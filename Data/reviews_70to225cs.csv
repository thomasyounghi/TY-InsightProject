71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2020-01-11,5.0,"Great aesthetics. A welcoming, relaxing place to sip coffee. The one and one really lets you taste the full flavor of the perfectly brewed Espresso. The espresso had a dark molasses flavor that was further awakened in the microfoam of the cortado. Our experience was so awesome, we got flat whites to take with us. I wish I could make coffee like this at home."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-10-02,5.0,Small aesthetic coffee shop with good coffee. I got a hot latte sweetened. They don't have flavored syrups. The coffee was surprisingly good and smooth. I would definitely recommend. There isn't much seating but it's nice and cozy.
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-08-12,4.0,"Everyman Espresso is a cute little coffee shop off Canal Street in Soho.  Located in an older building, the space has been renovated to look like a modern day cafe with hints of the original structure peeking through here and there.  There is not a lot of space in this shop, but if you don't have more than six or seven people in it no one should wind up in each other's way.

One of my favorite decor choices are a series of classic mugs lined up along several shelves near the door.  From what the baristas told me they are actually for sale and get replaced periodically (but I did not ask about prices).

I wound up having a Dirty Chai Latte with almond milk.  While not the best Chai I've ever had, it was definitely above average.  I could taste the spices and the espresso shot definitely had some kick.  It was a very satisfying drink.

Quick shout out to the staff who were really nice and quick with preparing my order.  Everyman Espresso isn't a place to spend hours on end on your laptop, but it is a great place to grab a quick caffeine fix to go."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-12-28,4.0,"Like most places in Manhattan, the coffee shop is quite cozy and delivers on its coffee! My husband enjoyed his Cappuccino while I really liked the Mocha made with Dick & Taylor's craft dark chocolate from Brazil. I appreciate how I wasn't charged extra for almond milk. 

I was surprised that the hot Mocha was served in a glass rather than a mug. When I pointed this out, the barista gave me smug smile. As other Yelpers have noted, the staff judges their patrons.  

I can never understand how the baristas craft such intricate designs on the drinks. The meticulous tiny heart designs were impressive and great way to start my day! 

The croissant wasn't very fresh and stale. My husband took a couple of bites and threw it away. I wish there were more fresh pastries and more comfortable seating. I sat down for a few minutes on a stiff stool and then got my coffee to go. There wasn't enough space to have a relaxing conversation. 

The coffee shop is designed to quickly go in and out rather than a hangout spot. If you need your caffeine fix, stop by for the Mocha!"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-06-15,4.0,"Stopped by to try their coffee and cappuccino. 
Coffee is subpar & not that strong. 
Cappuccino was amazing.

Love the vibes and decor."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-01-12,4.0,"Small coffee shop with attentive staff and yummy coffee! I stopped in here for a refuge from the freezing weather and a pick-me-up to keep me warm as I continue to explore SoHo. It was a fabulous choice. Feels like home and designed to keep you happy. HIGHLY recommend! 
Price point: $3.50 for cup of freshly brewed yummy coffee. WORTH IT!"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-08-08,5.0,Best coffee that I ever had in nyc :) Nice and friendly barista.  My coffee taste perfect the way I told them. Clean and well organized in small space.
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-09-16,4.0,Excellent coffee my husband had an American coffee and I had a decaf mocha. It was like Europe in Soho! The coffee was perfect! Not acidy or bitter just a deep deli fresh coffee taste ! It was pricey! And don't expect to sit and use the bathroom after drinking coffee. My bladder was full from the coffee and one of the only places the girl rudely said we have No bathroom! But I saw her friend go downstairs to use one.
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-10-15,1.0,"Typical pretentious cafeteria whose patronizing staff pretends to take coffee very seriously (but not really).
I dared asking the wifi password and the woman at the register gave me a stern look because I interrupted her iphone  activity (the password was incorrect, in case you wonder). A $4.75 burnt cortado and over all very bad vibes completed the awful experience."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-08-23,2.0,"I got a small almond milk latte here that was delicious and well made. And the young woman who took my order and poured my latte was really nice--excellent customer service. The problem is that it cost $6.25, which I find not to be very ""everyman"" in terms of price. They don't list their prices, either, so it took me a bit by surprise. I would definitely go back but just can't justify the cost"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-02-28,4.0,"This cozy TriBeCa cafe near the corner of West Broadway and Canal has all the right stuff. The staff is courteous, professional and friendly, the aesthetics very pleasing, it has good wifi, is not overcrowded, and the coffee is wonderful. The only downsides are that there's no restroom and it's a bit overpriced. I'd likely return."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-02-13,5.0,"I got to NYC for an eight-day business trip - and I'm so upset it took me until Day 5 to find Everyman Espresso. I live in the San Francisco area - and their lattes and espresso are as good as Blue Bottle or Sightglass in SF. They're using Counter Culture coffee, and their espresso tastes close to Blue Bottle - medium-dark and toasty but not overroasted.
It's a tiny shop, dominated by a huge Strada three-group espresso machine, and there's not a good spot for a line to form - which I think has led to a couple of the negative reviews here. The staff was friendly, but with a bit of that punk-rock, standoffish vibe, which goes along with the overall store atmosphere.
As an old recording engineer, I'm totally down with that. Plus, anyone that helps keep the blood level in my caffeine supply at the appropriate level starts in a positive spot with me."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-11-30,5.0,"Super friendly! DELICIOUS coffee, latte's and tea's. They have amazing breakfast bars. I normally buy two at a time Bc they sell out fast. It's also cute if you need to get out of the cold Bc the vibe is very chill and relaxing. Check them out! PS ask for the punch card when checking out so it adds up to a free beverage!"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-02-04,5.0,"Great coffee.
A completely different flavour.
Coffee 5/5
Cappuccino 5/5
Hot chocolate 5/5
Staff 10/5
Decor 5/5"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-11-03,3.0,"The servers have a friendly smile and attitude but at the same time you see them glancing at eachother judging their patrons. Pretty silly when their coffees could be judged pretty poor. The beans and roast are boring, and the strength blade."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-06-17,3.0,"My friend ordered an iced coffee, and it tasted so funny, and she thought maybe it was the almond milk. They kindly made another coffee for her, but in the end it was funny tasting coffee. They described it as ""very fruity"".blah, it tasted like fruity iced tea!"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-06-11,3.0,"My boss is a super fussy German CEO who asks me to do things like fetch three fresh Everything Bagels at 3pm on a Friday in Tribeca. So finding him an espresso that he enjoys is a terrifying task, especially when he won't drink dairy, almond or soy milk, yet insists on a cappuccino.

ENTER EVERYMAN ESPRESSO. Their coffee is great, they have a wide selection of milk replacements (including the very hot-right-now Oat Milk), and their servers are just snobby enough to make you believe you're really buying a great bean. (You'd hope so, too, with a cap going at $6.50 a pop.) 

Not a great place to catch up with friends, as there's only one mid-length table, but they do have WiFi (but no charging outlets), and they do offer a nice selection of pastries. They also don't have any restrooms, so freelancing here, even in the short term, isn't that feasible.

As for that trio of fresh bagels? The hunt still continues..."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2017-04-28,5.0,"It's rare these days to get such great service and have staff actually engage with you. I like going to Everyman because the coffee is not only delicious, Counter Culture is the brand, but the atmosphere is inviting and cozy. 
If you're a regular, there an added bonus of a frequent coffee card and they punch the card with a heart shaped hole puncher, (not necessary but a nice touch)!  I was working on a project and needed scissors and they were able to help me in a pinch which was random! 
Long story short, Everyman is a low key spot that's good for meeting up with a friend, conducting an interview, or stopping by for some great coffee from a local business as opposed to the usual corporate suspects. Go here!"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2015-12-03,5.0,"Very friendly atmosphere, great espresso drinks and a few tables (no bathrooms tho)! The space is small, but quaint. As soon as I walked in, the bearded barista smiled and welcomed me in. This small personal welcome was awesome, despite the store being busy. I immediately felt like I walked into a friend's house.

I ordered a cortado which was made (with a beautiful heart) almost as quickly as it was devoured. The coffee blend was nice and strong. Definitely a top-notch espresso drink.

I sat at the table for about ten minutes before leaving and enjoyed my stop into this great NYC-espresso shop. 

In summary: great friendly service, delicious coffee blend, small space (no bathrooms) and reasonable prices."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-11-02,4.0,"My husband really love their coffees and lattes, I only come here for their sparkling lemonade, not a coffee person. The lemonade is always perfect! Always refreshing to have on a hot day!"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-07-12,5.0,"Pretty good Red Eye ice coffee! The barista recommended based on my preference. A great coffee place for a quick break after walking thru soho.

Coffee is stronger than standard Starbucks cold brew. Def recommend giving it a shot!"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-06-30,1.0,$5.25 for an iced coffee! Unless the proceeds are going to charity this is just wrong. #EverymanEspresso #SOHO
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-07-12,1.0,worst iced lattee I ever had in my life. I dont know why this place has a 4 star yelp review. The vibe was very wierd inside the coffee shop as well
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-04-27,5.0,Really good coffee and pastries. The place is missing some tables and chairs but for the most part it's a great place to stop and have a coffee.

NY Manhattan SoHo
3pm Tuesday 10th November 2015
Four Stars

In small shop on W Broadway just north of Canal, Everyman Espresso is a warm and inviting place. The espresso machine is the focal point of the space. The multicolor tile back splash is interesting combination of crimson, burnt sienna, light grey, white, black, and grey blue (Pantone 304 C ish). They have four seating areas. A bench below each store front, a triangular shaped bench opposite to the service station and one triangle shaped table with three stools. Not too much seating but it was pretty uncrowded right now. 

I had a cortado ($4.5) which came in a Gibraltar glass with perfect amount of foamed milk. The espresso was nutty with an almost herbaceous quality. It was delightfully bitter with a smooth finish. 

Overall, a quiet place place to talk, work, and/or chill out."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2019-01-01,5.0,"Everyman Espresso had everything I wanted from a coffee shop. Clean interiors, nice people, lively atmosphere--not to mention their coffee and donuts. I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended if you want to enjoy a nice cup of coffee in a chill but lively setting."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-10-12,2.0,"I went in today in the mood for trying something new, I asked for recommendation for something special and basically my stand is I'd take anything you recommend to try as long as there's no lemon. then the staff gave me..... regular coffee. I am speachless."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-12-24,5.0,"Friendly staff. Attentive and willing to go out of way to be helpful. 
A great cup of Joe. 
Not that comfy but hey it's a coffee shop -"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-06-14,2.0,"decent coffee. Really sloppy service. For example. When an already served customer cuts the line to ask for one more thing, finish serving the current guy! Especially if the line cutter is initiating another sale. It's okay. The line cutting customer might be miffed for having to wait their turn like everyone else. But the other people in line won't feel like dumbasses for waiting in line.
I mean, am I getting it wrong? Should I just barge to the head of the line next time? Is alpha dog behavior encouraged and rewarded here? Woof! Bow wow! Give me my bulletproof coffee! Scorn upon these basics waiting in line!"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2015-01-30,5.0,"Delicious espresso. I ordered my usual- iced almond milk latte. It was rich, creamy, and flavorful without any added sugar.  They also offer typical pastries such as donuts, croissants, etc. A little pricey for a small drink, but the quality is amazing.

Very peaceful ambience. The baristas are knowledgeable and have a pleasant demeanor. There is limited seating so it's not so much a cafe- there is one communal table and a long ledge-type of arrangement where multiple people can take a quick seat.

 I will definitely be back for more of their caffeinated goodness!"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2016-08-23,4.0,"Another nice little artisan coffee shop. Any ordinary coffee selection should be great and the pastries seemed really nice. 

We got an ice latte. It was on the milky side. The flavor of coffee was not very strong. Still nice drink. 

They have some house specialty coffee on the menu. I felt adventurous and got the ""panacea"" ---- OMG!!!! ---- I almost vomit after a sip. It was a weird sour bitter taste. It contains lemon juice, ginger bitterness and expresso shot (maybe some other things). Actually it tastes like someone's vomit to me too... (Sorry Everyman! I don't mean to criticize it but that's what came to mind). I probably won't have it again but it is definitely a memorable coffee experience. It's so interesting that I actually would encourage everyone to try it out for once."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2017-05-30,5.0,"This might just be my new fav coffee spot! Came here this past weekend for a little coffee break. The service was friendly and attentive. They made really good selections and we were delighted with our coffee. We decided on the cool drip one that was the perfect size for sharing (can't remember the name though). Also split a lemon sprinkle cookie- wish I didn't have to split it because it was delicioussssss! Very small and quaint little coffee spot here on the edge of SoHo. Great for a pause from the hustle and bustle of the area. Not too much space for seats, but it was comfortable and very cozy. Will be back again!"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2016-07-29,4.0,"Great local coffee shop with the bulk of customers being local regulars. The cafe was very clean and the staff were extremely friendly. I enjoyed the drip coffee, but it's an extremely light roast (take Starbucks blonde as an example and lighten that by almost two-thirds).

There's a small bar style table if you want to sit with free wi-fi for a bit, but there's only 4 stools. Apart from that, there's a long bench in front of the bar and a windowsill seat."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-04-24,3.0,"Good coffee (& they have oat milk!), but the ""music"" playlist was quite alarming. Essentially screamo and/or spoken word dark thematic nasal punk rock vocals. I left feeling much angst. Sadly no outlet nor restroom- barista directed us to hotel across the st, to which we went, but were not able to access without a key"
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2017-04-10,4.0,"Delicious, creamy espresso and a clean and bright AeroPress. Served by friendly, knowledgeable staff. A bit of an awkward space, but the quality of the coffee more than makes up for it."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2018-03-08,5.0,"I've never lingered here with a laptop because the space is pretty small, although they do have seating and a communal table. Their drip coffee has citrus notes and they have oat milk for non-milk lattes! It's the perfect stop to pick up my coffee on the way to work."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2016-06-05,5.0,"Today we wandered around Soho and visited a few of my favorite stores (Purl Soho).  Anyway, as we made our way back to the car, I spotted a sign for a sexy cappuccino!! Coffee is always good for a drive to NJ (no negative comments please) so we stopped in.  

The barista was an absolute delight. I did order that sexy cappuccino btw and it was delicious. 

My husband ordered a perfect double espresso.  There was no where to sit so we sipped our beverages as we walked. 

The entire experience was just delightful. Definitely adding this place to my favorites list. 

Thanks for a tasty end to my day."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2017-06-03,5.0,"Quickly became my favorite coffee shop in NYC. Then I questioned that, tried every other great creative coffee place I could get to, changed my mind a few times and came back around. This is definitively the best coffee shop in NYC. 

Try as I might, I have never gotten my espresso as perfectly extracted as the baristas at EE do on the reg, all day. I've had cups of coffee here that have defined the possibilities of coffee for me. I did not know unadulterated coffee could have such fruity, blueberry or sweet lemon peel flavors before drinking it here. 

Cappuccino or espresso is my regular drink but I love that they have espresso cocktails. You should not miss trying an espresso old fashioned."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2016-01-23,3.0,"A cute little coffee shop in the Tribeca area, and one of very few options. I stopped by because I was about an hour early for dinner reservations, and needed a warm place to huddle with my book.

The first thing I noticed was the lack of a menu. What. I usually get the same no matter where I go (house coffee, either black or with a splash of milk), but I would have liked to see the options. I would have also liked to see the price of the different drinks.

I got coffee with milk to stay, and for a 6oz mug, it was $3. Whew. The barista offered refills, but I don't know if this was complementary or if it would cost me an additional buck or two. I didn't stay long enough to find out.

The acoustics of the place are not conducive to a quiet study or even reading session - if your reading requires some focus. There were two girls sitting across the room from me and I could pretty much hear their conversation as if I'd been sitting right next to them. Even the quiet chatter of the baristas seemed weirdly amplified. Maybe it's the wooden paneling...

Also, although there is a lot of bench seating along the walls, there is only one shared table in the back that fits 5-6 people. So keep this in mind if you are looking for a place to meet with friends. I enjoyed sitting in the window with my legs stretched out and my back against a column, but I was really only okay with the seating arrangement because I was flying solo. Otherwise, it would have been a tight squeeze."
71,everyman-espresso-new-york-2,2017-02-18,5.0,"By far my favorite coffee shop downtown. Great music playlist with an even better sense of customer service. Three great personalities in Leslie, Steven, and Sam. The coffee is great. A Cortado to go is my usual. Definitely check out Everyman Espresso. It's a vibe."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2020-03-04,5.0,"Laughing Man is Hugh Jackman's give back brand which is how I found out about it. I ordered an oat latte which was amazing both in the rich flavor of the coffee, prep, and latte art! Space is small (but expanding soon into a sit down) and I wish I knew more about the signature lattes which were kind of hidden on a different menu on the right, but all-in-all I would stop back and grab a cup again. 

*Also note this is a far-trade brand and eco-friendly. The designer in me loves the ridges in the cups and that it is still sturdy and less waste."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2020-02-09,5.0,"Really solid coffee, their specialty is the flat white. I also bought a bag of beans, they're Ethiopian and I can't wait to try them out! 

They have a small space, you could sit outside on a nice day. I was happy with my stop by, I would definitely come again if I'm in the area."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2020-01-02,4.0,"I had a lovely coconut latte while walking around the neighborhood. We paid around 11 usd for 2 medium lattes, service was fast and staff, polite.
My fiancée was keen to try this place and he wasn't dissapointed.
There is a small but nice looking selection of pastries, decent drinks selection on offer."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2020-06-06,2.0,"I got an iced honey lavender latte with almond milk, which was over $7, and when I tasted it there was no taste of lavender at all. I asked if they could add more lavender, which they did, but it didn't make a difference. It just tasted like a regular iced latte. I now make better ones at home. Pretty disappointed; would not come back."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-08-16,5.0,"Came in to try the honey lavender flat white. It was really delicious. 

The staff is really friendly and patient when you ask questions.

I like that they carry some refrigerated food items like over night oats, chai pudding and cold drinks like chocolate milk. 

Overall a great experience."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-12-18,5.0,"Delicious coffee, so so smoooooooth! Love the lattes, the honey lavender flavor, and the fact they will happily accommodate when I bring my own cup.

This is the definition of a hole in the wall, although there is a larger space in the works next door which is quite big from a passing peak I got--exciting! It's lovely on a nice day, where there is public seating and a stoop that everyone tends to hang out on. On colder days, it's grab n go and can get crowded.

There is always a line, although it moves fairly quickly. The coffee has always been good, except for ONCE where it was terrible (burnt?); that was definitely unlike them though. 

Don't know much about the foundation they support, but I'm all about charitable causes and hope they are are benefitting those in need."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-12-07,4.0,"The space is very small so don't expect to sit in here and laptop warrior this place up. This is a place where you grab the coffee of your choice to go and that's perfectly fine.

The service is friendly and efficient. We ordered two vanilla lattes and after a short wait they arrived. The coffee here is good and out of the 6 or so coffee shops I tried on my trip to NYC this was one of the better ones.

I really like the theme of their store though and that's what will make me return when I come back to NYC. Before you come here, take a look at their site, there's some great stuff on there."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-10-08,2.0,"Drink : 3/5 Price: 2/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Bang for your buck: 2/5 

I was really excited to go here because of the mission but was disappointed with my experience. First of all, the shop is tiny with no sitting inside. People crowd around the counter waiting for their drink. There should be a better system. However, this was a small flaw, since there is ample sitting room outside.  

The true disappointment was the tea latte. I'm currently on a coffee cleanse so I decided to get tea. Since this was a tea place, I was excited. Mind you, I only get iced drinks (even in winter). 

The tea latte was made by the person who took my order. He got a cup with ice and poured in white tea (white or green, your choice) and immediately poured cold milk. This drink cost $5+. 

The coffee is probably better than the tea. But if a place is going to call themselves a coffee and tea place, I expect better."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2020-01-17,5.0,"Amazing coffee - got an oatmilk latte and it was wonderfully creamy with great depth. Their espresso is truly top notch stuff. Unfortunately they don't have any indoor seating (YET - they're renovating and expanding this location according to the posters outside) so it's only grab-and-go but on warm days, you can sit on the benches outside. All in all, a great way to kickstart and brighten any morning."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-06-30,4.0,"Laughing Man has been on my list for a while now. There was a line out the door at around 9 AM on a Sunday (the place is tiny, but there are spots to sit outdoors) with many dogs and babies on site. I had an iced coffee and chocolate chip banana muffin from Ceci Cela. Everything was solid overall but above all, I think this place mostly benefits from being one of the only coffee shops in the area."

72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-12-30,3.0,"Definitely a hole in the wall but it's a bright spot with it light interior. My almond milk flat white was ok.  Nothing special to write home about.  The milk was not fully involved as it should be. There is no way to heat up the chocolate croissants. It was a cold rainy day outside so I was somewhat disappointed. I really want to like this place but customer service was luke warm. On a positive note Hughs house blend whole beans made it home safely to my burr grinder and my pour over was excellent.  A full body city roast with a smooth finish .  Not citrusy which I appreciate! Hughs brews a
Great choice!"
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-05-06,5.0,"This location is SUPER tiny! I felt bad for the 4 employees they squeezed in there BUT I must say the coffee is VERY tasty. I believe I got the Honey Lavender coffee, it was beautiful."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-05-03,5.0,"Amazing coffee! 
Outdoor seating, cute little spot. 
Nondairy alternatives and friendly staff. 
Will be back"
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-06-02,5.0,"We came in early on a Sunday! You walk in and are greeted ASAP. So so friendly. 
Just ordered some coffees. And the coffee is very very good and very very smoooth. 
Also ordered a brown butter carrot muffin. That was also delicious with dried fruit and carrots in it. 
Would definitely come back and try something else. Iced cappuccino or even a different baked good.highly recommend."
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2020-02-28,5.0,Great coffee we actually had burritos which were very good I never drink two coffees I actually had to have to because their coffee was actually really strong just the way I like it highly recommend
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2018-08-14,5.0,"Not only are you buying delicious coffee, you're supporting the Laughing Man Foundation every time you make a purchase. I was extremely excited to be able to come to NYC and make a purchase in support of Hugh Jackman's amazing work. I highly encourage everyone to read up on the amazing things that Laughing Man is doing. Hugh Jackman is making the world a better place on the big screen and around the world. 

The coffee shop is very small, but they've utilized the space very well. You'll notice that their pastries are stored tightly along the wall. Other item are fancily package and in their little coolers below. It's pretty cool. My Cold Brew and Almond Croissant were both delicious. The Cold Brew is strong, which any coffee drinker will appreciate. Smooth too. I'm not sure where the pastries come from, but they were delicious and fresh. 

It's a grab and go type of coffee shop (express, if you want to call it that). They also have seating outside, which is great for a nice day. In cold weather, I doubt anyone wants to be sitting out there. Check out my photo. It was particularly nice on this day. 

I'll be making multiple visits while in NYC. Still have to check out their Lavender Latte or the Flat White. Did someone say smooth? I'm there!!!"
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-09-01,4.0,"I'm always a fan of Laughing Man Coffee and this shop is no exception. It's pretty small catering to people who want it on the go. There's no seating inside, but there are a few benches just outside. Since they serve a working crowd mainly, they are very efficient. As you wait in line, they'll ask you your order so it's ready before you get up to the register."

Got the oat milk lavender latte for a great start to a cold NY morning in February. Great deserts and goodies too! Check them out and support the laughing man foundation!"
72,laughing-man-coffee-and-tea-new-york-3,2019-01-02,5.0,"I have not ever reviewed this place? Not possible.
I stay around the corner when in NYC. Going to morning coffee here is the beginning and often the highlight of the day in NYC. They are
Crowded but the line moves FAST! Staff is sweet.  I've bought their coffee by the pound too because it is so good."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-12-05,5.0,"This place has fairly limited seating but we managed to find a seat on one of the conveniently places benches against a wall of the room. The place has an Aussie theme, which was pretty unique in itself.

The coffee here was some of the best I tried on my trip to NYC. I ordered a maple latte and it was great. The consistency was on point and the flavour was excellent too. The staff were also very efficient and friendly."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2020-02-16,3.0,"As others are raving on Yelp, a very cozy place on lower eastside. 

It only has limited seating - 2 round tables. We had to share the table with two other customers. Everyone in the cafe will be able to hear your conversation. 

The cappuccino was quite good, the strong espresso with the right amount of foam just the way I like it.

Don't forget to check-in with Yelp and get 20% off !!!!!!!

We were there on weekday evening, and Saltwater closes pretty early around 7 pm."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2020-01-23,4.0,"It's such a small cafe, so you'll be lucky to find a seat here! Sharing tables with other people is normal, as there's only really 2 tables and a barstool area that can uncomfortably fit 3 people. There's also a bench for about 2-3 other people to sit at, although it doesn't have a pairing table. However, once you find a seat, you're good. They have a couple outlets so people can study here, free water, and wonderful staff members. 

I ended up getting the caramel donut and it was huge! I guess I see why it costs $5. It's very sweet and highly coated in sugar. The inside oozes rich salted caramel. Definitely pairs well with some water to neutralize it. 

In essence, if you can find a seat here, you'll be sitting in the ideal cafe."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-12-27,4.0,Nice little gem on the side of the road.  The latte was rich and service was quick.  Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get a special offer.  I come here all the time because the chains on the ave are always crowded.
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2020-01-09,5.0,"Everything about this place is amazing! The workers, the coffee, the service and the shop is extremely cute! The wall decors are extremely suitable and cute. They have so many drinks to offer and have pastries as well! Would recommend to anyone around the area! I'm totally coming back for more and to try the drinks again. Turmeric was never a go to but I fell in love with it after one taste and you will too!"
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2020-04-11,4.0,"Your typical trendy NYC coffee shop! Beautiful cute n cozy interior, though extremely small (2 tables plus window bar seating), so don't count on this being a sit-down chat/study spot by any means. Average prices for NYC. Unique coffee array, including turmeric, matcha, and maple lattes and their signature insta-famous chai charcoal latte. I've had the charcoal latte, but it's nothing too special aside from the optics of course. I've since stuck with their regular iced lattes. Overall aesthetics of the interior, exterior, signage, and decor is on-point."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-12-11,4.0,"Had a vanilla chai latte (they also have a masala option) and it was great! Light and foamy, not too sweet. My boyfriend enjoyed his cappuccino. Interior is very bright (a little jarring when I walked in but we adjusted) and tiny but cozy."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-04-14,5.0,"Really tiny coffee place, as are most places in Manhattan. Let me count...there are about only 15 seats available including the bench outside. It was packed but we waited for some seats to open up.

Here is what we ordered:
- Latte
- Matcha Latte
- Mocha Latte
- Iced Masala Chai Latte

The lattes were nice and frothy and each sip, smooth. Love the coffee taste without it being too bitter. I especially love the Matcha latte which was full of green tea flavor. 

Unfortunately, I check-in to Yelp after we ordered the lattes, I missed out on the 20% off discount. Don't get me started...

Service is super friendly and we didn't have to wait long for our lattes. Restroom is not available. After drinking that huge cup of latte, I told my husband to step on it."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-09-12,5.0,"Why did it take me so long to try this place?! Saltwater has really awesome coffee. I've had the flat white and ice latte, and both were outstanding. Very nice balance of milk and espresso. The prices are also rather reasonable for New York, especially with the check-in and rewards program. The space is small and wifi can be pretty spotty, but the exceptional coffee and friendly service are more than enough to make this a new favorite in the neighborhood!"
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-05-29,4.0,"I haven't had a good flat white in a while...until I stumbled upon this place. 4 stars for that alone. 

-1 star for lack of seating here."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-04-21,2.0,"""Am I on Mars?""

Cue the David Bowie song...I must have gone on the wrong day or something but this place wasn't anywhere near

You might like this place if....
- you like employees arguing in front of
-  a disorganized hot mess
- pretentious customers who have to understand if the beans were grown in a humane way and who take 10 mins to order a cup of coffee
- way too many choices on a coffee shop drink menu 

If not....
I'd suggest walking a block more to Boris and Horton where the dogs are much better"
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-10-07,2.0,"Blech, ordered a cold brew on a warm afternoon & it tasted as though it had been sitting around all day.  Not going here again."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2020-02-19,5.0,Perfect. High quality and dedication to the craft of espresso and fine coffee in all it's forms. Fantastic and well curated selection of superb baked goods. Well done Saltwater.
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-10-26,5.0,"Absolutely in love with the simple atmosphere of this cafe. The space is small, but is super bright and calm inside with its white interior and the streams of natural light that come in through the front window. 

They have an awesome selection of pastries on display near the register. Their menu isn't extensive, but has all the basics and then some fun drinks, too. 

I love getting the mocha with almond milk. But if you aren't feeling coffee, then definitely try the golden latte!"
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-01-02,2.0,"I wasn't very impressed with saltwater cafe. With the great reviews and heavy following I was expecting more. I ordered the matcha latte and looked at the very few, sad looking pastries in the case but decided against one. Maybe it's just the timing but there were only one muffin, two pastries and one oat bar available and none of them looked appetizing. 

My matcha was sub-par. Upon first sip I couldn't place it, but as I kept drinking, I realized it was almost half water when I ordered mine with oat milk (up charge - which I'm fine with paying if I get the oat milk... not water). The aesthetics and instagram prescience are there but not the taste or the variety of food options."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-08-20,4.0,"Great little hole in the wall coffee shop. They don't have a huge interior, so it might not be a great date spot, but I could see this being a good spot to come and get some work done, or read for like an hour. The inside is bright and clean, and the drinks are SMOOTH. They also have oat milk, which as a person who tries to avoid dairy, I really appreciate. They have punch cards as well, which is great because I will definitely be back."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2018-06-30,4.0,"After seeing pictures of colorful lattes on Instagram, I knew that I just had to visit Saltwater Coffee.

The cafe itself is pretty small but is beautiful decorated and very clean. It also has wifi if you want to do work there. We ordered a matcha and a charcoal vanilla chai, but were told that they were out of charcoal, though the latte would still be vanilla chai flavored. I was a bit disappointed but the drink was delicious and a must try! On the other hand the matcha didn't have too much flavor in my opinion, and could have used more powder.

All in all a good experience and I'll be back to try the other drinks on their menu!"
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-11-17,4.0,"The maple latte was yummy. Small cramped place with few tables & chairs, try not to knock down the shelves filled with breakables as you wait for your order as there isn't much room to stand. Felt awkward the entire wait time."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2020-01-25,5.0,"Coffee was great, the barista was friendly and helpful, and the prices a quite low considering the competition. The only caution I have is that the place is truly tiny with only a few seats and I have never seen such a dedicated crew of campers. I arrived in the mid afternoon on a weekday, got my cortado, and snagged a spot on a bench, otherwise the place was full. In the two hours I was there, only one person left and only one person ordered anything. They have a devoted following clearly, and well deserved, but don't expect to find a seat."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-06-14,4.0,"Cute tiny coffee shop with friendly baristas. I came with a group of friends to study and it was the perfect atmosphere. I checked in on Yelp and received a 20% discount. On top of that, since they were out of the cold brew, they gave me the iced coffee for less. They also gave me oat milk to add as much of as I wanted, which was nice. The coffee itself tasted delicious. I would definitely come back to this spot and try more of their drinks!"
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-01-07,4.0,"Super cute, really tiny place! I love how everything was decorated and my vanilla chai latte was great. Was very disappointed to find out that a lot of the drinks shown in pictures were seasonal and no longer available though."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-07-19,5.0,"Fantastic place to get coffee and catch up with a friend.  Loved this place bc of the Yelp discount they have - so Nice.  

Be wary tho - limited seating so take the coffee to Tompkins or get here early!"
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2018-03-17,5.0,"Super cute coffee/tea shop with a great selection of lattes in my liking such as turmeric, matcha, masala chai, CHARCOAL vanilla chai, hot chocolate (real cocoa), and BABYCHINO (for the kids!).

Lots of cute decor that I would want in my own home. The lighting is excellent - both natural and fixture. 

Good place to sit to work or read or have a quiet conversation with a friend. Only seats about 10 people and there is a bench outside. Music choice is upbeat and interesting. 

Service is friendly :)"
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2018-11-11,4.0,"Iced coffee was excellent and I really liked the apricot pastry that I got. My friend enjoyed her latte as well. The aesthetic is cool, too, but you already know that if you've looked at the pictures from here."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-07-29,4.0,"A cute little coffee shop in the East Village. Baristas were nice, the noise level is ideal for working (a little chatter and music), and the sunlight and aesthetic of the place are great for study break selfies, though seating is limited. I got an iced latte with oat milk. Espresso was pretty good (strong & slightly nutty), but the aftertaste was a bit bitter. For those that care, they use Califia oat milk. Latte price was surprising low by NYC standards ($4), but note that ice is 50 cents and milk alternatives are 75 cents. With the 20% off coupon for first check ins though, I couldn't help but splurge."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2020-01-19,4.0,"Cute coffee shop. Staff is super nice and had a warm atmosphere. Kind of gives you some southern hospitality which I was shocked receiving  considering I lived I in Richmond, VA where people were extremely nice. Chai was great 8/10. Dolcezza in DC has the best chai hence why I took a star off. Anyways- worth getting your coffee and reading the newspaper here to get your morning started in East Village"
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2018-01-30,4.0,"I've been watching this coffee shop since they opened, and I'm glad to see they are thriving in East Village - home of the independent coffee shops! 

They have a unique menu with Australian styled coffee (flat whites, long blacks, etc.), as well as tumeric lattes and the like. I went with the flat white because I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous on the day that I visited, but I'd like to come back and try either the charcoal or the tumeric latte! They sell Tim Tams as well, at a hefty price of $8/box (they're $5-6 in Australia), but I guess it's worth it if you are craving them and aren't due for a trip to Australia anytime soon!

The barista at the time I visited was very friendly and so quick. I like the minimal - yet thoughtful - decor of the store. The store is small though, and without a restroom, so I'd recommend coming here to grab and go versus hanging around to study or chat.

EDIT: Don't forget to use your check-in deal!! It's 20% off your order by checking-in. If you are a student, I believe you get a discount with your student ID as well."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2018-10-19,5.0,"Saltwater is a small cafe but super cute and cozy! The baristas here are very nice and friendly! Love the fresh flowers and plants as decors. Super instagram worthy, especially their lattes! I ordered a matcha latte and I really liked it, wasn't too bitter. I came here to get some work done, which I did. The music wasn't too loud everything was good. A lot of people were also getting some work done. Definitely would come back to try out their other drinks."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2018-11-25,4.0,"Yummy latte and donut!
***
Locals 
Small but delicious coffee shop! Amazing donuts as well!
***
Travelers 
They have a CHARCOAL chai latte! Also a very aesthetically pleasing cafe. It is very small and has very limited seating, so this is great for on the go or for a quick bite!
***
My Recommendation 
I made the mistake of not asking for the CHARCOAL chai latte instead of the chai latte. The donut is also really good!

73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-04-09,4.0,A bit pricey but the cold brew was very smooth and tasty. There's also not a lot of seating but love the interior
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-03-28,5.0,"Upon hearing rave reviews about this place from a friend who is a fellow coffee lover I decided to take the $20 Uber go try it out. Amazing Latte and great place to set up the computer and get some work done. Ended up staying for 3 hours, getting a couple of drinks and buying beans to take with me back to LA."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-04-21,4.0,Excellent espresso drinks! If definitely be a regular if I worked close by. Would also love to try their specialty lattes.
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2018-02-28,5.0,"This is an Australian-style coffee shop with a pretty decent size menu. They have chai on their menu which is a plus if you don't drink coffee. I got the Charcoal Vanilla Chai with oat milk and it was like a little taste of heaven in my mouth.

The space itself is pretty tiny and seating is limited, but it's a great spot for a grab-and-go type of situation in the morning. The staff here is very friendly, so that's always a plus. I'll definitely be back. Highly recommend."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2017-11-10,4.0,"Saltwater is a cute-as-a-button coffee shop in the northern East Village. It's Australian, which everyone in this city takes to mean ""actually knows things about coffee,"" and which fortunately seems to be the case. They have offerings like flat whites, turmeric lattes, and matcha in addition to the usual espresso drinks, as well as cute touches like Vegemite and other Antipodean products on the wall.

I went for a shot of espresso, always my test for a new coffee shop. They only pour doubles, and it came out pretty fast. I took it to go since I was running errands; there's not much seating in any case. No bathroom.

My espresso didn't knock my socks off like Blue Bottle's or La Colombe's does, but it was high quality. Given all of the other rave reviews, I will be back for a fancy drink and to give them their final star."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-04-18,5.0,"Always on the hunt for a good chai, so hearing that this place had a charcoal chai latte, I was immediately interested. Unfortunately, they no longer do the chai lattes with charcoal, only masala (not sure why?). Still decided to get the masala and even for a higher price tag, it was one of the best chai lattes I've ever had! Smooth, right amount of sweetness, and served in a big mug with a cute little metallic gold spoon on the side. Definitely want to come back and remember to get my 20% off from Yelp this time!"
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-10-06,1.0,"I cannot be the only person that got sick from this place. I came here one morning because of its proximity to my work, and I really needed a caffeine kick before a very important meeting. I got a latte with almond milk. A few minutes after drinking it, my stomach started to gurgle and bubble in that way that you know you're about to have a bad time. Fast forward to a few moments later, I had to keep leaving my meeting every few minutes to have the worst diarrhea I've had in years. :( 

I had not eaten anything beforehand, and my symptoms began a few minutes after I finished my drink, so I know this was the culprit. And believe me, I am not someone who gets diarrhea from strong coffee, I have been drinking coffee my whole life and I have never had stomach problems from strong coffee whatsoever. 

This just goes to show that you can get sick from drinks too, not just from food. Coffee shops can use expired almond milk, they can have bacterial contamination, they can fail at proper sanitation, etc. All of the same things that can make you sick from food can be applied to drinks as well. 

It doesn't matter how trendy and instagrammable you look if you make your customers sick. I paid that much for a latte wanting to treat myself to something nice. I am so disappointed."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-03-17,5.0,"Ooohhh the maple latte was the best! BUT I have to warn you this will scratch any itch you have for pancakes or waffles, so if that's your go to breakfast item just brace yourself for a maple morning. BUT if you fashion yourself after Elf and believe in the three food groups, this is your stop.


The space is a little snuggly, but I appreciated how quickly I got my latte. The service was friendly and prompt. 

I would totally explore the menu more and try their other combinations for coffee because I bet they would be delicious too."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-02-03,4.0,"Lattes are solid. Maple syrup costs a whole extra dollar though. No other complaints aside from the fact that the seating is very limited and shuffling through the line can be awkward given it only accommodates one-way passage. 

I'm sure the rest of the coffee is similarly great tho, so it's definitely worth checking out."
73,saltwater-coffee-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,"The maple latte with oat milk is unbeatable!! So yummy. Small space, not a ton of seating. Best if taken to go! I like to grab one and get a bagel from Tompkins bagels :)"

I adore the vibe -- open, high ceilings, industrial chic greys and browns, a lot of light, and strong a$$ wifi. 

The coffee is reliably good and the staff is cool, accommodating and kind. Shout out to them effortlessly re-doing orders if there has been a mistake.

My two improvements would be to add better pastries and snacks since they fall flat compared to the great coffee, and add a few more seats since those can be hard to come by. 

Otherwise, I love this place."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-11-15,5.0,"Really cute location. There's limited window seating - but the music is good and so are the baristas. I like the overall vibe for a quick grab and go coffee with the amazing Stumptown brewery. 

I got the drip coffee. The barista said their chai is a mix ? I normally make my chai the old fashioned way."

I got a flat white with whole milk, definitely pricey for a small cup which was $5. Also, they had croissants from supermoon bakehouse , this wasn't great for $5. I got the almond croissant that tasted like the plain one."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-11-03,3.0,This would be a 4 star review if based on the chai latte and blueberry crunch donut but I had to go with 3 because the staff was just so unfriendly and unhappy and  really put a downer on our visit.  The chai latte was exploding with spice and you can tell it was homemade.  The donut was also delicious but the staff was clearly unhappy to be there.  Not sure we would return considering the countless number of coffee shops in NYC.
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-08-12,4.0,"Who cares if Stumptown is a "" chain, "" it's a great one. Although noisy, the space was lovely and located in a great, convenient location. We ordered two lattes and were lucky enough to sit at one of the few small tables. Coffee was great, as were the staff who made our drinks. Major plus-- it has a bathroom! Seems like none of the coffee shops in NYC have public restrooms. I wouldn't hesitate to go back if we were passing by while in NYC again."

They have a wide variety of milk options (wheat milk?) for people who have all allergies and preferences. The high ceiling and industrial look give this place a unique flavor that has me coming back."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-07-16,5.0,"What a cute place. The Greenwich Village location use to be a bookstore in the 60s and they still have the old shelving behind the counter. It has an old feel. The staff is very helpful and friendly. They have places to sit outside, and inside. If you need milk alternatives, they have almond, soy and oat milk. The coffee is fair trade, and they get the coffee right from the farmers that grow it. Great environment. Great coffee. Great place to relax or enjoy the company of a friend. I had an oat milk latte. It was delish!!!"
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-04-27,2.0,"I love the coffee, the lattes, and the enormous pastries here, but the insufficient seating and weak customer service always make me dread coming! It's always so packed that waiting for a chair takes me thirty minutes, and even when one opens up, you have to fight others. I normally wouldn't hold it against the establishment, but Stumptown has left tables without chairs, so there's literally a shortage of seating, and when you ask them for the missing chairs, they pay you no mind. I've even had them fault me for bringing attention to the missing chairs, which makes no sense. 

Moving past this, I've consistently felt the service be super impatient and unfriendly towards my friends and me when ordering, especially when I can't decide what to order and I have questions for them. It's disappointing, because their coffee is some of my favorite in all of downtown.

One final thing is that they charge over $3.50 for a tea! And they're not even fancy teas, just black or green flavors. Idunno, I think it's a bit much."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-07-11,5.0,"I love this location! So nice inside, friendly baristas, and great neighborhood locals getting work done inside. The bathroom was clean as well, and I appreciated the filtered water on the counter with the milk/sugar.
Sat in there for a good 2-3 hours doing work and met some nice people. There aren't too many seats, but enough. My cold brew was a solid 4/5. Didn't try any of their food/pastry options, but a ton of people did and they all seemed to enjoy it. I'd definitely come back!"

The place can easily be passed by on the putside but luckily we went in.  My dad ordered a cup of Joe, two croissants that we both were drooling over in the display case and a Chai tea for myself.  Our drinks were prepared at the bar while our crossants were heated and plated.  There was seating indoors but even more seating in the backyard area.  We got a corner in the shade, pulled up a table and chatted the time away.  It was like being in our own backyard that's how comfortable the area scenery was.  

Everyone else seated back there were able to completely zone the other out.  The staff was friendly, the cashier was super helpful with the menu and what's available since it was our first visit.  The barista, he was personable and all smiles.  I'll definitely be back!"

We were just walking by on our way back to where I was staying. It was calling my name, and I couldn't resist. I didn't want to resist :-)

It's located very close to Washington Square Park and NYU. I have a feeling most people stumble across this location while walking to their destinations. Lots of seating inside, and it doesn't look like a location where there are a whole lot of students hanging out. Restrooms available too."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2020-03-02,4.0,"The place is tiny and always crowded. Yet, it gives the nice vibe that I really like. The store has a big full window where you can people-watching while sipping on the coffee. Their latte is also quite good."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-09-29,4.0,Just tried their regular coffee after hearing they had the best coffee. Its not too bitter but with a little more acidity than I like. It's pretty good coffee though. Love the casual vibe and the strong scent of wood as you walk in.

The coffee was smooth and loved the fact that they have flavored shots .75 cents either vanilla or Cocoa. The chocolate croissant was okay flaky and crisp with a nice hint chocolate.

The area was clean and reminded me of a collegiate library, made sense since we were near The New School and Parsons. Not that many tables to just sit and enjoy coffee while everyone (students) using their laptops owned all the table space. They do have a cute outside seating area tho. 

Loved the decor nice staff and coffee only thing is not enough seating inside."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-07-16,3.0,"It was my 2nd attempt to sit with a coffee and pastry but once again, no seats available. I got a cold brew and almond croissant. Both were tasty. 

I ended up taking my goods and found a lovely shaded bench in Washington Square Park where I ate my croissant out of a brown paper bag like a savage. 

I will try again to find a time when coveted seats are available. I will not be updating my review with that information because it will be locked in my brain. 

Enjoy!"

Located conveniently near NYU and Washington Square Park, this location definitely offers a wide variety of not just coffee products but food and other types of beverages as well! Since I was meeting a friend for coffee (on a particularly HOT day) I just stuck with a small cold brew ($3.50). The coffee wasn't anything extraordinary but the service and the friendliness of the staff is definitely something to be commented on! The barista who served me was extremely knowledgeable and welcoming. Much more so than the detached service you get at most coffee shops.

The interior of this cafe is also notable. Wooden paneling and fixtures give off a type of aristocratic feel to the space. Tall open windows near the entrance also allow for a lot of natural light to flow in. Definitely an ideal spot to grab coffee with a friend on any given day with nice weather.

This spot definitely hits the marks on almost all things you'd want in a great cafe near Washington Square Park. However, the only grip I have with the space is the limited seating! Fingers crossed that one day they add more tables, but until then you may have to wait a few minutes if you're looking to sit down and enjoy your beverage when visiting."

Barista was fast but not super friendly.  Meh, nothing good or bad, just meh.

I might come back and have a latte.  

Bad baked goods selection.  Not much to chose from and I selected a brownie that was awful.  Weird texture.  I'd have returned it, but I was already a couple blocks down 8th street.  :("
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-06-18,1.0,"An unfriendly place with poor attitude.
This was my first time at Stumptown, I had heard from a Barista friend that they made pretty good coffee so I thought I'd try. I also needed to purchase some beans, so I selected a pound at $18 a pound. I got to the register and asked if these beans were a pretty good choice( there were 11 kinds to choose from) The answer was this real sullen dismissive yes. No eye contact, no answer about well this is from Ethiopia... or do you like such and such. In short I found the help here to be nasty, ageist and sexist. 
When I got to the business was going I which was across the street I asked do you like the coffee from Stumptown across the street? They answered it's ok but the people who work there have attitude.
Poor attitude sums it up. So many coffee places and a cool indie one, Lena is across the street with really nice people."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2018-11-01,5.0,"Loved the atmosphere of this coffee shop - spent a very productive 4 hours doing my work with a cup of amazing coffee. I got the latte with oat milk (amazing non-dairy option that's as creamy as regular milk), and the coffee tasted rich and great without the bitter aftertaste. 

The inside feels very cozy and even Harry Potter-y (subjective, I know) - overall, definitely going back many many times!"
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-08-10,1.0,"The barista that served us was extremely rude and made fun of us as customers as we were waiting for our order. She seemed frustrated that we asked for something specific that was not on their admittedly limited selection of coffees, and openly spoke about how ridiculous she thought our order was with her co-workers while we and others at the café could clearly hear her.

If there's a problem with a custom order, or confusion on what the customer wants, it should be standard if not generally expected to just ask a question to the customer rather than make fun of them in front of everyone at the rather small café.

It seems clear to me that the privileged and ""hipster"" culture of this café and their baristas probably makes them feel entitled to treat those who do not fit in their bubble this way. I wonder if they ever think how that makes themselves any different from hateful racists and bigots that I'm sure they openly acknowledge to be 
against as New Yorkers. I'm simply baffled as to how an establishment that clearly wants to have a good reputation would lack something as simple as decent respect for the customer."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2018-03-13,4.0,"There were some great things I liked about this place. One, I liked the Almond Milk Latte & Almond Croissant I ordered. Not happy that they didn't have an oven to warm up my croissant but it was tasty all the same. Drinking a latte at a roasting company is amazingly tastier than from an ordinary coffee shop. The latte I ordered was so sweet with no added sugar and smooth. I was very impressed. 
The meters in the area are the worst. $3.50 an hour, ridiculous. But it is NYC so it is something to expect but still, WOW."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-03-31,4.0,"I was looking forward to have coffee from Stumptown for a long time, since they are well known in New York. I think my expectations were too high.

I came here on Thursday morning around 9am-ish. Can you believe nobody was in line in front of me? Wow. All the seats were taken except a seat at the bigger table in the back. After I sat down, the place got really busy and the line was out the door.  While placing my order, I asked the barista if they offer any vegan pastries. I couldn't see any labeled as vegan in the case, so I thought I would still ask. They had a banana bread and a chocolate chip cookie that were vegan. Banana bread was my choice. 

To be honest, I was disappointed with the banana bread. Probably the worst banana bread I have ever had. Too hard, falling apart, lacking flavors. The oat matcha was great. 

Overall, I had a good experience. The baristas weren't super friendly- but hey, they probably serve hundreds of people an hour. They all knew what they were doing and nobody was just standing around. Clean, spacious bathroom. And they also have dedicated room to training in the back!
My total was $14 for Oat Milk Matcha and vegan banana bread, plus tip."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-10-24,2.0,"This place is the most pretentious coffee place I've been to in a while. While the interior is pleasant, it's riddled with people who sweat an uneasy essence of superiority and superficiality. On top of all that nonsense, the coffee is literally a 6/10. Also, their mochas taste like chocolate milk.. which could be a good thing if you don't like coffee. I've made too many attempts to make this my go-to place and every time I left feeling thankful to breathe fresh air. They do have nice travel mugs tho!"
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2020-01-06,4.0,I tried skim latte. It was good but the coffee scent was not adequately strong for me.
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2017-10-05,5.0,"Passed a pleasant few hours studying here. It's an extremely busy location, with a mix of NYU kids, fashionable Asian tourists, and Greenwich residents. Snagging a table is a challenge. And small tables they are-- two people cannot fit two laptops on one comfortably.

The decor is very nice, and the music is at a reasonable volume. On this particular Saturday afternoon, they played Weezer's blue album in, I think, entirety. The bathroom is not too bad. Water is easily accessible.

As for drinks, I had a nitro chai for ~$5ish. It was basically a chai soda, with the perfect amount of sweeetness. A nice bump of caffeine for my afternoon.

I'm surprised that Stumptown hasn't yet conquered New York, but I for one welcome our new caffeine overlords."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2018-08-21,5.0,"This place is usually beyond packed, but I finally got to visit during a weekday morning and was able to grab a seat. Coffee ranks as one of my favorites in NYC, and the pastries are excellent - don't miss the Ovenly peanut butter cookies or sticky buns from Roberta's. Also had a decent almond croissant and really excellent scone. I like the environment here more than the Ace Hotel location, too!"
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2017-10-24,5.0,"Really liking this Stumptown location. The lattes that I've gotten have been smooth, rich, & full bodied. I haven't had a latte as comparable since I started drinking espresso at Abraço a decade ago in the E.V. Glad to have found another place with just as high quality and delicious latte. 

Not only are the lattes good, the decor and ambience are cool. Love the books, exposed brick, and wood shelves & counters. Really cool place to chill and enjoy your drink. 

The employees have been very friendly, both cashier and barista. 

I also enjoy their outdoor tables when the weather is nice out.

Funny, I've had Stumptown when they first opened in the Ace Hotel but my drink wasn't remarkable. But glad I gave this location a try."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2018-09-23,3.0,"This coffee shop has a great 1920s/ mid century modern vibe. Well decorated and has outdoor seating. Inside seating, for how large the space is, is somewhat limited. 

Coffee seemed pricey for how acidic it was (maybe a personal preference) but I rarely add sweetener to my coffee but did to my cold brew."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-12-01,1.0,Had some espresso and hot chocolate at this location recently. The espresso was bitter and burnt. The hot chocolate was milky rather than chocolate. Overall a bad experience. The baristas were nice though.
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-02-24,4.0,"Cute little place to stop in for coffee. I love their coffee! I always order the hot vanilla latte, its delicious. Next time I will try the iced."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2018-08-17,4.0,"Ahh Stumptown. It's nice to know that Stumptown is delicious wherever I go, especially when it's an actual storefront making fresh drinks rather than my usual ""out of a carton"" experiences with Stumptown."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-06-15,5.0,We order and purchase Stumptown beans to brew at home so it was a must-stop spot for us. Yummiest iced oat milk latte I've had in awhile!
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2017-06-11,5.0,"An increased presence for Stumptown and its delicious Americano is never a bad thing. While the original location holds a lot of its reverence, the Greenwich location is an awfully impressive coffee bar. Where was this when I was matriculated at NYU?

The location can probably use a few extra chairs and small tables for parties that want to sit and sip but aren't looking to use Stumptown as a study space. The classic drinks are as great as they always are for coffee lovers, but they have the one thing Blue Bottle doesn't - nitro coffee on draft! The smooth and silkiness of nitro or draft coffee is still a novelty all coffee drinkers need to experience. Just don't do it and take up all the seats when I'm here."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2018-05-23,4.0,"What a wonderful place to study! That's only if you get a spot... The outside seats are the best especially during the warmer seasons! They also have wifi without a password. The place is small with maybe around ~20 people max and also a bit chilly inside. 

Macchiato Latte w/ Almond Milk ($4.75)-4/5 Almond milk was $0.75, and it tasted pretty good. Not my favorite, but definitely better than Starbucks."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2019-07-20,5.0,"Popular coffee spot offering nitro coffee and kombucha, 2 items that you may not find in a lot of coffee places. The only issue I have with this establishment is that nearly impossible to get a seat because this place is in such a convenient location."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2018-04-29,5.0,"The coffee from Stumptown is very strong without the burnt taste that Starbucks has. Also, you won't get the styrofoam taste I get from Dunkin.

This location has a water tap think for self serve water that's not too tappy. Clean bathroom too!

I would love to own a Stumptown as my retirement job. Some people like to volunteer.I like to drink the profits. But, I don't want to clean the toilets."
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2018-05-07,5.0,"How could I possibly have anything bad to say about Stumptown? I already liked these guys from my past visit in Seattle, so I was excited to see that there were a few Stumptown's in New York. Even better? They offer a free cupping every Tuesday morning. I dragged myself out of bed in time and was treated to some knowledge, some great coffee, and some new friends. What the hell else is FREE in New York? Awesome experience, and I'd do it again!"
74,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york-2,2018-11-03,2.0,"The smith chai is unfortunately uninspired! Burns your throat a little (in a good way) but also watery and generally lacking in the richness and flavor chai should have.

If you're craving chai, find a Birch instead!"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2020-01-15,5.0,"This is my go-to coffee spot in the downtown and specifically, Nolita, area! 

I love that it's on a side street so it can get busy but it also feels like a small mom & pop coffee shop. And, in fact, it is. The owner is often there and even stands behind the counter taking orders. 

It's pretty small, as most coffee places in New York are, but they have a few benches with comfortable cushions and a few bar stools near the window as well. 

My boyfriend and I went here almost every weekend at one point and it's here that I learned that my favorite coffee drink is a flat white. They also have great pastries, like kouign-amann and croissants.

I'm hesistant to tell anyone how much I love this place, because I don't want it getting too busy ;) but Cafe Integral is truly a sweet & cute cafe."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-12-02,5.0,"Stopped by while running errands one Sunday afternoon. The place was quite crowded so goes to show how popular this place was.

The decor in this place was a mixture of modern and minimalistic. A lot of potted plans are strewn around the counters and seating areas. The cafe also has a lot of cool photographs. The beverages are served in some unique grey clay coffee cups which I thought was great and went with the decor.

The cafe has a small gift spot within its walls. You can buy some good coffee beans, cups, and some cool coffee table books among other things.  

I ordered the famous Horchata Latte, that everyone keeps raving about and I must say the latte did not disappoint. The coffee beans were well roasted and seemed to be of good quality. The Horcitta flavor was present enough to taste but did not overpower the drink. 

Overall a great cafe that is serious about its coffee."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-11-25,2.0,"This place has a modern, fancy interior and nice baristas, so I enjoyed hanging out inside. Sadly, I really didn't enjoy the almond milk latte. While it was a big portion, it just didn't taste good. I could hardly taste any espresso, the drink tasted grainy, and the aftertaste was strange. I also tried the mocha latte and it was way too sweet. I love the idea of supporting Nicaraguan imports, but I wouldn't return because for the price, I've had much better elsewhere."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2020-01-08,1.0,"Eek. Both my espresso and my wife's cold brew were overly acidic and not bold in flavor whatsoever. Additionally, the croissants were quite dry. Never again."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-11-24,4.0,"Cute cafe with that instagrammable, minimalist look. Standard espresso drinks + unique specialty drinks too. Plus they make their own housemade nut milks (almond milk, horchata almond milk) sweetened with dates. The horchata latte is great! Thick and creamy cinnamony flavor. Not super sweet so might need to add sugar if you're looking for something more decadent and sweet. The latter art is average haha. 

Came here on a weekend morning and it is busy! Pretty popular spot. Love the comfy couches in one corner. Great space to hang out and catch up with friends over coffee. 

They also have some food but I didn't try it. Overall a good cafe if you are in the area. I wouldn't travel out of the way for it because new york is saturated with a gazillion cafes. The unique selling point for me is definitely the housemade almond milk."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-05-12,5.0,"Cozy, Nicaraguan coffee spot in the heart of the lower east side. They offer classic coffee drinks and innovative house specialties as well. I got the horchata latte. It hit the spot, during this cold and rainy day. 
This is one of their 4 locations. Bravo Helvia! (Owner)
Come here if you want great service and an awesome cup of coffee. They also have an array of delicious pastries to accompany your coffee. :)"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-11-28,3.0,"Don't understand the 5 stars - the generic array of Balthazar pastries and coffee drinks. Maybe I'm hardcore, asking for a pourover, but it wasn't that good. Coffee guy did suggest the good drip, but I insisted, and maybe it's their strong point. Maybe it's the fantastic cappucinos. I guess I missed the point. So honestly, from a one time visit, just 3 stars."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-08-12,4.0,"In New York City, everyone is always on the hunt for a good cup of coffee. Cafe Integral delivers on its coffee and matchas. If you're on the south end of Soho and need to find a spot for your caffeine fix, Cafe integral is a great contender.

Here's what you need to know: 
1. The vibes are worthy of Instagram. If you're looking for the perfect backdrop for your latte, Cafe Integral could work.
2. The coffee is good. The beans and coffee are well done. 
3. It's slightly overpriced (as with all things in Soho). Just prepare yourself to spend.
4. The staff is super nice and knowledgeable. 
5. There is enough variety in the menu for anyone to find what they want.

NYC is filled with amazing coffee shops and places to get your caffeine and/or turmeric fix. If you're in the area, Cafe Integral is a great place to go - whether you're a local or a visitor."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-11-02,5.0,"I came here and was recommended the Horchata Latte, which was absolutely delicious. You could really taste the rich horchata flavor and the bold flavor of the expresso shot. I've never had anything like it before, certainly unique and different than your standard latte. I'd highly recommend if you want to try something new and different.

The seating is quite limited, so probably not the best place to get work done. Otherwise, its a good place to meet a friend or casually read a book."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-11-27,4.0,"This place is very hidden and quaint, so if you aren't walking around in the area, it will be hard to spot it. But once you do, trust that you found a great work or study spot that is very close to SoHo. 

One drawback for me personally was that they didn't have the option to get oat milk in my matcha, but regardless, it was very cozy reading a book and sipping on my matcha from a hand-made rustic mug!"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-08-30,4.0,"I got the Olivia and it was very good, slightly spiced with cinnamon and it also had dates. The only complaint that I have is that I didn't know it would be so small. The Brazilian cheese bread was also fantastic, nice and warm and a good pair with the coffee! I'd definitely come back."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-05-05,1.0,"I appreciate seeing many great options for good coffee coming into the neighborhood, but this spot is less about good coffee and more a pretentious shop selling the latest overpriced, trendy cultural appropriation or health superfood added to coffee at a premium price.  It also fits nicely into the trend of prioritizing instagram-ability over the actual product or service. 

I came to get a cup of their daily brew, interested to see their ties to Nicaraguan coffee. I stood on line starring at baristas who seemed to ignore us while chatting about some wonderful vacation.  The wait gave me time to read thru their extensive coffee-mocktail menu, filled with every unproven health supplement trend. 

If you want good coffee, walk a couple blocks to happy bones, grumpy or 12 corners. This place is more a waiting room for the Egg shop next door."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-07-17,5.0,Great coffee and service. The inside was pretty crowded for a random weekday. The iced americano was perfect.
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-04-30,4.0,"It is a great place to take a break in SOHO
The coffee taste great and they provide some common pastry but quite well taste.

The clerks are chill. Actually, I stay at the coffee shop for awhile they don't bother at all."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-06-29,5.0,"Very friendly and patient baristas! The latte I ordered had lots of foam and tasted perfect. It wasn't bitter and it didn't need any sugar. The presentation in stoneware was beautiful. The generous sized cup on a matching platter.

The interior of the cafe is welcoming, bright, and functional. It was cool inside thanks to the AC. 

I'd definitely recommend to my friends and would go back!"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-10-23,5.0,"Wonderful, polite staff. Great coffee and pastries! Cozy, little place."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-06-21,5.0,"3 words - Matcha Mas Matcha!!!!

This place came highly recommended from a fellow matcha lover and my expectations were pretty high. I came in thinking I was going to get my usual - matcha with oat milk - but then I saw the menu.

The menu is on a whole other level for matcha and espresso fanatics who are looking for something a little more (or should I say Mas?!). I have not seen matcha drinks this creative anywhere in LA.

I went with the Matcha Mas Matcha (iced) which is matcha, spirulina, and a super tasty house made cashew milk. My only complaint is that my drink wasn't twice the size because it was so tasty."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2017-04-11,1.0,"Nice minimalist designed space and pretty good strong coffee but for $6 I've had better around the city. 

Only reason I wouldn't come back here is because of nasty baristas. There are plenty of coffee shops like this in the city, I don't need to spend my money and feel crappy afterwards. They need to chill and smile once in a while to customers."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2019-09-04,3.0,"espresso was pretty good. 
They are using a pretty dark roast. 

I am not as willing to pay as much as they charge because of their skill and attention to detail. (Barista)"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-03-24,4.0,Great place to hang while waiting for a table at egg shop. I recommend the matcha fizz. Not a big fan for their espresso/espresso drinks - a bit bitter/sour for my taste
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2017-12-10,4.0,"Great coffee! My friend and I popped in here while waiting for Egg Shop and we both had a nice drip. Friendly baristas and the blue velvet couches are cool. They have a relationship with Egg Shop and the hostess will poke her head in to call names, so you don't have to wait outside!"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-01-11,4.0,"Good coffee and friendly staff! Giant latte with cute little heart design. Coffee taste really good ! Beware, to go latte is not served in giant bowls! Make sure you drink your latte in house!"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-07-22,5.0,"Their signature drinks are pleasant surprises. You'll read the ingredients, and they don't sound like they'll go together. But take one sip and they totally do. Might confuse your taste buds for bit--thinking it tastes different but amazing! My favorite is the Olivia, who knew dates were yummy in drinks? (Or maybe everyone did, except me). Their more traditional drinks are splendid, both their coffees and teas. Not too bitter, not too bland. There's something about their beans and tea leaves and the way they brew their drinks that you'll surely notice those subtle hints of different flavors.

Wonderful customer service. Always a plus when you can enjoy your coffee/tea in a gorgeous ceramic mug and pastries in a beautiful clean interior."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-04-18,5.0,"After visiting The Tenement Museum, my boyfriend and I decided to grab some coffee. Browsing coffee shops around me on Yelp, we found this cute place. The shop has a clean layout, with high tables and sofas for customers to enjoy their coffee/tea. The price were good, as we got a latte for $4.50 and a cappuccino for $4.00. The coffee were served beautifully and they tasted awesome. They also offer coffee to-go.

Good place to take a rest or just grab a coffee to go!"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-09-30,4.0,Great spot. Kinda small and cramped if you want to work. But I was overall happy with my tea.
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2016-09-08,4.0,"I've never been to their other location on Grand but this newly opened location is a bright and cozy cafe. There is adequate seating and the coffee is good and consistent. They also have other options for non-coffee drinkers. I can see myself sitting there and enjoying a cup of coffee. In terms of food, I did not take a good look at the menu but I saw pastries, breads, yogurt/parfait and they have doughnuts from Doughnut Plant (definite plus).

The downsides are that they close at 6pm every day and to be completely honest, I think some of the coffee options on the menu are overpriced. 

But overall, I give Cafe Integral a thumbs up."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-06-24,4.0,"Definitely will come back! I've heard that this place has the best coffee - as a drinker of not-coffee, I ordered a juice. Boy was I surprised. The Green Monster was drinkable, refreshing, and filling. One of the few green drinks in the city that are healthy, doesn't cost an arm and a leg, and doesn't taste like grass!"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-01-17,5.0,"The atmosphere: really nice minimalistic space and decorations, a cool place to grab a cup of coffee with your friend and just chill for a while

The coffee: I ordered cappuccino while my friend got herself a cup of hot chocolate. The cappuccino was silky smooth and the hot chocolate was standard

I would def visit again whenever I'm coming up to New York!"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2017-06-03,4.0,"I actually love coming here because of the aesthetics. I also think it's so cute that they collaborate with Egg Shop (it's right next door and I am a HUGE fan of Egg Shop). I love just sitting at Cafe Integral and read or do my work. Their sofa is super comfortable too!

I do have to say though.. I'm sure it's just me but their cold brew and coffee isn't exactly for my type of taste. They also explore a lot of different types of coffee and flavors which has a unique taste to it but yep, it's not for me. I think it's interesting but my taste buds don't think so. My favorite from them is actually just a classic latte."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-12-07,5.0,Hot baristas brought me here and Hot chocolate is highly recommended! Love the decoration and minimal vibes in the cafe.
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2017-11-18,5.0,"As far as local coffee shops in Soho goes, Integral is easily the best coffee shop in terms of the quality coffee and shop aesthetics you will find. Expanding to this second location is truly a luxury with a shop dedicated to coffee as opposed to a shop-and-sip experience. The nitro cold brew offered at Cafe Integral is silky smooth and flavorful - and almost rivals that of Stumptown. Local residents that are coffee aficionados or brunch patrons waiting for their tables at Butchers Daughter or Egg Shop should take advantage of visiting Integral for a great coffee rather than ordering a poor substitute wherever they are eating."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2016-12-23,5.0,"Just discovered this place and so glad that I did. Such a great spot.  

The coffee is fantastic and fresh.  They don't overdue it and you will enjoy all of the options.  

A special added bonus is that they have Doughnut Plant deliciousness in their case. So, you can get some of the best coffee in the hood and chase it with some of the best doughnuts in the city...without the hassle of waiting in that crazy line. Perfect!!!"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2016-10-07,5.0,"Definitely a new addition in Little Italy area that featured good and simple espressos. This cute little shop was decorated in a Scandinavian fashion, that I fell in love right away with its delicacy.

Egg shop/Butcher's daughter brunch lovers, come here and grab a coffee while waiting for your seats, and thank me later!

Very balanced latte, reminded me my good old time at Switzerland."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-12-01,5.0,My fave coffee/tea shop ever. I don't drink coffee often - it makes me jittery - but their coffee with homemade coconut milk is so tasty. Also they have a bunch of non caffeinated options as well like Golden milk which is oh so good for your body. I'm a fan!!
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2017-01-13,4.0,"Nice and helpful staff, nice interior, delicious coffee, quite expensive."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2016-08-29,5.0,"Really awesome pour overs and coffees just like their other location in the American Two Shot clothing store.
In addition, Integral features more pastries, chia pudding, and more non coffee drink options here.

The layout is spacious, bright, and has more seating than the location on Grand. 

For now they close everyday at 6pm."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2016-10-25,4.0,"Hopped in for coffee and a place to do some Yelping/blogging. The new location is very close to both my office and Chinatown so it's a nice in-between spot. 

Baristas are nice and the decor is clean and crisp. I really like how open and airy it is. Coffee is solid and comes in a giant cup! I definitely felt like I got my money's worth with my latte. I hate when they give you an eenie teenie cup of coffee when you're paying $4+! 

Wifi is reliable and PW is easily obtained from the barista. Definitely going to add Cafe Integral to my go-to list of cafes in the area!"
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-01-28,5.0,I come here just for the coconut milk latte. It's not just a hint of coconut it's like a creamy whipped coconut milk froth mixed in. I dream about this latte and only wish they'd open a spot in DC
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2018-06-10,5.0,"Cafe Integral is what I envision what a coffee shop in NYC should be if it was portrayed in a movie. It's chic and well put together. Similarly, the coffee creations are thought and creative. I tried the matcha mas matcha once and the olivia, unsure of what exactly I was ordering, but I was pleasantly surprised of how well the flavors go together. I'd definitely recommend to support this small business."
75,café-integral-new-york-2,2016-12-20,4.0,"The first thing that struck me when I came to this place was how a few people were having lattes in a large bowl! But I ended up having a skinny cortadito both times I visited. Coffee was good and I really liked the vibe in here.

There are some very interesting drink options on the menu though, and I really should come back to try them. There's also homemade nut milks e.g. almond, cashew, coconut (slightly pricey though) and pastries like donuts, croissants, cookies. The cafe was full both times I visited, but I noticed that the sofa seats don't get occupied for too long as compared to the window seats :)"
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2020-03-09,5.0,"I've tried the seasonal special drinks at the other locations and they did Not disappoint. Unfortunately, the cafe was temporarily closed when I stopped by so I could not pick up a rose hot chocolate (it's a hot chocolate infused with a touch of rose water: it's so delicious). The green matcha croissant also caught my attention: such a pretty croissant! I'll be sure to pick one up next time."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2019-12-27,4.0,"Gave it 4 stars overall. A small place with two or three barstools. Not particularly big by any means. Better off as a place to stop & go rather than drink there. The barista was less than engaging so I suppose with that attitude a perfect fit for this place. 
There are plenty of other places that are more than welcoming so if you're looking for exceptional service, this is not it. Coffee was nice and strong though."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2019-08-16,3.0,"Small coffeeshop with very limited seating (only a couple barstools) and no bathroom. I'd recommend coming here if you just need to grab a coffee, but not for studying or meeting friends. I had a half-caf iced coffee and it was very strong tasting."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2019-06-04,4.0,"TL;DR: Coffee is really yum but a bit overpriced. Not a sit down spot! 

I live above the cafe and how delicious are the artisinal drinks, 
but my goodness if i became a regular, 
my funds would be gone in a blink. 

Order the iced vanilla latte for something classic and sweet, 
and the classic iced coffee is still something that can't be beat. 

Cafe Grumpy won't make you grumpy, unless you're on a budget,
but the you can go somewhere else to try and cast your judgement."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2019-02-08,3.0,"Small shop with an assortment of pastries - muffins, banana bread, etc. - and a decent coffee menu. I ordered a mocha and it was good, but not that rich. Did the trick though and it was pretty! I noticed there were a few non-dairy milks, which I'm sure is standard but I rarely see it straight-up on a menu."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2020-02-27,2.0,"Just like the name of the place, the lady who works there was VERY VERY GRUMPY. I don't know whAt she's going through but man oh man.... just put a little smile there, even if you have to fake it."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2018-04-21,4.0,"One of my go-to coffee places in the area. I'm very picky, because in New York City~ where there are loads of coffee shops that make really good coffee~ many of these good coffee shops are also insanely busy. Like, really, really busy. But this location of Cafe Grumpy has a good quality to not-very-long-line ratio that I appreciate greatly. The baristas there are also very friendly and they can whip up a mean espresso really fast. Their cold brew is also rich with chocolate notes but minus the dirtiness of lesser cold brews elsewhere.

Though this has nothing to do with this specific location, I also really like Cafe Grumpy's beans. I buy their beans for pour overs at home, and they're really high-quality; even though Cafe Grumpy is all over the city, the overall quality of their product is not ""mass produced"" . Really appreciate Cafe Grumpy, especially this location."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2019-07-25,4.0,"Great coffee, slightly on the expensive side compared to other coffee shops in the area. They do have decaf options, which I usually get if I'm getting coffee late in the day. They also have some seasonal offerings like rose latte, which I find weird but people must be ordering so they have it on the menu? Very friendly baristas. Not much space to sit."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2019-08-17,5.0,I love this place. The kindest staff! The drinks are perfect and I love the seasonal ones like the cookie butter or the vanilla bean latter (AMAZING). They have outdoor seating and the music is perfect. Bad part is there isn't any WiFi.
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2017-04-26,4.0,"Came here on a Monday afternoon and the barista was very nice! 

I was debating on to trying their matcha latte or their cardamom rose latte (which was new).

I decided to get that and it wasn't bitter at all. It had a little hint of coffee in it and the rose wasn't overpowering at all. (4.5/5) 
I highly recommend this drink if you're a rose fanatic drinker like I am, 

The latte art was on point and there is limited seating available. There is a bench outside as well. 

Overall, service was attentive, nice and fast, I would come here again to try out their other drinks."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2019-07-06,5.0,"I'm new to the area and am indeed a grumpy girl in the mornings before my coffee. Decided to wander over here as it was close. The coffee was outstanding and the service was great. The person working was not grumpy as I had been nervous about, but responsive and nice. I had oat milk with my iced coffee which was delicious. Thank you for offering nondairy/vegan milk alternatives. At $5 for an iced coffee I found the price on par with other coffee shops in the area, for higher quality coffee. Plus, they have paper straws instead of plastic, which is better for the environment. I will come back on those days where I need a quick fix and can't deal with making my own, as a special treat. :)"
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2019-04-07,3.0,$4.50 for an 8oz cappuccino and extra $0.75 for oat milk. Pricey but the coffee tastes great. Not a sit down place and gets pretty busy especially on a Sunday morning.
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2017-08-07,5.0,"I came here for a quick coffee. Couldn't find the place at first even though we walked by, didn't have any branding on the outside. Once we got in we saw the grumpy LED face and knew we were in the right place. 

The coffee was good and they make a good cortada. The location works well for them since they are near the park and you can stop in for a coffee in the evening. 

There's not a lot of seating area, the space is pretty small but about 3 people can sit by the window.  They do have a couple of chairs at the counter as well. 

Not a place for a sit in coffee with friends, no restroom, just grab and go."

NY Manhattan Chinatown
1:30pm Thursday 17th December 2015
Five Stars

Located on Essex across from Sewards Park in Chinatown, Cafe Grumpy is a truly great little coffee shop. It's small with two bar stools and a 2-3 person window seat. The Cure was playing when I walked in from the rain which was fitting. They use their own brand of coffee roasted in Greenpoint Brooklyn. I had a small cappuccino ($4). It was served in an orange ceramic mug with a foam heart. Their espresso was bold with grapefruit and caramel notes. There is an amazing lingering bitterness that sticks to your tongue. The foam was thicker and sweeter. There was very little steamed milk which I liked. The barista was friendly and grumpy face logo is a great brand."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2017-07-23,4.0,Hipster as hell coffee shop without the hipster prices. They have sub-$4 Matcha which is rare in NYC. Their really friendly and in my experience get your orders out pretty quickly
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2017-06-08,4.0,"It's walking distance from the BFF's house... loved their branding and oh yeah... the token staff that morning wasn't grumpy!!!

I had a soy latte and it was good... nice coffee and it was made properly... drinkable at the right temperature :)"
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2019-02-02,5.0,"A gem of a find near our Airbnb in the Lower East Side. The logo sold me and the coffee, service, and pastries made it the perfect stop before hitting uptown."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2019-02-15,1.0,Coffee is good. Baristas are jerks. Go to Little Canal for a less pretentious environment. I asked the barista if he had any unsweetened nondairy milk and he acted like I'd asked him for his first born.
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2018-03-06,3.0,"4$ for an iced coffee??? No wonder they named it cafe grumpy...

P. S. Coffee wasn't bad...just not worth 4 dollars for a 75% ice and 25% coffee drink..."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2016-10-29,5.0,Cute coffee shop! They have their own coffee blends and swag. We received free cold brew with our cappuccinos. Very friendly staff.
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2017-11-04,5.0,"Kinda mad at myself for not finding this place sooner considering I work about 10 minutes from here. It's a cozy little place, not a spot to sit and chat, but more for grab and go. 

I've only ever tried their cold brew, which costs $4, but it's a great cup of coffee. Hands down the aroma itself is amaze-balls and I love coffee. Not just any coffee - I'm always on the hunt for quality. I'm waiting for the weather to get colder so that I could try some of their hot drinks. It's definitely become my go to spot when I need a cup of joe. And the logo is pretty cool too!"
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2018-06-16,2.0,I ordered an iced coffee with very little ice and no room for milk and she hands me a cup of ice coffee that had more ice than coffee and 3/4 inch space for milk. I don't think she really cared much.
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2016-11-01,5.0,"It was just a matter of time before I came across this little cafe tucked away on the outskirts of Chinatown.  

The minute I did the search on Yelp and this popped up on the peripheral, I knew I had to go. This cafe is not that large and all the seating is outside on the sidewalk.  I ordered a simple latte and it was made while I waited.

Seriously good coffee.

And I'll say it again here: NY has the best coffee.  I was thoroughly spoiled for my week here.  Can't drink any of the stuff in CA anymore."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2018-10-08,2.0,"It's quick, but everyone who works here has a shitty disposition. And the coffee isn't good enough to charge the prices. I work closer to Grumpy but most of the time I just walk to Little Canal where the people and the coffee are nicer."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2016-02-08,5.0,"One of my favorite spots to get coffee. It's on the very edge of Chinatown by the lower east side so it's pretty far for me but I think it's totally worth the trip. Their flat whites and cortados are made properly which is great because not many coffeeshops, especially around this area, can make them properly.

There isn't seating inside the shop as it is more of a get your coffee to go kind of place but that doesn't bother me as I just grab it and go to work."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2017-09-13,4.0,"Tried their drip, which were pacamara beans from El Salvador. Certainly not bad or over-roasted... but the notes were a bit muddled; I couldn't tell if it was the beans, the roast, or the brewing method. The barista who helped me also didn't seem to know much about the coffee, which is fine if you're at a Starbucks or Peet's, but shouldn't be the case if you're touted as ""third-wave"""
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2018-01-22,5.0,Superb coffee. Great service. Perfect place to stop when on the go. All of the coffee is made fresh and this spot has great pastries too!
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2018-03-19,1.0,Coffee may be good but the barista's attitude ruins it all. Thought the name was just the name? Wrong.
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2016-03-27,2.0,"Yep. Lives up to the name Grumpy. And they seem to be dictators regarding the overpriced coffee. 
Don't ask them to put sugar in the cup first. Evidently that's too hard. Outrageous. That's the way I like it. Have done for years. 
Coffee tastes good but I'll go somewhere where they don't take themselves so hipster seriously and make an outstanding coffee the way the customers likes it."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2014-02-15,5.0,"My favorite spot, here everyday, literally multiple times throughout the day. Love the staff coolest people, super sweet & I'm not taking about their baked goods...yet. 
Their bakery is insane. I've tried it all, you haven't had nothing until you've walked in my shoes... Lemon bread, banana bread, corn muffins, pecan cookies, bundt cake muffin, brownies, chocolate chunk chip something. The list goes on duh!
Love,

Soy latte & americano"
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2017-07-14,5.0,"Ok. This is an amazing little coffee place. The oat milk latte is great if you don't have dairy. As a vegan/vegetarian, I really loved the oat and almond milk option. (Get an iced oatmilk latte in the summer!)"
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2018-08-21,2.0,Do yourself a favor and walk right past this place and into little canal where the coffee is better and the people are a million times nicer!!
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2014-05-03,4.0,"I stopped by here with a lady I met and had some coffee with her. She seemed to have enjoyed her cappuccino here. I don't know why the cafe is called ""grumpy"" but I guess their coffee is supposed to make grumpy people feel better. 

I don't really have much to say, but I thought I had some wonderful and fresh coffee at this place. I had this coffee imported from Ethiopia called Chire, which has some kumquat fruit in it. I thought the flavor was really good, mixing it with some cream and sugar also made this cup a wonderful coffee. I also had some Blueberry Hibiscus Iced Tea, and I thought it was very refreshing, had a juicy flavor, and was not too sweet or bitter. 

This place is not really a cafe, it's more like a place where you grab your coffee and leave for someplace else, though there's a bench outside, and a couple of chairs. The guy who worked there at that time seemed to be very friendly. Overall, I thought I had some pretty good coffee, and I think this place has a lot of potential to serve some great coffee in a city like New York."

Hard to tell what's grumpy about this place since it's so good."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2015-09-16,3.0,"The espresso at Cafe Grumpy is great. The staff at Cafe Grumpy, are well...grumpy. 

I started coming in here to try something different in the area and on my first run I was quite pleased. My cappuccino (iced) was smooth and of the perfect strength. Second day I came in to get the same drink, and they attempted to charge me a $1 more (this was a sin on top of the already astronomical price of $4 for a cappuccino). Essentially they were charging me $1 for ice, and to NOT froth the milk, which they don't do with any of their iced drinks (I know this is preference and each shoppe does it differently). The guy behind the counter was neither here nor there when I was shocked by the price tag (be reminded this is $5 for 1 shot with milk and ice in a small/medium cup). I was too embarrassed to say I paid something different the day before, in fears of looking cheap--instead they'll just lose my business. There's tons of other places in the area that will make you feel more welcomed and be less picky about what they're serving you (I know purists, I'm sorry). My apologies that I am not willing to spend a $1 on ice*....

*Sometimes."
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2016-04-05,5.0,"How do they do it? Almond milk latte. It's so fluffy! But not dry. It's so delicious. It needs no sugar. I haven't found the folks here to be cranky, and I'm very thin skinned. I love their coffee and the care they put into each cup.
xo"
76,cafe-grumpy-new-york-6,2017-05-28,2.0,"I stopped in here before a job and grabbed a small cup of drip. Way overpriced and served with an attitude. Cute place but I'm not a fan of Grumpy. Next time, I'll walk the extra block and go to 12 Corners..."

with wonderful staff! The barista was very friendly and completed our order quickly.  latte was good but the almond milk I had with it was bitter, I think it was the brand they used. My boyfriend got a cold brew which he enjoyed. Not the best coffee I've ever had but still very good, and of course the name is amazing. Four stars because there is no place to sit."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2020-01-01,5.0,We were having lunch in Little Italy and wanted some tiramisu but our restaurant was out for the day. Our server recommended Caffe Roma which was right at the end of the block. We popped in and were so happy we did. We ordered the tiramisu and the cherry cheesecake and both were amazing. Exactly what we were looking for that day. Some of the best cheesecake I've had in NYC. So glad we followed our server's recommendation.
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-11-24,4.0,"Full disclosure:
11 Little Italy stores participated in the Netflix promotion of the Irishman that happen this past Friday and Saturday, it became a treasure hunt/food tour for me.

Ever since I discovered Caffe Roma through the food tour, I been back for the cannolis.  When I saw Caffe Roma as one of the participating restaurants in the Netflix promotion, I had to definitely see what treat they are giving away.  I walked in the door and reached the counter.  There was an employee behind the refrigerated display case.  Another customer was there and told the employee, ""Jimmy sent me.""  I piped up and said, ""Jimmy sent me too!"" so she didn't have to walk twice.  We received our treat and I was curious.  It is a full-sized cannoli.  How awesome is that!

If you haven't read my previous review, take a gander.  They are one of the few places that makes they own cannoli shells which is why it's all different sizes and not uniformed.  The cannoli cream contains miniature chocolate chips.

If you haven't tried their items, definitely come try their cannolis and desserts.

Thanks Caffe Roma for the cannoli!"
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-09-19,4.0,"Another historic bakery I want to show off in Little Italy. Each year when I go to the Feast I try to visit a new location. It's great to visit and meet the employees. 

I believe they were open to people using the restroom. The sign on the door says for customers only. I was fortunate I didn't have to go. I don't know why I'm mentioning this except that I saw a lot of people waiting in line in the rear of the restaurant. It's kind of open for all to see. 

It's a busy place with a couple of employees. There were plenty of open tables. I saw one girl not only handling the counter customers like me, but she also was taking a plated Cannoli to someone's table. I'm more of a grab a cookie and go. I can't sit still. I do want to walk around the room if they don't object. This place is historic. I enjoyed the old feel and original decor. I wandered around taking photos since they weren't overly crowded with customers. 

It's cash only. The signs are everywhere. It's very relaxing inside. The employees made me feel comfortable like I was at grandmas house. I got a smile as soon as they saw my wide eyes and open mouth looking at all grandmas cookies in the display case. 

I recommend you visit this historic bakery. You may just find cookies like your grandma used to make. I know I did!"
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-05-23,3.0,"Meh at best. I just do not share the sentiment of other reviewers for this place.
Walked in for a dessert nightcap on this Thursday evening and I thought we walked into Yucca Flats. Not one patron on the premises---just the workers. Regardless, we settled down for tea/coffee and dessert. Slowly, some people came around but overall, it was quiet.

Not much atmosphere although there were  many tables and  I'd like to say that Caffe Roma has been around since 1891, as stated on tee shirts. That's many years in business.

We placed our order for a Jasmine tea, Cappuccino and Tiramisu. No water brought to the table. 
The counter had a large variety of desserts on display, some looked good although what it tasted like was another story.

My cappuccino was average. I've had better and worse. The odd part was the tiramisu. It looked pretty but was a huge let down and not in the tradition of what I'm accustomed to. In fact, we both thought it tasted a bit like cheesecake. It was kind of dry and with not much flavor.

Also, because they were getting ready to close, we were asked to move to another table on the other side of the room. I thought that was an inconvenient suggestion, so we just ended up paying the check and left. It was only 10:30. 

Maybe it was an off night but I wished we walked to Ferrara. Oh well."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2020-01-14,3.0,I always come to this place when I visit little Italy. I have great memories here of cold days and sweet cookies. I recall how amazing the cappuccinos with whip cream were but for some reason this time the cappuccinos were more like lattes without any foam and the staff gave us a hard look because we had a sealed box from a different bakery. We ordered coffee and cookies but still we got looks from the owner and staff. Ehh might be trying a different coffee spot next visit
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-07-18,5.0,"Hands down, the BEST cannolis I've ever had.  I made a special trip just to come here during our vacation.  They only accept CASH.  A scene from The Sporanos was filmed here."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-12-15,4.0,"Cannoli, Cannoli, Cannoli... The cannoli here are exquisite!  Super crisp shells, rich, complex filing with hints of cinnamon and spice!  OMG!  In Cannoli people often confuse size with quality.  These are smaller, maybe 5.5"" x 1"", but so deep and rich that they are 10x better than larger flavorless versions elsewhere... ok everywhere else!   

This is very old looking establishment that looks as old as Mulberry street and NY itself.  I guess they feel they are busy enough that they don't need to put any money back into the look of the place.  Are the rear of the shop is a very cool looking bar that's a completely missed opportunity for bar side treats and eats.  They need to clean it up and rethink all the junk piled up... they could serve twice as many people and brighten the place up too."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-12-27,5.0,"Caffe Roma is amazing! I am so surprised at the rating, it should really be 4-5 stars. 

Quick note: best desserts around, cash only! 

My husband and I stumbled upon this bakery after dinner last night and we are so glad we did. I had their cheesecake with a cappuccino and the hubby had their cannoli with jasmine tea. Our dessert was simply amazing. My cheesecake was the creamiest I have ever had and having it with the cappuccino was the perfect combination. 

It seems like a family run business and everybody was so sweet and helpful. We'll definitely be back for some more pastries!"
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-11-19,4.0,"On a fair note I can give this pastry shop an average rating. It does everything on the average side of any given pastry or bakery but for the quality it puts out that is a slight higher than the average I give it a 4 star merit in it's category.

There were several selections we chose and shared.

Presentation is important, no?...of course, in a treat. The first was an oval shaped (5 inches in diameter about 3 inches tall), plump, mini cake-like cheesecake. It had a vanilla coated top shell with an oreo cookie in it's center. It taste sweet and with a vanilla flavor. It did not have a strong memorable flavor to it. It was just an average pass by snack not to be remembered.

The second of the same design was a darker brown shade all around with a swirl of chocolate syrup on top and that was my favorite choice. It being a chocolate cheesecake. This mini cheesecake had a stronger chocolate flavor over the cheesecake flavor.

The texture of all the 3+ varieties of mini cheesecake slanted toward more cheesecake than cake. They were very moist, mid level flavored with chocolate/vanilla/etc... and a light cheesecake taste.

I also enjoyed their cannoli. It was huge, the size of a sausage. I might eat a cannoli once a year. And in comparison I only wish the flavor of the cream filling inside was more intense in the side of ricotta/cream cheese flavor, it was very light. But the way it was made in the outside shell coated in chocolate and a double layer of crisp with the cream sticking out gave it a nice crunch factor mixed in with a delightful cream+chocolate chew.

Dust some sugar on their mini croissant or other pastry treats and these reasons I would surely go back while in the area and craving a sweet treat.

The coffee is good too."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-03-03,4.0,Whenever i visit NYC i have yo come to Caffe Roma. They never disappoint with the quality of pastries and drinks. I tried the hazelnut hot chocolate and it was really good. The service is all right just feel its very touristy area so they dont care much. It cash only so make sure you bring dough and no damn credit cards . They have a bathroom for customers only and it's always clean but can get a wait depending on how busy they are. They have a couple if tables close to the bathroom... its hit or miss.. try it but good place to visit... the chocolate mousse cake is dammmnnn good.. deliciousness written all over it..
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-11-26,5.0,"This family bakery has been in business since 1891, and it continues to deserve five stars for their cannolis, pignolis, sfogliatelle, and chocolate-almond cookies. Service is sometimes abrupt but always prompt. Cash only. Highly recommended."

The coffee was lacking. I ordered the macchiato but what I got was espresso with flavoring and that's not what I hoped for. 

I love the ambience. The fact that it's been there since 1891 is impressive. Lovely interior."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-06-11,3.0,If you're looking for a great cannoli go to Caffe Palermo.  The cannolis here had a crazy thick and hard shell with a filling that tasted mostly of powdered sugar.  I was disappointed.  It's also pricey and is cash only.

After eating 1/3 of theirs I stoped. Shell was soggy and old. The filling not very tasty. Just a bad cannoli experience.

77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2020-01-31,1.0,Not recommended at all... no cash accepted but no sign on the entrance at all. Foods are acceptable but not the best. Wasn't really a pleasant experience visiting here.
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-07-18,4.0,"Perfect.....exactly the kind of cafe you want in little Italy.

Had both the hazelnut and almond biscotti and will be back next time I'm in the area to have again."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-07-27,5.0,"Another must stops for me... I must admit, I haven't tried a lot of the Lemon Italian Ice in the area, but I must say, this one is pretty, (fill in the adjective) refreshing!  I haven't tried anything else so can't comment on overall shop.  

My daughter and I have to stop here every time we visit NYC. One thing that sucked however, we came all the way here during the spring and this particular flavor was apparently ""out of season!""     Alas, we got our fix THIS time...."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-12-28,1.0,"Awful. If I could give zero stars I would. One of the wait staff, who appeared to be a manager/owner, was extremely rude and unhelpful. We sat down at a table for 3, we had 2 in our party, and she made us move to leave that table for ""a bigger party"". We than saw her seat 2 people at that very same table she made us move from. She did not come back to our table to see if we needed anything and then we had to wait to get our bill. When the bill finally was brought to the table they told us it was cash only, which we didn't have. Had we known this when walking in...we wouldn't have even bothered to sit down. Would not recommend this place at all."

I could sit there and read a book and munch on Napoleons all day (but I won't). Everyone at my table was happy with what they got. Well air conditioned.. out door seating... attentive staff.

But we didn't regret staying bc the tiramisu and cappuccino was delicious! It was just the right amount of sweetness since I'm not a big sweets person, but we just had lunch and wanted desserts afterwards lol. 

The staff was super friendly and the price was perfectly fine. 

The store seemed like it needed some renovation and the chairs were a little frightening to sit & lean back, but seemed like the cafe has been around for quite a while. Other than that, it was a good experience!"
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-12-28,5.0,"Totally in love with this place.

Walked in by accident and had a cheesecake - best one I've ever had. So good, we had to come back a day later. 

Great atmosphere and very friendly and passionate waiter. Thanks for a great experience."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-06-06,3.0,Came here with a friend to try out their gelato. there was really nothing special to their gelato and it was a bit overpriced in my opinion for the serving size and the quality of the gelato.
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-09-11,1.0,"Desserts are edible but far from good. Clearly they tried to squeeze in as many tables as possible for the maximum profit, regardless of how uncomfortable it is. The service is horrible, after we ordered at the counter, we were told to sit down. After that they told us to move to another table as it was just the two of us- so we were sat literally in the middle of the restaurant, despite the fact that there were 2 other big free tables... we couldn't eat calmly as everyone was coming and going around us continuously as we had to sit in people's way... definitely not going back. Also, it's not cheap but cash only, no credit/debit cards... In 2018, really?"
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-05-17,1.0,"It's after 8pm and still fairly light out for May 2019 and we wanted some pastries and coffee. This place sucks in many levels. The wait person isn't helpful in sitting and greeting us. Only the espresso was amazing. Don't ever order their lattes. Their cream puffs are cold and hard and their Napoleon pastry isn't the jam. 
Lastly: Not once were we notify of a cash only business and no signage of it.One barista and two servers for a large establishment, with the restroom is smell and dirty."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-06-07,5.0,"Nice place! My family visited Little Italy on a recent New York vacation, and we dropped in Caffe Roma on both occasions. The coffee drinks were superb, as was the pistachio gelato. They have nice indoor and outdoor seating, and nothing beats sitting outside sipping espresso in Little Italy!"
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-12-07,1.0,Desserts are plain . Restaurant is dark and dingy. The waitress had the personality of a wall slug and was not friendly. Take your business elsewhere
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-06-15,4.0,"My fiance and I stopped here for a cappuccino after having dinner out in Little Italy.

I ordered a hazelnut cappuccino and my fiance ordered a regular cappuccino. Both were delicious and I really loved the historic atmosphere of the place since it has been open for so long! We were too full from dinner to try any of the desserts, but they looked delicious.

This place is CASH ONLY which is understandable, but with the use of credit cards these days, I would definitely suggest providing the option. Set a $10 minimum for credit card use and maybe people will buy more!

They have a small bathroom, which is your typical old school NYC style restroom, tiny and compact. My purchase something to use it.

We will return :)"
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-12-19,3.0,"Met a few friends here to read, blog, and catch up. There were lots of coffee options but since I am caffeine-free, I was only able to order a decaf tea. The pastries in the window did not look too fresh to me so I didn't order anything else to go with my tea. Not a typical walk in order at counter cafe since you get served if you sat down at a table."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-10-05,5.0,Amazing and cute place for desserts and coffee.  We had the hazelnut cappuccino and French vanilla cappuccino and it was definitely on point.  We also had the Cannoli Sicilian and it was very very good.  Will definitely come back for more coffee and desserts
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-03-27,1.0,"Caffe Roma looks like a great cafe, especially to take a break from travels (walking everywhere) and enjoy something sweet and warm. I came in with high expectations and was excited to try their creations. 
First, when we entered in there were no signs indicating to wait to be seated so we just sat to the closest table we saw. We were not greeted at all just a quick, ""excuse me, are you eating in?"" I believed we were asked by the owner or the manager, not sure. She told us to sit at another table because she was saving them for a large party of 19. If you were saving these tables a simple sign (nothing fancy) should say that the tables are reserved. As we headed to another table, I looked at their desserts and pastries, they looked pretty good. It was pretty cramped in there though.
We were served by a young lady who looked like she didn't want to be there. 
When ordering the Earl Grey, it has always been served as a prepared drink and sometimes with cream. When I received my drink it was just a cup of hot water with an early grey packet on the. I found it weird. Well the package did say its from Italy. 
Our waitress forgot my uncle's Italian cheesecake, when reminded of it she said, ""oh ok."" The Italian cheesecake wasn't bad. 
Service wasn't great. 
Wish they accepted card too, luckily my brother had enough cash."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-11-16,4.0,"Definitely definitely most definitely get their tiramisu- it's super fresh and to die for! Besides that, I loved the vibe of this place- old school and classy with that homey feel. Great servers, good coffee. My husband got the Irish cream hot chocolate which was a tad too sweet but that wasn't too bad - since our rest of the experience was pretty stellar. Great find in Little Italy."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-02-06,4.0,"I may not be the best person to judge an Italian café seeing as how I don't drink coffee, and I don't really love Italian pastries. But my lack of general knowledge in any arena has never stopped me from spewing my uneducated opinion out into the world before, so why start now?

Really though, I may not be a cappuccino or rainbow cookie guy, but I am into cannoli and pignoli and tiramisu and gelato and other desserts that end in vowels, and Caffe Roma does them all right. They aren't the best I've ever had, but they are far, far from the worst. 

Stop in for a treat and/or a break from the guys around Little Italy trying to get you into their restaurants for some fairly ordinary pasta, and you won't be mad about it."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-10-04,5.0,All we had was gelato and it was AMAZING! I had the coffee gelato...oh my I still dream about it.  The guy behind the gelato counter was very nice and you can taste before you commit.
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-08-27,1.0,"Cash only --.  Disorganized, lackluster customer reception.  Lackluster taste with cookies, some were not edible.  Cheesecake tasted very bland.  In contrast had a deli cheesecake earlier in week, and it was flavorful, fresh, and awesome!!  Didn't feel the love here -- move along - not recommended!!"
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-09-08,2.0,"It was my first time in New York and I heard so much about Caffe Roma I had to stop with my cousin. The restaurant is cash only which was fine. What was not fine was the customer service. It felt like my experience there was rushed. The waiters gave us the check before we were able to order something else. They kept staring at us to the point where I just wanted to leave. The restaurant wasn't busy and other guests were not getting the same treatment. The coffee was great; however, I wouldn't return."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-08-09,3.0,"The desserts are great but the owner was such a grump. I was with my two young sons and we brought a deck of Uno cards. He came by and said ""no cards"" and I thought he was joking. He actually came by a second time and shut it down! Kinda ridiculous and scared my kids with his rudeness. Give me a break."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2019-07-28,2.0,"Possibly the most miserable employees in NYC. Having lived here for 15 years it's really sad to the think that tourists visiting this great city are left to think that this establishment is representative of one of the most fabulous cities in the world.

Service aside - pastries and gelato was mediocre at best.

What is a shame is that someone has no doubt poured good money into buying the business but has left it to be run by a team that clearly does not care.

Hopefully there is either a change of ownership or staffing as it could be such a great spot."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-03-16,2.0,"The place was cute and clean. The service and the people were nice and so helpful and everything looked delicious, however the desserts were very underwhelming.

I got two macaroons which were stuffed with icing and tasted way off, not bad, but definitely not a macaroon by any means. I also got a cannoli which i wasn't too impressed with, one bite and i was fine. I have had tons of cannolis in my lifetime, and this one wasn't even worth finishing. Super sad."
77,caffe-roma-pastry-new-york,2018-10-20,1.0,"Ridiculous! So after I placed my order, I sit down to drink a watered down cappuccino with whip cream literally from a can, I glanced over and saw a very small sign that read ""cash only"". It's 2018, and the very least the employees could do is inform you that this is a cash only establishment prior to you placing an order, or better yet management could splurge for a big sign at the door. Luckily I always have a $20 on me, and was able to cover my bill. That being said, my cappuccino was disappointing in both flavor and amount of coffee. There are way too many coffee shops around that provide better service and drinks."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2020-04-03,5.0,"The best avocado toast and iced coffee I've ever had. I normally take my iced coffee with milk, but it was tasty without it. 

If I lived closer, I would absolutely be a regular. I think it's decorated very beautifully too. A good place to meetup with friends."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2020-01-31,5.0,"Hands down my favorite cafe in New York City. I love it so much:
- I once walked from West village to Ludlow because I was craving their coffee soo much. 
- It's my go to recommendation when a friend asks for a place to meet up. (I live in Queens so this isn't an easy trek.) 
- I love the bourbon vanilla latte so much that I have yet to try anything else there because I can't NOT get it. 
- I bought their coffee beans so I can make coffee at home. 

On top of their amazing coffee, Ludlow is such a cozy place with a  beautiful aesthetic. It's difficult to grab seats, but I love hanging out here with friends and spending time reading or doing work in my free time."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-12-27,4.0,"Historically I had only come here for a place to sit down while I waited for a table at Sweet Chick next door. Yesterday, I happened to be in the area and decided to come here to do some reading. I unfortunately cannot speak to the quality of the coffee here as I only drink decaf, which they do not serve here. I ended up going with a turmeric latte. The latte was about what I expected - not astonishingly good but also not bad. I've had enough turmeric lattes to know that this is pretty much the state of turmeric lattes. 

What I liked about this place though is that they have plenty of seating, most of it quite comfortable and well-suited for my purpose of a couple of hours of casual reading. Clientele is your typical mix of tourists, so-called ""digital nomads"" (most of whom are either gchatting or on some form of social media), and groups of friends or couples meeting for a coffee date. The decor is hipster - I think they're going for some sort of vintage record shop/music library vibe with all the old records and turntables. I noticed more than one person taking photos of the space, presumably for Insta. Because that is the world in which we live."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-11-15,5.0,"Best Americano in the LES. 

Great coffee spot with super comfortable sitting area in the back playing killer eclectic music. Not too loud the perfect ambient noise. Not your typical acoustic coffee house. Mellow hip hop, classical, jazz, Japanese pop, totally random good music. 

Killer Americano! Too much water and the drink turns sour. They do it perfectly here. 2 shots - small cup - a little room. Mmmm. Never thought I could get this excited for my morning cup but I've been searching hi and low throughout the LES and have finally found it. 

I've been every day this week and it's super consistent and super good and super reasonable. 

My wife says the chai latte and pastries are great too."

5 stars for the space out back and 4 for the coffee!"
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-12-13,5.0,"Remember when you were growing up, and in Ohio, and you dreamed of being in NYC one day where everything would sparkle and your life would be *SO* cool. Well, you just found it. You didn't know it then, but Ludlow Coffee was what you were dreaming of. I would give this place six stars if I could. I don't want Yelp to change the rating system because then other places would have 6 stars too and I would have to bump these guys up to seven.

If I was to sum up Ludlow Coffee in two words it would be ""f$#%ing perfect"". Everything about this place is so good it makes your toes curl. 
The coffee is outstanding, the place is enormous, and the baristas are artists -- quick but also kind and warm and patient. Anyone who doesn't get why that is crucial hasn't spent 15 minutes within earshot of a coffee bar. GUYS. It's coffee. You drink it five times a day. GET YOUR ORDER DOWN. 

Everything in this place is so lovingly put together that you can't help but delight in it. It's the ideal mix of very cool and very chill. Being in here will make you feel like your life is full of people who are lovely and interesting and have outstanding taste. It's everything you want from a coffee shop. It's probably everything you want in life. 

Pro tip: The granola bowl is $6 and has maybe $7 worth of fruit in it. I don't know how they can be making money on that but get it with oat milk. Also, Avocado Toast is on point."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-12-08,5.0,"Their matcha latte is to die for! 

I'm not from NY but I will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in the area. I visited this cafe to get some work done and indulge in some caffeine to prepare for the long day, and what a good decision that was.

The atmosphere and decor of the place looks super cool and vintage, making it a pleasant experience to look at everytime you break away from your phone or laptop screen. It's calming and has great music ranging from jazz, to hip hop. Nothing too distracting, but perfect for studying.

Now the latte was amazing. I've been meaning to try matcha in my coffee as it's supposed to keep you from getting jittery, and I wasn't disappointed. Not only did I feel fully awake after drinking it, but it tasted great, and I didn't have any of the hyperness that comes with drinking coffee. I've also heard great things about their vietnamese coffee!

I would highly recommend you go try this place if you're in the area, its a cute spot to study at or to get some coffee!"
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-11-16,4.0,"Stopped by to grab a coffee and catch up with a friday last weekend. It's a good cozy spaced place with two seating areas, one in front of the coffee bar (more crowded) with several high tables and one in the back with couches. It was packed around noon and there was a long line and wait after ordering to get your drink. I ordered an iced soy latte and my friend ordered a hot latte with regular milk but they messed up and gave it as iced. I would definitely recommend coming here for a coffee fix and or wanting a place to do some work during their less busy hours. The only thing I disliked - their special milks is an expensive add on, extra $1 for a splash of soy milk."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-10-23,4.0,"This is my roomate's go-to stop for coffee, and it's pretty good. 

My main issue, as with most places in NYC, is that the seating fills up so quickly and that it's always quite stuffy in here. I'm not sure if they have air conditioning or if it just doesn't work well. Speaking of seating though- what's the deal with that weird stadium seating all the way in the back? It's not comfortable and not very functional- odd. 

Other then that; I love the interior, it's low-key, modern and trendy. It is fresh and yet still maintains a cozy feel to it. This is the type of place one wears a beanie to. 

I do wish they had glassware to cut down on the wastage of plastic and paper products for the times I choose to stay. 

The price is in line with other trendy coffee shops, so this I'm fine with. The coffee flavor I have always enjoyed and I always switch up my order here. 

I will continue to come back, and probably with my roomie.

We came at 9:30am on a weekday, this place is still quite popular, as most of the good seats were taken by this time. 
I ordered a flat white, and it was presented quickly, but the milk was all bubbly, like a third-rate coffee place. They used to do perfect lattes and flat whites, with silky smooth milk, and I assume this was an off-day."

Takes at least good walk to get here from one of the subway lines, a total downer.

But!! If you're in the area, need a quick coffee or even want to get some work done in the company of other chill visitors in a spacious venue with calm, relaxing jazz music etc, this is it! 

I only stop by when I'm in the area, which is rare. But FWIW, I think it's a cute spot that deserves some praise"

79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2018-10-12,5.0,"Really enjoyed stopping into Ludlow Coffee Supply. The counter area was really neat, like a true barista counter. My favorite part was they even had their own pumpkin spice coffee mix which truly got me into the fall spirit. 

The area where the milk and sugar was had a bit of a awkward layout, kind of bottlenecked people into it. During a rush hour, I imagine that isn't very efficient.

However, the rest of the layout was really cool and matches the vibe of the Ludlow Hotel. Lots of seating, like a more cozy well-decorated Starbucks lol.

Great spot for a pick-me-up :D"

79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2020-03-09,1.0,This place used to be too notch although it's rapidly going down hill. There is so many people on laptops in there it often feels like a WeWork. 90% of the staff are really sassy and act like they seriously don't want to be there.

79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-08-22,1.0,"Ludlow had become one of my favorite coffee shops just a few months ago for two reasons: the ambiance (usually a fair number of comfy seats available and all my favorite albums on vinyl), and the fact that they had really tasty coffee. I was willing to overlook that they don't offer ""for here"" mugs & glassware for their drinks and even that they don't serve decaf (don't negate my opinion after learning I'm a decaf drinker). Oh, and the massive fly orgy happening by the lids & straws telling me someone hasn't been cleaning up properly. I was willing to turn a blind eye to it all, until today.

As someone who works remotely, I'm always on the hunt for a café where I can work comfortably for hours without my toosh hurting (eff you, wooden chairs) or the Wi-Fi conking out. Well, Ludlow's Wi-Fi has been a pain in my ass for some time now, allowing me access to the internet in brief spurts and destroying my productivity. In order to properly troubleshoot, I asked the barista if other customers ever experience this issue. 

Now, let me clarify something: there's usually a bubbly blonde woman working who's always been nothing but courteous and hospitable when I'm there. But this woman wasn't that barista. This woman wouldn't even acknowledge me as I attempted to get her attention standing there at the counter. When I politely asked if others experienced the issue, she replied in a smarmy tone, ""No, I mean, obviously it works fine for everyone else"" nodding to the other customers who weren't ""imagining"" these things like I was. It was the kind of brief encounter that the person in need never knows how to bring to a close, so I wrapped up my inquiry with an uncomfortable chuckle and said, ""OK, I was just...wondering...it's been happening...okay...right...um..thanks."" She didn't so much as say, ""sorry"" in sympathy or offer a suggestion, she just stayed focused on her task at hand with her head down like I was invisible. I felt invisible. 

I even witnessed how she handled the next customers who walked in. ""When you're ready, guys,"" she said while again not even glancing in their direction. I swear, she should have been adorned with a diner waitress ensemble complete with pen, pad, loud Jersey gum-chewing and red lipstick on her teeth. She'd be perfect for it. 

It was only after I went back to my seat with my nearly $7 latte and a screen that STILL wouldn't load that I decided, ""Eff this, I'm leaving."" It sucks that a café I so quickly fell in love with made me fall out of love just as fast. Thankfully, I'm in NYC and will seek out somewhere that suits my coffee shop needs. 

And PS: The star is for the blonde barista who wouldn't have made me feel so inferior."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-08-19,2.0,"The barista here was slow as molasses and could not keep track of the orders. Coffee shops should put only their best, most experienced baristas on duty during the morning rush. The counter guy also gave me attitude when I ordered the pineapple danish. He said dryly, ""It's apricot."" Boy, I've been on this planet for 42 years, I know what pineapple looks like. I also know what it tastes it, and it was pineapple. Some people are allergic to pineapple (thankfully I am not), so you need to be careful with these things. I do not recommend this establishment."

It's super lowkey with chill vibes and indie music playing in the background. The people who come in here look pretty suave with their chic outfits so it's nice people watching too. I do have to comment that their chai latte is genuinely terrible with too much cinnamon, def unbalanced flavor profile that needs work so avoid and I'm saying this as a south asian chai snob who also is a food sensory scientist so my expectations are probably higher than normal. The 4 stars are for the ambiance rather than the drinks but I'll try something new next time."

Every time I come at brown haired girl's (I don't know her name) shift I feel like I'm asking for a favor not visiting a coffee shop. All baristas except her make espresso based drinks until 8pm. But she usually turns off an espresso machine at 7pm. Also every time I ask my coffee to be for here she makes it in a to go cup. When I ask her why it is so, she simply ignores any of my questions. I'm not an always complaining person, but I feel uncomfortable when someone treats me like that. I like ""Ludlow Coffee Supply"" and I just want it to be really nice and comfortable place for anyone"

In addition to a great cup of coffee and a nice aesthetic, it's one of the more sprawling rooms to get some work done in the back half of the coffee shop. Lots of chairs and private space so you're not right on top of the other guests, and with a great playlist to lose yourself to, it becomes a top place for caffeine and laptop time."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-06-13,1.0,"Possibly the WORST service I've ever had at a coffee place. I arrive to 2 staff behind the counter looking at there phones and not realising I'm standing in front them. Not friendly or interested whatsoever. 
Unfortunately they rely on the regulars and I won't be one of them."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-09-18,4.0,"Great hole in the wall coffee shop, perfect for getting some work done. 

The atmosphere is more on the quiet side, with some chill music playing in the background. There's low light, which I prefer, but that may put some to sleep. 

The barista was nice and the people were in their laptops or in books getting stuff done. 

The only part I wasn't fond of was the limited seating in the back, where the space feels way more homey."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-06-04,5.0,"Definitely another cool hipster coffee shop, with typical pastries but nonetheless very delicious and high quality. They offer various milk options (oat milk included of course) and every time I walk in they're busy with people but in the best way possible! The customers are always friendly and the employees return the joy. Very photogenic shop and they have cool big chairs in the back to take the best Instagram pic in!! Love the atmosphere, the coffee, the food and the aesthetic (:"

Avocado toast is pretty simple but goes great with my drinks in the morning. The baristas and the service is always so friendly whenever i walk in, so special shout out to the guy with blue hair for always being so nice and remembering my order!"
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-09-15,5.0,"Super good coffees. Iced oat milk latte is so good. Chill vibe. Pro-tip, they have wine. Never had the food.

79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-08-18,4.0,"This is a great spot especially if you appreciate cozy cafe vibes. I was in the area hanging out with a friend knowing that I would have dinner nearby later. I wanted a quiet spot to get a cup of coffee and found this place on Yelp. I ordered a cup of ice coffee and was able to grab a seat close to the back of the cafe. 

Though it has the cozy vibes I love, the cafe is a little small. It's a little dark and moody as well, but there is not a ton of seating. There are few tables and there are single-seater couches. This is a good spot to catch up with a small group of friends or to do very casual work / read a book by yourself. I also ordered a cup of iced coffee, which was delicious. I think generally this cafe is very simple with a simple menu. Besides the fact that there are few seats in Ludlow Coffee Supply, this is definitely a spot I would come back to in the future."

79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-11-25,1.0,"An update to why I'll officially never come back here again!
I gave in and came for a latte and to meet up with my friend to hang out. So while waiting to order the same rude employee with dark hair that gave me attitude last time hair dyed blue now I guess was literally facing us but his head buried in his phone texting. Then after probably almost a minute he notices us, takes our order but asks for cash when I said I was paying with card & said I didnt have any cash. Rude. The girl behind him made my drink and was very pleasant no complaints there. Latte tasted good and while I try to get some work done with my friend, a little while later we overhear that same employee arguing with an elderly gentlemen over a quad espresso or something! He literally was so sarcastic and speaking over the man and belittling him with his tone! He told the man hes worked for coffee shops for years, went back & forth with & basically belittled the man. Then when the man got his drink & left I overheard the same employee say he loves when old shaky white men try to tell him how to do his job! I couldn't believe his comment! Unbelievably rude! Literally the worst employee customer service Ive ever experienced and witnessed. I left shortly after because I just didn't even want to be in the same space as him anymore. I'm honestly baffled that man still works there. He needs to be fired. As my updated but final review of this place I will not be recommending this place to any of my friends flying into nyc or family during the holiday season. We will gladly spend our money elsewhere."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-04-27,4.0,"Came in to wait for our table at sweet chick next door, as they don't have waiting space. Found out there a huge living room like space area inside. Pretty cool with music (there's  a collection of LPs) couches, stools. It's a pretty cool hipster chill area. Coffee looked and smelled amazing. It was quite packed but really cool."
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2019-12-13,5.0,"This place is my home away from home. I've been a regular here since it opened several years ago. The coffee is always good, the baristas are friendly and very efficient (the line here can get insanely long in the morning) and the space is comfortable with multiple options - sofas in the inside room and work tables in the outside area. Can't recommend it enough even though that will probably make the lines longer"
79,ludlow-coffee-supply-new-york,2018-08-30,4.0,"This coffee shop was another godsend when I was staying in Manhattan last month. There's an abundance of really good coffee (or should I say cawfee.) shops in the LES; I dare say this is the one the best ones I've been too. 

Ludlow Coffee Supply is located on Ludlow Street in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It's right next to Sweet Chick and across the street from the famous Katz's Delicatessen. 

Lucky for me, I was staying only a few steps away from this cute coffee shop. I was able to go each morning to get my daily dose of caffeine. The shop is small with only a few tables and window seats. There's a bench outside the front entrance also. Unfortunately if you don't get there early in the morning, you'll probably have to get your cup to go because all the seats will be filled up. Fortunately, I found that I could go sit at the Ludlow Hotel lounge area to slowly sip my coffee. (The Ludlow Hotel is only two steps away.) When I was there, the barber shop in the back was being renovated so there might be more space to sit if that area is done. They don't have a lot of pastries or eats, but they do have a few croissants."

80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2020-03-10,5.0,"I had dinner at Corkbuzz across the street and was in the mood for something sweet after.  I saw that there was a great check-in deal on Yelp, so I went over.

There are two other chocolate shops in close proximity (Max Brenner and the Nutella cafe), but I like the grown-up, coffee-shop feel of Blue Stripes. I love dark chocolate and was happy to reach my purchase minimum for the check-in deal with a small bar of dark chocolate and a dark chocolate croissant. The croissant was absolutely decadent and the bar was high-quality.

Nothing beat the hot chocolate, though--free with check-in and a small purchase! This was a rich treat for a cold evening. Highly recommended."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2020-03-09,5.0,"Thks place is amazing!  The free samples they offer is worth the 5 stars alone. I love chocolate so I might be a little bias, but I haven't had chocolate like this before. They use a wide variety of different kinds of chocolate in the picture I attached. I'm the kind of person that enjoys this the most because one single kind of chocolate doesn't do it for me. 

The staff was very friendly and understanding when we said we want we want what's pictured exactly as is. It's very instagramable if you want more food pictures on your Insta or any other social media. I think it's worth checking out as they have a large menu. I will definitely be going back in the near future!"
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2020-02-25,5.0,"Yummy mochas! And the best part is choosing your own chocolate, from white to dark, how fun is that?! 

I do wish I would've known they line the edge of the cup with chocolate, I made a bit of a mess. But overall it was great and worth it."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2020-02-11,4.0,"Went here to check out the spot and grab dessert on a week night. Though it was around 9pm, the place was totally packed. 

After ordering a chocolate cake and hot chocolate, I was able to snag a seat as someone was leaving. The chocolate cake was decent--not too rich, but had good flavor and the hot chocolate was very tasty and a nice touch to be able to choose which type of chocolate and also dip the rim.

Overall, a decent dessert spot and with a Yelp check-in, the hot chocolate is on the house!"
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2020-01-18,4.0,"Blue Stripes is a coffee shop and bakery type place, and while the hard seats aren't totally welcoming, I get it, because it's a high-traffic area. 

I had the chocolate cloud with molten milk. It was cold, which I wasn't expecting, but really good. My friend liked her mocha, too. The chocolate infused Nutella croissant was also amazing - I definitely recommend that."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2020-02-02,3.0,"Apparently, Jan 31 was Chocolate Day.  Naturally, I joined a food crawl on Feb 1 where we were able to taste some of the best chocolate shops in NYC.   This was the second stop.  

I was pondering rather ​get a brownie or hot chocolate.  Since it was the earliest stop, I ended up getting a small one for $1.75.   

I love to bake.  However, I'm lazy to start from scratch.  Typically, I buy box ones.  My favorite brand is Ghirardelli​.  This brownie reminds me of it.   It's moist and sweet but it's not too sweet.   The outside has a light dusting of cocoa powder.   

I love how cute the establishment is though."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2019-12-20,5.0,"All I have to say is: chocolate rimmed mocha lattes. If you're a coffee addict and looking for a sweet treat, visit Blue Stripes. I love their concept - exposing the beauty and possibilities of the cacao ingredient. While I had to say no this time to their infinite array of chocolate inspired pastries, I did have a dark chocolate rimmed mocha. It was the hardest thing to not gulp this indulgent drink down in seconds. I licked every last bit of that chocolate on the cup and could easily have had mugfuls

The actual space is warm, cozy, and large for NYC standards. Ample space to socialize or come ready for laptop work. A good amount of outlets and fast internet. It does get really busy (I was there from
3-5pm on a random but cold Wednesday and it was packed the majority of the afternoon). 

Please go try this and let it quickly become a favorite coffee shop in NYC."

The picture perfect multi window panes store front whisks you into a bed time story shangra la with high quality hot chocolates being its raison d'etre.     

But that's not all, a wide array of pastries glow like rich gems,  and if you eat in, they drizzle anything with chocolate or caramel.   

Willy Wonka meets Watership down tea time.   The secrets out and cute college women dominate the scene.    


I went for a cup for dark chocolate hot cocoa, $5.  
The creamy delight ran down my body like liquid gold as I careened into the downtown dark alley ways like a new found super hero.  


They also offer a non processed hot cocoa with no sugar for the super healthy.    Be warned - it's super bitter. 

Want to be dancing with sugar plums while you wait at the bedroom window for Peter Pan magic?  Come here.  No doubt."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2019-12-01,3.0,"On a dreadfully chilly and wet winter night, my friend and I stopped by Blue Stripes Cacao to dry off under the warm lights with a hot cup of cocoa. This place came highly recommended by several of our friends and we were delighted that we could sit and enjoy our treats at one of the many small tables. 

Blue Stripes offers a free hot chocolate with a Yelp check in! Our milk hot chocolate came in a paper cup, and was surprisingly watery. It was rich, but not creamy or thick enough for me. I was expecting something similar to Max Brenner's hot chocolate, but Blue Stripes reminds me of Swiss Miss hot chocolate that's been foamed. However, their other chocolate drinks offer a more creative spin on the traditional hot chocolate.

Hot chocolate is best enjoyed with pastries, so we also got the donut holes with milk chocolate fondue and the cinnamon bun. The fondue was sinfully sweet and creamy, but the donut holes tasted stale. I liked the cinnamon bun more, and found myself dipping chunks of it into the big pot of fondue. 

Blue Stripes is certainly a charming stop for pastries and hot chocolate but by no means the best hot chocolate spot in town."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2019-11-12,5.0,"Oh my chocolate, chocolate, chocolate lovers the deliciousness is realllll! If you are a fan of Max Brenner, than you will love this other creation that he has put his love of cacao and talent into. This shop is a lot smaller and feels more like a casual meet up for a quick coffee, & dessert spot but they truly do not skimp on the real chocolate yummers 

You will find a lot of college students or advertising folks typing away and designing on their computers while partaking, or rather indulging in hot chocolate, coffee, &/or cake. 

We stopped in to try the cake and shake omg is does not let you down. It is absolutely d-e-l-I-s-h!!! We had the hazelnut shake with cake please, try it  it is completely shareable every sip is indulging every bite calls for closing your eyes. We also received a free hazelnut hot chocolate for simply checking in. We  shared it, you will definitely taste the love in each chocolate craft or each sip. 

Go get some chocolate love! 

The staff is phenomenal & very knowledgeable. 
Service is quick and efficient. 

The vibe is very chill and cafe style."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2019-11-12,4.0,"Blue Stripes Cacao Shop is a hidden gem!

I visited earlier this week for coffee and breakfast with a friend and enjoyed this small shop that welcomes you with an enticing chocolate smell! 

They have a great variety of chocolate and savory items! I opted for drip coffee that was flavorful and strong. If it's your first visit be sure to check in on Yelp for a free cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate!

For food, I opted for a healthy option, oatmeal with fresh and dried fruit, almond butter and maple syrup as a sweetener. Yum!! Not only was the food and coffee good, but the atmosphere was comfortable and great for hanging out. 

I loved the back wall that had a full wall of books! This cozy shop is a great place to check out if you love chocolate, coffee and breakfast. I plan to go back when I'm in the area! Next time I'd love to try one of their pretzel roll breakfast sandwiches or a pastry."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2019-10-08,3.0,"Friday early afternoon, fairly packed inside with people on laptops finishing up breakfast. Menu is listed overhead behind the counter, while most of the food is displayed behind the glass.

Wasn't looking for anything substantial, so decided on the Nutella Foam Cloud ($8.50) and a Butter Croissant ($3?). After a few minutes, got my order and got the last remaining table towards the back. Have to say, I was disappointed in my drink. The cloud tastes like a watered down version of a milkshake. It's supposed to be light and airy, which it is, but the flavor doesn't come through as well as it should. Wish I had gone with one of the cake+shakes instead. Croissant is your standard fare; you can get a drizzle on it if you like, though that would have been overkill.

Service here is efficient, as no one seems to wait that long. I think I got the wrong thing here, might try their shakes if coming back."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2019-08-24,5.0,"Love the decor and ambiance at Blue Stripes! Decent place to work as they have plenty of power outlets throughout and free complimentary wifi. Store is small, but definitely spacious and has an industrial-eque feel to it. Ordered an iced latte while doing work here. Latte was great, great ratio between milk and coffee. Love the blue cups that your drinks come in, its really pretty. 

Heard the chocolate here was incredible. There are also dessert options that looked really pretty, and also they serve food here. 

Also love how this place closes really late ~11pm on a Saturday, which is fantastic if you want to get some work done late night but couldnt bother going to a library or such. 

Cool place to have a coffee date too. Would come back here again!"
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2020-02-08,4.0,"Came here on a Saturday late morning during brunch hours. Wasn't super crowded, but there was just one more open table for us to snag while one of us ordered. Decided to get a Power bowl as our meal and a dark hot chocolate with oat milk as a drink. I say it's a bit pricey for what it is, but I'd like to say I paid for a nice atmosphere and high quality food. The power bowl was pretty tasty and was seasoned well although I wish it were bigger. The dark hot chocolate was super rich and not as sweet as your typical hot chocolate. Would definitely recommend as a brunch spot or a place to read or do work! (They have a separate table area with plugs for people using their laptops, which is actually great!)"
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2019-09-15,5.0,"It was a sunny and yet cool Sunday afternoon. I didn't want to go home right after my errands so I wandered about and my mind wandered to coffee, then it wandered to dessert, and I found a location somewhere on 15th street. It wasn't for me but then my eyes fell upon the little Blue Stripes shop. To my delight it was filled with chocolate. It reminded me of Max Brenner but more low-key, and it is in fact created by the same man, though he no longer owns MB. 

I took a long look at the menu and was happy they had savory healthy food options. I ordered the Egg Jar which was on the slightly bizarre end for me but delicious nonetheless. Quite a popular place, seating took a bit of shifting before I found a table for myself. Other than that, my experience was fabulous. 

- The jar comes served with plentiful of spinach and mushroom with an almost hard egg yolk atop, alongside a large pretzel. 

- The cherry on top is that yelp check-in offered a hot beverage with any purchase to my absolute delight! I got to taste their decadent dark hot chocolate - exactly what I needed at the moment. 

Ideal to come along or with a friend of any kind."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2019-10-15,5.0,"I will definitely come back here! I was craving for something sweet and a friend recommended this. Rather than chewing on something sweet, I decided to order their (dark) hot chocolate and it was velvety smooth happiness! My s/o and friend ordered their iced tea drink and it was good as well. I forgot specifically what the name of that drink was. There are pastries and more chocolates here as well. 

The place has good amount of seats. The staff are so pleasant. Parking can be tough because of the area. Overall I will definitely come back to try more things in their menu."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2019-07-07,5.0,"The only words I needed to hear, ""This place is owned by the Max Brenner guy."" A visit was imminent. I love MB, it's a staple for any birthday celebration in my immediate family. Even the lone non-chocolate lover (weirdo) in our bunch is excited to go.

I've been to Blue Stripes twice already. The sticker shock at the register quickly fades once you take a sip of your drink or a bite of your dessert. The cake & shake that comes in the mason jar is almost $20 alone, but we get it every time and will again. It's so decadent without crossing the line into a tummy ache.

The Nutella stuffed croissant is another must try. We haven't had another croissant like this. Other places have what is the equivalent of chocolate chips in their ""stuffed"" croissants, but not here. It's like 45% warm fulling and 55% delicious flaky bread. It's messy and delightful.

I had the new Turtle Kreamz. I went with the swirl option of both vanilla and chocolate, inside a black cone (vanilla flavor) that was dipped in chocolate. More chocolate over the ice cream itself, and I chose the pearls to go on top (there were 2 other options). It comes in paper tray they lay the ice cream on since it may take a while to eat. Lol. It was huge, tasty and had me stuffed for a few hours at least. I'm not sure if it's a summer thing, but give it a try.

If there is a better chocolate dessert place out there, I don't even care to know about it. It's going to be a long time before I'm ready to move on from here."
80,blue-stripes-cacao-shop-new-york,2019-07-24,5.0,"If your looking for the best chocolate spot in NYC this is the spot so look no further. I came with my bf and we shared everything. We had their Black Forest milk shake with the cake. Omg the shake is divine, every sip is rich and smooth and delicious because they used high quality chocolate and you can taste it.
We also had their chocolate moose dessert and boy was it light and fluffy it tasted like your eating chocolate cloud. Of course it comes with a side of more chocolate so you can drizzle on top of it :)
We also ordered their cocoa ginger smoothie and it's literally so refreshing and delicious. I drank the whole smoothie myself because it's just that delicious.
Love the environment and the staff here is super friendly so it's a spot you must check out trust me."

High quality rich chocolate bites & drinks is what you will find at this uniquely designed cafe near Union Sq in Manhattan. Their black forrest cake & shake is insane, such a smooth drink. I recommend sharing this, it is very filling. 

Their chocolate desserts are incredible, they understand how to layer textures and blend flavors well. To end the meal, I had their cacao juice with ginger and coconut to cleanse some of the rich chocolate from my palate. It is is honestly one the coolest places to hang out, highly recommended"

If you're looking for an Instagram worthy latte, this is your spot! The milk is in an adorable beaker and the coffee is in a tiny bottle. (Go with the oat milk) 
You know a spot is legit when they give you sparkling water to wash down your coffee! 
The guys behind the bar are also super friendly!"
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-04-02,5.0,"They roast their own coffee beans. One location. Unassuming.  Thought it would be on street level, but had to ask the security guard who directed me to go down a set of stairs and turn left. It's actually located underground along a path to the subway. Opened now for 3 years, it's popular amongst Yelpers.  Locals' favorites: Sliced Egg Toast and Avocado Toast ($6/$9.50 for 1 or 2 slices). The slice is thick. I got the Yoghurt-Granola- Mixed Berries for my post workout treat. They have 3 choices for brewed coffee: French Press (dark roast), Colombian (medium roast), and I forget the name of the light roast. He let me try all 3 in separate glass cups. He was patient. Then I inquired about their expressions--also 3 to choose from: 1. Guatemalan, 2. Columbian, and 3. French.  I am sipping the Guatemalan americano and it has chocolate undertones. Yummy!  

I did try the samples they had out this morning by the register: 1. Peanut Butter Arugula Toast and 2. Sliced Egg Toast. Enjoyed them both.m, but the Egg one was my fav between the two. 

Good stream of people coming through mid-morning. There is a hideout small lounge area good for 6 people. I saw an outlet there as well. Free WiFi.

They do not rush. They bring the food to you."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-05-04,5.0,"You would never know this was here unless it was through friends, family, coworkers, or just passing by. It is definitely a hidden gem.

Location/Enviroment
When you get off the subway 2,3,A,C it is in the direction toward John Street at the very end. It can be hard to find if you are not going out in that direction. The place is small and it is not a place to really dine in with a group. It's more for a quick bite or a to go order for lunch. There is very little seating but you can sit there and eat if you prefer too.

Food:
The food is definitely delicious. It is all homemade and made to order. You watch them make it and it is simple stuff. I usually get the tuna sandwich because it is just a great amount of tuna and the bread is nicely toasted. It is great they do an open face sandwich because it keeps the bread getting soggy. You can put the bread together if you wanted, it is a personal preference. If you ever just want to try their food they do have samples out every day. There coffee is a pretty reasonable price for where they are located.

Overall
They are one of my favorite locations to go to at the moment. They are generous since they do help those in need. They also are inviting since they tend to remember you after your first encounter with them. They do give special offers which is great from my budget and they are pretty quick."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-07-20,4.0,"Dropped by Voyager Espresso when I had some time to kill and got to try some pretty good coffee~ First off, there is a lot of intrigue about this place because it is a bit difficult to find -- you have to go through a door off of the lobby of a building and this place is basically nestled within part of the subway! Super cool to be honest, but a bit confusing if you don't know where to go. The presentation of drinks in Erlenmeyer flasks is another interesting part of the experience at Voyager and it certainly adds to the appeal of the place. The coffee I had was good, well balanced and too tart. Service was super warm and friendly so I'd definitely drop by again if I was in the area!"
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-08-26,5.0,"If you can't find it: it's on subway level below ground, you can enter through business center lobby.

Very fun, tasty, and def recommended."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-08-20,5.0,"As previous reviewers have mentioned, this location is sort of a hidden gem find as it is nestled in the hallway of one of the entrances of the Fulton station. I ordered a chai latte from this cafe and really enjoyed it! It was super creamy and flavorful. 5 stars are given especially because of the service. The barista who made my latte was incredibly nice. They ran out of 2% milk so he offered to make it with oat milk and sprinkled cinnamon on top."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-01-28,5.0,"Voyager Espresso is one the best hidden gems of the city! Nestled in the subway walkway in the Fulton Street station is this amazingly cute cafe! I have gone here twice and both times ordered the Nutella Banana toast which is so yummy and a steal at only $6.50 as well as a cappuccino. You also can choose which coffee roast you'd like your coffee prepared with which is nice. 

The only downsides are that the cafe is only open until 5pm on weekdays and closed on weekends because it's in the subway atrium and there also is no bathroom. But for people who work in the area, it is a fantastic place to grab a quick coffee and breakfast/lunch to go."

Was in the area eating brunch and we wanted to get some coffee afterward.  We found this place on yelp.  Had good reviews so wanted give them a try.  

As we entered we noticed the sign for buy one get one free coffee drinks, we were already sold.  We ordered the mochaccino hot and ice latte.  Both drinks pretty good, not the best we've ever had, but solid nonetheless.  They serve their dine in drinks with a side of sparkling water, which is always a nice touch in my opinion.  As we were ordering our drinks we also noticed that they had free food samples at the counter including pieces of avocado toast.  What other coffee/café gives out free samples of avocado toast and buy one get one free?  Plus they posted their Wi-Fi password so you can easily login without having to bother the Barista.

Because of their customer service, I will definitely come back. Sally their buy one get one free deal ends in January, but I'll try to head back before then."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-05-28,5.0,"Excellent coffee and presentation, the owner is very helpful with suggesting different roasts.

The food here is good value too, I'd recommend a full sandwich or a salad/sandwich combo."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-09-05,5.0,"What a great find!  Enter 110 Williams, go through the subway doors, down the stairs and through the white doors, then turn left and it's on your left.
The espresso was delicious, and we were given a choice of bean profile!
I had an oat milk latte, and the hubs had a flat white.
Great little nook to hang out and drink.  I wish I could have ordered so much more.  The soup sounded particularly good.
The staff was very friendly, and obviously passionate about good coffee."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-11-08,3.0,"Coffee too strong, too hip, can't handle. Others more bold than me perhaps can. I just want something hot and sweet and vanilla. I'm talking about a latte of course. Great customer service but not a place for me."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2018-08-10,5.0,"I'm in my happy place right now. Voyager coffee allows you to complete escape from the hustle and bustle of the financial district... in the least expected place of all. At the Fulton St subway station! 

It's basically a sauna in NYC right now (mid August) so I opted for an iced coffee. The barista even gave me a free coffee tasting so I could choose! I tried the Barundi, Colombian, and the dark roast. They were all sooo good but I personally liked Colombian the best.

I'm a big fan of the presentation here. The metal straw, mini water cup, coffee beaker, the tray... I love it all. They even make their own almond, macadamia nut, and date milk. Soooo good. Definitely try this. 

Overall, amazing coffee, service, interior, and presentation. Can't wait to be back many many more times :)"
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-05-20,5.0,"First, it was located inside a hotel/office front building. Go inside, turn right to go through two glass doors down to the subway. Down the stairs, turn left and you'll see the shop a few feet down on the left. 

Second, the iced latte was deconstructed (make your own) and the avocado toast was large and with a lot of avocado. It was $5 for the latte and $9 for two full avocado roasts in the pic. $20 total, easily a great price. 

A fantastic way to start the day and a hidden gem for sure."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-02-11,5.0,"I just got a new job in the city hall area and I was looking for a new coffee shop to prepare for my day. I found voyager coffee online and decided to check it out. The location, tucked away in a subway station, was a little tricky to find but felt extremely cozy once I settled in. 
I ordered a coffee to go and an espresso to stay. They offered both light and medium roast and I opted for the light. Their customer service in explaining the difference was awesome.
Their espresso has complex flavor notes that show their attention to detail as they must have dialed in recently. They also offered sparkling water to accompany the drink which was appreciated greatly. I will be returning here soon."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2020-01-16,5.0,"I have worked across the street from here for a year, but it was so hidden I never knew it existed! Cool place. Nice barista. Great coffee."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2018-11-16,5.0,"Without yelp I wouldn't have been able to find this hidden gem! Absolutely amazing customer service and delicious coffee! 

This place is kind of hidden underground in a subway station so just follow the directions on their website! I ended up getting the iced latte in an Erlenmeyer flask and honestly it was one of the best lattes I've ever had! I also loved that they served every coffee with some sparkling water on the side. The owner was also extremely kind and gave us samples of some baked goods they had on sale. Amazing coffee and great service! Will definitely be back next time I visit New York!"
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2018-07-02,4.0,"I tried their latte because the cup looks just cool and it'll be fun to make my own latte. I chose light roast, but it was very mild and watery (NOT in the bad way). If I chose regular milk, the espresso may taste stronger, but I also chose their house made specialty milk (almond macardamia date milk) which does not have strong milky nor nutty taste (I thought it would). So the latte turned out to be a little plain, however, I still liked it. 

The owner (I guess?) is a very nice guy. He gave me two bottles of light roast because he told me for latte one light roast may not have much flavor. He let me try their house made specialty milk and the portion of the sample was generous. He even didn't ask for compensation when a guy broke the glass by accident. He just said it's okay and cleaned up the glasses.

I had a little chat with him. They are specialized in the light roast. Their coffee beans are seasonal and sourced from all over the world. Their specialty milk is made every day fresh without adding any sugar. The mild sweetness is from the dates, so very healthy. Just drinking the milk makes me feel refreshing.

The location is kinda tricky. It's INSIDE the subway station, so it's definitely the most quite coffee shop I can find in FiDi. Their seating is friendly, too, meaning they have hangers underneath the table so you can hang your bag. They also have free wifi and power outlets if you want to work or study."
81,voyager-espresso-new-york,2019-08-20,5.0,Their Mediterranean sandwich is to die for! It was SO GOOD. It's a little hidden and you would not see unless you were already in the Fulton Street subway station. They have a small counter that can seat up to 2 people.
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2020-06-02,5.0,"Ordered some coffee cake and a pound of rainbow cookies for delivery. Can confirm that Cafe Belle makes the best rainbow cookies in NYC. Coffee cake was also excellent - so fluffy. 

Next time: I want to try the cannoli!"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2019-10-24,5.0,"I'm writing this review as I'm still sitting here in this cafe, because this is how much I love it!

Cafe Belle is a quaint little Italian cafe that serves authentic, homemade Italian pastries and coffee. It seems like an under-the-radar cafe, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the adjoining neighborhoods. There aren't too many seats inside, but the cafe compensates for that with free wifi, a clean restroom, friendly service, and its adorable floral decor.

Over the span of the hours I spent here, I ordered a Spinach and Feta turnover, a large drip coffee, and a raspberry rugelach. The turnover was buttery, flaky, delicious, with the perfect filling to pastry ratio. The rugelach was one of the best I've ever had. The raspberry filling definitively tasted of real raspberries, making me believe their claim that they shy away from using artificial ingredients. It was sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, but not sickeningly so. 

My coffee was eye-openingly strong and the perfect pick-me-up my afternoon needed.

I selfishly want Cafe Belle to be my best kept secret and to shelter it from the traffic of the city, but I believe that everyone should have the chance to sample a taste of Naples. 

I'll be back soon for more pastries!"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2020-03-07,5.0,"Cute little coffee shop. I ordered a latte with coconut and hazelnut syrup. They have alternative milk options, I got my latte with oat milk. Then, I got a brown sugar chocolate chip cookie dipped in chocolate. It was delicious! I like to dip my sweets in my coffee sometimes, so these items complimented each other great."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2020-05-29,5.0,"Cafe Belle is a place I go out of my way to stop by whenever I am in Little Italy with friends. It is worth the walk up Mulberry for their delicious Italian bakery cookies. I have sat and enjoyed a coffee and some cookies with my boyfriend there on a few chilly evenings and I just love visiting!  Everyone who helps me out is always very sweet, helpful, and patient. I love the interior design decor. Also love that this is woman owned and operated! They often stock shirts and mugs that are Italian pop-culture themed and it makes them unique and stand out to me. I feel like the owner brings the younger generation in with her branding and the older generation in with her baking. Schedule your visit for a seasonal rainbow cookie ice cream sandwich, you won't regret it."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-09-09,4.0,"The owner reached out to me personally to acknowledge my previous review and address the less-than-great service we experienced. 

As I'm sure all my fellow Yelpers can appreciate -- sometimes when you post an honest review, you get berated by ruffled owners and managers, who are more concerned about their Yelp stars than about their actual customers. The way she approached it was so professional and very much appreciated. 

Will definitely go back because - as I said before - one of the BEST CANNOLIS I've ever had in NYC!!"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2019-08-14,5.0,"Such a cute cafe, with old school vibes. You'll only notice this place either if you're strolling around the REI area, or are seeking a place to grab drinks. Definitely an underrated spot to meet up with friends or someone for a casual conversation, and I love how it's not an Instagram spot influencers go to for the gram. I ordered an iced latte and my friend ordered an iced tea, and just sat down to talk. The woman making our drink was super nice and didn't try to up sell any of the pastries. Although the cafe is small, it seats a good amount of people and I loved how we weren't rushed to leave or pay until we were done conversing. Even though we only bought drinks, I'll be back to try the 7 layer ice cream sandwich as that seems like what Cafè Belle is notorious for."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2020-02-19,5.0,Tiny coffee and pastry shop and every item is simply delicious. Mostly Italian style pastries. Some of them are really though to bake but they have done a fantastic shop. I highly recommend the sfogliatelle!
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2020-02-17,5.0,"I've been looking for an authentic Italian bakery for a long time. This bakery is a female owned location, and is AMAZING! The service is always impeccable and the staff is beautiful inside and out. I'm looking forward to the summer when I can enjoy my scone and coffee outside on the amazing belle block! I'd recommend to anyone"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2019-06-26,5.0,"Super cute coffee shop and bakery. I ordered a cappuccino and an apricot madeline to have in the cafe, both were excellent. Cafe Bella has the classic assortment of Italian bakery fare-- cannoli, rainbow cookies, sprinkle cookies, etc-- along with cold beverages. The aesthetic in here, combined with the plentiful wall outlets with USB plug-ins makes for a great place to do some work while you enjoy your coffee. I"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-04-08,3.0,"Me and my friend went here to grab coffee after dinner around 9.30 pm. I was surprised they were still open it's a quite cozy little coffee shop with many European sweets like cakes and cookies. 

I got a latte and my friend got a cookie and cappuccino. The latte was weak and the cappuccino was also a latte basically had no foam. But my friend enjoyed the cookie. 

So don't come here for amazing coffee but the sweets and grandma decor."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-05-08,5.0,"Such an adorable little cafe, very reminiscent to a Paris style shop. Plenty of pastry selections paired with very kind and attentive staff. However, my purpose for the visit on this warm spring day was to try their famous Rainbow Cookie Ice cream sandwich. It is so pretty and it did not disappoint. I was going to share but opted for my own although, it is shareable lol. 

The price point is about $6.50 per slice 
Very clean shop
Cozy for coffee date, or chat time with a friend, or two 
Friendly staff 
Plenty of selections"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2020-02-02,5.0,"I love this sweet little place.  Everything is always fresh and delicious, and I love to sit there after church at Old Saint Patrick's and get a little work done with a piping hot latte.  The girl who works the counter on Sundays is a gem!"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2019-04-23,3.0,Someone told me to find Lobster tail pastries and rainbow cookies and was happy to get both here. I also tried their napoleon but found the napoleon to be old and soggy...The crust was not flaky whatsoever and really gross to eat. That was probably the most disappointing selection during my visit. The other reason for the 3 stars is for the customer service of the woman behind the counter. I had my friend order pastries while I asked to use the restroom and the lady didn't believe me that I was going to buy something since the bathroom is for customers only. Rude AF. I wouldn't bother come back to this cafe as there are numerous others that provide better customer service and sweets.
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2019-03-21,5.0,didn't like what I ordered because I am picking but they have so many lovely pastries to choose from. Cute place with great prices!
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-09-29,4.0,"Believe in the hype for their rainbow cookies. First and foremost, although I'm sure that their rainbow ice cream cake is A1, it is HUGE. And no, that is not a bad thing at all. Just be wary if you're by yourself and ordering it- I had to pass on it because I felt too guilty (first time for everything). I opted for the rainbow cookie cannoli and some rainbow cookies to take home. The cannoli was a 3/5. I get the concept but the filling was just off. Real rainbow cookies should never have that minty aftertaste that store-bought generic rainbow cookies have. Now the rainbow cookies I took home? I think heavenly might be an understatement. At $18/pound they're not cheap but I've eaten one too many rainbow cookies to know that the going rate for authentic rainbow cookies is $5/4 oz so it was in the ballpark range. Cannoli aside, the rainbow cookies are a 5/5. I can't wait to try the rainbow ice cream cake here when I find someone willing to share it with me (or will give in and have it by myself)."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-11-15,5.0,"Love this place! Really cute, hip coffee shop with Italian sweets. Small but there are seats available. After a long day in the nyc snow, I tried the hot chocolate which was incredibly rich and delicious! I also tried a piece of the rainbow cake which was excellent as well! Will definitely be back!!"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-02-17,4.0,After a late night dinner we stopped by so for coffee we just happened to walk up on this place the girl behind the counter was very friendly and polite we ordered some lattes and pastries everything was delicious the girl was even nice enough to warm some of pastries up
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2019-01-01,5.0,"I really enjoy this cafe. It's rarely crowded and the atmosphere is relaxing. 

A lot of the other coffee shops in the neighborhood are packed with tourists and lack simplicity. 

Cafe Belle is simple and tasteful. I hope it's around for a while."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2017-11-26,5.0,Stopped by to get some rainbow cookies and it was delicious! Bought 6 pieces for about $7. A bit pricey but worth it. The cafe's decor is really cute also.
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-10-10,4.0,"I was looking for a pastry shop that was close to the library and luckily this place was right across the street! I was drawn in with the interior of this place, cute and quaint! Then realizing they had Italian cookies, I got super excited. I am pretty picky about them since I lived next to an Italian bakery for the majority of my life. $1.25 per cookie, seems a little expensive, but was definitely worth it at that moment. Super fresh, yummy, and satisfying! I also got an iced green tea which was so delicious I bought another one before leaving. Def a lot pricier for their cookies, but the quality worth it. 4 Stars because my heart longs for home!"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2019-01-17,5.0,"I am a NYC union ironworker who has been working in all different neighborhoods for the past 20 years. I have had coffee and pastries from all over the city. This place is truly amazing. I come from Italian roots. My mother and my grandmother made cookies and pastries like no one else. Cafe Belle is like going back home for me. I am so grateful that I am working around the block from here. I will truly miss this place when the job I am on is done...BUT...this is one place I will definitely make trips back to. It is clean, it is chic, and it is super cool. The staff and owner are super sweet as are the cookies and pastries. The coffee is awesome as well. A must for anyone who wants to try some good Italian treats!!!"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2019-04-19,5.0,The BEST pastries I've ever had !! Such a cute place too beautifully decorated. Their rainbow cookies are to die for. My favorite from all bakeries I've ever been to.
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-12-22,5.0,"Found this place through Foods of NY food tour and my husband and I went back twice after the tour during our trip to the City.  Everything we had was great, but the rainbow cake mini cannoli style is heavenly- soooo freaking good- I'm still mad I didn't get more for the road."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-04-06,3.0,"I had to fill my sweet tooth, so I ducked into this spot with high expectations. The interior does give off a French vibe with a new twist, but there is something off about it that doesn't really hit home. The refrigerator had this loud droning tone to it which I digged, because I'm into noise and avant guard music. The cashier was trying to play some Hip hop to mask the sound, however, there was no getting around that deep ass hum. 

I ended up having a cheese cake topped with chocolate. The topping is not a sufficient shortcut to or replacement for actual chocolate cheese cake. The cake would've been fine alone, and I wouldn't have judged so hard, but the topping killed it for me. It was an average tiny pastry, but nothing out of this world.

The Hip hop's inability to mask the loud fridge mirrored the chocolate's inability to provide any amelioration to the average cheesecake. 

I would listen to Hip hop purposefully cut with drone signals and eat chocolate cheese cake any day. :)"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2019-02-03,5.0,"This is a cute little bakery in lower Manhattan with lots of great options. I loved the decor at this place and the staff was friendly. Nice quiet cafe, perfect place to catch up with friends or get some work done and a treat for motivation. The cannoli cake is extremely popular here (according to the employees). I loved it! It was tasty and not to sweet"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-01-14,4.0,"Bookmarked this place cos foodbaby raved abt their rainbow cakes/cookies. So i came on a friday night w my gfs for some tea and desserts after dinner. Its a pretty small cafe w abt four 2 seaters table and a bar stool table at the window.

We ordered the chocolate eclair, carrot cake and rainbow cookies to try. I didnt have the chocolate eclair but my gf did enjoy it. The carrot cake was a tad bit too sweet for me but was moist and frosting was good. I even tasted small pcs of minced carrots. I enjoyed the rainbow cookies, it is one of the better ones i've had. The jam is smooth and flavorful. Most places ive tried were kind of thick and too tarty.

This is a good spot to catch up w ur friends over desserts and drinks. We stood there for a few hrs until closing time and had a great time."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2017-10-19,3.0,"I saw the 5 stars and immediately knew I wanted to try this place. There were so many options so I decided to splurge a little and got 4 things; pecan tart, apple tart, carrot cake, and a chocolate mousse type cake thing.  I was super excited to try all of them, but was left feeling super underwhelmed :/ I think more so because I had high expectations coming into it from the 5 stars, but I thought the carrot cake was kind of dry and everything else was just kind of meh. Maybe I did myself a disservice by not ordering the rainbow cake, but oh wellssss."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-10-31,5.0,"I love this place!  By far the best Italian cafe downtown!  All the pastries are made fresh daily and there is a very good assortment of cakes, cookies, and delectables.  My favorite is the rainbow cookie!  I support this local business and their attention to good customer service and homemade yummy desserts.  5 stars all the way!"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-03-11,5.0,"This place is like an amusement park for your taste buds. I've had the Napoleon, San Giuseppe, (deluxe?) rainbow cookie, and almond cornetto. If you're bored of custard, the middle-two items come canoli-filled, which I think is ricotta. A cornetto is like a croissant but softer and less flaky. Their chai tea is on the sweet side and comparable to most places that serve chai. I stopped drinking coffee but I sat close enough to the device that dispenses theirs and holy moly it smells amazing. $5 card minimum, if I remember correctly they charge you a fee if you're under."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2017-10-20,5.0,"After living in Little Italy for 19 years, I finally found my favorite Italian bake shop. Unlike other bakeries within the vicinity, Cafe Belle serves you FRESH, FLAVORFUL, and AFFORDABLE treats. They have so many different options to choose from and also serve coffee. 

It's a cute and small shop, with seatings indoors and some outdoors. The service is ALWAYS PHENOMENAL and the staff are always smiling. 

They even fill the cannoli fresh UNLIKE other bakeries."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2017-05-20,5.0,"I was feeling sick and needed bread to calm my stomach. All they had was pastries, but I told the staff my predicament and they found something in the back that they'd made while experimenting. It was just a plain roll with salt on it, and it made me feel better. The staff chatted with me and was very friendly and understanding, great customer service."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2017-06-30,5.0,Very friendly staff and good coffee! Not to mentions that omg smells AMAZING!!! (They said they are baking croissants) I didn't get to try their baked stuff but looked so good! The decor is super cute too.
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2019-04-12,5.0,Excellent. Anytime I needed to feed my sweet tooth and needed a caffeine boost. The rainbow pastries are the best I've had. Keep it up.
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2017-06-18,5.0,"Ok... I found my new sweet spot. Pun intended! 
This is such a great Italian dessert shop. 
Coffee is really good and the sweets are fresh and delicious. 
When you go in, ask for G! She's is so lovely and accommodating.
The owner Belle is very friendly and the place feels very homey. 
Try the rainbow cookies and the biscottis."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2017-10-21,5.0,Nice place!!! Good vibe and real good coffee made with the star of the coffee machine! Marzocco! Also pastry and biscuits are fresh and homemade! Real Italian breakfast!
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-03-04,5.0,Amazing!!!!!! Love this place super chic and delicioso!!  The San Guiseppe was incredible! THANK YOU SO much I'll definitely be coming back !!!
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2018-02-27,5.0,"The service at Cafe Belle was impeccable from when I walked through the door until I left. I walked in and was immediately greeted by a very pleasant lady who was very helpful and knowledgeable of their pastries. She recommended i try the rainbow cookies and since Everyone raves about them on yelp, i gave them a try and They were nothing short of delicious perfection! Not dry like most rainbow cookies and full of flavor. I also had the cheesecake and my niece has the rainbow cake which we both loved. I will definitely be back!"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2017-08-01,5.0,"My husband and I can't believe our luck  finding this place. We literally just returned home from a trip to Naples in Italy where we splurged on decadent hand crafted Sfogliatella and exceptional espresso. We thought we'd find neither back in the States until we walked into Belle Bakery.  The owner Noel is absolutely lovely and shared the story and how the cookies and in particular the Sfogliatella are  handmade by her father and grandfather so everything you see in the case is part of a generational thread and years of refining and perfecting. This is truly authentic, artisinal crafted food.  She showed us an amazing black and white photo of her father the moment the master bakers around him felt he had perfected the craft of making the time intensive and complex Sfogliatella. We usually don't bother eating them in the States because they're machine made to save the intense labor and  often Frozen and reheated (ugh). In Naples they would never stand for that why should we! This place is a slow food gem."
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2017-08-06,5.0,"This place is AMAZING! Best Italian cookies and pastries in NYC, hands down. My boyfriend and I have been coming here regularly for their yummy treats. The service is always excellent, and the owner, Belle is super sweet and accommodating.

A few must tries-- 
the chocolate square cookies withs sprinkles-- so buttery and not too sweet
rainbow cookies -- try with ice cream!
brownie-- super fudgy and decadent

Honestly, everything Ive tried here has been amazing. The cookies are always fresh, unlike other Italian bakeries in the city, where they are stale and hard. You can also tell they use fresh and real ingredients (butter fans, rejoice!) and everything tastes freshly and home made. Also, their iced tea/coffee is super refreshing on a hot day :) 

Skip Little Italy and the super touristy Italian bakeries. This place is the real thing. You will not be disappointed!"
83,cafe-belle-new-york,2017-12-03,5.0,"While visiting New York, my daughter and I found this wonderful cafe. We instantly fell in love. The serene ambiance, the delicious coffee and hot chocolate, not to even mention the delectable sweets. We got the chance to talk to Belle, learn more about the shop and her family, which made the experience even better. We went every day during our visit! I can't want to come back to the city just to visit Cafe Belle."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-11-14,5.0,"I love this spot for a casual lunch downtown near the courthouse.  The staff here are amazing, they remember what you like even if it has been weeks since you were last in.  

Beyond the regular lunch rush though, I highly recommend coming after 2 pm for the clay pot curry. It is delicious!!  I love the salmon and tofu especially."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-06-11,4.0,"Yum! Definitely a fan of this place. I've only tried a couple of items here and can't wait to come back for more. 

Great spot for some cheap and filling eats. They have really good curry. I've tried the seafood curry noddle soup and the soup was so rich and flavorful. And went very well with the noddle. They also sell this Indian pancake for you to dip in the soup and it was delish. I've also tried the curry beef over rice and that was good as well but I found the curry in the noddle soup to be more rich and intense. 

Service was also fast and friendly. I was in and out in 20 minutes for a quick bite. Definitely recommended"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-09-26,4.0,"I came here for lunch for the jury duty break. I definitely recommend getting the chicken curry dish w/ pancake for 8 bucks! The chicken fell of the bone. 

I was sat down immediately and left after 30 minutes.

They have an american menu and asian menu, definitely come here if you are doing jury duty!"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-07-01,4.0,"The chicken curry was delicious and just the right amount of spicy. Good portion of boneless thigh meat and not too many potatoes. Excellent thick peeled cucumber slices to cut the spice. I had the pancake (roti) instead of rice and it was so delicious I ordered a second one to sop up the curry. Good prices, modern metal tables and chairs give the place a modern, neat cafe look. Would try again."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-05-14,5.0,"Cute little diner type place with a huge variety of food to satisfy any craving. I couldn't decide what to get, but the server was very nice and told me which of each category was favored. From sandwiches to soups to asian platters, the choices were about endless.

-Korean bbq beef over rice ($13): this was delicious. Chunks of beef tender and marinated, sauteed with peppers and onions. Served with rice and a salad. 
-Grilled hanger steak ($14): this was good but not exactly a steak, more similar to the chunks of beef in the previous dish. It came with a delicious mushroom sauce over it, with broccoli all over mashed potatoes. 
-Side of fries ($4): crispy perfectly seasoned fries, no complaints here

Service is quick and friendly, food is delicious, a great spot for any type of food you may be looking for!"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-05-13,5.0,"A little gem I've always passed by but never got the chance to try till now. It's a quaint little spot with very attentive and friendly staff. When I got seated, Linda offered to explain the menu and recommend dishes to me since there was such a huge array. I ended up getting the angus beef burger, grilled hanger steak, and Korean bbq beef over rice.

The food came quite quickly. The burger was medium rare like I requested and was quite thick. Very tender and not dry. Quite delicious but the fries were the real winner here. The fries were extremely flavorful and crunchy without it being dry and wasn't small at all.

The grilled hanger steak came out medium rare as well. Came with lots of broccoli and a good serving of mashed potatoes. The steak was extremely tender and paired extremely well with the mushroom sauce.

The Korean bbq was my favorite. It was very flavorful and good portion sized. Everything was extremely affordable as well. Definitely pop in and give it a try if you haven't yet!"

We met for breakfast and it did not disappoint.  The staff is friendly, effective and on point.  I really enjoyed every meal and would recommend this place highly.  The menu has lots of choices and the portions are good and the prices are very reasonable.
Mama's is a great choice for any meal of the day."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-05-07,5.0,"I absolutely LOVE this place. It's a hidden little gem in Chinatown that serves an amazing curry. It's not a surprise that they have news paper articles lining their walls on what an amazing place they are. If you come to Chinatown, I suggest you come here. 

But not only that, their specials are an amazing deal. I come here at least once a week, if not more. They have a wide variety of food that they have perfected. From their breakfast to their mamas bowl with salmon with quinoa and black beans to their chicken curry. You won't be disappointed. The French fries are crunchy and just golden brown. It's absolutely a great place to eat. 

After a while of coming too, the staff start to know your name and know what you like to eat and drink. Now I come in, they start making the drink without asking."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-04-18,5.0,Quality and fast service. The owner is super nice and food comes out quick. Just remember to know what you want since the place can get packed easily. First impression: clean and quaint space with welcoming staff. I wish more people could come to this place. Great food as well!
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-07-24,4.0,"My sister suggested this restaurant for a long time that the curry noodle is awesome.  It is a very comfortable place to eat and relax.   When I look at the menu, I don't see any curry dish that my sister suggested to me.   I asked the waitress did they have curry.   She told me that they only have curry beef or chicken over rice.    I was little disappointed because I was looking forward to try the curry noodle soup.  THe beef curry was very good however the portion is little small.   I would come back to try the curry noodle soup next time."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-06-06,5.0,"I read a bunch of reviews & this place made the list when I was out & about. I rented a Citibike, rode across the Brooklyn Bridge & then made my way to Mamas. I have been craving some greens for the past few days & this place did it better than I ever thought they would. Arrived on a weekday around 4 & was the only person in the place but got the best Chef's salad I've ever received in a restaurant. Every layer had hidden treats from massive chicken breast to tomatoes, cucumbers, 1/2 an avocado, hard boiled egg, blue cheese, big chunks of REAL bacon etc. I've owned & run restaurants & my only disappointment was that I wasn't able to come back to Mamas for something else. Nice job gang!"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-01-03,1.0,"I ordered a dish but was given the wrong dish. I get home and realize the mistake. They gave me some smelly Asian curry dish, but I ordered an AMERICAN dish. I inform them of their mistake and this Asian woman with terrible English yells at me and says that I should have checked my order, so she blamed me, not the employee who incorrectly took my order. I asked her what she could do for me. She told me to bring back the wrong dish to the Manhattan restaurant, but I live in Brooklyn. She told me to take the train from Brooklyn to Manhattan to bring back the wrong dish...I mean who is going to take back a dish when they live in another borough? I asked if she could offer another solution like have the delivery guy deliver the RIGHT dish to me since YOU made the mistake, but she said that he's not going to take the train from Manhattan to Brooklyn...she said who is going to take back a dish when they work in another borough? I said, ""EXACTLY!"" Of course, she didn't understand and slammed the phone on me. When I called back, she angrily yelled, ""F*CK YOU, you stupid!"" So I wasted money on food that I didn't order, and I got yelled and cursed at by an angry Asian woman. 

I know that Mama Eatery hasn't been doing well, so I guess that she was taking her frustration out of customers. However, don't take your anger out of customers who are only pointing out that their order was wrong and asking that you correct it."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-03-22,1.0,I've given so much business here and not only are they cheap with me but their service is terrible. Never coming back.
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-04-06,4.0,Food is good and fresh. The price is not that bad compared to the quality food. It's enough portion for two people. I would come again.
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-02-16,5.0,"This place is one of my favs in Chinatown! The food is great, service is fast, and staff are really friendly. Definitely try their iced coffee, it's addictive"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-03-30,5.0,I love this place! It feels like comfort food and the seasoning is on point. I got the veggie curry noodles and my bf got the chicken curry with rice. Both dishes were delicious
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-03-03,5.0,"Huge delicious cheap plentiful bowls of Malaysian curry goodness. In a just world everyone would know how great this place is and there'd be a 20 minute wait to get in day or night. It's not a just world, but I'm glad Mama curry is still here in it"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-08-31,3.0,"We had to ask 6 times for penne pasta with nothing on it and parmigiana on the side for a 5 year old. First they suggested that she would not like it that way. Then they repeated what we asked for and said they would have to ask the chef. We asked for 4 waters and a lemonade. They brought two waters, were not sure that the 13 year old who asked for the lemonade needed water and did not want to give a glass of water to the 5 year old because of the glass but didn't offer a plastic or paper cup. Three of our meals arrived and then they brought a duplicate meal we did not request. They asked us if WE had ordered two replica meals and we assured them we did not. We began eating and 7 minutes later had to ask for the penne pasta- repeating the same process. They asked if we wanted sauce-NO! They asked if we were sure-YES! 

My mango chicken was not flavorful. But I gave them 3 stars because the portions were large and my three other companions enjoyed their meals."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-04-02,5.0,"Such a good deal, you won't be disappointed. Staff is very friendly and the restaurant is spacious. The curry chicken is incredible!"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-08-04,4.0,"A nice quiet place for lunch. The waitresses were nice.  Me and my sister, ordered a Caesar Salad and a Seafood curry noodle. The salad was crunchy and fresh. For the curry, it was creamy and not that spicy which was great for my sister. Will definitely, get food from this place again."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2015-08-28,3.0,"This place is hidden away next to the park behind Chinatown, so usually it isn't very crowded. When I usually come by either for take out or dine in, the food usually comes reasonably quickly, so this place is a decent option if you're in a hurry.

Not specifically a Chinese restaurant, these guys primarily serve typical diner food. However, there are some asian inspired options, such as korean beef or kung pow chicken available. These options are pretty good, and should definitely be tried out. The drinks here are a little bit on the expensive side, so watch out.

The one thing I am kind of confused about when it comes to this place is the service. It's not really clear to me if this place is specifically designated to be a takeout place, or a dine in. The service that you get when you dine in isn't really up to par, but then again, it could be a lack of understanding on my part."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2017-10-11,4.0,"The Malaysian curry or they call it ""Asian Spicy Curry"" is what carries this place. All of the curry dishes are a must try, from the pancakes, to the soups and noodles.  The tofu skin is made on premise and is to die for. Yip Khuan Thye is the chef behind this. She was added into the eclectic mix of food they offer. It's too bad they don't offer bubble tea or Thai iced tea. That would just completely tie this place together."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2017-02-22,5.0,"Great lunch salads during the day and curry noodle options at night. 

My avocado salad was $10 but it was packed with grilled chicken, avocado, red peppers, tomato raisins, carrots, cucumber and of course greens. I was very full and satisfied after."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2016-09-22,4.0,"If you're craving for curry noodles, this is the place to go.

A clean nice place, small but neat. Location is just a bit off the main road, you have to roam a little further in chinatown far away from the hustle and bustle. We were greeted by dull outside lighting but when you get inside it was bright and was halfway full of people. 

Food of choice:

*Everything CURRY! it is their specialty and trust me you'll come back for more. 
*My go-to-place for Curry noodle soup!
*try to get some asian pancakes to dip into the soup, they're a nice treat!"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-06-01,5.0,I went in for a pickup. Ordered right when I got there and it only took about 8-10 minutes. I got penne pasta with pesto and grilled chicken and it was super delicious and priced well. Absolutely recommend!
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2014-12-23,4.0,"Another non-Chinese place in Chinatown. Compared to Everest, nicer decor, smaller portions, slightly pricier (but not much) & therefore more female friendly.  Run by friendly middle aged Chinese woman so you need to talk slowly.  Standard NY dinner fair - eggs waffles oatmeal... by on the feminine side.  It's also the breakfast place for the nearby Hotel Mulberry so you will see Out-of-towners (Europeans mostly) at breakfast.

The Lox are way better (more salmon & creme cheese) at Everest.

And like Everest, Cops like to eat here."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2016-06-08,4.0,"Came here for dinner a few times and was surprised to find that Mama serves two menus: one from Mama and one from the Asian Spicy Curry pop-up. My boyfriend ordered from the curry menu and ended up getting the Curry Chicken. Me, being the ultimate pasta lover, ordered Linguine with tomato cream sauce and grilled chicken. We also got a Mama's Sampler on the side. Last time we came, we ordered the Mama's Sample but they forgot our order and closed the kitchen but this time, we finally got to try it. 

The Mama's Sampler came with a little bit of everything: calamari, wings, mozzarella sticks and spring rolls for around $10. It was pretty decent but I enjoyed my pasta dish the most. They are incredibly generous with the portion size, lots of linguine drowned in delicious creamy sauce. The grilled chicken that came with the pasta was a tad dry and burnt but I just dipped it in my sauce to cover these flaws. The curry dish was also delectable. The curry is most similar to Malaysian curry minus the spiciness. If you are looking for something spicy like a Thai Curry, I wouldn't recommend this. If you like pasta, give their pasta dishes a go!

Overall, Mama is a decent spot if you are someone who hates waiting for seating (they have plenty of seats) and likes having a variety of delicious food to choose from. My sister recommended trying their salads so I will do so when I get the chance. Otherwise, you will find me at Mama, chowing down pasta."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-01-04,4.0,"If you work or live nearby, this is a good spot for an occasional lunch and dinner. I recommend eating here if you're in the area and looking for something that is not mainstream Chinese, Italian or Vietnam (or other specialities that you find in Chinatown). I wouldn't recommend coming out here just to try their food, though. 

I mainly get the Chef's Salad (TONS of meat, but it's all deli meat), avocado salad (sort of disappointed that they give only half an avocado instead of a whole avocado) or burger (not the best burger you can find/eat, but it's pretty good). Aiming to try their curry and pasta sometime, since I live close by."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2017-08-17,3.0,"I used to love this place ! I guess my palette has changed, and I'm a little more picky, and aware of more flavors, and what not. But, I just don't think it was the same at all to when they first opened. I guess I also feel like what I normally get, I can cook for way cheaper and a little more flavor. ( I usually get their grilled chicken pesto pasta) I guess it's a good bite when you're at work and need something quick, but not a place I'd recommend, or go out of my way to eat."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-08-20,4.0,Small menu.  Clean.  Good breakfast choices:  whole wheat pancake with strawberries cooked inside.  Brioche french toast.  Served with fresh fruit on the side.  Affordable.  Fast friendly service.
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-09-22,4.0,This place is low key and good. They are clean and the food is in my opinion better than any regular diner. Their selection on the menu is also great. Good spot to come to for a quick bite
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-12-27,5.0,"My coworker introduced me to this joint and it's been our go-to spot for the past two years. I always order the same dish: beef curry with a side of pancakes. The curry is extremely flavorful and my only request is that they increase the portions (my coworkers think the portions are plenty - I might just have a huge appetite!). Mama's Eatery is low-key and although it's nice that it's never too crowded, I hope more and more people stop by to taste the delicious curry!"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2016-03-15,4.0,"As much as I like this place, the hours are inconsistent. There are times when we go or call around maybe 12pm or afternoon and they're not open despite what their Yelp hours say. 

Food quality is very consistent and fresh, never had a problem with anything. It's hard to find American food in Chinatown, and this place is definitely a gem. What surprised me the most is how good their bubble tea was! I ordered a peach bubble tea and it was better than most bubble tea joints I've tried. Thank you for that. I love peach. But on a side note, I ordered the fresh squeezed mango juice and I didn't like it at all. It tasted fresh for sure, but it had a really weird taste to it. 

Also, delivery is incredibly quick (then again were only about 3 blocks away). We ordered about $130 worth of food and it was delivered in less than 30 minutes. The cashier who took our (really long and complicated) order was really efficient."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2017-03-22,2.0,"Been here many times for lunch and food and service is 5 stars. But just tried their breakfast today for the first time and quite a disappointment.

Ordered two eggs over easy with a side of bacon and coffee. 

1) Menu says choice of french fries or home fries and toast. Well they don't have home fries anymore, but did not update their menu.

2) The butter packet was covered in, what I think is, syrup with a bread crumb sticking to it. Kinda gross. Clearly salvaged from someone's pancake/waffle order. It was perfectly sealed so sure, no need to throw it away, but at least wipe it down.

3) Bacon is $2 extra. It was obviously ""re-fried"". Dried like leather and broke into pieces as soon as I stab it with a fork. (see pic) Since I took a few bites, I sincerely hope this was not also salvaged from someone else's plate like the butter.

Love their other food, but will not be returning for breakfast."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2016-04-14,2.0,"My team ordered a smattering of salads, sandwiches, and hot dishes from here recently.  I was sorely disappointed.  The hot dishes (salmon over greens, chicken over greens, etc.) looked wilted and lacking in color.  I opted for the salmon nicoise, which is usually a favorite dish of mine, but man did it disappoint.  The salad leaves were a little wilted and old, and not cut right so one piece was attached to 15 others, making it hard to eat.  The salmon was crusted so heavily in pepper it was pretty much inedible, and the wasabi-like cream sauce didn't add much.  Nor was the salad mixed.  It haphazardly included some roasted red peppers, a hastily chopped boiled egg, and olives, but they didn't mesh together like they should in a nicoise.  I begged -- begged -- my team not to order this again.  

When I selected the two star rating, yelp said ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""  That's the appropriate description of the lunch I had."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-06-06,4.0,"This is my second time eating at Mama's. The first time I was here I dined in and this time I took food to go. Both times I tried different salads and both times I was at that level where I was satisfied mainly because of the large portions and not so much for the taste. It's standard food but nothing that my cravings would force me to come back for. I think another reason why I'm on the fence with this place is because their salads are a bit overpriced. Yes, their portions are huge but their ingredients are basic. And I can't justify spending $12-15 on a salad that just doesn't wow me. Maybe their other dishes are better and their salads need more work. I'm not too sure. But I do know that I won't go out of my way to eat here. If I happen to be in the area and something on their menu speaks to my stomach, then I'll return."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2019-02-23,5.0,"Great place in chinatown!! I ordered the chicken curry noodle soup, asian pancake, and the ginger dressing salad. All were very delicious. The portions were perfect and priced very well. Adding it to my regular spots to go to in Chinatown!!!"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-08-24,3.0,"Hmmm..... I have been going to this restaurant during lunch hours for many years and it has gone threw a transformation in the way it services it customers. While the staff continues to be very friendly, they now seat you and you can order from your table. Before, you order at the counter sit at a table and they bring your food to you, very casual. Not sure why they changed it, but this more formal service might not be too attracting. Especially since this sort of service comes with a ""tip suggestion"" at the bottom of the receipt. A place that was so busy you would be smart to order from your office to go pick it up, is now empty. They do have a substantial menu with many options. But frankly unless you know the food.... you might end up with a flop meal. Stay away from the pasta primavera in Alfredo sauce, it's more like penne swimming in milk. Salmon wrap reads good on the menu, but doesn't taste like it. I had to add ketchup for flavor. Their prices have also gone up, but their food has not."
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2018-01-27,4.0,"Been coming here for so long, I'm a loyal customer! They have delicious American food! I LOVE their angus burger! Everything is pretty good there but I absolutely LOVE their angus burger! And the waiters are super cozy and welcoming! Everyone should try this place! Definitely a must!!!"
84,mama-eatery-new-york,2015-06-07,4.0,"Was walking by and saw a sidewalk sign promoting a pop-up, ""Asian Spicy Curry"".  Person taking my order was friendly, and the folks managing the pop-up were nice, and since it also caters to non-Chinese clientele, spoke English.  

I had the chicken curry which was very good and pricing was competitive with other Chinatown joints.  The space is nice and well lit with a large front window facing Columbus Park. It is a pleasure to sit in a restaurant in Chinatown that receives natural light.  I must have walked by this place dozens of times without giving it a thought, but I will be back."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2020-01-31,5.0,"Oh man, this place was good. Wanted hot chocolate in the area, but also ended up getting lunch. Got the arugula salad and the mini pdq sandwiches. delicious! I liked the ham and cheese one and pesto one. The salad was surprisingly good too and filling with all the toppings. 

The hot chocolates were good, not great. It was more milky and dark chocolate than solid milk chocolate. I did like the marshmellows though. They have about ten seats but it's a cute place and tons of foot traffic/kids. Nice street in fidi too."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2020-01-26,4.0,"Strolled by and decided to check this store out. As soon as you walk in, you smell the magnificent PDQ and it was glorious and cheesy!! We tried the roasted garlic PDQ, which was chewy and cheesy (similar to mochi bread to me).

Docking one star since the latte I ordered was bitter and burnt."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2020-01-26,4.0,"Cute place that smells good as soon as you enter the space. If you're looking for PDQ (Pao De Queijo) aka Brazilian cheese bread then this is the place to go. They serve PDQ and coffee and offer a nice space to relax on the weekends - especially if you're looking to get away from the hectic crowds in Seaport.

This place definitely is a hit for FiDi residents as well."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-08-20,4.0,"Primarily focusing on brigadeiro (fudge-like) and various pao de queijo/PDQ/cheese breads, this is a nice new Brazilian bakeshop and coffee shop located in South Street Seaport. They also have a few tiny sandwiches and some breakfast/lunch options along with La Colombe coffee. There weren't many people in there and it was already a bit late and they were already out of some of their ""PDQs"" as well a cake but but overall the food was quite fresh. The staff was also very nice and also patient with some tourists who came in shortly after me. The desserts here I tried was excellent while their PDQs were fine.

I solely had two PDQs (regular and olive) with their cream cheese spread (extra 50 cents) and a brigadeiro cookie. The PDQs were fine though a bit pricey. They reminded me a bit of a Brazilian take on Bantam bagels, those usually cheese stuffed bagel bites which also happen to be both convenient and a bit pricey though with a better cheese here. I've had pao de queijo before and I found the olive one to be a bit better (I assume more since it felt like it was more worth it for the price.) The spread was well a spread. It worked but I think one should be for free if you order enough of them as it just adds cost.

Their cookie was a lot better. The middle reminded me of the eponymous fudge truffle and the outside had a good amount of sprinkles. It was soft and quite delicious and well worth it (I believe for 3.50.) It's probably would be one of the better chocolate chip cookies in the city if the texture on the outside was as good as the inside. I'd definitely get one of those again if I am in the area and I have a sweet-tooth.

2.5 (Traditional PDQ)
3.0 (Olive PDQ)
4.0 (Brigadiero cookie)

This is a a welcome new place in the South Street Seaport but I couldn't help but think that the cookie was a lot better. They do have deals for their PDQs but I still think they are a bit too much. Good place though."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-10-30,5.0,"ordered Brigadeiro Cake, under 10 bucks.

Holiday theme orange sprinkle on top of the Brigadeiro. Nicely presents.

The dark chocolate layer was rich, soft, put a big smile on my and my friends face.

Pair with coffee or tea , and spend sometime."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2020-02-29,5.0,"This is simply one of the finest Brazilian cafés outside of Brazil. Probably the best anywhere outside of Brazil. They make the most amazing Pao de Queijo and other Brazilian specialties. The coffee here is also superb. This is a great place for either brunch, lunch, or a late afternoon treat.
I try and make it here every Saturday morning with my kids. They love it too!"
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-06-05,3.0,"I'm a bit surprised that the cafe I went to is the same as the one with all these glowing reviews. When I found out about this place, I was so excited because I love Brazilian food and there aren't that many such offerings in the city. However, I ordered a sampling of each cheesy bread and a slice of brigadeiro cake, and everything was just meh. 

The brigadeiro ganache on top and between the cake layers were good, but the cake layers themselves tasted like cheap boxed cake mix from the supermarket. It was nice to try it, but there are many other bakeries in NYC which make better layered cakes. At least, the cake was moist and tasted like it was made this afternoon... 

... unlike the cheesy breads, which were very dry and tough. Keeping in mind that it's very hard for Brazilian pão de queijo to be dry, with their glutinous texture and oil content, the pieces they sold me must have been really old. The total of $14 I spent here for a slice of cake and 6 dry little cheesy breads was not outrageous, but felt a bit overpriced due to the disappointing quality. They do have coffee and lunch-type offerings. Maybe others are having more luck with those."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-12-06,4.0,"Cute cafe. I loved the vibe of this cute little cafe. Very festive especially now during Christmas time. It's more of a sitting and chatting cafe then a working cafe

Pros: great service, great coffee, tables to do work, free WIFI
Cons: no outlets so once your computer dies you have to move elsewhere"
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-07-14,4.0,"Cheese breads - chewy with a hint of salty flavor along with some bacon and pepper taste.

Chocolate cake - moist and not so sweet, if you are craving for a good moist chocolate cake you can try this one."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-07-23,5.0,"My fiancé and I were on a hunt for a good cup of coffee and a little something for breakfast. Despite what the movie Elf leads you to believe, just because a window says ""worlds best cup of coffee"" doesn't mean it's true. 
But Cafe Patoro had everything we were looking for. And an extra bonus, it was pretty cute on the inside. We ordered a iced latte, brewed coffee and an assortment of pão de queijo. And it was all very good  we especially enjoyed the variety of flavors to choose from of PDQ. 
We left that place very happy."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-09-28,4.0,"Good PDQ sandwiches, although I wish they would be toasted up like the PDQ by itself was. Really good filling also - I was full by the time I bit into the third one. My favorite was the original one with cheese and guava!

The coffee I tried was just ok (La Colombe! I thought it'd be stronger), and the chocolate chip cookie good but plain. I also checked in for the chips on yelp, but, at least to me, they tasted like stale pieces of bread with little flavoring. Maybe will heat them up with some toppings to make mini sandwiches.

Overall: 4.5/5 for the PDQ sandwiches, 3 for everything else. Will grab a slice of the chocolate cake next time!"
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-10-27,4.0,"Came in here yesterday to try a pastry/dessert because I've heard they are delicious and the rumors were not wrong! I was tempted to get the brigadeiro cake (chocolate cake with brigadeiro as icing), but I decided to get the chocolate chip brigadeiro cookie sandwich and I'm glad I did! It was very tasty. It was a bit pricey, but I will be back soon to try the cake!"
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-09-14,4.0,"I ordered the brigadeiro latte from this cafe. Overall it was creamy, smooth, and sweet. When you get to the bottom of the drink, you can taste the gooey chocolate and sprinkles from the melted brigadeiro mixed into it, which I fairly enjoyed. The shop had a lot of delicious looking treats so I'd be interested in giving those a try next time."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-04-04,3.0,Stopped by for a quick coffee while strolling through South Street Seaport. I'm always in the mood for a sweet treat but unfortunately it was about an our before their closing time so there wasn't much left to choose from so I took a pass and we just got two small coffees $5 total. The coffee was good and the employees were nice and they had a small seating area but no available outlets to recharge my phone unfortunately. I think it would be better earlier in the day when there's a better selection to choose from.
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2020-03-10,4.0,"Brigaderio latte was more of a dessert than a coffee, which is exactly what I loved about it! Had it after a few of the PDQ's which was fantastic. Service was so friendly and helpful and the Cafe itself was in a cute spot in the seaport district."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2018-07-28,4.0,"I had a very expensive but very delicious iced Brigadeiro Latte. A $7 thin slice of coconut cake, again, very delicious but it seemed overpriced by the portion size. If items here were 15 to 20% less expensive, I would make this a regular stop.

If cost is of no concern to you, then you will be very happy with their fresh and tasty coffees and treats."

Blueberry muffin was nothing special."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2018-12-12,5.0,"I don't do a lot of yelp reviews, but I have to throw Patoro a shout-out. I spend most of my time in coffee-shops and I am a creature of habit so I am pretty picky, here are my thoughts...

Ambience: 5/5 - Bright, colorful, and usually decorated for Christmas, Easter, World Cup, etc. This little spot will certainly bring some cheer to your day (especially in the holiday seasons). If you prefer a dark dingy, hipster-y spot, this isn't it. Also, it's clean.

Coffee: 4.5/5 - Great coffee, decent-sized pours, strong espresso, artful lattes. All in all, one of the better ones. Currently they are using La Colombe roasters. 

Food: 5/5 (wish I could give 6/5) - Amazing food, very creative, highly instagrammable, not too unhealthy, but overall delicious. On the savory side, the pao de queijos speak for themselves (just try it, please), great empanadas, and the quiche is out of this world.  On the sweet side (I don't, but plenty of folks do have a sweet tooth), it's a paradise for chocolate lovers (they make their own confections), and they bake all their pastries in-house so they are super fresh and flaky. My recommendation is to go for the brigadeiros (bon-bons for the english-speakers). New creation is the PDQ waffle w. brazilian cream cheese + guayava syrup (yeah it's as good as it sounds). Pro-tip, they use their chocolate in the mochas, so I think they are best-in-class there. Seriously I cannot understate how much better in-house chocolate is than instant powder, Ghirardelli syrup, etc.

Amenities: 4.5/5 - Good wifi (they just upgraded). Power strips under the bench (you gotta look for it). 1 Bathroom. Not much to say here.

Seating: 4/5 - Not a lot of seating, but usually something opens up in a few minutes if there's a line. 5 small-ish tables.

Employees: 5/5 - Amazing people, always with a smile or a joke, seems they are all Brazilian. They will brighten your day without fail. For me this is always the determining factor when it comes to coffeeshops, if you are the same, you will love this place. 6-7 great people and a rotating cast of 2-3 on any given day.

Patrons: 5/5 - They bring in a good crowd, a mix of tourists, random locals, and regular customers but everyone has been polite and not too loud (which can be annoying). Little bit of a Friends or Frasier vibe here, you will get to know some folks if you come back a few times. Pretty sure someone is working on a screenplay. Zero bad experiences so far. 

Location: 5/5 - Front street is like another time and place. A little slice of quiet and fresh air in the middle of a noisy and bustling city. Beautiful storefronts just off the water. Really retains that Ol' Seaport vibe. I somewhat regret writing this post if it contributes to making the place less quiet. 

X-factor: All the above notwithstanding, there's something to be said for the fact that this place is different from every other great coffeeshop. They have a story and a unique feel due to the strong Brazilian vibe (the employees, the food, the flag hanging in the window, the imported juices and sodas, etc). I really like the fact that it feels like you are stepping into another place entirely when you go there. It could just as well be located in Sao Paolo, but luckily for us it's smack dab in the middle of downtown Manhattan. :)

That is all, thanks for reading. TLDR: unique and amazing place, never been disappointed and I go there a lot."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-02-24,4.0,"Very cute, small brazilian place to get coffee or lattes. They also serve this brazilian cheesebread called Pao de Queijo (pdq) in various flavors: jalapeños, garlic, pepperoni - very tasty! They are made of Tapoica, flour etc. I also tried their hot chocolate with marshmallows which was delicious - dark chocolate, whole milk and less sugar - perfect!"
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-07-11,5.0,"I've been traveling to Brazil a few times a year for the past 8 years and it baffles me that in a country full of gourmet brigadeiro shops I haven't come across gourmet Pão de Queijo before I stumbled into Cafe Patoro in downtown Manhattan of all places. Pão de Queijo at Cafe Patoro beats any I've tried in the cities of São Paulo, Santos, Socorro, Monte Sião (MG), Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba or Gramado. My absolute favorites were the Bacon & Maple PDQ and the Garlic PDQ. My Brazilian girlfriend and I came here for breakfast during our three day stay in NYC and ate at least 4 dozen PDQs and a few Chicken Empanadas which were amazing as well."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-07-17,5.0,"Definitely didn't think I would taste a better coffee than a Colombian coffee but I'm sorry to my Colombian people the iced Mocha Latte at this place is literally the best coffee I've ever tasted. I came in for a quick breakfast and got a ham and cheese croissant, it came with a side of salad and in total cost $12 ($17 with small coffee). It is pricy, but the quality and authenticity is very clear. I should really stop eating the food before reviewing it so y'all could see how tasty and BIG this sandwich was. Definitely worth my money and I will for sure be back. The coffee Is made by ""La Colombe"" so explains why it's sooooo good."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-01-16,3.0,"Delicious but absolutely tiny as can be for the price. 

$7 empanada that is VERY lightly filled? The PDQs are good but it would be nice to be able to just get 1 or 2 of the sandwiches and not 4. Someone posted a menu pic on here that is also not accurate and they have increased the prices since then. 

Let's put it this way, I left after $12 and went to go get lunch...delicious treat but light if you're looking for a real lunch."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2020-02-06,5.0,"This was a great bakery. Their desserts were incredible, I have never tasted  anything better.. I definitely recommended."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-09-12,5.0,Brazilian carrot cake and latte we're perfect. It's right across the street and I love that it's the same workers every time. The foods delicious and the prices are very fair.
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-06-07,4.0,"I saw this place on Instagram and was intrigued by their Brigadeiro croissant, so I made the trip all the way down to South Seaport to try it. I went on a weekday afternoon and the cafe was pretty packed. It's a relatively small shop with only 5-6 tables for seating. I recommend grabbing your food and then heading to sit by the water. 

I ordered the Brigadeiro latte, which was tasty!! It's not too far off from a mocha latte or something chocolatey though. The Brigadeiro croissant was not on the menu, but the staff was willing to make it for us anyways. This croissant is UNREAL. So gooey and yummy, filled to the brim with chocolate and sprinkles. I also got a few of the pao de queijo. They were running low on their flavors so I wasn't able to get all of the ones I wanted to try. The classic flavor is good, a pretty standard pao de queijo."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,Great friendly service... great  pastries and savory options. Vegetarian and Gluten free options available.
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2017-12-30,4.0,"We came here for breakfast before going to the iPic movie theater, which was 2 minutes away.

This cafe had a super relaxing, cute, well designed interior. We enjoyed our breakfast very much, ordered

- 1 quiche 
- 4 mini sandwich bites
- 1 small hot coco
- 1 small coffee 

All cost about $27, breakfast for 2. 

You first pay up front. Then they heat up the food, build sandwiches, and bring it to your table. Very friendly staff

There are just 4 or 5 tables. Think a lot of ppl probably grab and go, for those who work around the area."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2018-01-24,5.0,"Charming coffee shop and cafe specializing in pao de queijo. These are small cheese pastries, sort of similar to French choux pastry. They are light and cheesy and absolutely delicious (especially with some guava jam or extra cheese). They had three varieties available when I arrived at 7:30am on a Tuesday - original, pesto, and olive. I got all three and some guava jam. All three were great, although the original and pesto had more flavor than the olive ones. 

Be sure to grab those free Yelp chips. I was expecting potato, but these are actually PDQ chips and they are ADDICTIVE (and, again, very good with a sweet spread or some extra cheese). Mocha was strong, flavorful, and not too sweet. The baked goods looked amazing, I'll definitely be back to try those. Overall, highly recommend if you're looking for a meal or snack in the area."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2020-02-16,4.0,"Cute little coffee shop. In South Street Seaport area, right in front street.  Try the cheese bread, it's yummy."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-06-04,5.0,"Excellent food and service. Great little treats we'll pick up a few boxes whenever visiting friends. Their cornbread is fantastic too. 

Been coming here for a while, as my fiancée has celiacs this is her favorite place for gluten-free treats near her apartment. To celebrate our engagement, we rented the Pioneer schooner from the Seaport Museum and had Cafe Patoro handle the catering for our 40 guests. While their catering capabilities is still relatively new and growing, their team, and especially Tiago, really stepped up and knocked it out of the park. They re-formulated their carrot cakes to be gluten free so we could include them, and delivered 200 PDQ sandwiches arranged on platters in their iconic yellow boxes. Which made it super easy for us to just put on the boat and enjoy. 

All of the food was gone before our sail turned back to port. I'm so happy we chose them to cater for us and will continue supporting this local business."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-04-05,3.0,"Shocked that I'm saying this because I love good gooey melty cheese, but I found the innards PDQs to be meh until they cooled down and I tried them at room temperature. The inner cheese contrasts much more starkly with the chewy outer bread at that point! I think I was expecting a more hefty, creamy cheese filling rather than the almost light snack that the PDQ turned out to be! At 11am the popular flavors were all sold out so come early if you want to try something unusual like fig !

The brigadeiro croissant was huge and MESSY! I took mine to the seaport to eat and was hands deep in chocolate icing with no napkins. It was a wonderful time but not my best show as a functional adult. I wasn't sure about how the very cake-like chocolate melded with the big croissant and felt like it was a mismatch of flavors and textures. Nevertheless a big ball of chocolate ooze is always fun to eat and the croissant becomes burrito-size in heft by the time you get to the middle."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2018-12-24,3.0,"Adorable Brazilian cafe in the South Street Seaport District.  The decor is cozy and classy,  but the space is tight. We were fortunate that it was a chilly afternoon and there was space, but consider the cafe seats about 10 and stands about 5. I tried the Dulce De Leche cake, a hearty slice that can be shared. It's definitely good enough to get again, yet maybe not the top choice. The coffee was served warm, not hot.  The prices were exactly as expected, 'reasonable for NYC' pricing. For a first experience, I'd say 3/ 3.5, I'd like my coffee hotter next time and I look forward to trying some of the other goodies. especially the cheese breads they are noted for."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2018-06-18,1.0,"For a cafe that boasts that they are the highest rated on Front Street, they don't seem to be trying very hard to stay that way. I went yesterday with my family on Father's Day and was met with with rude service and mediocre coffee. Look through my reviews - you'll see that I rarely, if ever rate businesses this low if that's any indication of how upsetting this experience was.

My family came in on a slow Sunday afternoon, and decided to grab some coffee to stay. The barista was curt and dismissive, and didn't seem interested at all in taking my order. 

We sat down and waited to receive our drinks while other later customers were served before us. I looked around, and we were the only patrons to not get latte art - even customers with paper to-go cups had some semblance of effort put into their milk foam while my sister's espresso drink was just plain. 

My iced mocha was overly sweet and there was not enough ice, so it basically was a lukewarm chocolate coffee drink. 

The staff basically ignored us after that, even when I tried to get their attention for another coffee. They were inattentive and stood deeper in the kitchen watching something on their phone. 

I was embarrassed to bring my family here. I had looked for a highly rated cafe around the Seaport area to impress them and instead ended up subjected ourselves to poor treatment and subpar coffee at Cafe Patoro."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2017-08-01,4.0,"This is an adorable cafe. For the longest time, I was searching for a Brazilian cafe that offered the infamous pao de quiejo, my favorite cheesy bread. It's a small shop but with plenty of choices. The woman who assisted me was very friendly and helpful. The pao de queijos were popular because when I ordered, it was nearly gone (and there were a lot of flavor options!). For $6, you get 5 slightly bigger than average pao de quiejos and had to get a slice of brigadeiro cake for $6.25, which looked amazing. 

There were a few tables available so we decided to sit down: three adults and one stroller. The woman graciously offered to heat up my pao de quiejos which I immediately nodded with force. Nothing like warmed up bread to make my afternoon snack even better. 

Thoughts on the five pao de quiejos:

Original - you can't go wrong with the classic. Got two of these and glad I did since we all shared it. It's just unbelievably fantastic, brings back memories when I first had this deliciousness 10 years ago at a Brazilian restaurant and still taste as fantastic as ever. 

Pesto - hint of pesto flavor without being overwhelming.

Pepperoni - i love pepperoni so thought this would be cool to try. Little bits of pepperoni are embedded in the pao de quiejo. Light aroma, good taste.

Roasted garlic - for those who love garlic, this would be a great treat. Very fragrant and a subtle smell yet strong taste when you bite into it.

All of the pao de queijos had great consistency and pulled apart nicely. Of course, as I received my items, a fresh batch of originals come out of the oven...melt*.

Brigadeiro - never had this cake but saw lots of reviews and photos on this and of course had to try! It looked like a piece of yummy chocolate cake. The description for it is a dark chocolate cake with Brazilian chocolate truffle filling. Fairly small sized slice of cake for $6.25. But the richness, consistency, texture, freshness and taste make up for it. Not sugarly or too sweet, right amount of dark chocolate without being bitter, perfect amount of filling and frosting/sprinkles. Good pick and so glad I tried it. It felt like a guiltless dessert. 

My mom tried the coffee there and loved it. She went with the Colombian blend and it was so aromatic! No need for sugar...that's how delicious it was. Adorable spot. My husband wanted to try the cold brew but already had his max for the day. Would definitely come back to satisfy a weekend afternoon craving."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2018-09-14,5.0,"Hands down, the best Brazilian spot around the area, or anywhere in NYC. A must try Brazilian spot with all these baked goods that brings back memories from my childhood in Brasil.

Must tries: Cheesebread Sandwiches,
Brigadeiro Cake,
Carrot Cake,
Cornbread Cake,
Brigadeiro Chocolate Chip Cookie Sandwich
Iced Tea Matte Leao,
Brigadeiro Iced Latte."
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2018-12-31,4.0,"I love going to this place because it's closed to my apartment. I really enjoyed their chocolate cake, $7/slice, which is okay and the cake is moist, a little too sweet on the cream/icing. Somehow they changed the cake size, it used to be a larger cake and bigger slice, but now much much smaller slice and still charged $7. I asked how come it got smaller? Waiter/waitress said it's always been that size. Ummm no! Don't lie to me was what I thought in my head because I've been here for as long as when they started. Give me a better explanation next time. Do go if you live/work near seaport, nice atmosphere but I do not like being lied"
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2018-06-30,4.0,"Such a quaint and modern cafe! I really like their design and furniture. 

I always get their cheese bread and croissant with chocolate. I also like their interior, the staff does a great job keeping the tables and seats / booth very clean. They have comfortable seating and the display of pastries, cakes and bread inside the glass behind the counters. The staff is very friendly though they have a non working WiFi. Overall, a great low key venue to catch up with friends or do some light reading."

85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2019-02-27,5.0,"I do love going to coffee shops and seeing how each coffee shop is unique from the other and Cafe Patoro deserves a review.
 
My friend recommended us a spot to catch up and I'm very glad that it was Cafe Patoro. I would love to make this my go-to spot, unfortunately I live in Queens. A lot of detailed effort is put into the shop to make it feel hospitable is what I thought when I walked in.
 
A barista named Thuane greeted me and she was a delight. She answered all my questions and even recommended me something as I'm very indecisive. I ordered a latte (to see Thuane's art skills) and a Brigadeiro croissant. Coffee - really good and they're not stingy with the pour and the croissant was really tasty! I had an engaging conversation about our cultures until my friend got here and the rest was history.
 
The location is A++ in my book because it's close to the water and one of my favorite places to relax and walk around.
 
I probably will come back here once a week when I'm passing by the neighborhood. If you get the chance definitely go and visit!"
85,cafe-patoro-new-york,2018-07-30,5.0,"They didn't have caramel latte but had their own version which wasn't actually like caramel but very close. They were very friendly staff and welcoming.

The FRIENDLIEST wait staff in the city- unpretentious but hip. Comfort food and healthy food, hot cozy drinks and tipsy bevs, pastries (with gluten free options) plus ALL DAY breakfast. I usually get the granola bowl or the salmon salad bowl. But I often just come with a book and get a cup joe and muffin after I put my laundry in across the street which makes waiting for clean underpants 5 times more bearable. Also did I mention the coffee is bottomless? ...caffiene queen dream. This location is bigger than the Union Square one (honestly I can't breathe in that one) but this is my tried and true go to in my hood."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2020-02-29,3.0,"So....this location on Carmine Street in the West Village is cozy and welcoming.  The staff may be the friendliest and most inviting in the city.  

You walk up to the counter and make your selections the. Have a seat wherever you like and they will call out your name and bring you your order.

The craft beer selection is all about NY breweries.  I tasted a few and settled on the Montauk IPA.  It was delicious.  

Since this was just a stop to rest our feet and have a snack and a drink it was perfect.  I ordered the soup of the day which was a spicy kale and sweet potato soup.  I expected a sweet potato purée but out came a tomato based soup with diced sweet potatoes.  I was surprised and excited as it looked amazing.   However, I was sad to say it was a disappointment.  Some of the kale was not cooked well and it tasted like I was chewing on a dried bay leaf.  Also, the soup was over salted and the sweet potatoes were inconsistent in texture.  The fries were ok...basic thin shoestrings.

I noticed a lot of people ordering brunch items such as the wheat toast with smoked salmon which was probably a better choice.

So...I'm torn.  I love the decor, coziness, welcoming staff, and location but not crazy about what I ordered.  So, will I come back?  ABSOLUTELY.  This place is so cool.  However, I'll probably just grab a beer or a wine and choose one of the brunch items or a snack."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2020-02-11,4.0,"Great lunch spot! Really cool setting and awesome food. It is NYC, so the spacing is tight. It is set up with service in the ""casual dining"" mode, so you order at a counter and then someone drops your food off for you.

I love this place, and will keep coming back for my favorite breakfast (omelette with a variety of fillings to choose from), coffee, and place to work. It's a casual restaurant, where you stand in line to order and pay at the counter, and then sit down. You have to grab your own utensils, water, and condiments like ketchup from the corner behind the counter. If it's busy (weekends), someone will help seat you! The Grey Dog also has a special place in my heart as a Michigan alum - I love the decor :) Go blue!"

The little tables are waaaayyyy too crunched and crowded and squished together however. It is uncomfortable and you feel like you are up in strangers' space. Please maximize your profits without making people feel like sardines on top of each other.

Also for a chill, brunch place, music is too loud. We had to leave early because my friend with sensitive ears was getting a headache from it."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-11-27,5.0,"Whoa! Comfort food city and good vibes all throughout. Order at the counter. I had their winter sangria and nachos. Their sangria was some of the best I have had in the city. You won't be disappointed.  Nachos were a good size. Was eyeballing my friend's sour cream, that was the only thing that was missing. All of the wood and fun signage really add to a homey feel. Planning my next trip there soon. They have some gf and vegan options. Would love if they added a few gf desserts."

They resolved my issue right away! The girl at the front handling orders and drinks notified her boss and put my order in right away (Zucchini spaghetti with grilled chicken and vegan pesto on the side)... I also enjoyed a Tumeric Lattte on the house and that was so well needed after a long day at work! 
Totally understand that technical issues could arise and the way they resolved it made me feel appreciated especially since it was my first time trying The Grey Dog on Carmine. 
The picture won't do it justice since it was a take out order but believe me it was cooked thoroughly and delicious! Plus there was plenty of chicken - they're not stingy with the amount of protein! Will definitely try other menu items from here! :)"

We arrived at 11 on a Sunday, no issues at all, no long waits.  Even during peak hours, you can still get a table pretty quickly. The food is also inexpensive for what you actually end up ordering.  

Unfortunately outside of the coffee the food was underwhelming.  I ordered the french toast and my friend ordered the pancakes....we ended up eating only half of it."

86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-03-01,4.0,"Great brunch location in Chelsea and close to the Whitney (which is where my friend and I we're headed to afterwards). The restaurant setup is unusual in that you wait in line to order your food and an employee will assign you a table with a different colored bandana when one frees up. It's definitely a bit confusing but I think it's much more efficient. After you order and pay at the counter, you can grab water and utensils before heading to your seat.

I ordered the Classic Omelette with ham, spinach, and cheddar and it came with home fries and toast (you can choose what kind of bread you want). The omelette was done well, but it's also pretty hard to mess up an omelette. I think the real star of the show were the home fries - they were crispy little nuggets of perfection. Also a big fan of the thick cut toast - I put pieces of my omelette on it to make a little sandwich if you're into that.

Overall, delicious brunch place with reasonably priced dishes and a short wait time! All hard to find in the city so I'm glad I was able to try it out. I believe there are multiple locations around the city so I'm sure you can find one close to you."

Their portion is huge. Very gigantic pancake and super filling! My bf barely can finish that. 
I do like my omelette very yummy, delicious and you get to choose the filing you like. 
What disappointed me is the latte. My bf's latte is over burned. My oat latte I barely can feel the coffee and the oat milk isn't that good. 
Their restroom can be more tidy and I think that's something they should pay more attention to."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-07-19,5.0,Food was super! We stumbled upon this place and couldn't have been happier where we ended up. I got the vegan zoodles with tofu and my s/o got the veggie burger. The burger was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It looked homemade too! The fries were legit better than McDonalds. SO GOOD! Their frozé is now my new favorite drink and the happy hour prices were great. Love love love! Can't wait to come back.
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-10-06,5.0,"West Village GEM!

This place is PHENOMENAL. The staff has a vibe that makes you feel both energized and relaxed. Even if you peek in and see a long line at the counter, they move it along quickly, while still giving 100% attention to each and every person. The food is great. The service is superb. Even though you order at the counter, they always come around to make sure you are satisfied with your meal and to see if you need anything else. One of the few places left in the West Village where you can sit for a meal and not feel cramped or rushed to let someone else have the table."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2018-07-20,4.0,"Great neighborhood spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch! My family and I were newcomers and were not sure how the seating and ordering process worked. We initially tried to seat ourselves at a table, but one of the waiters placed a bandana on a table in the back for us while we waited to order at the counter. The menu is expansive and has classic breakfast staples like pancakes, french toast, omelettes, home fries, and more. All of us were easily able to find something we liked. After ordering, paying, and tipping all at the counter, we sat comfortably at our saved table in the back, where there was a big screen showing a world cup game. 

We didn't realize that the service was limited in that we had to get up for our own water and utensils. However, the staff did refill coffee and bring out the food (by loudly calling out your name until they find your table.) The portions were generous and very satisfying. I wouldn't say my ham egg & cheese croissant was totally amazing, but it definitely hit the spot. I liked the casual atmosphere and neighborhood feel to the place."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-12-18,1.0,"Typically I love this restaurant. Great atmosphere, company, and food. I typically will stop in once or twice a month when I'm in the city. This time it was so horrible I decided to write a yelp review. The food didn't come out for 30 mins and when it did it was not the meal described. It was then returned to the kitchen. I waited so long that I left and went somewhere else.  I came in the next day thinking it was just because of the holiday  and the same thing happend; Thirty min wait and then I left. (Place was dead)."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2018-05-24,5.0,"Great spot for brunch/lunch! I have been to the Union Square and W. Village location, all have same menu and system.

The menu has tons of breakfast options served all day and also vegan and gluten free stuff. How it works? You make the line to order at the counter, pay and then they sit you to wait for your order. Super-efficient and even when there is a lot of people it moves really fast.

I had the goat cheese & avo on toast with walnut pesto, cucumber and arugula ($12.50) and replaced the goat cheese for poached egg. Loooved the pesto! Not too oily and savory enough.

My friends had the poached eggs & avo salad with smoked salmon, fresh lemon and olive oil ($14.95) and the Fresh Mozzarella & Tomato sandwich on choice of bread with arugula and pesto ($12.50).

Everyone was really happy and surprised how generous the portions were considering the prices."

Great natural ingredients, not over thought... perfect prep. Oh, and the atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable. Warm. Thank you, Grey Dog."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-06-29,4.0,"I've been to grey dog before a few years ago, and this was my first time back again! I thought it was still pretty good, but the portions seem like they've gotten smaller over the years. However, it's still 100000% filling. They grey dog breakfast is a great option if you have a hard time deciding between sweet and savory when you're at brunch and you can pick and choose a bit in the dish. I got pancakes, over easy eggs, avocado, and potatoes. It was all super yummy and the pancakes and potatoes were really good!! You can get your own water, condiments, and extra utensils at a little nook near the counter where you order. The restaurant itself is really cute with the map tables and there are a few hints of Michigan around the restaurant which I love as a Michigan student!! definitely check out grey dog for a good brunch :)"
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-04-01,4.0,"They give SO much food here! SO much. :) The ""Breakfast & Brunch"" menu is available until 3 pm, so that's nice & convenient. 

Things that I've had here: Classic omelets (you choose the fillings), local omelet (egg, goat cheese, mushroom, butternut squash, pesto), egg & cheese croissant, oatmeal (offered at certain times of the year). The local omelet was especially tasty. Sometimes Grey Dog's food can sit a little heavy for me - I try to avoid the dishes that seem like they could be too greasy. But I do appreciate that they give very generous portions, so you're getting a good value for the money.

Last time I was there I got a classic omelet and the counter person asked if I wanted potatoes, a side salad, or fruit. I chose the fruit. Only when I later received my emailed receipt did I realize that they charge $1.50 extra for fruit - and probably for the salad as well, since the potatoes were what was mentioned on the menu. I appreciate that they offer some healthier options, but I wish she would have said ""The fruit costs extra - is that okay?"" I don't like getting ""surprise"" charges. 

Mostly I like coming here on occasion because the atmosphere is pretty nice - it's super-casual and the tables are so close together it almost feels communal at times, but I mostly find it a cozy, warm environment and Grey Dog staff are always nice. 

I like coming before noon - after 11:30 it often starts filling up a bit and after 12, the lunch crowd starts coming in so it's nice to get there earlier and not have trouble finding a table."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2018-09-14,4.0,"André 3000 was in this establishment right before I popped in for a glass of wine. This meant, no one cared about me. I did, however, get to hear everyone talk about the best half of Outkast and enjoy this adorable little joint. 

I had a nice glass of red by candlelight, noted all of their delicious breakfast and lunch options on the menu board, and I will return."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-08-18,5.0,"Brunch at The Grey Dog never disappoints! It was crowded, as was to be expected, but we had no trouble finding a table. The staff was incredibly friendly, and the food came not too long after we ordered. I got Grey Dog's breakfast with eggs, bacon, and french toast, all of which was delicious! I ordered my bacon well done and it came out so crispy, I was thrilled. I would definitely recommend adding fruit on top of the french toast because it just makes it that much better. It was my first time at this location, and it was on par with every other wonderful experience I've had. I will keep coming back again and again."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2018-09-06,3.0,"We came here since the brunch place across the street had a ridiculous wait. Grey Dog is pretty pricey and the quality is ok. The service was good but it's a different setup. You have to get your own utensils, water, and condiments. Never been a fan of those setups. Food was ok not spectacular."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-07-21,5.0,"Very well priced for NYC and for a big meal!! Food was very great and staff was friendly! I also got the iced chai and it was super tasty! It was quick, we got in line, ordered, and food was brought out within 10 minutes. Definitely will be back!"
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-07-05,5.0,"Went today for lunch with my sister, nieces, nephew and a couple of their friends.  Everything about this restaurant was just perfect. From our initial step inside the front door the entire staff made us feel very welcomed. They were all incredibly warm and genuine and it makes it feel like a place you have been so many times that everyone knows you.  On top on the wonderful service everything we ordered tasted great- fresh, quality ing"
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2018-07-22,2.0,"Pretty crowded at 11:30am on Sunday. You order first at the counter and then sit down. When we went they were out of forks and maybe their washer was broken because they gave us plastic forks.... A sit down restaurant with plastic forks, I couldn't believe it. I had the avocado salmon salad for $15 and hubby had the French toast for $13. Pretty affordable prices and in a cute, charming area of the village but the food was so mediocre and the atmosphere was so bad that it was overall a really blegh experience.

 I would note that's it's kind of loud inside, for some reason they turn their music up even though it's crowded which adds to the noise level. Would skip. Much better restaurant's like blue stone Lane and Jack's wife Freda on the same block."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2017-10-28,5.0,"Absolutely, I loved this restaurant. So many great brunch and lunch choices. I had the signature Grey Dog breakfast with 2 eggs, sausage patty, French toast (with bananas, strawberries and blueberries) and potatoes. This meal was so delicious with a stand out in the French toast. The syrup seemed extra special and the fruit was perfectly complimentary. I would do it all again except I tried other stuff.

A friend ordered the salmon toast points and I had to control myself from going back for more. It was served on a pita with capers, cream cheese, onions... #lifeexperience

Also had the cafe au lait with hazelnut coffee. Not something I drink on a regular but was really delicious for vacation breakfast! Great start to a tourist's day. 

Definitely a go to breakfast/brunch/lunch spot because there were so many great choices. Wish I had a few more days so we could come and try the tuna and avocado tacos... #sadface. Gotta be on the agenda for next time!"
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2018-08-06,4.0,"Fantastic local omelette that was a nice size, filling, and honestly, very handsome. I realize that was a weird thing to call an omelette, but it was shapely and even and a gorgeous yellow. The toast was a little too thick for my liking but still enjoyable. The house potatoes were also pretty good, but I think that I've had better ones. 

Hot sauce is good, service is good. I got the brussel sprouts as well but these were a little disappointing to be honest. They were overdone and too many leaves and not enough hearts. Not quite as good as Westville's TBH. It's difficult for me to decide between 4 for 5 stars. I'm going to have to say 4.5."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-11-10,5.0,Very cute place! We came for brunch and loved the selection. I got a latte to drink and thought the dog pawprint in cocoa on top was a cute touch. Loved the atmosphere!
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-07-11,2.0,Ordered a smoked salmon sandwich for $14. It sure looks like and tasted like canned salmon t! Disappointed. Usually like the food here.
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2020-01-26,5.0,Get the ahi tacos and sweet potato fries!!! Ate my whole plate Was so so delicious and the perfect sav blanc wine on the menu. Also staff was SO sweet and gave me a free muffin bc they were throwing them out otherwise. Can I get a 6th star box??
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-09-22,5.0,We were looking for a place to have lunch before seeing a play. This is a great find. We had delicious bowls that were healthy & fresh. My house blend tea with steamed oat milk was the best. We'll definitely be back.
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2019-06-23,5.0,"I am in love with the Uptown omelet! It's got goat cheese, spinach, asparagus & pesto. GREAT for keto!! We've been there twice in the last 3 days & we'll go back next time we are in NYC. The staff is super friendly too."
86,the-grey-dog-new-york-6,2018-04-23,5.0,"As soon as I first walked in, I knew this was going to be one of my favorite NYC places. The atmosphere is funky, fun, whimsical, eccentric, hippie, quirky light, and overall very cozy and inviting. It has exposed brick, fun flags, funky pictures, the tables are all of different islands. Nothing about the decor really goes together or makes sense, but thats what makes it so great. 

I love how you order at the counter and then sit down for them to deliver your food. I feel that its efficient, and makes it more casual. The servers are helpful, friendly, welcoming and overall make the experience super enjoyable. 

The menu is extensive, and everything I have had is good. The sandwiches are all classic and great portion, the chicken fingers were average, the sweet potato fries were unbelievable, and my absolute favorite was the vegan (With chicken) zoodles with pesto. It was one of the best dishes I have ever had, perhaps because of the lightness, the flavor... everything about it was perfect. I want to try so many things on their menu and can't wait to keep coming back. Definitely a spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch, and also has several vegan/vegetarian/gluten free options."

Currently reviewing because the staff is extra on point tonight. The young man (just got his name, it's Charlie) at the front greeted me right away and helped me pick out my food, and the young lady behind the bar let me try out my tea options and both were lovely to talk to. But the  part was when I flubbed my order -- they fixed it for me, easy breezy. Great service!"
87,grounded-new-york,2020-04-13,5.0,"This is hands-down my absolute favorite coffee shop in downtown Manhattan- black tea rose latte is my favorite drink. Their bagels are great too, plus they have the BEST and biggest variety of seasonings on the side! Truffle salt!!! Amazing vibes to do work here sitting in the couches amongst the plants. Hope to be back soon!!"
87,grounded-new-york,2020-01-02,4.0,"I come here for their vast selection of teas but more often than not I will leave with the ""Five spice latte"" which is a spicy, nutty delight. Order preferably with whole milk to taste all of the goodness.

Great WiFi, selection of books, always interesting people watching but the people showing up at grounded are not uber pretentious or overtly arty types as you can sometimes run into in the village but rather people of all ages/backgrounds just showing up, enjoying a cuppa and reading and/or catching up on conversations with friends. 

Gets pretty packed on weekends so I tend to avoid the place on sat/sun mornings but great spot to get some work done, make some calls etc. during the weekday. Wish there were a few more spots like this scattered around the city"
87,grounded-new-york,2019-12-28,1.0,"Yes Eve its true, WORST FAKE MATCHA EVER at Grounded on Jane street.  Eve you are obviously have Hypogeusia (a disorder)

Mean has nothing to do with this conversation.  I write what I experience!! Truth! 

Worst Matcha Latte's in the World.
I received a Snarky message from a troll named Eve, she said i was mean to post such a review as well as that they serve organic vibrant green matcha!!   Let me comment 1.  It is NOT VIBRANT GREEN.  2. It has a grainy sawdust taste.  3.  I drink ceremonial Japanese matcha for 20 years now.  4.  I drink matcha daily at home daily and at various matcha shops or cafes  all over the world!! 5. I am a professional chef, who has a trained palate.  6.  I am not mean!!! I am HONEST.  

Obviously ""eve"" has no taste buds or has ever tasted authentic matcha, and most likely ""eve""  may need glasses to let her see what  color vibrant green looks like. Also ""eve"" may need to take a course on humanity. 


Worst Matcha in the World.
I went back one more time to try their matcha as i live a few minutes  from grounded.  I love Matcha.  This is not matcha what they serve.  It is grainy and old and comes out a brownish brown green!  Not matcha.  It must  be old or outdated or not even matcha.  Matcha should be vibrant green.  Smooth and not grainy.
Do not go here for Matcha!  Huge waste of money and time..  let alone spitting out sawdust after 1 sip.
Grounded, stick with your coffee and let the matcha tea shops do their  matcha correct."

The employee's (baristas) are great, very friendly and attentive. It's one of the Best Cafes in all of Greenwich Village, New York. Again, I Love the place, and especially; Richard, Ava, and Naron who all always take good care of me, ""Thanks Guys"""
87,grounded-new-york,2019-11-15,2.0,"Cramped and noisy, not enough outlets if you're planning on staying here for a while. The tables are too close together so there's barely a sense of personal space. The music plays pretty loudly so this isn't an ideal spot for a quiet study session.

I got a peppermint leaf tea in a cup and I don't really think it's worth your money: you can finish the cup in about three or four sips."
87,grounded-new-york,2019-06-21,4.0,"This place has a good vibe to it. Simply love the natural sunlight. Coffee here is great, unlike any other regular cafes. 

Its seems kinda crowded (cant really complain about that being in NY ) nice music and the winner, internet speed is good ;)"
87,grounded-new-york,2019-07-30,3.0,"Cute space that seems nice for working, but note that there are signs requesting to limit your working/WiFi time to 90 minutes (though based on reviews I doubt this is enforced). No pets allowed. 

I got an iced honey nut latte and was not impressed (Making your drink iced is 75 cents; the oat milk was also 75 cents but decided not to splurge). It was cloyingly sweet-- almost like a slightly better hotel coffee w hazelnut creamer-- and I wasn't able to taste the espresso. Their coffee is organic x fair trade, so be aware going in that their some of their prices reflect that. Overall not a bad experience, but I doubt that I'll return."
87,grounded-new-york,2019-07-07,2.0,"Meh can't really say I'm a fan. 
1) Space- there's not a lot of it, but this is NYC so that can be excused. But if you get claustrophobic, this might not be the place for you as all the seats are pretty clustered together.
2) Service- Not great unfortunately. The lady taking order forgot about both my order as well the the order of the guy in front of me so we were waiting for our drinks why she was chatting with the other employees
3) Drink- I got the rose tea latte and was pretty disappointed with the result. The rose tea tasted watered down and the milk did not have a lot of microfoam so it went flat pretty quickly."
87,grounded-new-york,2020-02-07,4.0,"Great cute cafe hidden in west village but it's a local favorite so it's usually packed even during off peak hours on weekdays.. It's packed, crowded, tables are small barely fitting a laptop and it's hard to walk in between. They play loud music so I don't think it's a cafe where you can quietly work or do reading but a cafe where you can catch up with friends over a good cup of tea and coffee. I liked the variety of tea latte selections they have and also unique lattes like honey nut and nutella that are hard to find. I'd recommend this place to pick up drinks and go or a quick catch up with friends as it's not that quiet."
87,grounded-new-york,2018-12-30,5.0,"One of the coziest cafes I have ever been to. So many plants inside the cafe, and the cafe has couches, low tables with seats and high-top seats too. Plugs are available as well by the walls though you definitely have to sit in as strategic spot. Free WiFi as well - a bit unreliable and sometimes it won't connect for a few minutes at a time, but it wasn't too cumbersome to work this. This is a great spot to study, work or meet a friend to chat. Gosh this is one of my favorite cafes ever. 

Drink selection is great too. I got the Grounded Spiced Latte which is a latte with a bunch of different spices. Very good, I look forward to trying their various teas and tea lattes too!"

87,grounded-new-york,2019-11-11,2.0,"Poor customer service, no apology or acknowledgement: after ordering a ghost pepper grilled cheese and waiting 30 mins, I get told it's been sitting there waiting in the counter. I was not far from the counter and never heard it- it was sitting for 30 mins according to the timestamp of my receipt, and no effort was made to see whose it might be. After I checked in with the counter the first time (~15 mins in), they told me to wait. After checking in 30 mins later, the woman at the counter refused to acknowledge. She rolled her eyes and told me ""I mean, it's a counter service and it's standard."" I am not about to eat a cold grilled cheese that cost $7. I asked for a refund and she just shrugged, looked annoyed no apology at all. She just took my credit card and told me it was refunded and I thanked her- no acknowledgment. This took place Monday, 11/11 at 12:15 pm. 

I live in the neighborhood. This is not my first time here. This type of behavior is unacceptable- at least have the decency to apologize and train your folks to check why a grilled cheese was not being picked up by anyone, or shout that it's ready more than once? Mostly, I am peeved by the behavior- there's tons of coffee shops around and this perpetuation of rudeness is unacceptable. 

2 stars because the coffee was great and it has a nice environment with plants and a cozy vibe."
87,grounded-new-york,2019-02-12,2.0,"My experience here left much to be desired upon this visit. The rose tea latte was still tasty. But I ordered the portabella sandwich and for the price it had nearly nothing in it. Also the flavors were off and it was much sweeter than expected. 

My biggest gripe, however, is that the music is played off of an employee's phone and it constantly interrupted by the chiming of notifications. It is very distracting for a space that is devoted to patrons being able to relax and do work. 
Also the music ADD is not great for focus either. There is either a penchant for Fetty Wap and the Remy Boys or blaring rock music that will be skipped through at any moment at the player's discretion. Will definitely second guess my next visit."
87,grounded-new-york,2019-05-04,4.0,"Vibes: 5/5 stars! 

Coffee: 5/5 stars! 

Price: 2/5 stars!! Ouch!! 

I came in and was most excited about the specialty drinks on the menu. After seeing the iced specialty drink prices were around $6, I decided to get a regular small iced latte with oat milk, ready to put down around $5. It was $7! The price of oat milk is not listed on the menu, but I guess it is an additional $1. They also charge for drinks to be iced. I have noticed this is a trend in a couple coffee shops, but I don't quite get it. When you get an iced latte, they pour the milk into a cup and add a shot of espresso (I watched the barista do this). When you get a hot latte, they have to spend the time and skill set to froth the milk. I don't get how the simplistic order gets the upcharge! 

Aside from the price, this was a great place to get work done for a couple of hours. The neighborhood is welcoming, there is a good amount of seating, and the inside is filled with cool decor and inviting plants."

87,grounded-new-york,2018-12-25,5.0,"Very cute little cafe with organic products tucked away in the north end of west village. The neighborhood is quaint (well, as quaint as Manhattan can really be) and not too busy and the joe was good. 

The vibe is also cool, very hipster-ish but then again, I can't recall a cafe that isn't some shade of hipster. There is ample seating and it is a good place to come and do some work but an even better place to catch up with friends since it was a little bit on the louder side when I went there. 

I would definitely frequent this place if I lived in the neighborhood and so should you! - if you live in the neighborhood. Stop by anyways even if you don't, they got some really good coffee and the staff were very friendly."
87,grounded-new-york,2019-09-04,5.0,"One of my favorite coffee and tea shops to go in NYC whether is to  meet a friend, a coffee date or just go by yourself to enjoy your own company while reading a book as you sip a tea latte. I have gone here on several occasions. I found this place not through Yelp but by accident.

 My go to drink at this place has been the tumeric medley latte.  As I do not do dairy I ask for oat milk, makes it more creamier without the dairy. Has enough sweetness, earthiness with a hint of ginger. Be aware there is a charge for switching but reasonable in comparison to other places. Do not expect this to be a Starbucks , Prêt-à-manger, Eataly, or any other chain coffee shop. For crying out loud is a small coffee shop that is located in New York City. I am not trying to justify the pricing and space,  just calling out it for your awareness.

 I like the hours this coffee and tea shop has. Is a huge plus for me to unwind without alcohol and treat myself with a tea latte as the temperatures starts to drop."
87,grounded-new-york,2018-12-01,5.0,"My favorite neighborhood cafe! 

I used to come here more when I lived nearby but I still  come time to time when I need a cozy place to work or read. 

The cafe is the type of cozy yet spacious that I have yet to find elsewhere in manhattan. There's lots of seating (but they do get crowded) and they open until 9! There is a wide variety of drinks and smoothies as well as sandwiches. 

Lots of people come here to work on laptops and there are plugs by the wall as well as WiFi. My favorite spot is their red sofa where you can sink into and read a book. I would describe this place as comfortable and cozy so it's not y'all artificial instagram cafe, it's one were you can stay awhile and feel at home.

Greats vibes overall."
87,grounded-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,A new favorite spot in the West Village to get some great artisanal tea and work at the same time. 10/10 recommended.
87,grounded-new-york,2019-09-26,5.0,"I don't like coffee typically, but I make an exception for the espresso served here. I always come in and get an iced dirty chai, and they make, to date, the best dirty chai I've ever had anywhere. Amazing.

Also, I'm not sure what time some of the other people in these reviews went in, but I've always only had AMAZING customer service here. It's one of the only places I've been in NYC with friendly, smiling and helpful employees. I tend to spend time there later in the day, so maybe the earlier scheduled baristas are different, but I've never felt disrespected at Grounded."
87,grounded-new-york,2019-07-21,4.0,"Cozy coffee shop with lots of character.  Really giving the craft of caffeine meaning with cardamom coffee!  They were kind enough to let me sample it. My dirty iced chai with oat milk was $9 m, which seems insane. I support the amount if the mission is truly organic-fair trade-etc, but the price caught me off guard.  The smoothies are alright, just not as expertly executed as the coffee beverages.  I love how many snack options they have. My friend enjoyed her hummus sandwich."
87,grounded-new-york,2019-07-20,3.0,$6 latte should taste better IMO. I got a honey vanilla rooibos latte and it was pretty bland. My friends got a honey nut latte (waaay too sweet) and matcha tea latte (also somewhat bland). Otherwise it's a cute spot to linger for studying / work. We came here to eat our Magnolia bakery desserts with coffee -- I recommend this because magnolia has no seating!
87,grounded-new-york,2019-09-16,1.0,"SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE. 

And if for some reason you're really dying to spend $12 on a bagel and coffee, there are plenty of other places in NYC you can buy overpriced cafe food WITHOUT the added RUDE customer service you get at Grounded.

I've been coming here for 2 years, but yesterday will definitely be my last day. I really liked the ambiance (except the days the music is terrible), which is why I kept going, but it's hard to ignore their high prices. And now the terrible customer service has completely turned me off.

I came into the cafe yesterday around 11am. After I received my food order from the kitchen, I asked the barista for a cup of ice. The barista was a heavy-set Caucasian female with dark hair that was pulled back. Her skin color is completely irrelevant and I am NOT taking any jabs at her appearance, but I don't want this incident blamed on the wrong person if a manager happens to read this review. She was the one serving customers their coffee drinks from behind the pickup counter at the time I came in. After I asked for a cup of ice, she said in a rude tone, ""There is some over there"". I then said ""Oh, there is ice over there?""  She then again in a rude way said, ""Yes, that's why we have cups over there for people to use"". I then looked over and realized that she was referring to the jug of iced water that is left out for anyone to use. It's great that Grounded has that, but I wasn't asking for water. I then said ""Oh, could I just have a regular cup with just ice?"". She then again pointed me in the direction of the jug of water. It was at that point I realized she was just indirectly refusing to give me a cup of ice. So I turned back to her and said ""So...I can't have a cup of ice"". Shen then smirked and simply said ""NO"".

First, if a customer is paying $4 for a bagel, I don't think it's too much to ask to give them a cup of ice, which in case they forgot, is literally just frozen water.

Second, let's say they were trying to be sustainable and cut down on costs and be conservative with plastic cup usage, she could have just said that and offered to put ice in one of their water cups.

Third, let's say for some bizarre reason they were running low on ice... perhaps they use an ice machine and it wasn't working properly. She could have just said that as well.

Basically, there were plenty of things she could have said without being rude, dismissive, and snooty.  I will not be back and I will certainly no longer refer this place to friends!"
87,grounded-new-york,2018-03-25,3.0,"Coffee to go is a good idea at this shop. The place is extremely overpacked on a Sunday afternoon and the body heat is overwhelming. There's a nice bench outside to sit and sip your coffee in a secluded, cute, WV street. 

Pro Tip: they serve up Murray's bagels to go -- again, you'll have to endure the body heat inside waiting, but fresh Murray's bagels are almost worth it."
87,grounded-new-york,2019-09-03,1.0,"This place has really gone downhill. $I've been coming here for 2 years, but no more. The prices are ridiculous - $3 for a small cup of coffee, and this cup actually had coffee grounds in it! Then I get to witness an employee tell a person in a motorized wheelchair that they can't use their space because they'd block other customers. Sure, you're right, it's a tight space, but did you say the same to the couple with the baby stroller blocking the same space? I doubt it."
87,grounded-new-york,2019-07-28,5.0,"Love this coffee shop! Huge for NY standards (anyone on here saying it's small should prob move out of nyc or stick to Starb). Plenty of outlets. They play good music. Have a good variety of coffee/teas. They have a skylight that lets natural light in and plants (my fav part).

Only con: WiFi was wonky while I was there. Not sure if this happens often"
87,grounded-new-york,2019-11-16,2.0,"FYI: They turn OFF their WiFi on the weekends ""so people can talk and spend time together."" Do not come here if you plan on doing work unless you have a personal hotspot and noise cancelling headphones. If you're coming here to relax or read, know that they play pop/dance music loudly.

Coffee is good but on the pricy side and customer service is subpar."
87,grounded-new-york,2020-01-26,1.0,"I used to absolutely love this place. You could always rely on a wonderful pot of loose leaf tea, with a huge variety of teas from which to choose. This evening we came at approximately tea time and were told that there were ""no teapots left."" Looking around the crowded cafe, we saw only one tea pot in use. When we asked about this, the woman who was running the place said they only have one tea pot. We were, rightly, irate. After all, the chalkboard outside advertises ""60 organic teas by the cup, ounce or pot."" So how can Grounded call itself a tea house if they only have one teapot and ""all the rest are broken""??? Whaaaa? When we complained the manager told us to ""file a police action."" What happened to ""the customer is always right?"" I'm sad, because I always enjoyed coming here, and the pistachio financiers are excellent. Not coming back."
87,grounded-new-york,2018-07-20,5.0,"PLANT GAME STRONG.

DRINK GAME STRONG.

WiFi is pretty strong.

Bathroom game less strong.

Overall an amazing place to work."
87,grounded-new-york,2017-05-27,5.0,"The rose black tea latte here is to die for. I cannot wait to bring everyone I know here just to try a sip of it! Not only is it super asthetically pleasing, it is also very aromatic. I am a huge fan of anything rose, and I was so busy smelling my latte, I didn't even want to drink it! It was a little sweeter than I would have liked, so I'll probably ask for fewer pumps of syrup the next time I visit. However, it is definitely going to be the first thing I order.

I also ordered the breakfast burrito, which was good, but nothing to rave about. I appreciated that it was freshly prepared and served with a side of salsa. However, it also took way longer than I was expecting it to take! I think it took about 20-25 minutes for them to finish making it, which was surprising.

I like that there are a bunch of seating/standing options for those who want to hang around for a little longer, and for those who are just grabbing a quick espresso shot. The lighting is decent in the back of the cafe for studying and doing work. 

There is a bathroom available and also complementary wifi that worked pretty well. This is definitely a gem of a find in the West Village area!"
87,grounded-new-york,2018-08-29,3.0,"It's a pretty chill coffee joint, with a decent selection of hot teas and coffees. There are also baked goods for purchase.

The space is known for being a longstanding staple of the area, and has many cushioned seats for those perusing books, on laptops, or just hangin'. It also boasts natural lighting and plants.

Honestly, I didn't find this place *so* comfortable that I wanted to stay longer than necessary. I've been here 3 times now, and each time I felt too distracted by the 1) noise, 2) the worn-out cushions, or tiny wood benches, and 3) constant smell of grease that permeates my clothes.

Drinks-wise, it's okay. I didn't find this place special enough for me to make a detour. DEFINITELY not a great place to meet friends / have a coffee chat, since the seating situation is abysmally crowded."
87,grounded-new-york,2018-08-21,4.0,"Grounded is a coffee shop I'd visit regularly if it weren't so darn packed all the time. The coffee is always good and it's a good spot to read or get work done- if you can get a seat.

Pros:
- Great coffee
- Large menu of food and pastries
- Friendly staff
- Clean-ish bathroom
- Beautiful atmosphere: there's greenery and nice decor
- Lots of seating space
- WiFi and outlets

Cons:
- ALWAYS packed and cramped. I often need to stand at one of the standing tables or just leave.
- The aforementioned seating space and outlets will most likely be taken."
87,grounded-new-york,2018-06-24,3.0,"My boyfriend and I got the matcha lattes here one day. They were not mixed right at first with way too much matcha powder (see picture). We asked them to make them again and the server was very kind and even asked if he had added the right amounts of each thing. On second attempt the latte tasted better (would not get from here again) but I do want to try some of the other food and pastries that they offer ! 

Side note : no dogs allowed ):"
87,grounded-new-york,2019-11-09,3.0,Really like their selection of teas and great lavender lattes. Would come here every weekend to do work. Now they stopped having WiFi on weekends so I have to find another work spot with good coffee/tea
87,grounded-new-york,2018-12-17,5.0,"Cozy cafe in the West Village. But, don't expect to take a quiet phone call here because the music is quite loud. Great place to work though if you have headphones or can drown out the noise. There's a lot of seating and outlets as well. I got a latte and was happy to down it as soon as I sipped it. Do try to be courteous with how long you stay though. Staff are patient and nice!"
87,grounded-new-york,2019-10-22,4.0,"Not a coffee drinker, but I do love a good turkey sandwich and this place has one of the yummiest in the city! That lemon aoili! Holy moly! It is made in house and absolutely delicious - I wish they sold it in tubs as I can't get enough.

It can be stressful to find a spot to sit and eat in the middle of the day; it seems most people park themselves and laptops and take up most of the tablespace.

The staff attitude situation is notable (other than the sandwich maker who is awesome and always smiling). 

Overall, it's a good spot for a quick lunch so long as you're okay taking it to go."
87,grounded-new-york,2019-05-02,3.0,"Love Grounded but a few issues are driving me to write this review:

- Wi-Fi is slow and spotty, which doesn't make this as good of a working cafe as it might seem

- temperature inside is way too hot!

- music is too loud and spotty (assume that's the Wi-Fi)

Surely all of these issues aren't helped by the number of people coming through. Generally it's great place for coffee, conversation, and work :)"
87,grounded-new-york,2019-03-15,5.0,"Wonderful, down to earth (no pun intended) cafe in an utterly charming former garage or carriage house space by the look of it. 

They're open decently late. 

What I like about Grounded is it's nice but not ""too nice."" I.e. it's in a very rarified neighborhood but still feels warm and approachable."
87,grounded-new-york,2018-12-31,5.0,"Love this place - one of my favorite neighborhood spots. I've tried a few of the sandwiches and have yet to be disappointed - same with the coffee! Love the honey latte. Very quaint and cozy little space that always feels so inviting. Great ambiance, good music, and friendly service. The only downside I can think of is difficulty finding seats, so don't count on being able to sit right away."
87,grounded-new-york,2020-02-04,4.0,"Very cute interior and great selection of tea! I don't drink coffee so I cannot speak to that, but I had the rose hot chocolate and it was delicious (also a unique menu which I like). I also had a bagel, which I believe they get from a local bakery (not exactly sure though) and it was very good! It's small and was crowded both times I've been there, but I did go there around noon both times, so it makes sense that they would be busy around that time. The only downside is that you might not always find a place to sit. The first time I went there was no seating available and I got lucky the second time and found one table to work at."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-03-16,5.0,"Shoutout to all matcha lovers! At first I didn't think the drinks here would WOW me. Indeed, it sure did. I think I've waited too long to finally check this place out. I love going to Cha Cha Matcha. I didn't go there this time which I felt very bummed because they were closed due to corona virus. Nonetheless, Matchaful is my new favorite spot. There's a variety of matcha beverages on the menu. It was a challenge for me to choose! The seasonal menu always changes. Be sure to try them before the next seasonal menu is up. I asked for their recommendations. She told me the Vanilla Zen and Indigo Glow is a top pick! I went along with the Vanilla Zen (iced). Top layer of the drink is a green color. I can tell easily it is high quality grade matcha. At the bottom layer is the vanilla. I did not mix it when I took my first sip. So what I tasted first is this pleasant sweet vanilla, creamy, smooth, and mapley oat milk. Gosh the oat milk taste so good! There are specks of cinnamon, which gave it spice and sweetness. When you mix it, the sweetness of the drink dies down a bit from the matcha layer. The matcha does have the earthy bitterness. Oh I couldn't stop sipping into the straw. The vanilla zen also contains ashwagandha. It's an herb that helps calm your mind, which aids in stress relief. I love how they use plant based milk. It's very nutritious. Also, unrefined sugars are used which is better for your health and body. Plus, how can you not like their bamboo straws? Fantastic. I didn't try their baked goods. From what I saw, it's dairy free, grain free, gluten free, or egg free. Very great for those on a restriction or have an allergy. You can purchase matcha powder here or even their kit to make your own matcha at home. Here's a heads up. Their drinks are expensive than other places you might be use to. Don't be surprised. The quality is truly outstanding!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-01-28,5.0,"Not only is this place serene with wonderful organic vegan food & drink options but they employ friendly, knowledgeable, and kind humans. 

Coming here is one the highlights of my week. 
Everything is so delicious and made lovingly. 
If you love Matcha as much as I do then wherever you are in the city you'll give it your best to effort to make it to the up and coming new quaint Canal street."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-01-27,4.0,"If you like matcha, and a little piece of quiet in the heart of canal Street, this place will warm your soul. 
I've tried them all, but my favorite is wise warrior.  The hint of coconut is so wonderful
Very sweet friendly service. And the pastries are also fresh and a nice addition to your matcha"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-01-22,3.0,"I love matcha, and the drinks here do not disappoint. Compared to the other matcha specialty cafes in NYC- Cha Cha Matcha, etc.- Matchaful is little more grown-up and serious in terms of offerings, decor, and service- with higher prices to match.

The vanilla zen is amazing- slightly sweet, but in a natural way, and still matcha-forward.

The food items look beautiful, and everything has upfront ingredients listings that are clearly very healthy, but I have not tried anything because I have a hard time justifying spending $6 on 1.5 bites of cheesecake.

The employees seem great; I noticed that they go out of their way to help customers select a drink they'll like.

I would come here more often, but it's just SO expensive at almost $10 for a very small beverage. I think this must be why it's often empty-ish when I pass, despite being so cozy and pretty."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-05-09,5.0,"High quality matcha with sophisticated flavor combinations. Very cute and peaceful shop. I continue to order their matcha online so I can make it at home. I drink the Kiwami by itself and I use the Hikari for lattes. Both have creamy, fresh flavors that whisk very well."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-05-18,5.0,Iced vanilla zen latte is delicious !! The oat milk is to die for. Great matcha flavor. 5 stars!
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-03-03,5.0,"Matchaful is a photographable cafe where Millennials like to come and play. If you want to try the best matcha in the city, then look no further. I was feeling a bit under the weather, so I decided to order the liquid cold with matcha, fresh ginger, fresh turmeric, vanilla, cinnamon, black peppercorn, cardamom, cordyceps, maple, and oat milk. It's creamy and balanced flavor profile worked well as a warm midday pick-me-up. It was exactly what I needed to soothe my cold-like symptoms. Also, I ordered a heart-shaped scone that I devoured within seconds. The baristas were knowledgeable, patient, and friendly individuals. I will be sure to visit again when I am in the city! Until next time!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-01-09,4.0,"I tried the hojicha latte and the vanilla zen here.

The hojicha latte was pretty underwhelming. I got it with macadamia milk I believe. I think the tea flavor could've been stronger.

The vanilla zen was much better! The flavor was matcha-y but I liked the addition of vanilla and the bit of sweetness. I can see why it's one of their more popular drinks, and I would order it again.

I wouldn't go here often because of the steep prices, which is why it's not 5 stars. I'd go here for a rare treat when I'm in the city :)"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-11-15,3.0,"A trendy cute matcha store near Chinatown! We got a hot vanilla zen and an iced cacao dream. Prices are high, but I guess it stems from the quality of the ingredients and the reusable straw that comes with iced drinks! 

 I was confused cause it looked like we should order at the end of the bar, yet the barista was standing and staring at us from the middle of the bar, so I went up to him to order.  He took my order , and then said in a snappy tone ""next time order at the end of the bar, k?"" I thought it might've just been me but friends agreed that he did have a snappy tone of voice. 

The vanilla zen was really good and I love the ""ZEN"" made with matcha on top! 

The cacao dream however, was below expectations. The drink was very clumpy, it had a few ingredients to it but I could only taste the cacao and matcha. I guess since they both come from powders- and the drink is iced, that's why it was so clumpy? Every time I took a sip, I got some little clumps of cocoa or matcha powder."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-11-04,4.0,"I got the cacao dream. It was made of cacao, matcha, maple syrup, macadamia milk, and other ingredients. I don't like it too sweet so I asked for light maple syrup. The drink came out good. The sweetness was on point, no too sweet and could still taste a hint of maple syrup. 

This place is also environmental friendly! They give you a bamboo straw for the drink and if you bring it back next time, you will get 40 cents off your order. I have to say the drink was pricy though. Cacao dream was $8 without tax. Their barista told me they use premium quality so I guess that's why the drink was expensive.
 

Updated: the drink was $8.4 and I just noticed that iced drinks are 40 cents more. I thought the 40 cents was the tax but it was for the ice. Therefore the prices on the menu are tax included."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-02-12,4.0,"The drinks here are more pricey and since it was my first time here I wanted to try one drink and see how I liked it. I was very impressed with the matcha flavors in my Vanilla Zen order, I ordered it hot and they topped it off with a cute topping of matcha that read 'Zen'. The experience of watching my drink order and the interior space is very nice and definitely makes the cafe feel relaxed."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-09-29,5.0,"Tldr: delicious, thoughtful matcha shop

This is not your everyday matcha shop. They are so innovative in terms of flavor combination! And, they are vegan friendly and use all sorts of non-dairy milk. I tried their house made organic coconut milk and my mind is completely blown. It was fragrant and light and complemented my matcha perfectly. 

I got their Flower Focus (coconut milk instead of hemp) and my friend got the Watermelon Passion. I personally liked the light floral, fragrant properties of my Flower Focus more. It uses GABA tea which is a kind of matcha (I think) and it's supposed to help boost your focus. The Watermelon Passion had a punch of acidity which helps give you an energy/wake up boost. It's also full of ingredients that are great for your skin.

Another plus is how they commit to being eco friendly! They give you a bamboo straw to drink your tea with, and if you come back with your straw or if you bring a reusable cup, you get a discount!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-09-09,4.0,"I got vanilla zen for my drink. She said that's the most popular one in the store.

Vanilla Zen: hikari, pure vanilla extract, ashwagandha, cinnamon, Mct, maple, hemp milk. 
Sounds pretty fancy!

Besides matcha flavor. It had a strong bean taste, I guess that's from hemp milk, this was my first time had hemp milk, and I loved it , and the taste was so amazing with matcha drink. 

It was $9 and iced add $.40 so this drink cost more than $10. 
bit pricy, but the quality worth it. Plus they use reusable bamboo straw. Very cool and environmentally friendly."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-03-19,4.0,"Gabrielle, the manager, invited my friend and me back for another try of their Indigo Glow. It was definitely a lot better. I've been back to Matchaful a couple more times afterwards. I have to say that they do offer quality matcha and have very creative drinks. I've decided to splurge and just purchased their 1kg kiwami matcha. I hope they make it through this rough period!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-02-12,5.0,"I loved the matcha here!!! The cafe is also super cute and instagram-able. Their matcha is super good; super smooth and if you bring your own cup, they give you $0.40 off!!! And they can fill it till the top without extra charge, so I got a 24oz matcha for the same price as a 12oz one. They also only have plant-based milk so just an FYI!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-10-18,5.0,"I found this place randomly on Yelp after looking up matcha cafes downtown. I was pleased to find this recently opened cafe in Chinatown, as I previously have not been too impressed by the matcha offerings in New York. 
My friends and I came here on a Sunday morning, just a little after 9am, which is their weekend opening time. There were a couple of people in line already, and a few staff members behind the counter. They have a range of both hot and cold drinks, some as simple as matcha lattes, and some with more intricate additions, such as ashwagandha and turmeric. The drinks with more additions are priced up to $10, which is a lot for tea. 
I opted for a matcha latte with almond milk ($6), and one of the staff behind the counter made it. We didn't wait long for our drinks, and we were given biodegradable bamboo straws. 
The seating area features small tables, wooden benches, and cushions. It's a very comfortable place to while away the morning with a good book. 
While undeniably pricy, I loved the cafe's aesthetic, quality of drinks, and friendly service. This is the matcha cafe that I've been waiting for, and will frequent a lot more in future."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-11-07,4.0,"Was lured into Matchaful when I saw the Indigo Glow (matcha, taro, maquiberry, herbal collagen booster, maple, oatmilk - $9) on the seasonal menu. I love taro and matcha drinks separately, so wanted to try this mixture. Was pleasantly surprised that there was a good balance of both. Specialty drinks are pricey these days, but the overall experience at Matchaful was nice - was not crowded on a Thursday mid-morning, got to watch the ""tea""-tender mix my drink like I would at a bar, and had quiet time working with access to wifi."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-09-14,4.0,"I hate to admit it, but I liked this place. Ugh- such an IG millenial era trap and overpriced beyond belief, but the ladies working behind the counter are kind and patient with questions, and I can't get over how nice the bamboo reusable straws are. I got their summer strawberry matcha iced drink and heck was it tasty. You don't want to know how much I paid for it though... and the price is why I won't be back....often."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-09-12,4.0,"Very lovely cafe. Due to the set-up of this cafe, you feel so relaxed and at peace. I loved how you can walk through the whole process of how they make your drink. Great variety of plant-based milks. Price is quite pricey compared to others but I love how they use bamboo straws. Sustainable and good for our environment. If you bring the straw back, you get 40 cents off your purchase! Such a chill cafe. I personally wouldn't study here since their tables are too low but there are people I saw working on their laptops."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-08-27,4.0,"A new matcha cafe in the peripheral areas of Chinatown Manhattan.  In the passage of my professional travels I've encountered this business with a open mind and without judgment.  Matcha is healthy.  Priced too steep.  When examining the drink menu on the black board one drink in particular lured me like Mary Howitt's 1829 poem ""Will you walk into my parlour?' said the Spider to the Fly.""  Customer service is five stars as the staff was very informative of their tea options and what is embedded.  This business utilizes environmental sustainable reusable bamboo straws which customers can retain and reuse at one's own mugs.  I had the pleasure to attain such a straw.  The staff gave a brief explanation how to easily clean using soap or a craft pipe cleaner.  Seating and tables are available for a relaxed appeal with books on each table and a coaster.  Atmosphere appears very sustainable environmental.  Sales receipts can only be either emailed or texted to phone due to their cash registers' inability to print receipts as the new registers have gone ""paperless"" moving forward with progress.  Business cards are available for grabs.

Vanilla Zen $9.40 (calm)
Hikari, pure vanilla extract, ashwagandha, cinnamon, mct, maple, hemp milk.  A lot of these terms I have never heard of and don't know what these ingredients entails.  This drink was noted for ""calm"" which is what lured me into Matchaful's parlour.  I had a hard difficult day and turned into a pounding headache which I greatly desired a phlegmatic disposition at day's end.  This drink was too matcha green for me like Elphaba Thropp, a fictional character in ""Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West"" by Gregory Maguire.  It was overpowered by too much matcha.  I was hoping a subtle matcha taste for iced tea.  Unfortunately, I did not taste any vanilla.  I did see cinnamon embedded.  Price is too steep for me for this drink."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-10-06,5.0,Delicious and creative drinks with cute presentation. The calming vanilla matcha + oat milk drink was perfect on a chilly autumn day. Inside is quite relaxing and a nice ambiance to catch up with a friend or even bring a date.
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-10-21,5.0,"Stopped by during a recent trip to NY and ordered the Vanilla Zen, as i was told it's their most popular. And WOW, I completely understand why it's so popular - it's a perfect mix of matcha, sweetness, and creaminess (ordered it with hemp milk). I wish I could have gone back and tried their other drinks as they also sound so delicious and creative (who would have thought to put turmeric in their matcha?!)

Also, can we talk about how gorgeous the place is? Perfect background from your next IG post ;-) 

Make sure to stop by and check it out before the pop up ends!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-10-20,4.0,Really cute matcha shop with very nice aesthetics. They have so many options on the menu in addition to seasonal drinks so I'd have to go back to try more. I went with one of the Fall seasonal ones and it was very tasty.
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-02-25,5.0,"Tasty drink, calm vibes, and nice baristas that taught me a few great things about my drink. Will definitely be back with my new reusable straw!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-08-22,4.0,"It's a cute matcha cafe- the drinks were pretty pricey ($6-8?) but everything was 30% off for their opening. The space is trendy but a bit small, and the tables are the tiny round ones that aren't that useful. The seating is sparse, and there aren't really outlets, so definitely not a cafe to come and work or chill for long times. Hopefully they'll change up their furniture a bit going forward!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-01-20,3.0,"Cute, friendly service, free bamboo straw, pricey, the drink tastes.. healthy (mostly like very matcha, very alternative milk)."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-08-09,5.0,"Favorite + BEST matcha shop in New York hands down! Everything is done traditionally, paying respects to the origin of this special beverage. They're super transparent about their sourcing and most of all their matcha is the best I've ever tasted. So smooth with no bitter after taste, and you can tell by the color that it's very high quality.

Pricing is very reasonable for the product you're receiving. Matcha latte is $6 which i think is very reasonable, as I've paid upwards of $6 for a matcha latte from coffee shops around the city and quality hasn't been great. 

Drinks are delicious and not full of sugar like other places! They use all unrefined sweeteners and organic ingredients which is hard to come by in NYC!

Staff are super friendly and space is beautiful. A++ Matchaful!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-01-19,5.0,"Love the vibe here, delicious matcha and decorated adorable inside. Prices are high but they're worth it!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-10-02,4.0,"They have a very aesthetically pleasing looking cafe!
They provide free bamboo straws along with every drink purchased. We bought a vanilla zen and a regular matcha latte. This place is all about being healthy for the environment and for you so you wont find any dairy milk options or simple syrups but maple syrup and oat milk instead(forexample). 
Only slightly downside is that it is quite expensive for a lattee but that comes with the many factors! Overall a cute cafe!"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-11-04,5.0,"Nice hip matcha place near the office. I ordered the classic matcha w macadamia milk and it's really good. I liked it better than cha cha matcha. Similarly, they offer a variety of plant-based milk.

The ambience is modern cozy, suitable for meetups."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-09-02,5.0,"Matcha tea and matcha flavored beverages have become wildly available all over NYC. A lot of coffee places (chains and independent) will offer Matcha lattes or even matcha flavored desserts. It used to be you could only get matcha things at a few cute Asian-y places. Unfortunately, most ""matcha"" or matcha lattes are not good, using grainy and poor quality cooking grade matcha, hastily thrown together with milk/mylk but still charging higher prices than your average green tea. This happens even at some of the dedicated matcha places that have popped up over the years (here's looking at you Matchabar) but is not so at Matchaful. At Matchaful, I find the drinks rather thoughtfully crafted. The ingredients well combined to create drinks that are unique, tasty, and utilize the nice matcha taste to the best effect. I also find that they have taken feedback from customers seriously over time, and have tried to have equal amounts of substance/quality product, as much as insta-worthy style. 

Some further notes; This place has a health conscious focus which might make it seem pricey for some people, however, matcha itself (traditionally) is in fact more of a luxury than it is being treated around the city, and so I think the pricing is appropriate. I have become a regular and will continue to frequent Matchaful, looking forward to their seasonal drink offerings. Right now, I'm really loving the Flower Focus and Midsummer seasonals and previously I loved the hot tahini matcha drink they had. In addition, the refrigerated items, such as the rose bar, are really refreshing, delicious, and my personal favorite of their new food offerings.

In closing, you will enjoy Matchaful if you are interested in new uses for matcha that are aesthetically pleasing, health conscious, and not overly sweet (although the employees are friendly and will not judge you for asking for a sweeter drink). As something of an Asian tea purist and enthusiast, it takes a lot for me to be such a fan of a non-traditional tea place but so far I have been consistently pleased by Matchaful and their journey from Smorgasburg stands, pop-ups in Dumbo/Soho, to their new Canal street café."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-03-03,5.0,"Amazing EVERYTIME! I love the drinks so matchaa!! Lol but really though there drinks nourish my soul. Every time i get the chance to come to new york this is my one and only stop. The servers are amazing and always so knowledgeable on what they are crafting. The atmosphere of the store is also impeccable, especially being in the city the really do have a way of making you feel like you stepped in to a chill vibe. I love just a plain matcha latte iced but its fun that they have so many different blends ill usually try a new one in store and then my normal one to go! Also the fact that they are plant based is just awesome to me and the reusable bamboo straw like what the heck !?!? I couldn't ask for a better cafe please make a store in maryland !"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-09-14,5.0,Service is top notch! (Super friendly and helpful) free bamboo straw with iced drinks is a plus! I ordered the matcha latte with almond milk as well as the overnight oats (peanut butter and jelly). Everything tasted fresh and delicious! Decor inside is really aesthetic and the music playing is calm- so a perfect place to study! There are various books scattered on the tables and they are interesting to look at. I believe they also have tastings! 10/10 would come back- only downside is that it's a little expensive (but I understand why since the quality is too notch). Great place for a treat yourself day :)
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-01-28,1.0,"Their matcha isn't anything special to go out of the way to come here, but the customer service is beyond atrocious. There were four of them behind the counter but just one making drinks and I waited a while before the one barista finished and came up to me, not saying a word even after I greeted him in a friendly way. All I got was a glaring look and acted as if he was sooo inconvenienced to help. And when I asked, ""Do I pay up there?"" he nodded and glared and you could tell he wanted to roll his eyes. If he hates it so much, why work there? Your life must really suck. Arrogant pretentious hipster? You're just a barista LMAO. A girl watched the barista make the matcha and came to ring me up and said, ""You got the almond matcha?"" I actually got the oat, not the almond but of course I didn't want to correct them at this point because they both were unfriendly and  would be annoyed if they had to remake the drink. So not only are they rude but they can't get a simple drink order correct. It tasted horrible so I threw it out. Never returning."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-10-24,5.0,"SO GOOD. I stumbled upon this place when my friend and I were staying at the Sheraton across, and she loves matcha so I popped in here. I tried the iced vanilla zen and WOW, it was the perfect mix of sweet with matcha, and I've had a lot of matcha in LA. I now make it a point to come here everytime I'm in the area, a bit pricy ($9.40) but you can really taste the quality."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-10-30,5.0,"Walked in on my way to Little Italy, what a pleasant surprise! I browsed their menu and settled on the Vanilla Zen. It was perfect for my nerves, and I love that its made with ashwaganda and hemp milk. It has a slight headiness upon the first sip, which graduates to a measure of creaminess I haven't yet experienced with non-dairy milks. I'm betting it was the MGT. The drink soothed my nerves, and I was able to enjoy a great afternoon in Manhattan thanks to my short stop into this wonderful tea shop. But it's so much more than that.

There are little nooks to sit, a well-stocked fridge area to purchase items to go. Now, can you please come to Montclair??"
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-11-02,5.0,"Obsessed with this place. If I lived in NYC, would go every day. I can't drink coffee anymore, but matcha is my jam. You don't get that awful caffeine crash and it's so much better for you. I had an iced matcha latte with oat milk both days, and it was perfection."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2020-01-21,5.0,"Honestly one of my favorite cafes to go to in NYC. They're both creative and traditional in their curation of matcha and other teas on the menu. I'd recommend getting the hojicha latte -- I always get mine iced, even in the winter! Their snack selections are also cute, healthy, and yummy. I forgot exactly what I got, but it was a dessert made of cacao powder and dates and it was solid."
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-11-08,5.0,The scone is so good and the vanilla zen really makes you calm and relaxed. Everyone looking for something to help them zen out from the fast paced life of NYC please try the vanilla zen!!! Won't be disappointed
88,matchaful-new-york-5,2019-10-07,5.0,"This place is worth with more than 5 stars. Everything is healthy. Even cheesecake which is so delicious. They only used plan based milk also. The scone is my favorite. I ordered horchata latte with almond milk. Since I am matcha lover, this place doesn't make me upset. The interior decoration is very unique. Very unique shop for me."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2020-03-10,5.0,"Always on the hunt for a good latte while in NYC. With reviewers raving about their Black Sesame lattes, I had to come in to try one.

Imagine the disappointment I felt when they said that they ran out at 1pm on a Saturday. Ms. Bobalicious here couldn't help but throw a little tantrum. What? Are you kidding me? Seriously?  Oh man...but I came all the way from New Jersey. I think the cashier was afraid to make eye contact with me at this point. 

All the items are written on their beautiful blue chalkboard. Having to make another decision, I decided to try their Hojicha latte, it's a ""New"" item and I hope it becomes permanent. It's roasted green tea leaves/stem and because I love eating nuts, this drink offers a nutty taste. It was absolutely lovely, delicious and the sugar level couldn't be more perfect. It's not easy to find this flavored latte so this is a must try if you've never had it. It already has me craving it again.  

Place has a wonderful, quiet vibe with large windows where you can people watch. The back offers table seating. I plan to come back to try their famous Black Sesame latte. Maybe this time I should come one hour earlier."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2020-02-22,5.0,"Adorable coffee shop with a slight Asian tint to its decor. There are open, communal tables that are wide and spacious. The ample windows means that the cafe is well lit with natural light. Perfect for doing work in.At 10 am on a Saturday, there was plenty of space for us, though after an hour or so space starts to fill up quickly. We were in for a surprise the day we visited, too, in the form of some unexpected lion friends.

We came when they were still having their Lunar New Year special flavor, which happened to be the almond cookie latte. For our first round of drinks (as we were planning on squatting and doing some work for the day), we got the almond cookie latte and the chai latte. The almond cookie latte was interesting. You could definitely smell the aroma of an almond cookie. The taste wasn't as prominent, though there were cookie crumbles that added to the flavor. Fun to try once, but I wouldn't get it again. The chai latte, on the other hand, I would get again (and did). It was aromatic and spicy, exactly what I was looking for.

After getting a solid chunk of work in, it was time for a refill! Or, to follow the language of the funny sign they had at our table: after two hours of parking, it was time to refill the meter! For our refill, we split an almond cookie, and also had a matcha latte and the chai latte again. The chai latte was still my favorite. The matcha latte was fairly strong and a bit bitter for me. Prices are reasonable though some of the specialty drinks can get pricey. My other hitch was that although we ordered for here, the drinks were served to us in to-go cups, instead of something more sustainable.

Overall, it was a well-lit, roomy, quiet place to do work in, with outlets, wifi, and an interesting bathroom with a golden dragon faucet. The only catch? Our cozy spot for a quiet grind got infiltrated by some friendly lions! The day we were there coincided with a lion dance, so we ended up right in the midst of it. The lions actually came into the cafe and performed, leaving a trail of confetti and noise in their wake, and then there was a martial arts performance right in front of the open doors. While a novelty, it was a distraction that effectively put an end to the day's productivity. Made for a memorable experience, though! It's definitely gracing its place as one of my favorite places to grab a latte and work in the neighborhood."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2020-02-22,4.0,"I had about an hour to kill while waiting for a friend in the area, so I stepped into The Granddaddy for a drink. They have a bunch of baked goods as well as a very wide variety of drinks. I ordered their black sesame latte, which was really good. I've been really into black sesame lately so this hit the spot. 

They have three sections in the cafe - the front couches are a no laptop space, the middle tables are for laptops, and the back couches are also a no-laptop space. The laptop area does have a two hour ""parking"" time. I'm not sure how well they're enforcing these rules, because a woman on the couch in the back area was on her laptop the entire hour that I was there. 

The bathroom is very clean and smells amazing. Ask the barista for the code after you've made a purchase."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2020-02-20,4.0,"Cute little coffee shop on Grand St. that served up some delicious coffee. It was a quick in and out visit. We popped in, ordered our drinks, and took them to go. The coffee was a dark roast, strong, and fixed my caffeine needs immediately. 

If I lived in NY, I could see myself coming here often!"
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-09-21,3.0,"The Granddaddy is a relaxed, lowkey cafe compared with the busier streets of Chinatown. It is a fantastic place to both get work done - over half the people inside the cafe were on their laptops (Wifi is great) - or catch up with friends.

My friend got the sesame latte with oat milk ($1 extra) and I got the sencha green loose leaf tea. Their other specialties include sparkling frescas, flavored lemonade, egg creams, as well as typical coffeeshop orders. 
They source pastries from local bakeries such as Balthazar and Davidovich, though several are plastic wrapped and don't seem very fresh by the afternoon.

Service is a bit understaffed on the weekend. There was only one person working the counter who had to both make drinks and take orders."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2020-02-07,4.0,"Vibe is super chill and relaxing. There is a good amount of tables and 2 small lounge areas to sit and drink your coffee! Overall, the flavors are interesting. I ordered the black Sesame Latte which was okay, definitely tasted more of the milk than the black sesame. I would come back if I have the chance to try the other flavors but only if I'm around the area."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-06-29,5.0,"I've been coming to The Granddaddy since they opened, I think. I was looking for a non Starbucks cafe on Yelp, saw their ad and that they just opened, so I gave it a shot. While I forget to check in a lot, it's always my go to in the neighborhood. 

The prices are pretty good ($4ish for most things), and the coffee is actually tasty. Free water is a perk, but not the driving factor. The space, however, is the real motivator to come. I miss old school cafes with comfy chairs, and they mixed that with some of the tables for people trying to get work done. Definitely recommend this joint"
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-04-30,5.0,"*Black Sesame Latte*
.
When I saw this on the menu, I knew I just had to try it since I love black sesame ice cream  It was just as good as I had thought it to be & I'm so glad I tried it  If you love black sesame or just want to try a new flavor, then this is perfect

The ambiance is low key & you can just relax or work on your laptop."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-12-11,5.0,"This is one of my favorite coffee places in Chinatown to lounge in. 

It's busy, so go early or at an off hour. They have plugs, fast WiFi, and a super clean bathroom. The coffee and pastrys are good and not too pricey. They also have some alcohol at times. 

The space is super airy and relaxing. Most people who are there are students and are on laptops doing school work. 

One of my favorite things every now and then is to sit in the 'laptop free zone' and to play chinese checkers. It's rare that I find that game in a cafe , but one of the things that bring me back to this place specifically."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-08-05,5.0,"I've come here to do work on several occasions and it's always been a pleasant experience. There's a lot of space at the tables, there's plugs, the WiFi is fast, and it's a roomy place that isn't super crowded at all times. 

It's located conveniently in the midst of Chinatown and is overall a pretty cool place to hide out from the hustle and bustle of NYC. 

They sell beer on top of the usual fare of coffee and baked goods. Prices are reasonable, people are friendly enough, and the service has been good. 

Pretty great place, I recommend it."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-08-28,5.0,Cookies are to die for! Big cookie guy here and these hit the spot. Just wish they were hot but they still have great flavor. Matcha latte was great too and the area has a good amount of space to sit to study/work or just chill out in the laptop free zone. Clean bathroom too. Love this place.
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-06-26,4.0,"I came here for breakfast on a Tuesday morning.  It was a larger space than I expected with a lot of seating including comfortable couches.  The tables seem to be for the people with laptops.  The couches were laptop free zones.  We ordered a hot black sesame latte, iced coffee, and two cheddar scallion scones.  Their pastries come from Balthazar.  The scone was tasty and fresh.  The black sesame latte was hot and had a lot of black sesame.  It was interesting since most cafes don't have it.  I would come back again for a coffee or breakfast.  The Japanese style coffee seems interesting so I would try that next time."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2018-11-02,4.0,"The Granddaddy is a cool, clean, open space coffeeshop located near Chinatown on Grand Street, right nearby the D/B. I came here on a weekday morning to work and check out the space and it really impressed me. The cafe has several different seatings: front window seats, couches up front and back (for non-laptop users) and two medium sized communal tables for working on. There are outlets as well for those who need to charge their electronics. WiFi is available, and it is recommended that you purchase a drink or pastry after every 2 hours to support the cafe and use their space.

Coffee wise- the basics here including matcha and Japanese styled iced coffee. I'm not too sure what's the difference but the coffee was definitely strong and flavorful. I also got their cheddar scone which I found out are made by Balthazar (as well as their other pastries). Price was right and they do take card and cash.

Overall, it's a great cafe but can get packed with laptop users! So be warned if you aren't able to sit down and unwind. The interior is beautiful too.

I would definitely come back if I'm in the area. Pretty low key ambience.

Accepts card and cash.
Bathroom available.

Drink up!"
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-06-10,3.0,"Overall: 3

A lot of people studying/working on laptops. Much more of a quiet vibe vs. a place to chat with friends. It's a small coffee shop with a lot of seating, but there was no AC when I went, so a little difficult to sit in there. Neighborhood is ok and interior design is average."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-03-25,4.0,"While not my local coffee shop, I do find myself here relatively often. A big room with lots of seating for reading, studying, etc... Quality coffee, good pastries, and right in the ballpark for what espresso drinks should cost in the LES ($3-$3.50 range).

In the event you need to use the rest room, they have some pretty nice ones that won't give you flashbacks to having to relieve yourself in the CBGB bathroom. Always a plus."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-03-29,4.0,"Happy to have a spacious, modern, trendy coffeeshop like this one in Chinatown! There's plenty of seating and it wasn't hard to find a seat. I was so excited to get the black sesame latte and it was so good, with plenty of ground sesame, but it was a tad expensive :("
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-05-22,3.0,"Coffee was OK. Owner came off a little standoff-ish and didn't seem too enthusiastic about his own stuff. My friend asked, ""What's a Japanese Iced Coffee?"" And he shrugged his shoulders and said in a monotone way, ""Just ice coffee."" Like bro if it's just iced coffee, then just write iced coffee. 

It's a beautiful, small coffee shop to hang out, but if you're looking for a place to study or work, beware that there is a tacky 2 hours only sign on the tables. 

I had an iced americano and the chia seed pudding. I liked both, and I get that I'm being picky, but I don't like how they use plastic utensils for the food (single use products are no bueno for the environment). 

Just eh. Would come back for coffee if in the area, but wouldn't be my first choice."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-04-03,4.0,"A more modern and relaxed cafe on the edge of Chinatown and LES. It's a great quiet place to get work done or just escape from the noise that is ubiquitous in NYC. 

We had the coffee and a few bites (croissants) to split. Both were nothing out of the ordinary, I don't know how coffee could stand out in NYC with a coffee store practically on every corner. However, the space has some great light if you want to sunbathe but not experience actual nature/NYC atmosphere."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-07-24,5.0,"Cool little neighborhood coffee shop! Great pastries, good coffee, and awesome music!  Fast, friendly service even though there's only one person chipping away at a very steady line of customers.

Came back and the barista knew what we wanted and asked ""Where are the kids?"" VERY personable! What a great coffee shop!"
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-03-06,4.0,"I stopped by for a quick drink today (a well deserved hot chocolate because it's FREEZING outside) and was genuinely impressed with the layout, the atmosphere, and the service. 

I was greeted immediately and my order was made very quickly and professionally. The cafe has a low counter, so you can watch your drink being made and make sure there's no funny business going on. This place doesn't do funny business 
It's not cramped and packed like many of the cafes you see in New York. Its actually VERY spacious. There are specific areas designed for laptop users and specific areas designed for people who just want to sit and chill around. I didn't sit at the laptop area, but everyone seemed like they were really in their own zone, which is a good thing! Because you won't have to worry about the person next to you talking too loudly while you're trying to get work done. The lounging chairs were fancy shmancy looking, but also comfy. It's a win-win. The only thing I would like to point out is that the cylinders placed at the back of the cafe that are used as tables are a little too low! It was inconvenient to have to hunch over to reach for my drink 

This cafe on the outskirts of the bustling Chinatown is a great place to stop by for a relaxing breather, though! My stay this first time wasn't for long, so I only ordered a hot chocolate (it was decadent and didn't taste watered down at all), but that was already tasty enough to have me visiting again! And it'll be the perfect spot for me to get some last minute studying in!"
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-11-13,4.0,"Great place to work if you can get a seat. It was a little packed when I first got there on a Wednesday morning but cleared out pretty quickly.

I love the vibe of this place. There are laptop free couches, tables and window facing stools. 

I had an oat chai and an almond croissant which were both decent. I'm not very picky about coffee shop food since I'm usually there to do work more so than eat. I thought it was a little more expensive than other places. $1 for non-dairy milk vs 50 cents at most places. 

The wifi cut out at a certain point and the woman next to me said it happened the last time she was there. It was pretty short and non-disruptive of my work so I didn't mind."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2018-10-27,3.0,"Wifi passport: SundayDriver

Nice coffee/tea/pastry shop. The pastries are from a couple different bakery shops. The coffee and tea are nice could be a bit stronger in my opinion though. A cozy and warm atmosphere with cute and modern interior decor. Slow paced and pretty quiet. Only one guy as cashier and making the beverages at the same time. Good for studying or working. Limits to 2 hours so others can come in and enjoy as well, but if you really need they suggest for you to purchase something again to get another 2 hours. Walkable to train station too."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2020-02-18,5.0,"Wifi, coffee, hip Chinatown kids, bathroom with a code, laptop free sofas. The Granddaddy is a cafe that has it all."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2018-07-22,5.0,"Stopped by this fairly new cafe on Grand to wait for dinner. This cafe is very spacious and big for chinatown/LES. I love the open space concept with natural lighting. There are long communal tables and bar seats for you to work on your laptop. In the back, there is a couch and comfy loungey chairs to just chill out (laptop free zone). The bathroom is also very clean which I appreciate. 

My boyfriend ordered the japanese style ice coffee and I got the thai tea. The japanese style ice coffee was really good. We didn't even need to put any sugar or cream/milk in it. The thai tea tasted like thai ice tea without the condensed milk. It had the flavor but was a little off since the only sweetener was simple syrup. The prices were also fair. Like a lot of other cafes, they load up on the ice (3/4 of the cup was ice). This would normally bother me but because I was drinking it so slow, the ice just melted and I got another cup of watered down coffee/tea. 

Overall, really love this place and would be back to either catch up with friends, relax, or study at!"
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-03-08,2.0,"I really wanted to love this Cafe. It's adorable and chill with the potted plants and hangout vibe. The laptop free zone is great for people who aren't there to work or play with their Macbooks. Their Black Sesame latte is a unique choice of drink that I love to indulge in every once in a while.

But there is one thing I just cannot understand -- which is the understated customer service. Every time I've been there, the baristas have been either flat out flippant, monotone and not at all the friendly service you would expect in such a wonderful interior and cozy environment. At first when I was assisted by a female barista, I was irked by how quiet and unfriendly she seemed. But later on I realized this was the standard and what to expect when visiting here. The guy baristas are the same, if not worse. I have yet to be greeted with a smile and how are you? greeting. It kind of blows my mind.

Today was my third visit and my last one. It's unfortunate because my work is a minute's walk away on Eldridge and Broome St. But I would rather get a great cup of coffee and customer service that warms your heart rather than the monotone service here."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-10-19,5.0,"Chocolate chip cookie and an ice cold beverage as my afternoon delight. I love how they put a hint of salt in the cookie as it intensifies the flavor, goes really well with the latte."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-10-29,2.0,"Just came in n get a drink, ordered lemonade, it tasted like ginger ale totally! 
asked the password politely, the male staff said it's over there, but can't really find it without glasses, then turned around still don't see it, n the staff suddenly yelled at me n pointed at the register, I finally see it, a tiny card paper with unclear handwritten. I just feel really awkward, don't know why the staff get annoyed, anyway doesn't feel good."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-11-23,1.0,"Comparing to other places in Chinatown, I highly do not recommend this place because the staffs in here are not trained well at all. My boyfriend and I just sat there for more than 2 hours but there are lots of issues happening. We didn't notice the  ""laptop free zone"" in the corner so we still used it ( plus, that corner is the only place that you can charge so it's kinds of illogical to put that  board there). So anyways, when 1 staff came and asked us not to use our laptops, we realized the rule and immediately turn that down. 5 minutes later, he came again and said something REALLY RUDE like ""do you understand what I say?"", ""I can argue with you all day,"".... As an Asian, I find this quite racist. 

Besides that attitude, I still feel that rule illogical because that guy said the zone was created for people to chill out and talk. But THERE IS LITERALLY NO ONE talking, all customers in cafe are doing the work with tablets. While the  laptop zone is full and no one was there to chit chat, why can't we sit there and do our work? I mean.. it's about flexibility.

Anyways, I ordered cold latte and it turned out like a $2 coffee on the street. Not worthy at all. Again, highly do not recommend this place. Neither the staff nor the drink reach the average standard."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2018-06-26,5.0,"First time here and I am a content child. I was going to study in Brooklyn but decided to compromise with Jon-Jon and meet in the city. And Yelp provided me with Granddaddy. Thank you Yelp. It was hot. I was arguing myself as to whether or not i wanted coffee, and the barista/food provider/staff helped me decide on the Japanese/style iced coffee. Absolutely delicious. Smoother than the traditional iced coffee, close to Cold Brew but not quite. SO GOOD that I had to get two. Also, the cranberry scone is amazing. Jon-Jon had the green tea latte, though he wasn't the biggest fan. Then again, I don't trust other people with my tastes, so I won't allow that to influence my rating. I will most definitely be back soon because lovely aesthetics, charging and FREE WEE-FEE. 
As always, happy eating and drinking.-MMG"

Overall, quick service and I enjoyed the latte and Burberry muffin I had while reading here!"
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2018-04-27,5.0,"So glad that a spacious cafe has opened up in Chinatown. They have a large space with beautiful light fixtures and small touches around the cafe that gives off an overall great vibe. My favorite would be the tall windows that allow so much natural lighting into the cafe that it's a great place to get some work done. They have two communal tables that are close to outlets which is perfect if you're planning to do some work on a laptop. In addition, there are two lounge areas (laptop- free zones). 

It seems like they have expanded their menu quite a bit and I got the Iced Chai Latte (maybe a liiiiiiitle less ice next time!) and my friend got the Black Sesame Latte. Their drinks are reasonably priced and taste pretty standard. 

This is a great place to get some work done or catch up with friends. Can't wait to continue my productivity steak at this cafe!"

Nice spot to chill and wait for friends."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2018-05-20,5.0,"I stopped by this place because of the large, open space that the cafe had. There's a lot of room to grab a coffee and chat with friends. I ordered a Japanese iced coffee and the black sesame latte. I would highly recommend the black sesame latte because it's something that I rarely see on coffee menus.

The barista was extremely friendly and helped us in talking through the differences between the coffees. Watching him make the latte was fun because he takes his time with each coffee. I will definitely be coming back!"
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-07-29,2.0,"I love the way this place looks! Very pretty and modern, but that's where its goodness ends. I think I had a tea here prior to my last experience. You can't fuck up tea, so that isn't what my review is about.

Their cold brew tastes worse than regular degular watered-down iced coffee with just a hint of coffee essence. I went inside last week because I really needed to use the bathroom and work on some things on my laptop that required internet. Starbucks makes yummy cold brew so I thought this place probably does too. Wrong. Wrong. Yuck! It was so bad, I had to put a ton of sugar & soy milk in it just to get it at a drinkable speed. After, it was still disgusting so I just threw it away. A waste of $4.50! Their customer service was ehhh. People who benefit from desirability politics don't always make the best employees for such an environment. Remember that.

Then I found out afterwards there's something wrong with their wifi. You can't have a pretty cafe with bad overpriced iced coffee and no wifi at the same time. You have to pick one at least lol. 

Get your act together, Granddaddy! I'm still rooting for you.

UPDATE: the owner contacted me and offered me a free cold brew next time I come in. I appreciate the gesture and the attention around improvement. Thank you again!

I mentioned Starbucks here not because of the high-quality of their drinks. Quite opposite actually, I was shocked their cold brew was so good. Pearls clutched-shocked lol. I think they have the worse coffee, and I used to work at one so I would know :)"
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2020-01-21,5.0,Nice ambiance. Small shop but spacious. Black sesame latte is a must have. The cashier was also the one to prepare my latte. I also have a granola parfait. They complemented each other. A really chill space. Can't wait to go back.
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2018-10-16,4.0,"Pretty much your standard NYC cafe. A lot of customers come here and sit for hours with their laptops to get their work done. There are specially designated tables and chairs located by the front and the rear of the cafe that are ""laptop free"" areas. 

I ordered the black sesame latte and it reminded me of my childhood favorite black sesame paste dessert. The black sesame powder was whisked briefly to prepare my latte, but my baristo didn't whisk the powder throughly, which led there to be a large clump of powder at the bottom of the cup. Price wise, the latte was about $4-5, which is pretty standard. Overall, the drink was decent, but I wouldn't rave about it. 

Toward closing, I witnessed the baristo gather up the pastries that were in the display cases and put them into a plastic Tupperware container and later put them underneath the counter. I sure hope he doesn't plan on re-shelving them for the next day."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-12-16,4.0,Really cozy spot to stop by with friends. I tried their matcha latte and almond croissant. My sister ordered their chai latte. Was very impressed although my matcha latte could have used more of the matcha flavor. The almond croissant was divine. Would highly recommend checking them out! I'd be returning for sure!
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2019-05-24,3.0,"Decided to give this cafe a chance because it seemed really cute. I've walked by it quite often, so I decided to finally try it. The interior environment is nice, the vibe is calm and is a great place to study or get coffee with a friend. 

As for what I ordered, I got a regular iced coffee. I was surprised because the coffee wasn't too strong, I was expecting it to be a little darker. Maybe I have higher standards as a daily coffee drinker, but I didn't think it was particularly special. I also ordered a mint lemonade, which was extremely (!!!!) sour. I could not believe I paid $4.50 for it. Also did not taste any mint whatsoever, was pretty disappointed with it."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2018-08-07,4.0,"I don't know why I'm confessing this, perhaps to prove my 6th grade teacher right when she said, ""When you assume, you make an ass out of u and me."" My group & I passed by The Granddaddy everyday on our way to the subway station, & mistakenly assumed that it was a Chinese restaurant. We're such weirdos. 

Natural light comes flooding into this cafe's floor-to-ceiling windows. The gold lighting fixture is cool & modern, & on the communal tables are signs reminding patrons to buy food or drinks every two hours. This is definitely a place where one could camp away with their laptop or books for hours. 

I wanted a hot drink even though it was sweltering outside. I also didn't want caffeine or coffee. I ordered a black sesame latte; with its spices, milk, & sesame paste, it was exactly what I wanted right then -- not too sweet, a bit earthy, & very much not coffee. 

I'd come back to take advantage of their absolutely chill atmosphere & creative drinks."
89,the-granddaddy-new-york-2,2018-09-03,4.0,"Came here to kill some time before dinner. We shared an Americano and the black sesame latte.

I liked that there was milk and simple syrup to dress your drink to your liking. We liked the coffee more than the sesame latte. The coffee was bold but not burnt. 

I liked the open space and the clean bathroom."
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2020-04-01,5.0,"I really really like this tea and coffee shop.  It has a great amount of teas to choose from, and the staff is very attentive.  It is slightly hard to find though, but once you find it it's definitely a gem.  

PROS
- great selection of teas of all kinds
- good pricing, worth what you pay for
- good selection of equipment
- staff knowledgeable and polite
CONS
- spacing is really tight in there to maximize selection.  But everyone is really polite (well, the majority are, I had a run-in with some not as agreeable clients sadly)

I'll definitely come back for sure!"
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2020-02-23,5.0,"This cozy tea shop is not for high tea rather it's for your loose leaf needs. They have some imported bagged tea (mostly English brands). Their loose leaf tea variety is great. They have a section of decaf tea, they have many regional teas (India, China, Japan) and many blends (Irish, English, Russian, Fruit, etc) but it's so much more than that. They have a chocolate mint tea, dragon fruit tea, creamy earl grey and other surprising tea flavors. They offer some rare teas, tea balls, as well as coffee. The aesthetics of this shop is old school. You're allowed to open jars and smell the tea which helped me select. I can't wait to come back."
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2019-10-06,4.0,"This is a cute little tea shop with a wide variety of teas. They sell most of the teas by weight so you can get just the amount you're looking for. We ended up leaving with one of the peach green teas which was one of the cheaper and plainer teas but we've been enjoying it so far, especially when iced."

Anyway I've moved all over the US and was convinced I could find coffee just as good.  But I couldn't. It's fresh and always perfect. 

If you stop by, tell them Randy ""6 lbs of very special mocha java"" sent you!"

They are really nice there and will explain all their tea and coffee blends. It truly is one of the best coffee and tea purveyors in the city.
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2019-11-24,5.0,"Do not miss out on this place. Whether you're local to NYC or visiting, you will find some of the greatest tea and coffee on earth at McNulty's, not to mention a unique, charming atmosphere and the best customer service."
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2019-11-02,5.0,"Oh my goodness, IT SMELLS SO GOOD IN HERE!!! A true city gem in all of its glory. 7.30 for 8 oz of ground house blend coffee-an inexpensive treat. Come in, and breathe deep, they have fantastic loose teas here, and cute gifts, mugs, etc."
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2018-04-16,3.0,"So supermarket Twinnings bags aren't authentic enough for you anymore? Needing to go more in depth with your leaves and grinds? 

McNulty's Tea is a wonderful local little shop crammed full of tea and coffee. Not unusual for NYC, per se, but a cool experience. This place 1- has hundreds of different kinds of tea, 2- looks like a dark, haunted movie set, and 3- is arguably the best smelling place in the city. Plus, it's almost 125 years old!

I bought one milk oolong from here, and to date, it remains the only tea I've ever thrown out. It had an aroma very, very similar to that of buttered popcorn and I just couldn't stand it. After doing some research, I realized it must have been a flavored milk oolong and not an ""authentic"" milk oolong.

However, I was able to find a Java Santosa tea that tastes and smells exactly like the tea I got hooked on in Indonesia, so that was a win. I recommend you search for that one if you're looking for a light, malty, floral tea that goes well black or with milk. 

$7 for a 4 oz bag, which serves 20-30 cups, is the average price. It's worth exploring here if you're searching for an obscure flavor you got turned onto in Asia, Africa, or the Middle East, or if you just want to be introduced to something new. Use their website for a helpful filter to learn about their offerings."
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2018-12-26,5.0,We have been buying our #coffee for #gaggia #espresso #chemex here for years; great selections for any flavor preferences and origins. . Love this neighborhood gem. Also always take our friends from out-of-town; a good friend visited always ask for chocolate-covered hazelnuts and their hazelnut coffee
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2019-10-26,5.0,"Wonderful place with unlimited selection of high quality teas (and coffee although I've only tried the former). I love the dark, turn of 20th century ambience and friendly staff. I always try to visit when I'm in the city."

90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2019-09-28,5.0,"Go-to for buying my coffee and tea, the proprietors are so kind and knowledgeable.  A west village institution."
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2018-07-12,5.0,"Agreed with every single person who has labeled the scent of this place as out of this world! When I walk in the door, it is easily the best part of my day. If I could bottle the aura of this place and bring it home along with my tea I would.

I have to thank the Yelp community for this one - a tea obsession is something my godfather and I share, so I love to gift him something new and unique for the holidays each year. A couple of years ago, I was searching for a non-commercial tea shop and found this place (thanks again, Yelpers!). Not only did it look like what I had in mind for a tea shop, but it is also conveniently located on Christopher Street where I could grab the Path train to get home! 

As we've all said, you are transported to another time and place when you walk into this shop - I love it, I love the history, I love the aroma, I love the oldness, I love that it's super cramped. Its perfect! I always ask the shop owner for recommendations for my uncle and he delivers every time - full of knowledge and always suggests something I probably wouldn't have grabbed on my own. My uncle always loves the tea - which he says every holiday ""I can smell how good it will taste through the bag!"". 

I will continue to grow and replenish my tea collection from this shop - I may even try their coffee at some point! As other Yelpers mentioned, any tea or coffee accessory you can imagine is carried. I can only speak for the tea, but pricing is more than reasonable, especially considering the quality, selection and overall experience when shopping here."
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2016-12-17,5.0,"Wow what did I miss having been here only one time. My taste buds have been searching for a better cup of coffee and I dont mean all the commercial joints opened all over the tri state area. There is so many coffee joints (joints hmmm) oops trying to be competitive in a saturated market.

What brought me back to McNultys is the best coffee beans in the world!! I googled this endeavor and three regions came up. The best coffee beans to consume come from Turkey, Indonesia and Ethiopia. Well come on my taste buds are looking for new tastes and better coffee. Its not like you can change wives and girlfriends for a new flavor just because your tired of their appeal. Or maybe you can hmmmm Lol....notttttt!

Online my mind settled on Ethiopian Harra bean because of profile with fruity notes and chocolate under notes. The only place I found that sold these bean was in UK. Then my mind kicked in lets check Yelp, thank God for Yelp.

McNulty was the only place I found in NYC that had these Ethiopian whole beans and off I went. When I am on a mission dont get in my way. Lol  The price for the Harra beans was $17.80 a pound and worth every cent. I cant wait to try the Ethiopian Sidamo beans. 

Making coffee is a science from the right texture of grinded beans, to the temperature of hot water, to the pre heating of mugs with hot water before dispensing finished coffee. When home I make french press. The water must be 190 degrees and rough grinded beans are bloomed before total saturation. Look on you tube if you wanna make coffee the right way.

The Harrar beans were smooth with a fruity note subtle but nice. When I bloomed the coffee in the french press the smell was very nice. I drink my coffee black with some truvia and this coffee did not disappoint. 

Service was friendly and nice. The store has a huge I mean huge variety of fresh chinese tea leaves. I love the tea ceremony its an art! Well thats whole other review. 

Thank you Mcnultys and wishing everybody a happy and safe holiday!!"
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2017-10-25,5.0,"McNulty's is a New York City treasure! It is one of the few businesses remaining that really feels like old New York. It should be landmarked! Well, it is landmarked, at least in the minds and hearts of their regular customers who cherish their high quality merchandise. 

As an avid tea drinker, I have tried nearly every source of loose leaf teas available in New York. There are many good ones but I always return to McNulty's. There are three simple reasons: 1) Excellent, friendly and expert proprietors and staff. 2) Reasonable prices for top-of-the-line teas. 3) The BEST quality and the BEST tasting teas in New York! 

One reviewer said this: ""The smell that hits you when entering McNulty's is the stuff dreams are made of."" This is so true, and I would like to add that the look of the place has that same quality as well. You feel as though you have been transported back to the early 20th or late 19th century and are experiencing what shops may have been like then. The old wooden floors and counter, the many antique tin storage containers, the old fashioned lighting, cast a spell of old world charm. Yes, it is crowded when there are more than 4 or 5 people there, but that usually lends itself to an intimacy and friendliness that is completely absent in most retail shopping experiences. I have had many wonderful and informative chats with other customers while waiting that have added greatly to the quaint and welcoming ambiance at McNulty's. 

In addition to their large selections of teas and coffees you can find nearly any accoutrements necessary for the brewing of both, from filters to pots. I am not a coffee drinker, so I cannot make any recommendations. But some of my favorite teas: Extra Fancy Jasmine; Flowering White Pekoe; Sencha Green; Blue Eyes. Go and find your favorites!"
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2015-01-17,5.0,"I'm surprised that there are only 169 reviews of this ancient Village emporium.  This place is magical... 

My friend Mark introduced me to McNulty's in the late 1960's when we were undergrads at a college in Jersey City. He was an NYC guru and knew all of the great places to shop. My thing at the time was good, hot tea - most of the coffee I tried back then was bitter. That included a cup I had on a date to see Tony Bennett at the Waldorf Astoria (I was a good date, back in the day). I told the owner what I was drinking and he made some suggestions. 

I first bought some quality English and Irish tea bags - all we had at home was Lipton's. That's when I learned that Irish Breakfast was a magic elixir. I went back for more but the owner then suggested Assam in loose leaf form and a simple infuser. Wow! The taste was even more exciting and I have had a bag of Assam or Golden Assam on the shelf ever since. 

Their coffee choices were a little different since I started from a different place - no frame of reference except mom's instant Sanka. Eventually he picked a kona ground for French press and, for the first time, I had a cup of coffee that didn't taste like crap! Kona is now an occasional pleasure since I still drink a lot of Assam tea.

I love this place. It's a trip back to a great time in my youth and the folks in the store have consistently helped me learn and grow in my appreciation of one of life's simple pleasures.

I hope it's around long after I'm gone, helping other tea and coffee novices on their journey to a better cup of something tasty. 

Highly recommended."

90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2018-11-25,5.0,Months ago we were walking in the neighborhood and randomly found McNulty's and have been going regularly ever since. Everyone should buy their coffee and tea from here - the selection is amazing and the employees are wonderful is recommending and explaining their products. And yes as everyone else has said the store smells heavenly and feels so comforting. It's always worth the train ride there!
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2017-07-24,5.0,"This is a must visit stop for the tea and coffee fanatics out there! 

I am rather amused by the foreign tea products that this shop carries. Where else can you find imported French teas in New York City? Seriously, not a lot of the shops do because of the high custom fees that they have to pay for bulk shipping. By research - McNulty's and Dean & Deluca's are the ones who sell imported French tea products in the city. 

I am almost out of my Mariage Frere's tea and certainly don't want to fly my way to Paris just for a cannister! So I came here with the purpose of scoping out the Mariage Frere's tea (if any) at the store. The cashier gentleman was super kind to let me know that they don't carry Mariage Frere products anymore due to the high shipping fees. Bummer news but he recommended another imported French brand to me - Nina's. 

So I got the Nina's Marie Antoinette tea instead. I'm loving the aroma and body so far! If you're familiar with French perfume houses, this reminds me so much of Annick Goutal's Petite Cherie perfume. This is a playful waltz of juicy peach and musky rose. Very youthful and grassy. I was pleasantly surprised to get a whiff of this from a cup of Nina's Marie Antoinette tea. 
 
The customer service is spectacular here. My conversation with the owners (dad and son, I think) felt so personal and comfortable - as if I was a regular weaving in and out of the store on weekend mornings. This makes the store experience even more charming in West Village."
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2019-03-01,5.0,"McNulty's has been sending me coffee for decades. They have NEVER let me down. The best coffee ever -always fresh, custom blends (which my friends order) & totally reluable. McNulty's is, quietly & consistently, one of the best pillars of my life! Why can't I give them many more than 5 stars?"
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2016-03-11,5.0,"Discovering McNulty's by sheer accident is what I imagine discovering the Lascaux Caves must have been like--shock, awe and raw admiration for a place that offers so much yet demands so little. 

For tea-philes, this is mecca. Don't let the simple storefront fool you. Inside lies an Indian Jones-like cavern of wondrous treasures inspired by the miracle of camellia sinensis--from pure loose leafs to aromatic blends to convenient packages to molded cakes. My personal favorites were the delicate jasmine pearls, as well as the astonishing breadth of pu-erh grades (the latter being my favorite tea of all time). Most teas are loose leaf, but the staff will let you sniff anything. And speaking of the staff, the men manning the counter were some of the nicest, most knowledgable people I've ever had the pleasure of buying tea from."

So, don't come here expecting a Teavana, Argo, or Davids Tea - it's FAR from the experience, and even further (upwards) in quality of tea that they sell. 

Come here and expect - 
- Tea that is not laced with Natural and Artificial flavoring in the tea blends
- huge selection of full leaf teas, as well as specialty blended teas
- humble, low pressure shopping experience with well trained personnel.  

Don't come here and expect to buy an overpriced Tea pot."

This smallish shop has a more expansive selection of teas but also a very good selection of coffee. Being a heavy coffee drinker, I treat myself to coffee from here every once in a while. Recently indulged in Ethiopean Yirgacheffe and it was well worth the price, even in my crappy Mr. Coffee machine. Service is friendly and they'll def help you out with a selection if you need it. Only downside is that the prices are a little steeper than other shops (no quality coffees under $10/pound) but, then again, you get what you pay for."

Not to fret, this long time shop will help you on your way to becoming a proud continence coffee lover. You must have this brown liquid pumping through your veins all day, everyday, especially, if you want to survive this town with any resemblance of your former sanity intact. 

I come here for the smell. If you see me here standing with my eyes closed and breathing deeply, do not interrupt me. I will Mick Jagger you. And don't even ask me what that means."

90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2014-02-25,5.0,"This place is cramped, dark, and packed.  It might not look like a fancy shmancy overpriced tea shop like DavidsTea, but it lives up to the hype. 

I was highly impressed that they had one of my favorite [rare] teas here - Milk Oolong!  I only found this at DavidsTea and when comparing the prices, this place is on point.  DavidsTea sells Milk Oolong for $6.75 an ounce.  McNulty has it for $7.50 for TWO ounces!  I have a sad story, though.  I left my little baggy of tea on a bench in the middle of the Village.  Therefore, did not get to try the tea.  However I did try my friend's rare oolong tea and it was delish!

I see the coffee selection here is vast and quite popular so I may decide to pick up some the next time I'm here.

Staff is helpful and friendly.  Will definitely be back."

90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2014-01-10,5.0,"McNulty's is a wonderful old tea/coffee shop for true fans of leaf and grinds. It's been in the neighborhood since the 19th century and is even older than Porto Rico Importing, my favorite beanery in the world. And as far as I can tell, it is an institution in its own quiet, lovely way.

It was a little dim, when we walked in on the way back from a morning riverside run. The man working here (owner or manager, I would say) was pretty low-key but friendly and helpful. I only had money enough for a half pound, but that was enough to snag some McNulty's blend. There is a vintage bean scale, hand-written signs, and other trappings of an olde-style shoppe. I wasn't shopping for teas, but the advertised varieties looked tantalizing. Prices were pretty fair, comparable to Porto Rico.

My only disappointment was not finding a coffee bar to get a cup to go--a la Porto Rico (oh, how they spoil me there!)--but otherwise, this is a little treasure.

(And no, this store has nothing to do with THE WIRE.)"
90,mcnultys-tea-and-coffee-co-new-york,2017-08-14,4.0,I came here last week to pick up some tea. They have a wide variety and the extra fancy jasmine is my favorite. It's quite pricy but don't know where else to get high quality jasmine tea. Service is good - and quick.

A friend and I were walking past OddFellows on E Houston and being the ice cream fanatic that I am, dragged him inside with me.

I wouldn't say that I'm a boring person... but I am definitely boring when it comes to my taste in ice cream flavors. I like strawberry, coffee, french vanilla, cookies and cream and that's about it. I sampled a few different flavors here, but ultimately decided on a good old french vanilla. I usually go for the cone, and surprised myself when I went for the cup this time around. 

The staff were friendly and patient when I wanted to try all the different flavors. The ice cream satisfied my sweets craving and OddFellows provided a nice little 20 minute break from the freezing cold streets of New York. Yes, yes, I know that I left the freezing cold to get ice cream. You gotta do what you gotta do to satisfy those cravings though.

If you're looking for a spot to get a scoop or three... OddFellows is the place!"

Service was not very good. I was very dissuaded from trying multiple flavors because the person serving scoops had a bad attitude -- not overtly rude but just seeming extremely bothered I wanted to try more than one flavor and rather annoyed I came in at all. Which is a shame because if you want to retain regulars you should have friendly staff. I frequent the nearby train stop often for varying reasons and I might be unlikely to come back just because of the unfriendliness."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2020-02-03,5.0,"This could be my favorite ice cream shop in NYC. Per my previous rant regarding the monstrous portion of typical ice cream shop, OddFellows Ice Cream defies the norm and actually serves a size that I can handle. The flavors here are creative yet approachable that I keep coming back to try many of its ice cream. 

This shop serves good coffee too. I'm sure the shop can cover the sales drop of ice cream during the cold months with what they make with their coffee and pastries. Unlike many coffee shops, OddFellows mastered the miraculous combo of great coffee and great pastries. 

Seats are comfy and kept clean, thanks to the diligent staff here! Staff are all friendly and kind. The service has been always pleasant.

As I'm writing this I realize that this shop is my dream come true. It would be even better if they manage to have a bathroom for the customers!"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-11-10,4.0,"OddFellows now offers plant-based ice cream flavors! As a very lactose intolerant person, this was great news. I got the cherry miso, which seems pretty unappetizing since I'm only used to miso in savory foods, but trust me it was actually very yummy! The miso gives a flavor reminiscent of a cross between soy sauce and salted-caramel (tastes much better than it sounds). If you hadn't told me it was non-dairy, I would've assumed it was just plain ice cream. 

The shop itself is pretty small with a few tables and window seating. Ordering was very efficient, and the employee was the one who recommended the ice cream flavor to me!"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2020-01-09,5.0,"4/5- Rounding up for fantastic service
Came by on a Sunday afternoon for a quick snack. This location is decently spacious with several larger tables/booths for seating. Service was so friendly and fun to chat with. I also love that they're so generous with their samples. Each spoonful is huge! They were also very nice and did a split single scoop.

For my flavors I got the following:
1) Strawberry Jam: Really concentrated strawberry flavor like a jam should. The flavor is also more deep than a typical strawberry ice cream.
2) Pistachio Cardamom: The pistachio flavor wasn't too toasty but provided a nice crunch and nuttiness. The addition of chocolate was a nice variation on this flavor. They were decently heavy on the cardamom which I loved.

The two flavors together were phenomenal. Like a spiced chocolate covered strawberry covered in nuts. Texture is a bit looser but still creamy.

Overall I really loved my experience here and I would definitely come back. I was informed there's a ton of flavors on rotation and you're almost guaranteed to get something new each time."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-06-26,4.0,"Great place for creative ice cream flavors. And if you're not sure, ask for a sample.
I opted for a carrot cheesecake ice cream and was not disappointed. I'm usually not a fan of cheesecake but this flavor was more like vanilla with chunks of carrot cake. It was delicious. The chocolate cone was also really good, it tasted like an Oreo!
The mural on the side of the wall is an added bonus for photo ops. 
I'll be back to try some more flavors."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-05-29,5.0,"Oddfellows never fails in delivering delicious flavors in their ice cream. Cute ice cream shop with seating on the side. Cashless.

I shared the coffee crunch which was delicious. Soft and creamy with good strong coffee flavor. The crunch added great texture. Yum!"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-05-06,2.0,"This review is for this specific experience which I hope will be a one-off.  I arrived at OddFellows around 3:45pm on a Tuesday.  I wanted to try to PB&J soft serve, but they weren't serving soft serve at the time.  I figured since I was already there, I might as well try the ice cream.  I actually wasn't impressed with the flavor selection at the time.  They seemed very basic, not what I would expect from a place with the name ""Oddfellows.""  Their space is very trendy!  There's a small area with tables and then an open square bench seating area for the other half.   

I got a scoop of the tropical fruit sorbet ($5).  The sorbet had great flavor and consistency.  The two issues I had were 1) I wish they had prettier cones to serve the ice cream in and 2) my cone was empty toward the bottom (see picture).  $5 is already very steep for average ice cream so I was disappointed when I saw the empty space.

Finally, it was a nice day out, so there were a lot of people checking out the shop.  Despite this, they had one person working who was not the fastest or friendliest worker.  Overall, I still want to come back to try the soft serve, but I was very off-put by this experience."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-03-14,4.0,"Bowie, Bourdain and I were all Oddfellows. And none of us liked this ice cream shop. So perhaps their name is a little... misleading.

Much like a lot of D pix are misleading, from a certain angle?

Or actually not like that.

This is a very strange ice cream store as you can probably imagine by the very strange meme. I mean name, but there are some strange memes out there.

I used to visit the one in Brooklyn and a couple of people that I would go with really liked it but I never did. I actually think I gave them 3-stars because I was so unimpressed, but after all this time I can see the merits of a couple of the products here if not the others.

They are a little overpriced but then again isn't everything in New York these days? Good to see that they made it over to Manhattan, and congratulations."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2020-02-24,4.0,"Yummy and creative flavors. Only one of them (the chocotorta) blew me away, but they were all delicious and super fun to taste. It's so creamy and delicious, way more satisfying and heavy than other ice creams. Besides the ice cream being the best, it's worth coming for the flavors alone. There's usually a line and not many people working, so know what you want before hand or try to get your tasters quickly! With so many flavors
I wish they'd put another person behind the counter but oh well. If you like ice cream and unique flavors come here!!!! It's REASONABLY priced for once also, 9$ for a triple scoop!!! Yummmmm"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2020-01-13,5.0,"This place is small but mighty!!!  My friend and I got two-scoop ice cream cones. The ice cream was creamy and delicious!!!  He got toasted marshmallow, and I got one deep chocolate with peanuts, and one chocolate mint chip. There were plenty of seats, and we enjoyed our visit before walking back to the East Village."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-01-13,4.0,"The temperature was near freezing and for some reason OddFellows sounded like a good choice. The ice cream and treats are that good or I'm just a glutton for punishment. 
There is a nice variety of unique ice cream flavors, donuts and brownies to choose from. I chose a honey flavored ice cream and a blueberry donut to satisfy my sweet tooth. I loved both! The pricing is moderate and what you would expect for the area so I wasn't too shook when I saw the $3.50 price tag on a single donut. We arrived shortly before closing so the donut wasn't in its freshest (a bit crunchy on the outer layer) state but it was still better than most donuts I have tried. 
This location offers Apple Pay and tipping option on card payment. The seating is decent it's not the biggest location. It's perfect to stop in for a quick scoop or snack, then move on. I will be back soon to try more flavors."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-08-10,5.0,"I had gotten a free ice cream from a promotion for a tech firm. The samples were from odd fellows, and it introduced me to their coffee ice cream. It was delicious. I am not a fan of any coffee or coffee flavored concoction that is not hot coffee, mind you. 

Chocolate crunch and the Guinness flavored chocolate are both killer, as well. 

I will be coming back.

Ice cream for grown up kids."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-06-17,4.0,"Absolutely delicious! Went with a friend and we had the genius idea to get a flight of the ice cream. It comes with 6 ""mini"" scoops, however, they are not so mini! lol for $9 you get to try a large chunk of their flavors, which rotate quite often. I'll name the flavors we had in order of best to worst: olive oil, white chocolate toasted almond, coffee crunch, sprinkles, coconut cream with chocolate, and matcha rocky road. The matcha was my absolute least favorite as it was super grainy and not a pleasant aftertaste. I never had olive oil ice cream before so I was pleasantly surprised at how creamy and sweet with a hint of savory it was. The store itself is super cute too, and has several areas to sit around and enjoy the ice cream."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-07-18,3.0,"Good flavour, but I found the ice cream icey rather than creamy.  Not that rich, but definitely flavourful."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-07-07,5.0,"No complaints on my end! Cute decor, friendly and prompt service (they were generous with the samples). I loooveddd the flavor I chose. I think blueberry something? It was super creamy and thick, and not wildly sweet. Perfectly balanced! Also saw the cutest dog on my visit there"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-05-09,5.0,"So I randomly stumbled upon this place and it was freaking good!!! I would totally come back and try some new and other flavors. Fun unique stuff and interesting vibe in there. Totally worth a visit, one of the best ice cream places I've had!!"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-04-08,4.0,"Always get a pint instead of scoops! Way better deal. We got almost 6 scoops for $10 in a pint! Share with friends and save money! 

-out of soft serve at 5pm on Sunday"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-10-04,2.0,"Honestly, kinda let down. The branding of this little joint was so on-point, I for sure thought that the ice cream would stand out but to be honest, it was just an over-priced scoop of chocolate ice cream. For the price, i was expecting something mind-blowing. I've had worse but I've also had A LOT better."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-07-12,5.0,"Small ice cream shop with seating
Staff is very nice
Loved the ice cream! About a dozen of flavors to chose from and they are all unique just the way I like it!"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2018-08-23,4.0,"I am in Love! I thought this coffee/ice cream shop was amazing!  If Oddfellows was closer I'm positive I would be in everyday. Which would def be a problem for my waist line! 

The store is sleek, super modern and the staff is very nice and helpful. They will let you sample any ice cream and even answer some questions! 

They have some great ice cream flavors and a variety of coffee options to choose from. They change soft serve flavors often but stick with the coffee/espresso theme. 
Today we ordered on a chocolate cone espresso with lemon zest. It was a light and refreshing combo. Not to sweet and over powering. It didn't leave an after taste and it def left you wanting more!  We also ordered a small scoop in a cup of coffee crunch another great choice. A stronger flavor with crunchy cookies pieces and a great coffee flavor. Def not to sweet. Def a well balanced ice cream.

Overall, Oddfellows  has a great shop here and I would love to have it closer to me! I love their products! I will def come visit again.

Btw, there is plenty of seating to sit and enjoy your ice cream or coffee. The only down side, there is no bathroom here!  

Parking is difficult but get here by 6pm and it becomes free.(319)"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2018-09-29,4.0,"I think my favorite thing about this place was the space.

I happened to go in when it was super beautiful outside and they had the window open, so I was able to sit and enjoy the outdoors from the comfort of the ice cream shop.

The ice cream itself was rich in flavor and I really enjoyed the scoop I got.
(Coffee crunch)

I'm not a big ice cream person, but I felt this was up to par.

Not sure if I'll make a special trip to come back, but if I walk by and I'm craving some, I can't say I won't get another scoop.

3.6/5"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-12-01,4.0,"They've got some pretty darn good ice cream. I made a quick stop here to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings and I am glad I did. I had a coffee sundae, I think that's what it was called. It had fudge brownie pieces in it. I absolutely love brownie pieces in my ice cream. I also love coffee flavored ice cream. I tried other flavors which were good as well. I'll definitely stop by when I can to try more flavors whenever I can."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-01-26,4.0,"I love OddFellows because they have delicious and unique flavors and the prices are pretty reasonable. My favorite has to be their miso cherry and the cookie butter ice cream. It's delicious! This particular ice cream location has only a few seats, which gets ridiculously pack towards the night. Also, this location has less flavors than their other locations."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-03-21,5.0,"I only had some coffee in this whimsical ice parlor, but enjoyed watching my friends devour their ice cream. The space is small, but super clean and the staff was nice. I will certainly come back for a cone."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-08-12,1.0,"I'm writing this review not for the quality of the ice cream or location, but for the sheer disrespect of one of the employees that I have encountered, not even 30 minutes ago, around 9:10 pm August 12. 

Tonight, me and my boyfriend had entered the store to get some ice cream, which my favorite flavor was in stock. The first thing I got when I looked around was from one of the two employees was her shouting ""THERES NO BATHROOM IN HERE"" and a passive aggressive comment saying ""I just LOVE when people think it's a public bathroom"". 

Not only was she saying this in front of us, but she was shouting this in a store full of customers and with two of them right in front of the counter. Even then after, ignored us for the others about inquiring our needs until the other employee got us our order. I was so shocked at this event that it almost ruined my appetite and excitement that night. Luckily for us, we explained our distaste to the employee who served us (not the one who made the comment) who apologized for her actions. 

I get it, there are a lot of annoying customers who are looking for a free bathroom. But to accuse us RIGHT when we got in, assuming we were doing something wrong and not buying their product was a appalling act. It's a shame I will never enter this location again because of this employee, because the ice cream quality is one of the best I've had. But that employee needs to be fired. Point blank simple."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2018-08-20,5.0,"This is best OddFellows location yet.

The space is comfortable, the lines are never too long, the service is great, and they serve coffee? Can't get any better than this.

They offer some of their great regular ice cream flavors (among my favorites are ricotta plum thyme and saffron passionfruit) as well as their newer soft serve. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the lemon soft serve was. It's the perfect balance of fresh/citrusy and rich/creamy. The texture is on point too. Only downside is that the selection of soft serve flavors is limited to a couple (e.g. when I was there, only flavors of soft serve were lemon and coffee).

I'll be back to try one of the coffee and cream creations, like affogoato and café liégeois."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2018-04-09,5.0,"The 3rd and I think I have to say best location yet of OddFellows just softly opened at Houston and Mott St.

This one is the best mostly because it is a hybrid coffee / ice cream shop, so I can basically just live here. They have a fully stocked cabinet of all their excellent rotating ice cream flavors, but also a full menu of really cool coffee drinks that you can only find here. For example, they are using some mind-blowing infused milks that you can add to any drink. I tried the Toast Milk in a latte, and it really tasted exactly like toast. Can't wait to try the Burnt Marshmallow and Thai Tea milk next time. The great soft serve is also available here, appropriately available in Coffee and Cream flavors.

This one is also best for accessibility, located at a bright corner of the heavily trafficked area of Houston St near lots of action and right near the Broadway Lafayette stop, so it's a really convenient spot for coffee and/or dessert right before getting on/off the train. I'll be here very very often."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-07-16,4.0,I popped by on Sunday and got a scoop of the almond butterscotch. What a great flavor combo. It was so good!! My friend got the cornbread and said it was weird but good. Definitely coming back for their other creative flavors.
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2018-07-08,4.0,"Oddfellows opened up several locations over the year and luckily, this one was a block away when I searched for desserts on yelp. The decor is clean and bright with white subway tiles and big open windows. I got a scoop of Santa's Milk and Cookies and requested it in my own reusable cup and the server gladly obligued. He even rinsed my cup before scooping! (I had coffee earlier in the day)

The ice cream itself was a bit light, but had a nice mix of smooth and crunchie textures from the cookie pieces. It's a traditional flavor in comparison to their creative ones such as grapefruit jalapeno - I sampled from my friend's scoop and although it's a refreshing sorbet, the jalapeno may be a bit much as a full scoop (for me). My friend liked and finished hers!"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-02-01,4.0,"This is one of my favorite places in the city to get ice cream ! It's soo good I buy some flavors by the PINT.

The burnt marshmallows takes me back to when I used to roast marshmallows on my stove haha City life 
The malt maitake peanut is a must try. You won't believe that there are mushrooms in it. I made my best friend try it and she hates mushrooms. She was going to get it until I told her what was in it lol 

The miso cherry is great if you are looking for a salty but fruity flavor ice cream. Today I brought home a pint of the Tea and Biscuits ! It has an fragrant earl grey base but I slightly bitter bite with crunchy biscuits through out..FABULOUS.

You know the ice cream is great when its 10 degrees out and your buying it by the pint-loads lol"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2018-09-20,5.0,"I'm on the fence about giving Oddfellows a perfect score after just one visit & trying just one flavor. I thought about it & it's no different from penning a 2-or-3-star-review without hesitation after a disappointing first meal somewhere. The flavor I tried makes me think favorably about returning to try others & inspired me to spread the word -- I've told no less than a handful of people IRL about my incredible find. And now I'm telling you... 

The Strawberry Jam ice cream is my literal (ok, figurative) jam. It gives me life. It's the business. Yasss, bitch, it slays. What other annoying, over the top phrases can I use to convey my obsession?! Ultra sweet & creamy with a citrusy tang right at the end. If the Strawberry Jam isn't available when you visit, ""flavors change often, don't be mad"" is the warning Oddfellows gives. Just go, they've got cold ice cream & hot coffees."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2018-04-20,4.0,"Cute, new corner shop by OddFellows with a few tables and bench seating by the window. They call it their Coffee & Cream concept because this location is a coffee shop and an ice cream shop. Their interesting and rich ice cream flavors are what I've come to expect. And they've applied that same creativity and ethnicity to some of their coffee items. 

I stopped in over opening weekend and the line was out the door. I decided to go full out with their new concept and got a cold brew milkshake using their coffee crunch ice cream. You can pick any ice cream flavor for the milkshake and it's made with coffee instead of milk. (There's also a regular milkshake option if you don't want the cold brew option.)

It is on the pricey side but on par with other local, high quality ice cream or coffee shops.

It's a great location right on Houston St. too."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2020-03-10,4.0,"I really wanted to try the hazelnut dulce de leche flavor but I was unsure if they still had the flavor in store. I called ahead and asked at all three locations and the Nolita location said they didn't have it currently but would put it out the next day for me. I thought this was incredibly sweet and made the trip to get it the next day. The flavor was dulce de leche ice cream with hazelnuts (small pieces) and cacao nibs in it. It was actually pretty good especially if you do not like the typical pure caramel flavor because the cacao nibs add bitterness to the ice cream. There are lots of hazelnuts, so the ice cream is pretty crunchy and I kinda missed out on the creaminess of the base. Want to try the soft serve here but waiting for a flavor I would like to pop up!!!"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-05-10,5.0,"Hifhly recommend this place, i tried the pina colada flavor and it tastes just so real!!!

So sad that we didnt have chance to tried the softserve... Will tried it nxt time"
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2018-04-13,5.0,"One of the best ice cream shops opened another location and offers great coffee as well, not sure if I can be any happier. 

This location offers pastries, their amazing ice cream, and great coffee. Their service is amazing as well. It was a pretty crowded day since I came in a day that finally felt like spring. I ordered the wrong milkshake at first, they already started making it, but insisted on remaking it to the one I wanted, no problem. They were super nice about it. I wanted the shake with cold brew but ordered just a regular milk shake.

I asked if I could have a pb&j ice cream shake with cold brew. At $9 although pricey, it tasted amazing! If you're a fan of peanut butter and coffee, this is for you, it was super addicting and I was sad when I got to the bottom of my cup. I've also never been disappointed by any flavor of their ice cream, they let you sample as many flavors as you want."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2018-12-03,3.0,"The Coffee Crunch ice cream I got was delicious! It had a deep coffee flavor with tiny bits of coffee beans (?) but wasn't as creamy as I would've liked. I also tried the Apple Buttermilk and Rosemary Scented Goat Milk with Concord & Walnuts but again, they didn't have that chewy and creamy consistency I'm looking for and the flavors weren't as pronounced as the Coffee Crunch.

The space is super cute; both a coffee and ice cream shop with window seating that's very aesthetic. Service was friendly at the register but no so much in front of the ice-cream cabinet. I'm usually showered with enthusiasm and non-judgment while trying the different flavors at ice cream places but I got none of that here :( I might drop by to try other of the rotating flavors if I'm in the area since I'm a fan of experimental flavors all thanks to Salt and Straw."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-04-05,4.0,"My husband and I popped over here for a treat after dinner one night. I love this new location. It's so spacious and lovely inside! There's a good amount of seating and it's really nice and bright inside. They had I believe 9 flavors available when we were there and we settled on sharing dark chocolate chip. We also tried the Thai Iced Tea flavor. It was really good. Super sweet so we didn't think we could eat a whole cup of that but so good. The dark chocolate chip was nice. Very creamy and the chocolate chips were excellent. I wish the chocolate ice cream was a bit more rich in flavor, but it was good. A nice ice cream spot! The woman who helped us was super friendly."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2019-02-03,3.0,"I had this place bookmarked for a while.  I had wanted to try their toast milk, but sadly they no longer had it on their menu as it seemed to be a temporary fad. Trying to make the best of the trip there I decided to sample some of their ice cream and ended up settling with a duo combo.  I decided to go with their popular pick of confetti and refreshing lychee.  The prices are on the higher end and I only recommend coming here if you're in need of a pick me up.  I wanted to also get a coffee drink, but for the price point of $8 it was a bit too much for a tiny order.  The inside is cute though and if you're in the area it's good to try once."
91,oddfellows-ice-cream-new-york-3,2018-09-22,4.0,"This place is super cute! It's a coffee shop + ice cream shop. And they sell a combination of both together. I got the Café Liégeios, which is a mix of a shot of expresso with a scoop of coffee crunch ice cream topped with whipped cream and coffee soil. I didn't really enjoy this, I ordered this because I thought it would be like an Aussie iced latte but better because it is topped with whipped cream. It tasted nothing like that and the whipped cream didn't taste good at all. I didn't really enjoy this drink but I did try their vegan coconut soft serve and it was really good. Would definitely come back and get that next time."

92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-07-13,3.0,"This review is for their Yogurt boba/bubble tea drinks. I was really excited to try these because Yakult was my childhood drink!! I tried their Yogurt Grapefruit and Yogurt Orange.

At first sip, I loved it because it hits you with that Yakult and fresh fruit immediately. But it gets too sweet, too overpowering, really fast. I even make sure to get half sweet, but something about the Yakult and fruit combination makes it overbearingly sweet. The Grapefruit is a little more bearable than the Orange, due to the tartness that cuts through the sweet.

As great as the first sip was, I think this drink would be greatly improved if lightened up a bit! It could be a nice, light, refreshing summer drink instead of something that sticks in your mouth after a couple sips.

Just sharing my thoughts. I love that yogurt / Yakult was a flavor to begin with"

And after I've finally WITHDREW
Then it's time to go to Kung FU!

WHAT

Finally I found a really nice KFT after a couple of really bad cavity experience is on Manhattan Island today. I mean KFT experiences, but that too, because, dentists.

What to get: Lemon Black Tea With Tapioca!
Or: All the fruit teas are pretty good, especially if you go off menu and get black tea!
Or: Go crazy and order your fruit teas with the very strong Oolong!
Or in winter: Any of the hot milk teas!

The bubbles were good, and the taste was good, and the service was excellent, and they let me use their restroom even though it looked like they didn't have one. They took nice picture of me and everything went well.

There was some nice girls flirting with me in here, and I just had a good experience. I also found three wasps in here. Oh wait that's my living room.

The problem with the store, and the reason I didn't want to give it 5 is that there is often a significant line, and it's just so so long waiting for drinks when there is. Still, you can't fault a store for being popular, although you'd think they could add a few more employees when they get this slammed so often.

But on this particular evening 20 minutes before closing time there was no line and the drink came out right away and everything was perfect - so they're definitely getting five stars and they have much better customer service and people skills and drink making skills than some of the other shady locations in Lower Manhattan.

Generally speaking, Kung Fu Tea scores 5, but it's usually a low 5, considering that it's a massive international corporate chain, whose milk teas don't match up to the best chains: Sharetea, Gong Cha and Coco. However, they're still really good, and the fruit teas here are among the best. Especially the lemon black tea which absolutely rocks my world. If it's not on the menu, demand it! Other fruit teas (Berry, Orange, Grapefruit) must also be ordered off-menu as Black Tea instead of the meh Green. Also the Lemon Black tastes good as a Lemon Oolong, but everyone else hates it because they have bad taste.

And this is one of the very best locations in NYC.

So if you think your life is now over
And your gf won't let you disrobe her
And you ask what I think
Just come get a drink
Kung Fu's Lemon Black Tea with Boba!"
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-10-25,3.0,Like their boba butttt this location claims to have 10% off if you check in on yelp... mine you they don't HVe a deal on Yelp ( nothing to claim) but they'll take your phone and rate themselves 5 stars in order to get the 10% off. Plus they charge tax
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2020-01-26,5.0,"Yummy tea in a great area, awesome staff, stop by for your drink, have been here a few times and always bring mmmmm friends"
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2020-03-08,5.0,Satisfied my boba craving at the one place that is always consistent! Not too much taro and not too much sugar for my taro milk tea! This location is one of my favorites because they ALWAYS have mochi! Most other locations are usually sold out so I definitely picked up a couple strawberry & mango mochi
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2020-02-11,5.0,"The best overall bubble tea in the east village by far. None of the new places live up to the quality, consistency and variety of Kung fu. Trust me we tried them allllllll. But they should be open later. And also the workers should get paid more. They are busy all day and night"
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2020-01-12,5.0,"It's always a treat to find a kung fu tea. Sadly this location didn't have the Thai milk tea, but the other options were just as yummy. If you like bubble tea this stop is a must!!!!"
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-12-21,5.0,I said it before but Kung fu tea is one of my favorite boba shops. I definitely recommend getting only 50% sweetness/sugar and not 100% unless you'd like diabetes. It was insanely sweet!! Too sweet but 50% was perfect. I have only had milk tea and need to try the fruit teas. The Kung fu milk tea and the oolong milk tea are definitely my favorites!
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2020-02-07,5.0,"Terrific flavor, best milktea in town.
But better choose less sugar as you usually have regular sugar at other milk tea shop"
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2018-12-18,5.0,"I love Kung Fu Tea.

After devouring a meal nearby at St. Marks, my friends and I swung by Kung Fu Tea for some boba. My go to is the Oolong Milk Tea with boba. If you haven't been to a boba shop before, the way it works is that you choose a flavor, sweetness level (0%, 30%, 70%, ...), ice level (none, less, light, ...), and toppings.

After ordering they make your boba factory style. You wait in a queue and once your drink is ready they call your number and the boba comes plastic sealed on the top: perfect to take on the go!

Versus other spots like Vivi's and Gong Cha, I think Kung Fu has the tastiest Oolong Milk teas. Also, the boba has the best texture in my opinion... firm at the center with a soft exterior."
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-12-22,5.0,Fast and friendly customer service! Love my taro bubble and mango green tea from here!

92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-12-21,5.0,I always get the passion fruit green tea with bubbles! Such a cute spot with really friendly staff and they have a bathroom for customers which is super helpful after drinking a bunch of tea!
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-12-25,5.0,"Amazing store and friendly staff, definitely worth a visit! Also the quality of the tapioca itself is incredible. Check it out and they have seating so it makes a cute date idea."
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2018-08-15,1.0,"Love the drinks at this chain but this particular location I had to give one star even though I would have given it a 5 because they messed up my order and wouldn't replace it or even offer a discount for the same exact drink less the mistake. 

So I was going to order a yogurt grapefruit drink and then changed my mind to a wow milk with grass jelly, red bean, and tapioca. What they gave me was grapefruit yogurt with all three ingredients. When I told them that's wrong and how no one makes all those three ingredients with yogurt grapefruit some of the other employees had a agreeable face. I had asked if they can replace the drink and the person who I took a picture of mentioned how I didn't say Wow milk so I was shocked by how he didn't try to say sorry.

A customer waiting even agreed how she couldn't believe they wouldn't make my drink over again as I ordered the exact same drink but with milk this time and paid for it a second time. I even threw away the original one in front of them and they didn't even apologize. Hope they reprimand this employee and if the boss was there which was possible, that means this is bad business..."
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-12-16,5.0,I love this place so much! They made me an Oreo slush that was delicious. Cute atmosphere to chat with my best friend too.
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-07-07,2.0,"Kung Fu, not sure what happened but your smoothies does not taste like smoothies anymore. There is no fruit but is filled with boba seeds with no real mango. We were pretty disappointed during our last 2 visits. Clearly not going to be coming back here again for our smoothie fix!!"
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-12-10,5.0,I love the coffee milk tea here. It's a convenient spot in the village area and usually it's not too packed. Well worth the price. Quick service and friendly staff as well. Check it out!
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-02-11,4.0,"Ordered: 
Oolong milk tea with tapioca

The tapioca was cooked perfectly and the tea flavor was nice. I normally order my tea without sugar because I prefer a stronger tea taste and I enjoyed the tea taste here. The service was efficient, the prices are reasonable, and I was satisfied with my drink. This is a solid spot for boba drinks."
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-09-21,2.0,I came here friday night and had a drink before dinner. I was sitting inside there to kill time. The tea was great. But i noticed I was starting to itch. At first I thought it was just me getting anxious but both of my legs were starting to itch really bad. I started to feel bumps forming on my legs. When i got home I noticed that my left leg was covered in bug bites. They look like flea bites over mosquito bites. Not sure if they are letting people bring in their animals inside. But they need to fumigate that store. Won't come back here to kill time again.
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2020-01-28,5.0,"I love the rosehip lemonade and the peach oolong teas. The rosehip lemonade is floral and sweet all at the same time, and the peach oolong has bits of peach at the bottom so no extra sugar needed!!"
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2018-12-08,4.0,"Solid Kung Fu Tea branch in East Village across from 99 Flavor Taste.  They have a good range of options and all milk options are lactose-free, luckily for me.  I always go for the hot taro milk tea with bubbles and 100% sugar.  It's creamy and sweet with the perfect hint of taro flavor and perfectly chewy bubbles that don't melt even in the hot tea.  Prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly.

A good option in the East Village after a hot hot and BBQ feast!"
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2020-01-07,5.0,Great and customizable.  Matcha sesame is my new favorite! Cute interior and good location.
92,kung-fu-tea-new-york-35,2019-09-15,5.0,"My favorite chain, I was so excited to find this one in the east village. A little bigger than the NYU location so it provides more seats to work, study, hang out with friends etc. Love the lychee punch and they get the best bubbles in nyc!

93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2020-02-26,5.0,"I happened to be in the East Village for work and looked up nearby vegan places for lunch.   If it wasn't for Yelp, I would not have found Atlas Cafe.  It's easy to miss walking down the street. The place itself is cozy and has an authentic feel without being all in your face.The service is super friendly and warm. The waiter had a cool accent and seemed kind. There are MANY vegan options!! Really affordable! I had the vegan tofu crepe. Food comes out fast and the Moroccan flavors are so warm and yummy! Spinach and sun dried tomato filled with realistic tasting chicken. Good combo. I wish they played Moroccan music. I'll be back to true the bagel with tofu cream cheese, pancakes, and their desserts! Oh and get their coffee! Full and happy. Highly recommended."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2019-04-10,5.0,"I've loved this place each of the few times I've visited. I can't speak to their table service since I always order to go. However, the people who have taken my order are always extremely friendly and helpful. Plus, the food is always delicious!

That vegan spinach artichoke dip pizza! Oh, it's so good. It's rare to find a vegan version of this--one of my top three favorite pizza toppings. Atlas' pizza is more of a flatbread, yes, and it may look small. But don't let either fool you. It's so tasty and all the toppings really fill you up. They load it with artichoke, spinach, dollops of vegan cream cheese, and vegan (I think NUMU) cheese. They also add LITERALLY two specks of red pepper flakes on each slice. I hate spicy foods but this very subtle kick once or twice was enjoyable and upped the flavor. 

Don't forget to leave with some vegan dessert. Their selection may change on availability but they usually have strawberry/pumpkin/white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, chocolate peanut butter bomb cake, death by chocolate cake, tiramisu, a selection of different cookies, pumpkin/chocolate whoopie pies, and cannolis. While their menu is not completely vegan, their bakery is! So go crazy and try everything."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2019-02-13,5.0,"Really lovely place with THE BEST MENU OPTIONS- particularly for vegans or vegetarians!!!

They have so many unique options. Also delicious cakes and sweets. 

It is a small inside- about seven tables and the cafe seats 18 people total. They also do to-go.

They give very quick service. You can come in and grab a Vegan Moroccan Burger for $8.95- ready in just a few minutes. 

They also serve hot drinks like coffee, smoothies, and shakes. Gluten free options for the food too!"
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2018-07-10,4.0,"3-4 stars for vegan dessert selection.

Craved vegan desert and typed that into Yelp and Atlas was the closest to me.  How many times have I walked by this unassuming place and would have never ventured in otherwise.  Isn't it funny how that happens?

Well, the entire case of desserts are vegan - something for every taste - the guy (probably owner?) told me they've offered these desserts for something like 12 years already, so not newbies on the vegan fad train.

Loved my Death by Chocolate cake - it totally hit the spot - and enjoyed it while sitting out on the patio watching the music videos playing inside.

Will be back to try more items.  No frills and a very comfortable place."

Not sure if the hours listed online are incorrect but I was annoyed. I was coming here for the vegan options. Website/info about this place should be updated."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2019-01-27,1.0,"Me and my co workers always order from this place and to be honest every time they are almost comedically rude. Rush you off the phone and then proceed to get your order wrong. So I call back and tell them they got the order wrong the argued with me for 5 minutes then said they were sending me a new one and then never did. So when I called back he cursed at me and told me ""he's not bringing me shit"" 

Also very mediocre food regardless, and always cold."

93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2019-05-16,5.0,This place is amazing. I had the vegan tofu Mexican scramble with a iced chai tea ! Bomb.com! And the staff were so nice and welcoming. Our waiter even handed us a free little taste of a smoothie he made :). The vibe is great and so is the food
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2018-08-09,5.0,"Tasty Vegan food for a very good price! My favorite vegan dish is the ginger ""chicken"" crepe. The perfect food after my bouldering sessions in Brooklyn."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2019-04-23,5.0,Really delicious food and a very friendly owner. The moroccan chicken sandwich (on tunisian baguette) was A+. Will definitely be coming back to try other things!
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2017-10-25,5.0,"I'm a recent regular here.  They have an extensive vegan/gluten free menu offering pastas, crepes, and desserts.  My favorite is the Mediterranean vegan crepe.  They have both savory and sweet!

It's super casual and simple inside with a hand full of dinning tables and outdoor seating.

The owner is here daily taking orders and helping out.  It's definitely my favorite quick, healthy lunch spot!"

Iced coffee was pretty good."

93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2019-06-30,5.0,Came here Sun morning after reading the review. Great and very reasonable priced breakfast! Enjoyed the Vegan Tofu Scrambled Platter. Will definitely be back.  Good portion as well. A hidden gem.
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2016-09-26,5.0,"So let me just say, I've been going to this cafe for years...and for good reason.

Where do I start?

The food is delicious- no matter what you order. If you're a vegan, you will only love this place more.

The owner is a true gem in NYC. He always goes out of his way to accommodate. You can tell he does what he does because he loves it- it's never about the money with him.

Even after not going here for a while, I was welcomed back with a big smile. (And some free treats)

I'd recommend this spot to anyone. One of my favorites in the East Village!"
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2018-11-08,1.0,"Probably one of my least favorite places in all of downtown. 3x have I ordered food, all different items, all extremely inedible. Eggs are more like eggs au poive - the pasta is always over cooked and over salted - they don't know how to make a bagel. Just overall a terrible execute. So many other options that make better quality food and know how to season properly."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2016-07-18,2.0,"As a native New Yorker and vegetarian, I've been going to this cafe since they opened. I appreciate their menu, which includes many vegan and gluten free choices. I'm overall glad that they are still around, but they recently changed owners and unfortunately the food and service are hit or miss. It used to be one of those places where the owner always recognized you and chatted it up. Food was always fresh--you can pretty much expect a fresh tasty salad from most veggie-focused cafes, right?

Recently I went on a hot summer day. They weren't air conditioned and the guy seemed rightfully stressed out, but insisted I sit to eat. I ordered the Tunisian Vegan Chicken salad since it was too hot to eat anything warmer than salad. Out came my ""salad"", a strange fluorescent concoction-- from what my taste buds told me, a bed of wilted, hot mesclun greens with bright orange tomato based sauce and a few vegan chicken strips (the kind you can buy at Mahwah in Chinatown). I swallowed it down but it wasn't pleasant. Since I'd ordered ""salad"" I'd been hoping for something with a few more fresh veggies and, well, not piping hot. I still can't figure out where the fluorescent orange color came from, but I'll leave that up to you to decide!

A party of 8 came in while I was eating and even though the cafe is too small for a big group, he rushed to accommodate them. The temperature inside rose with all of our body heat. I waited until the party of 8 was served and went up to the counter to pay. Even though I was first in line, it took actively waving him down for 15 minutes to get one of the three guys in the back to take my money. It was hot in there and I had somewhere to be. 

Suffice to say, once I forget this weird food experience I'll probably go back again for old time sake. I just hope they read this and put a little more thought into their food quality and service. We vegetarians like fresh veggies in our salad, it's true!"
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2017-10-14,1.0,"First order was great, vegan gluten free pizza. 

Second order was the personal mozzarella pizza with vegan/gluten free crust, listed under Vegan and Gluten Free pizzas. Order came and had real cheese on it (I'm allergic to gluten and eggs, and am a vegan). I called and they said that's what I ordered and as I tried to explain that I ordered the one under the Vegan section, the guy just said check your email it's the same as what they have, then as I continued to try and explain it he just hung up  :/ Not ordering from this place again. The pizza went to waste. 

And if you do order, don't assume that what's listed under Vegan is actually vegan. Even if it's listed under vegan and said in the description it has a vegan crust"
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2018-09-14,5.0,I don't usually write reviews but i go here all the time and this place definitely deserves more than 3.5 stars. Their vegan crepes are the bomb! It's shocking how good they are for the price. Great salads too and food always comes out super quick. Love this place
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2014-10-14,3.0,"After taking a hip hop class nearby at Exile Professional Gym, my friend and I were hungry. We wanted something light and healthy. 

Walking by we saw they offered gluten-free and vegan options. I try to maintain a gluten-free diet, it helps with my digestive system, and vegan for me cause it's meatless Monday. 

It's a small restaurant, the menu is on the wall. The menu has crepes, sandwiches, soups, salads, and smoothies, no I don't have a thisp now. They offer Moroccan food with a healthy earthy crunchy twist. 

I ordered a vegan chicken (soy based) Moroccan sandwich with a Harira soup (chickpea) combo total was about $9.

My friend had the Cubano chicken sandwich with the same soup combo. He looked like he was inspecting his sandwich frequently. That's on him to tell us why :P

Not a bad deal, taste was okay. 

The sandwich was a bit small, with a soy patty in the middle and a bunch of tomato sauce (supposed to be harissa, which is super spicy, I didn't mind though) surrounding it. My thought afterward was that it wasn't bad but I wouldn't run back.

The harira soup look like their own creation (all of their soups are vegetarian), it had little pasta lentils chick peas, it was alright. My friend commented that it felt unfresh or that it was from a can or something, it had that Campbells vibe to it.  

The health rating on the outside was pending, which was explained when I went to the dark little bathroom and was greeted by small flies. ""Hey welcome to the bathroom"", ""oh thank you!"". Yeah they shouldn't be there. 

I dig what they are offering but I think they need an overhaul.

Real score is a 2.5"
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2016-02-05,4.0,"Not bad at all.
I've only been here a handful of times, which was always for desserts and they certainly know how to treat a fat vegan. Rows of delicious cakes like peanut butter bomb, oreo cake, walnut cheesecake....and even more vegan goodies such as cannoli, assorted cupcakes, and brownies! Even though their menu is mostly vegan / vegetarian, all of their baked goods are vegan which is a huge plus. Lunch or dinner here is inexpensive, but the prices for desserts are off the charts, literally! A slice of heaven aka ""oreo cake"" will you set back a mere $8.00, yikes!"
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2017-12-20,5.0,"Cheap prices (especially for vegan food in this neighborhood), good food, good vegan options (and non vegan options too), they don't skimp on any of the toppings or extras, and everything's always nice and hot, two blocks from my apartment... over all a very good find.  I mostly come here for breakfast and I really like the tofu scrambles, but I've been meaning to try out the vegan crepes too. The coffee's pretty good as well, they have a full coffee bar, the WiFi is fast and they don't scold you for sitting and working for a while as long as it's not super busy, which it usually isn't early in the morning. I especially appreciate the non pushy workers/atmosphere and early 2000s pop music they play. The seating area is fairly small but it's got a nice vibe and lots of sun. Definitely would recommend."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2014-03-11,4.0,"Atlas cafe?? 

I'm on the iPhone using the Yelp app (Love Yelp) and I see Atlas Cafe on my map screen. I said to myself, what a dumbass name for cafe. Atlas, I think of the tire brand.

I walk into the cafe and there is a huge Atlas on the wall. (Now I feel like a dumbass)
The wobbly tables and old chairs, this cafe is old OLD school!

I walk up to the counter and see some tasty looking pastries. I ask if they are made on premise. 

I'm told by the cutie pie barista with a Polish accent, ""No but they are delivered daily""

Well, put another shrimp on the barbie sweetie! I'll have an Almond Croissant as well as a Latte. One word - Yabba Dabba Doo!!!

Outrageous pastry as well as the espresso used for their latte.
Small place true but it makes up for it with quality coffee and baked good."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2015-10-03,1.0,"Admittedly, I only go here for Vegan Treats pastries anymore, and those are delivered from Bethlehem, PA on Tuesdays. Atlas still has an impressive assortment of Vegan Treats at all times of the week.

I went--on an impulse--to get a slice of the Death By Chocolate cake to go. I had been having a bad day; it was cold and rainy and I had been walking outdoors for most of the afternoon, so I reasoned that I deserved it!

So I went in and asked for the Death By Chocolate--an impressive multi-layer chocolate cake with gold leaf. As soon as the man handed me the clamshell and I was going to go, I suspected it was smaller than usual; Atlas Café had always given a huge slice of cake--so big that if I was taking it home, I wouldn't eat it all at once; I'd cut it and eat it in halves. 

I got it home and found this was true: they gave me a piece that was probably a half to two-thirds the size of their former slice. But that's not the worst part! The cake was stale and made me want to cry. I mean, the frosting was predictably good, but it was as if it had been slapped on chocolate Styrofoam. 

This means the restaurant is doing something funky with their cakes--and possibly all their food handling, but I haven't tried their other food since their new management took over. The previous owners got their Vegan Treats delivery on Tuesdays and froze a large part of it, thawing the cakes and pastries over the course of a week so that they'd be fresh when they were served; the new owners are apparently not doing that the same way if sawdusty cakes like this are the result.

I'm sorry to say they blew their last chance with me; I understand they must have a huge rent to pay for the tiny space they're in, and the restaurant business is tough in general--moreso in NYC--but get your act together, kids. I'm certain I'm not the only customer who's given up on you."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2014-06-16,4.0,"The menu here is incredible. I don't know how they are able to keep track of everything! I had my doubts about the food quality from the appearance of this small cafe, but I am glad that I tried this place anyways. What really drew me here was the selection of desserts from Vegan Treats.  That does not disappoint!  Best selection anywhere in NYC. Sticky buns (pecans!), cookies, whoopie pies, brownies, donuts, cake, cupcakes- they have a selection your mouth will appreciate.

As for other food, crepes and their vegan Moroccan chicken are my favorite choices. Vegans can also order soft serve and cream cheese on bagels, pancakes and lattes with nondairy milk (rice, almond and soy), smoothies, salads, wraps, soups and other entrees.  The prices are great for what you get.

The stars are for the Vegan Treat and vegan menu choices, but it's not anything avant garde or unique beyond measure. It's good quality but incredible quantity of selections!"
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2015-06-16,4.0,"The Atlast Cafe has the slowest service in Manhattan. Luckily this is not that place.

The very first time I came to Manhattan for a food tour (which was a couple of years ago now), this was one of the very first places I stopped. I came because it is supposed to have an excellent Lox & Cream Cheese Bagel, and it was very good indeed.

Unfortunately I wasn't yet schooled in how NYC does Bagels, so I didn't realize that for the true miracles of the Bagel world I'd have to go to Manhattan places like Murray's, Ess-A-Bagel and Brooklyn Bagel, as well as Baker's Dozen in Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Bagel in Queens. But for a ""first attempt"" at a bagel this was good. The bagel itself was excellent. The cream cheese was standard, and the lox were fresh and smoky and salty and delicious.

It didn't rock my world enough to finish the whole thing (I had plenty of other things to eat), and my travelling companion wasn't impressed (she loves bagels but doesn't like cream cheese), so I'll give it a healthy 4 but with the option to raise it to 5 once I give it another try.

And if it was the At-full-mast Cafe then I'd have gone here a little... excited, down below. But I didn't. It was hot, humid, and heavy traffic in Manhattan, so I just gulped down my lox and got the hell out of there. I mean I was such a virgin in those days. I hadn't even tried Sammy's Halal of Queens yet. (gasps) (groans)

Speaking of gasps and groans, are you free tonight? I'm like an Atlas Cafe. I specialize in around the world and will give you something hot to drink."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2019-02-08,1.0,Never had such a rude delivery driver before!! And called the place to complain and manager was rude too! Couldn't believe. Didn't get my food and I will never order from here again or recommend to anyone.
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2016-12-06,3.0,Small cafe in the east village.  It has about 8 tables.  Wide array of cafe like things.  Good service.  Good prices.  Nothing else that came to mind as we were there that made this place stand out.  There are a few off Broadway theaters in the area so this place serves well to kill time before the curtain goes up.
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2015-05-13,5.0,"Nice staff and they open fairly early for this area which is great. The lattes are freshly made and so are the bagels and paninis, just as you wish. Quite a small coffee shop, but they have a big variety of bagels.

I would say for Europeans they seem quite expensive, but for New York, that's what you have to pay...

Only one tiny complain: wish there was some more outdoor seating. At the moment all they have is a bench."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2016-09-20,3.0,"I've been here a long time ago and remember loving it. Today, I was a bit disappointed. I walked in and did not get acknowledged right away by the wait staff. The cook in the back assisted me... Which was nice, very proactive. I was only coming by for a light snack so I thought a smoothie would do. I ordered the mango madness and boy did it drive me crazy. I'm not sure who made it but I essentially received a banana skim milk slushy. The taste of strawberries and mangoes were barely present. I wouldn't have known it was in there if the description didn't say so otherwise. Suggestion to add more strawberries and mangoes!!!"
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2018-05-02,5.0,"By far the best place in the city to eat! I am vegan, my boyfriend loves meat, and my best friend is gluten-free. Finally, we have found a place that accommodates us all. The food is inexpensive and absolutely delicious. They offer everything from breakfast, to pizza, to sandwiches, to pasta, to dessert: you name it. The best part is: EVERYTHING is good. I cannot rave enough about the food. The place itself is cozy and inviting. It is small which makes it feel homey. The workers are foreign and so fun to talk to. Take my advice and go have one of the best meals your have ever had."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2016-05-02,3.0,"I've been coming to this place on and off for the last decade.  The thing to remember about Atlas Cafe is that all their Vegan desserts are outsourced from ""Vegan Treats"" up in Bethlehem, PA, which is, like the best Vegan Bakery.  So, even though they don't make their own baked goods, you can pretty much guarantee a tasty dessert.

I highly recommend getting the Oreo cake; it's pretty much my go to.

I've never come for anything other than dessert.  So, I can't really comment on the rest of the food.

The service on the other hand.  Not so good.  I can't speak for the day time staff, but the people that work there at night, seem to be pretty uniformed about any of the products that they sell and not friendly/borderline rude.  However, since I'm such a sucker for their outsourced treats, I keep coming back."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2015-10-23,5.0,"Atlas Cafe is under new ownership as of about a year ago. The new staff is so friendly and so kind. The food has gotten even better (but they still have the amazing vegan cookies that we all love!) with the addition of vegan and gluten free pizza and pasta options. Try the customizable smoothies too!
This is an adorable and affordable place to bring your vegetarian, vegan, and glu-tard friends when they come to visit- the menu has something for everyone."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2018-03-22,5.0,"This was the cutest little cafe, and the decor was super modern. I loved the vegan chicken BBQ pizza, it was by far the BEST vegan pizza I have ever had. They also have vegan desserts and vegan cannoli :)"
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2018-03-20,2.0,"I ordered the cinnamon roll with frosting and cannoli for dessert and was severely disappointed. The cinnamon roll is dry and stale, while the cannoli is no bigger than two bites, yet costs $5. Do not order these items here please!"
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2018-04-06,1.0,"This place used to be great but has since gone very downhill.  I ordered a cheese pizza today, the cheese and sauce was melted together to the point it looked like soup and the dough was still raw.  This is the saddest pizza I've ever seen.  Never ordering from here again."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2017-07-04,1.0,"Ordered off of GrubHub and was astounded by how bad the food was. I ordered something called beef bacon and eggs, and received something I had to dump in the trash. Mushy soggy eggs, a gross concoction of bad tasting cheese and wilted vegetables, and sad little 'salad' that consisted of soggy greens and way too many old carrot shavings. Actually spit it out after trying to eat it. REALLY BAD FOOD."
93,atlas-cafe-and-bakery-new-york-2,2018-02-13,5.0,"I've only been here once but the food here is delicious! The gluten free spaghetti with alfredo sauce was amazingly cheesy! I'm addicted.

I also love that they have a lot of healthy options here for decent prices. Will return for more!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-12-31,5.0,"Stumbled upon here while searching for a nearby coffee shop with seating. What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! It specializes in Hawaiian coffee (Kona Coffee), which I've never tried before.

I chose one of their signature drinks, a Hawaiian latte, which contains a blend of coconut and macadamian flavors. I was going to order it with almond milk originally, but the barista recommended it with Oatly instead. The oat milk made the drink delicious and extra creamy. There was also a coconutty sweetness, but it wasn't
overpowering. I'd definitely be willing to come back and try their other coffee drinks. The place isn't too large, but it's cozy and quiet. I give it a thumbs up!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-12-14,5.0,"Such a great coffee spot in the East Village! I had an iced Hawaiian Latte, served in a glass jar with a metal straw (bonus points for sustainability!!!), that had some delightful tropical coconut and macadamia flavors. The drink was refreshing fuel for my studying. I found myself craving more right after I finished it! 

There are a good amount of tables and seats if you're looking for a place to get some work done. Not to mention, their WiFi was easily accessible and reliable. Highly recommend that you check this place out. Even in the middle of winter, it felt like I had a little piece of sunshine in here!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-10-27,4.0,"Lately I've been into Matcha/Green Tea lattes. This place doesn't disappoint. Well-made, unsweetened, and satisfying. Only caveat is that its a bit pricey ($4.00+ for one small latte) but quality is definitely there.

Great place for getting some weekend work done. WiFi strength is great and atmosphere is light and calm.

Overall 4/5. One of the best coffee/study spots I've been to in Manhattan thus far."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-09-15,4.0,"Stumbled upon this nice coffee shop while looking for a place to grab lunch. Just like how everyone was Yelping about, this place is pretty relaxing and chill. There's a huge couch with some outlets behind it that you could charge your electronics. 

I ordered one of their signatures, Hawaiian Latte and asked for iced latte with Oat milk (they use Oatly milk so YES!) Luckily I asked the barista if the drink was typically sweet and he said yes, so I asked if he could make it less sweet for me. 

FYI: if you asked for any iced drinks, keep in mind that they charge 50 cents extra and 60 cents extra for Oatly. Yup, so my drink came up almost $7 which is pretty pricey but hey it's NYC so asking for extras will cost ya. 

Overall, Kona Coffee & Company is a decent place to hang out! Very nice and quiet. Free WiFi and outlets to charge your laptop or phone! Also love that they use reusable straw!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-08-18,5.0,"Best coffee shop in the east village in my opinion. Been here several times and the music is on point, the volume not too distracting and obnoxious, the coffee great. Plenty of seating and the couches are comfortable that I had no desire to leave until my trip. Would come back."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2020-02-12,3.0,"Decent coffee shop, I just got a cold brew and a yogurt to go. I didn't stay for long because it was ridiculously hot  in the cafe. Just and coffee were just meh, but I found staff kind of dismissive and rude."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-12-14,4.0,"Solid place. Stopped by when I was having caffeine withdrawals while in the area. I had the Hawaiian Latte slightly less sweet - it was still a bit too sweet for my taste so I'll probably opt for even less sweetness next time. Hawaiian lattes tend to be on the sweeter side, so I didn't actually mind too much since it's on par with what I've had in Hawaii. Prices are basically on par with other NYC coffee establishments. I'm happy to have found another coffee shop in this area!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-11-27,5.0,"Amazing coffee! The pour over is $7 and 7minute wait, but I think it's worth the wait! It's got a smooth note and refreshing taste!
The espresso was smooth and worth getting, but I prefer single origin over a blend. 
Anyhow, I'm excited to try these beans at home!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2018-09-14,4.0,"Kona is a modern coffee shop and cafe with Hawaiian flair. Though coffee is somewhat pricey, they're serious about their sourcing, and quality is high. Keep a lookout for specialty drinks like the Hawaiian latte ($4.50), which goes harder on the coconut than the macadamia.

They also have a short food menu, including acai bowls. My boyfriend's acai bowl came with hefty toppings but was a bit light and soupy on the acai. Do note for the nut-sensitive that many things here come with almond or macadamia.

Service fast, and friendly enough. Bathroom clean. Seating easy to come by, though not particularly cozy (largely high stools). Decent wifi, somewhat limited outlets."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-06-24,5.0,"Spent the better part of a Sunday afternoon doing some reading and getting some work done. One of my favorite cafes in the EV, they do wonderful (if not a bit pricey) renditions of your favorite coffee classics, but with a tropical Hawaiian twist. I LOVE the Hawaiian latte so much, it's a little bit insane to think about. I am luckily able to enjoy dairy, and I allow myself the whole milk indulgence when I get the hawaiian latte because it really just ties together the macadamia nut and tropical coconutty flavors to perfection. L O V E. Perfect way to send off your weekend. Plus, many outlets, and one giant couch for all your flopping needs."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2020-03-07,5.0,"One hears Hawaiian themed and instantly thinks of the floral shirts and tiki drinks. This is not that - and in a good way. 

Somehow this coffee shop hit the right amount of Hawaiian decor without being too tacky, yet also fit the vibe of East Village. Talking about indoor plants, nice wood tables, and good lighting.

A good cup of coffee? - Fantastic
Playlist to vibe to (if you want)? - Really chill
Plenty of outlets and seats? - Enough to work with
Bathroom (very important)? - One in the back

I hate to bring attention to spots like this since I come here often, but might as well give credit where it's due."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2020-03-06,5.0,Excellent coffee and lox toast! Used a 30% off Crave deal with min. purchase of $10. Delicious food and chill atmosphere...a definite must!
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-09-28,5.0,"came back to Kona after a while and this place is still as lovely as ever. friendly staffs, great coffee, comfortable ambience that enables me to do some work and always make me forgot how long I have stayed here. tried the spinach & kale pastry which turned out to be delicious. tried the new oatly draft latte which is describe to be heavily caffeinated. my caffeine tolerance is pretty low but I ignored the description and went for it anyway. tasted amazing though! didn't regret it, but it is heavily caffeinated. I can feel the effect with just 1/4 glass. maybe it's especially great if you need long hours of studying anyway"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-09-30,5.0,"So glad I found this coffee shop! A great place to get some studying done, they have comfy couches and multiple tables with outlets everywhere. Their wifi can go in and out however, but it wasn't the worst I've experienced. Their coffee is AMAZING! I'm still thinking about that iced hawaiian latte I got from here... super creamy even though it was oat milk, nutty but not overpowering the coffee. I love that they give you metal straws in a mason jar when you drink it there too. Looking forward to coming back again!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-08-17,5.0,"I love cafe hopping and I think this was one of the best finds I came across. I was in the area after having lunch with a friend and wanted a place to sit down for some coffee and do some work. I originally tried a different spot, but ended up settling down here for several hours. This cafe is very spacious and has a great selection of menu items. 

I was able to grab a good seat at a table. The wifi here is great and there is a large couch section along with several tables toward the back. There is plenty of space to sit and the tables are large enough where you can comfortably do work on a laptop or write. The vibes are very casual and it's quiet enough to get work done, but also is a nice place to catch up with friends or have a meeting with a coworker. 

The baristas here are great - they explained several menu items to me and my order of an acai smoothie was freshly made and came out shortly after I ordered. It was delicious and just the right level of sweetness. The menu is also quite extensive, with typically espresso items and teas, but also Hawaiian specialties, which I'm hoping to try more of in a future visit. In addition to drinks, Kona also has shaved ice, and some food items like pastries and sandwiches. 

I definitely see myself coming back here (potentially with friends), and hope to try their coffees and other snacks!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2020-02-06,4.0,"The drip coffee was quite good and balanced- I enjoyed it with some oat milk. I would have liked to see more vegan options besides overpriced avocado toast and an acai bowl. Vegan sandwiches or more pastries would be great! They only had vegan pumpkin bread which was just ok, very sweet! I'm a savory breakfast gal and I didn't really have options and didn't want to pay $10 for bread with avocado. The aesthetic however was nice inside and comfy! A nice place to catch up with a friend over some coffee."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-08-12,5.0,"I've been coming here for the past 2 years and I LOVE this place. They have great drinks - I particularly love their cold brew because it's smooth and consistently amazing. Their Hawaiian latte is also great and they also have some draft lattes available (draft oat latte is my go-to). 

Also, they recently added Hawaiian shaved ice to their menu (around late Spring/early Summer) and you can add mochi and condensed milk as toppings. It's not flashy but it doesn't need to be! The flavors are great and it's a generous amount for the price. I believe it's going to be on the menu all year round.

There's a decent amount of space too if you want to go and do work there( though the wifi has been inconsistent over the past 2 years). 

The owner (who's usually there) and the staff are friendly, too. Overall, definitely worth checking out!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-08-21,5.0,"Great place to get some studying done. Cozy with a huge couch if you feel like lounging or some nice tables and chairs for some legitimate studying. I got the coconut matcha latte and it's exactly how it should be - simply sweet and elegant. No shenanigans!

Kona is definitely a peace of mind in a busy city with crowded coffee shops! Definitely would come back!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-11-22,5.0,"Kona Coffee is a great coffee shop in the East Village for both their coffee and the atmosphere.  I use the coffee shop as a good place to do work throughout the week.  

It has a decent amount of space, accessible outlets, and a very clean bathroom (which is always important).  Also the wifi is reliable, which is more than I can say about many other coffee shops. The only downside to the place is that it closes at 9pm, but if you need to do work you can go across the street to The Bean, which is open to 11pm."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,Some of the best coffee in the whole city.  My lattes have been perfect. Not too hot and not under steamed. Good baristas for sure. Recommended without hesitation
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2018-04-16,4.0,"The first sip of the Iced Hawaiian latte brought me back to Hawaii with the macadamia nut flavor. The coconut flavor caught me off guard though. Not sure how the latte would taste hot. But if you like your coffee dark, then this is not the drink for you because it is on the sweeter side. Also, it tastes very light and doesn't seem to have that much caffeine. 

It's super cozy inside and there are pastries on display. Free wifi, quiet and good seating available. I would come back to try their Kona drip coffees or grab another Hawaiian latte! 

FYI - don't forget to checkin before you order for 10% off!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-07-01,4.0,Friendly service and good coffee - def what I was looking for but unfortunately my last 100% Kona coffee was in Hawaii and it tastes better in hawaii- it could be the mountains and the oceans give a different atmosphere than the streets of Manhattan but stil would recommend for some good coffee. Def wish they had more food options.
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-03-25,4.0,"I've walked by this place more times than I'd like to admit before actually coming in to get something. There selection of drinks is amazing, and  the bagels are on point. I got a drip coffee which was okay nothing you special. If you're not a fan of ""the bean"" across the street or are looking for a new spot this is definitely it. 
BIG PLUS - They are open till 9PM!! I'm willing to truck it here after all my usuals close if I need my coffee fix!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-04-28,5.0,"Sleek design and nice staffs. 
I happened to be here with my best friend as i wanted coffee very early in the morning. 
The coffee was very fresh and they have an amazing acai bowl and some pastries. Barista had his smile on even though it was very early in the morning. If you live around this area, check that place and make this place as your spot! 
Oh they have a killer couch!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-03-23,5.0,Love this place.  Needed a place to chill and randomly walked in.  Excellent matcha macaroons and macadamia nut cookie (yes it was just me and I had two different cookies- don't judge).  Coffee is super smooth- the place is clean and chill and has a low key but elegant vibe.  Highly recommend this place.
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-11-27,2.0,Ordered the matcha latte with almond milk and all im drinking is the milk because there is little to no matcha flavor quite dissapointing by the way it looks on yelp
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2018-07-22,4.0,"Went here with a friend to grab an iced chai tea on a Sunday morning. The place had some patrons, but we were able to easily find a seat.

I got a chai iced tea with oat milk which was delicious--I have never had oat milk before, so I don't know if it was that or their chai or a mix, but it may have been the best chai tea I've had.

The one downside to this place is that it sort of has mixed identities as it is sort of casual and open, but then has like soft lounge music and not a lot of natural light. Nevertheless, it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood and I will be back."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2018-08-01,5.0,"Love the ambiance and the furnishings were very comfortable and welcoming and clean!

94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-03-16,5.0,"Stopped by here on the way to the train because I was starving! This is a charming, cute little coffee shop (that has a bathroom and outlets to charge laptops/chargers) I got a broccoli and cheese quiche and the Hawaiian latte (top seller) The latte was great, there's macadamian milk in there and it's pretty sweet but I really enjoyed it. They also have a bunch of other small dishes like avocado toast, macaroons, croissant sandwiches and an assortment of coffee options. It was a comfortable setting and I would definitely go back to get some work done or just grab some coffee and a bite. The prices aren't that bad and there was only one person behind the counter but she was nice. I'd recommend it!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-10-05,3.0,"Meh. I don't see the allure that everyone else sees. Maybe the locals like it better. It was about 90 degrees inside the building on a sunny day . Service was slow, food was average at best."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2018-09-16,5.0,"Coffee snob: get in here. This place is great. I've been here 3x specifically because of the kona beans. Unfortunately this time they didn't have the  extra fancy estate beans, just the estate beans. No matter, where can you get a 100% kona pour over for 4.5-6.00. People pay that much money for an abomination called coffee at Starbucks (with whipped cream?). If you are lucky enough to visit when they have the extra fancy beans, get it. It's unforgettable. They also have very good pastries and bagels (black seed). Great seating, WiFi and outlets. One of my favorite coffee shops in NYC."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-11-15,5.0,"I love the coffee and matcha here. The vibe is super chill and can get lots of work done here since they have so many outlets and they have WiFi. It's great spot to read, hang, or prop open your laptop. The bathroom is clean. So glad I found this spot!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-08-19,5.0,The coffee from Kona is exactly as I remember it from Hawaii. You can get it hot or iced.
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2018-08-12,3.0,"As soon as I heard this shop had lavender syrup, I was hooked. My go-to is a hot lavender mocha with almond milk. Mmmmmm delish!!! 
Though, the tasty drinks are a bit eclipsed by the lukewarm greetings and service I've received from three different baristas over the past two months. Pretty consistently disinterested and neutral.
Suppose I can just as easily google lavender syrup and serve myself with a smile!
Pluses: always plenty of room to sit and baked goods are 50% off after 5pm."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-10-16,5.0,"It's hard to find a coffee shop that has a decent amount of seating and opens late. Perfect place to study! There are tons of outlets everywhere and it never gets too crowded. I always go for the Oatly draft, it's delicious. For those with a sweet tooth I definitely recommend their Hawaiian or Lavender latte. The baristas there are super friendly as well."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2018-06-20,5.0,"This review is actually for their beans alone, which are FABULOUS. We needed a bag of beans and stopped in to check out this place while we were in the area. Had a chat with the very knowledgeable staff about whether to go for the pure kona or stick with the house blend...we decided the house blend would be a safer bet for the brew method I was going for (double boiler espresso machine). Beans had a perfect roast date and they bagged them fresh. They were pricey ($16 for 8 oz - ouch!) but Hawaiian coffee is pricey even in Hawaii so we were prepared for the stickershock.

Beans have brewed like a dream. Chocolately, warm, rich, full flavored lattes all around. Very pleased with our purchase and will look forward to a coffee in house the next time we are in the area."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2018-08-25,5.0,"Chill, clean, great people behind the counter. Customers are chatting about Hawaii and I feel like I'm on vacation! Now to the drinks, for the Hawaiian latte with Macadamia nut milk and wow what an amazing experience in my mouth!!! 
I'd definitely come back anytime I'm in the area for sure!!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-08-26,1.0,"The customer service here is very poor. Walked up to the cashier and he just stared at me, not even acknowledging me- his customer. No ""hello"" or ""welcome"". I walked right out. Not giving them my money."
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2018-05-23,4.0,"The Kona Coffee Extra Fancy is an investment but worth it if you want a really good cup of coffee.  It does take a while to make since it's a pour over so don't order if you're in a rush.  Would love to see more Hawaiian desserts to complement the good coffee, not mini cupcakes or croissants.  The coffee begs to be drunk with a malasada, chocolate haupia pie or a lilikoi chiffon pie.  If they can produce these desserts, they can really make this a truly unique Hawaiian coffee/dessert cafe in New York.  Perhaps they can collaborate with the nearby Mahalo Bakery to make this happen.  Heck, if they buy from me, they will not know how to handle the crowds!"
94,kona-coffee-and-company-new-york,2019-07-09,5.0,"This place reminds me of coffee shops in California, ""trendy"" vibe but less pretentious than a lot of NY spots. I've been here a couple times and it's pretty close to my ideal spot so far... Good coffee, nice mugs, big couch, and ALL of the seats are actually padded instead of being some terrible metal stool like so many cafes do. Plus wifi (with password clearly displayed!) And I haven't tried the food but all the baked goods look pretty tasty. They even emailed me $3 off my order after the first time I came here. Service is fast and professional. Spacious, nice lighting. Good for work/study. I splurged onna Hawaiian latte and it's perfect, not overly sweet and flavorful."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2020-05-29,5.0,"This could be the best breakfast in NYC

-if you do sit here (during non-COVID times) it's a bit small, but that's the only downside
-they make magnificent eggs. Can't emphasize how high quality the dishes here are. Get the pig and egg...it's worth every penny
-some dishes have a middle eastern twist to them, which is creative and enjoyable
-staff very friendly and attentive to detail 

10/10. Love it here."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2020-04-25,5.0,Best neighborhood cafe spot. Extraordinary fresh and delicious homemade sourdough bread. Pick up a loaf or two and you won't regret it.
95,c-and-b-new-york,2020-03-14,5.0,"Popped in here in the peak of the COVID scare to do some work for a few hours. The seating area is behind the narrow hallway where the baristas are, and there's plenty of seating, small tables, wifi, and a few outlets. The hanging plants and overhead lights create such a nice warm space for staying, or a convo with a friend. The music is a blend of instrumental jazz and classics from the 20-40s on VINYL. Each track is picked and played by the barista on a record player!!! How special. The workers were diligent in wiping down the spaces regularly, and were kind and polite even though they had every reason to be on edge. I got a small drip and stayed comfortably for a few hours. Plenty of people around me ordered food and each dish that was passed around looked incredible so I definitely have to come back to try some, especially the sandwich and the tomato purée dip situation!"
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-08-18,4.0,"C&B is a staple in alphabet city that has only expanded its menu through the years, and I love it. 

Their breakfast menu is my favorite because the pork belly sandwich that's hearty, affordable and just so good! 

I would recommend popping by and grabbing your meal to eat in the park, weather permitting."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-08-18,1.0,"A cockroach walked across my arm while I was eating here. I quickly blew it off (Where did it come from? The ceiling???). Then I saw another scurrying across the bench my friends were sitting on.

The food tasted good, but they got our order wrong. They offered to remedy it for us by bringing us a chorizo sausage, which they brought, but it was entirely undercooked - raw in the center. 

Food tasted fine, but there's no way I can come back here after that cockroach experience."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-07-14,2.0,"I would regretfully agree that the counter person completely soured my experience of a cafe I used to love when I lived in the EV a few years ago. Yesterday morning, I was in the area and stopped by to order a breakfast sandwich and latte to go, first asking the barista, ""Good morning, how are you?"" She responded as if I'd peed on her foot. It was 8 AM. No one else was in line, but my presence was clearly an imposition. When I asked, as gently as possible, ""Hey, do you guys have skim milk?"" she all but rolled her eyes and made it clear I was a massive idiot for trying her patience beyond belief.

I'm not one to believe that baristas are required to smile or perform anything but the most basis courtesy, but It was hard to enjoy my sandwich after such a negative interaction. The sandwich was good.

I wasn't even going to say anything, but when I opened Yelp and saw that a TON of other people have had similar complaints, I decided to share my experience, since C&B has no way for customers to reach out via their website. I ran by this place this morning and felt a little sick, that's how unpleasant this interaction was."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2018-12-28,5.0,"Some good music spinning, a very good dark hot chocolate, friendly staff, cool place.
And more importantly the food is awesome guys!
I tried the chicken sandwich and the Cilbir bowl.
Cilbir bowl is interestingly mixing Turkish yogurt and poshed eggs.
The chicken sandwich is my favourite: good balance between lemon juice and avocado, the bread is great and the chicken moist and tasty."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-11-11,4.0,"This place just oozes character and charm. 
Had the egg and sausage sandwich. Really liked it but be warned: the sausage is ZIPPY. If you want bland you could always look for a Denny's or IHOP. If you want to try something different and delicious, this is your spot in Alpha City."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2020-02-29,4.0,"I work around the corner from here and I get the egg and cheese sandwich at least once a month!  The coffee is a bit small for the price but it is strong and always sooo good.  I also appreciate the freshly baked sweets everyday, ESPECIALLY the pumpkin maple cookies which I think are seasonal, but are the best treats ever!"
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-07-16,4.0,"C&B is a great place to come eat and have a coffee and chat. They have WiFi and I use to come here to do work but it's been too busy for that lately. They only have 5 tables for 2 people each. Their food is very good & underrated. It is on the pricier side compared to other cafes, but definitely better tasting and higher quality. They play records all day & have breakfast and lunch. It gets busy on the weekends but definitely a gem."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-05-23,5.0,"I don't think there exists an egg sandwich in all of manhattan as delicious as the one at C & B. I've never had eggs so perfectly cooked, and their homemade bread is unmatched. My go-to was, of course, the egg and cheese. I like the chicken and eggs but it's a little heavy, and their chicken sandwich with avocado and cheddar is my current obsession. I'm so happy they opened a second location near my work! The staff is also usually super friendly and they play great music, giving the cafe a great homey neighborhood vibe."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-04-28,1.0,"LOVE THE FOOD! The food here is AMAZING, everything on their menu is incredible. This rating is for the women at the cash register this morning. Both my roommate and I had horrible interactions with her this morning. She was extremely rude, snarky about how much we tipped and extremely aggressive when asking us to move to stand out of the way (it was very crowded). Extremely disappointed in her attitude and if I hadn't come to C&B previously and know from experience this is not the norm, because of her I would not return. 

Don't normally write reviews like this either, and work in hospitality myself,  but it was outrageous."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2018-11-25,4.0,"A gem next to Tompkins Park. A favorite of the neighborhood.

Very small so you may have to wait for a table to sit. 

Staffing was exceptional.

Two of us got breakfast sandwiches ($10 each). Both were large, well prepared, and tasty. Chorizo might be too spicy for some. Other diner got their yogurt dish with an egg. Also a winner.

Good selection of coffees.

So if you want a relaxing and ""mom and pop"" style breakfast."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-09-30,5.0,I had a lovely latte and a super tasty dish with a poached egg on top of an eggplant and veggie-type porridge with a crispy rice tadig. The type of experience that makes me sad I don't have quite that many interesting food choices in my neighborhood
95,c-and-b-new-york,2017-10-30,4.0,"New Yorkers swear by the egg sandwich as a hangover cure. Waking up with a headache on a Saturday morning, I headed down to C&B with my boyfriend to kill it with good old eggs and carbs.

The small shop is located right on the south side of Tompkins Square Park. There's a counter at the front and a minimalist sitting room in the back. The vibe is hip but unpretentious; think white-painted brick, melodic '90s hiphop, and serve-yourself water. I would feel comfortable taking someone on a (breakfast?) date here.

Their offerings are pretty pricy. The bowls are in the $10-15 range, and the sandwiches run around $9. I opted for the cilbir, or turkish eggs with yogurt, and my boyfriend went for the chorizo sandwich. We also had an espresso and a cappuccino. Total damages were around $28.

Our drinks came out first, in less than five minutes. The cappuccino was gorgeous, with some simple art on the top. So smooth and creamy. I didn't like my espresso quite as much.

Another 5 or 10 minutes later, we received our food. The cilbir was two poached eggs swimming in a garlicky yogurt spread sprinkled with herbs with two triangles of lightly-toasted bread. Making egg sandwiches was messy but great. A very filling way to start my day, but at least it was somewhat healthy from the yogurt?

My boyfriend liked his egg sandwich. There were 2-3 eggs worth of scrambled eggs. The chorizo was very rich. He felt that he had had better for less, though.

I enjoyed my meal here-- it's simple but very high quality. Consider it for a definite upgrade on your bodega BEC. You've earned it."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-11-26,4.0,The egg and sausage sandwich here is very good.  Cute restaurant.  Cozy with nice people working.  The coffee is OK.  My friend had a poached egg with some veggies.
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-10-28,5.0,I love this neighborhood spot!  It's got the best egg sandwiches in the area plus they just updated their menu to add more delicious offerings. Their coffee is good and strong too. The new barista is super nice and friendly. Can't wait to go back!
95,c-and-b-new-york,2017-09-06,4.0,"Had this place bookmarked for a while, given that it's far away from the train stop and not necessarily spacious. Narrow restaurant with an open kitchen up front and some seats/tables in the back.

Ordered the Pig & Egg Sandwich ($9) and an iced coffee ($3ish). Was going to order a juice, but the guy working the counter said they didn't have any. Food comes out in about 15 minutes - a small yet hardy sandwich with fluffy eggs and a slab of pork belly inside. A simple meal yet extremely satisfying; really liked the flavor of the pork (no sauce necessary). Coffee is your standard fare - not too bitter and paired fine with the sandwich.

I like how they serve most of their menu all day; instead of just breakfast. If there is no crowd, worth trying their breakfast."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2017-08-10,4.0,"Amazingly good breakfast sandwich! I don't have a reason for not coming here sooner, maybe it's because the space is so very tiny that it's hard to miss. I think there was a couple of small tables in the back, and a bench outside, but that's it. It's a grab and go spot. 

I ordered the Pig and Egg sandwich and the Merguez Sausage, Egg, and Cheese sandwich. The cut of pig on the first sandwich is good, but not nearly fatty enough for me! I think it's pork belly, and when I hear that I think of almost gelatinous, melt when you lay a fork into it meat and this isn't quite like that. 

But the sausage sandwich is made with what might be the best sausage patty I've ever had. Slightly spicy and flavorful, moist, dripping with red and topped with perfectly velvety scrambled eggs.

Edited to add August 2017: Oh my god that curry egg dish! I really love having curry for breakfast and this is just so warming, I can't wait to have this in the colder months. Delicious curry, with zucchini, yellow squash, carrots, chicken, and rice, with that heartbreakingly velvety soft egg. Everyone should eat this all the time."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-06-04,2.0,Mix feelings here. I'm a regular and I keep coming back for the delicious food and each time I think it should be the last because of the service. The food really is impeccable (although I would just chop the strings of watercress because they resist teeth and make for a messy sandwich eating). But like other customers I have experienced rough / borderline rude service from the girl most days at cashier/coffee counter. I've now been there enough to know that it's not a case of having a bad day but rather a general bad attitude. It bothers her to serve people. She simply should change industry. Ruins the atmosphere which would otherwise be lovely. Too bad.
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-07-15,3.0,Maybe i should try something else next time...the bread is fresh and good.i got the cilbir which is poached eggs with garlic yogurt and some spicy sauce... it was good usually its the kind of breakfast that i like to have even if i asked for some extra mushrooms with the cilbir or on the side but they refuse ...its fine... but it had too much yogurt i couldnt even find or taste the eggs.... i might give it a try
95,c-and-b-new-york,2017-05-24,5.0,"Cute, small little breakfast place that has the most delicious beef merquez.

We ordered some breakfast sandwiches - egg, cheese & sausage.  The sausage is a beef merquez that has similar traits to chorizo, with a fabulous spicy flavor.  If you don't like spice then you won't enjoy this breakfast sandwich.  It's also a large breakfast sandwich, I was full after eating half of it, so keep that in mind in case you might want to split one with someone. 

It's right across the street from Tompkin Square Park, so eat your breakfast there, take it to go, or go picnic in the park across the street.  Either way I'm a fan and will be back. Perfect for the on the go breakfast person.  Coffee was good too.

Cheers & Enjoy!"
95,c-and-b-new-york,2018-10-16,5.0,"Let's get one thing out of the way - yes, it's expensive. 

Anyways, the food is as good as what you get in Daily Provisions but here it's more casual and there's no insane lines and the people aren't as annoying. Their bread is so damn yummy and the ingredients inside really are the focus of why you come here. I love this place. I could eat here every day of the week. 

I would love for there to be many more places like this in Manhattan or Queens. Brooklyn is saturated - with skunk."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-09-01,3.0,"INCREDIBLE food - hard to find a better breakfast south of 42nd street (maybe the city). I come here almost every weekend. There's a woman that works at the register that's very rude, which sours the experience."

Food: SALT, SALT, SALT  :(  brothy chickpeas with underwhelming flavor (or it was obliterated with salt) and a smattering of large crutons. Only OJ in a carton for breakfast juice. All of this for nearly $18?!  :-/

Uhhh yeah. Not good. Was starving and under a tight schedule - too late to walk out without eating more than a couple of bites and try somewhere else or I would have.

But im writing this review because the food, specifically the menemen, is wildly inconsistent. Sometimes its amazing and sometimes its totally inedible. So i guess im writing this review to flag it to ownership because the last two times i've ordered, the menemen was BAD. Oversalted, weird consistency, almost sour/rotten just bad. And its a huge bummer because again, I love you guys and have had some great, great food here. And also because I'm tossing my $20 meal in the trash, again."

95,c-and-b-new-york,2018-01-07,4.0,"Small casual cafe with friendly staff on the South side of Tompkins Square Park - it's kind of an unobtrusive looking spot and it's easy to walk straight by without noticing it. Please don't though because inside you will find some of the most (if not the most) delicious egg sandwiches in the city. I love eggs but I'm almost always disappointed when I order them out - not here though! The scrambled eggs at C&B are light and fluffy and they taste wonderful. I love their egg and mushroom sandwich which also has some wilted greens and a sherry vinaigrette that perfectly balances the buttery toasted bread and richness of the eggs - it's so good. C&B is a great spot for breakfast or a quick lunch in the East Village. After all, I mean, egg sandwiches? You can't get much more New York than that can you?"
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-03-29,4.0,Homemade rolls with creamy soft scrambled eggs is a good choice. Limited menu but what they prepare is delicious.
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-05-05,5.0,Great tasting pizza and incredible customer service I love coming here it's a busy place relaxing and comforting.
95,c-and-b-new-york,2017-05-01,3.0,"I have been here before, but never for their food, so I'm really glad to have gotten to try it again! I came in just as they were opening, so I had my pick of tables in the back. The food menu is not put up on the walls (their drink menu is), but they do have paper menus up at the register for your perusal. 

After much thought, I went with the egg, sausage, and cheese sandwich. I wasn't sure how I'd like chorizo, and I figured sausage is sausage, so that was that. The sausage was actually very similar to some chorizo that I've had in the past - in terms of texture (pretty tough and chewy) and spice (had a nice kick). I guess what I'm saying is that if you can't decide between sausage and chorizo, it might not make a huge difference! The sandwich by itself was $9, which is pricey - given that it was just for the sandwich without any sides, but I guess in NYC, that will do.

Their coffee - even just their black coffee is made to order and poured over. I'm not exactly a coffee connoisseur (although I do enjoy frequent cups of coffee), so it didn't really make a difference to me. However, I did appreciate that my coffee didn't just come out of a huge pre-made vat."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2019-10-22,5.0,"We tried pig and eggs and sloppy seyit, both were delicious. We have been told that all ingredients are  local are organic. Iced coffee was also good. I would definitely go there again."
95,c-and-b-new-york,2017-03-05,5.0,"Cutest lil unassuming breakfast spot on the corner of Tompkins square park serving up some DELICIOUS egg dishes!!!

I went for a simple egg & cheese sandwich and my boyfriend got an egg & chorizo sandwich. That brioche looking, ciabatta tasting bread was toasted perfectly and soaked up all the eggy and cheesy goodness. The crunch on the sides were so good. The chorizo was a big piece of patty which we were not used to seeing but omg it was so juicy and tasty with a little kick. 

We got a skim cortado and a regular capp and I think their coffee is only alright.

We didn't want something huge for breakfast because we had lunch plans but I am definitely coming back for one of their breakfast/lunch bowls!!"
95,c-and-b-new-york,2017-06-01,5.0,"C&B is my new favorite spot! If I lived closer, I would be here every weekend. 

I had an iced coffee and their sausage egg and cheese sandwich. The coffee was really smooth, not acidic at all - I'm trying to cut down on added sugars in my food and this was easy to drink with just milk. The sandwich was super - fresh scrambled eggs and the sausage is actually beef merguez - so it's a bit spicy and definitely not your typical sausage patty. Most amazingly thing is that they bake their own bread. You can see the little oven next to the cashier, and the kitchen is in plain sight. Everything is prepared on the spot (so expect a short wait). 

When you first walk in, it looks like there's no seating but there is! Towards the back, there are a couple of tables - seats about 12, max. 

Overall, it was great food, great atmosphere, and the great staff!"
95,c-and-b-new-york,2018-04-03,4.0,"This place is chill and a good spot in the Thompson park area to grab a coffee, some breakfast or a snack.  They have some seating at the back which is  great.  

They make everything super fresh right in front of your eyes.  I enjoyed both of the dishes we ordered the curry veggies and the pork belly. It tastes really great and clean. It's a good option for this area, a place I would Def would come back to! Very happy with the meal"
95,c-and-b-new-york,2018-02-25,3.0,"tl;dr Simple menu with lots of good options.  Food was a little too salty.  Small seating area, 2 people is ideal.  Place looks loved and has character.  

Counter service food and drinks with a small seating area in the back.  The chef/owner is supposedly Turkish - some of the dishes have curry, but not most.  Could fit a max of 4 people at a table.  Not the place for big groups; two people is ideal.  Its seat yourself so no reservations.  Food came quickly.  The guy at the register was comically awkward. 

Ordered:
- beans and egg bowl.  Had a lot of veggies in but was a little too salty
- chicken and egg bowl.  Good, also too salty"

Having missed breakfast, I needed a little something to nosh on, but when I walked in, the decadent aroma of chocolate, specifically hot chocolate lured me in. No other nosh was needed, but I definitely intend to go back and try one of their beautiful pastries. 

The decor is adorable and feels like one of those places you don't see every day. It was also the best cup of hot chocolate I've ever had- the kind that warms your soul and reminds you that life is good."

A chocolate cafe in New York? Wohoo! Hot chocolate? Check. Seats and tables? Check.  It is not very common for a chocolate cafe to exist in New York.  Hot chocolate $5.00 for small on a arctic winter cold day is healing the soul.  Seating and tables are available but minimal which is a refreshing as it was enjoyable on site without lugging it all the way home possibly damaged and cold.  Seating is walk-in pending availability.  My experience was enjoyable.  Table service is minimal and since there are less than ten seats, by law, restrooms are not required to be provided to patrons.  I am enamoured for chocolate bonbons, classic chocolate chip cookies and chocolate cakes.  Customer service is attentive.  This cafe is a simple but a nice ending to a date night for couples as it is very conducive for conversation.  I believe chocolate is a stimulus for romance.  I wish there were more chocolate cafes in New York.

Mendiants $3, two small milk chocolate cookies which satisfied my taste and healed my broken heart and my broken soul.
Single bonbon $1.80, Earl grey tasted lovely.
Chocolate mousse slice $5.75, it was a sliver slice but average.  I did not feel it was moist.
Chocolate raspberry cake slice $5.75, I did not taste any raspberry in this sliver slice of cake and not moist but believed it was lying in the display case all day."

Delightful items to take home, or gift, as well.  Some seasonal items like choco bunnies or Santas etc.

Not sure if it's newly opened or if it's been open for awhile but the taste is the same! They always make the cutest animal chocolates from their mice, penguin to the turkey special. I love their hot and iced chocolate drinks too. I recommend asking for half and half. Half milk chocolate, half dark chocolate for the drinks. I just wish they had more seating available for dine-ins. There's only 3-4 tables available so minus one star for that. Otherwise give this place a try!!!"
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2019-11-26,3.0,"Ehh a little disappointed with this chocolate chip cookie I got here. You for sure have to warm it up if you want it to be good. The edges are kind of bland and the only part that made up for it was the center because it was packed with all the chocolate that melted in your mouth at once. I'd say there are better cookies in the city, but I'm sure they have other good desserts."
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2019-07-25,4.0,"Like the Cambridge, MA location, of which I was a regular, this L.A. Burdick has a small-town feel, thanks in part to the lovely & warm shopkeeper. 

Delicate pastries and chocolates, both packaged for gift-giving & displayed for in-store consumption at one of their five tables, are a feast for the eyes & mouth. The delectable aroma -- that's the white, dark, & milk chocolate used for their hot or cold beverages. My usual is an iced white chocolate, which was as good here as it is in Cambridge. My only disappointment was that they don't carry the same madeleines as my go-to location. 

Spoil yourself or someone you adore to quality chocolate treats from one of the most adorable shoppes you ever did see."

The shop might've been tiny but it was lovely.  Very beautiful with the lights.  The service was excellent.  The ladies were so nice and friendly.

I really liked my Burdick Blend Dark Hot Chocolate (though, to be honest, I've had better).  The Chocolate Mousse Cake was good.  The mousse part was excellent but the cake base was dry.  I did enjoy myself overall and would recommend it to any hot chocolate lover."

There are about four tables though."

With shipping it was over $155. And one of the Easter boxes was missing. Customer service was good and they sent out a replacement the next day. If you don't live in NY or Boston- just be aware- the boxes are TINY. I am so embarrassed to give something so small. I had to order something else from another place. The tiniest Easter box of chocolates was $28 plus tax and shopping and looks like it came from the dollar store. The chocolates are unique and delicious and their classic mice and penguins are always a hit. Just be aware- if you buy online and aren't aware of the sizes, you will pay a fortune and be disappointed."

I've had their chocolate before and it is delicious but the real draw for me here is the hot chocolate. I've had hot chocolate all over the world (including Belgium and Switzerland) and L.A. Burdick really makes a fine hot chocolate. It is thick, creamy, not too sweet, but packed with flavor. I love the dark, milk, and white hot chocolates. I like them all so much that I never know which one to order. I also always enjoy looking at the little mice chocolates as well."

96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2019-02-19,5.0,"Very good but almost TOO rich. Like wow - based on the amount of richness I can handle. Even for milk chocolate it is creamy and really tastes like dark chocolate. It is a really good taste though. Pretty milky and has hints of sugarcone or waffle cone that you'd have with ice cream. Still delicious. 

- my girlfriends review 

(I try to stay away from sugar during the week)"
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2020-02-02,3.0,The service was great very sweet and friendly but the chocolates are not so good especially considering the price. Next time we come we should just order the much lauded cakes.

This place gives me a Christmas feeling since the ceiling it's covered with little lights and it just makes the perfect place to stop by for a hot chocolate in this winter season.

I tried some of their chocolates, the most famous are their ""mixes""..a MUST! We tried also the Burdick and the chocolate coconut cake, which I highly recommend! 
If you come here you definitely cannot miss their hot chocolate! So good...I just wished it was a little bit more ""dense"" and not so liquid."
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2019-01-12,3.0,"There is a claim that they have the best hot chocolate in the world. I got an almond milk hot chocolate (dark) and it was very rich. Here's the thing, i don't like hot chocolate that is too rich. They also had peppermint hot chocolate which sounded pretty solid.

Cute place with friendly staff though."
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2018-11-12,5.0,I stopped in here on a cold day after brunch with a friend.  This is a small place with a few seats.  I had a milk chocolate hot chocolate.  It was excellent.  It was a very relaxing place to spend some time chatting.
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2019-11-12,5.0,FAV spot for hot chocolate. Def come here if you prefer thicker hot chocolates. I tried the single origin dark hot choco and the signature Burdick hot choco. They're both great but I prefer the single origin because it leaves a milder aftertaste while the signature one can leave a lasting bitter/sourish note. I also recommend just getting a small size if you're getting dark chocolate because the flavor can be pretty intense; something you'd rather sip than chug.
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2017-12-23,5.0,"A must for any chocoholic. The hot chocolate is probably the best I've had in the city, and every pastry and truffle I tried was simply perfect. (The mouse and penguins are iconic!) Ambience is classy and relaxed and the employees are all very sweet and helpful. Great spot to sit and relax, or just to grab a gift to go!

Tied with Jacques Torres as my favorite chocolate spot. Definitely better than LiLac, Kreuther, ROYCE, and Neuhaus."

It has a lot of lights and boxes of chocolates filled every wall. Snow was falling and we were freezing that we decided to crave for some hot chocolate. This place has hot chocolate!

The serving comes in a small or larger mug! I would be chocolate wasted if I get the bigger mug-- it was so rich! Chocolatey! One of the best hot chocolates I've ever tried in my life.

Very cute seating arrangement but I believe there was a time limit. 

Will definitely come back when I am in town and perhaps try their actual chocolates too!"

Their chocolate is amazing with adorable animal themes, one of the master chocolatier previously worked at Micheline star restaurant as well, so the quality of the chocolate is excellent. 

This shop has a small seating area so it's perfect to stop over for a shopping break or even to meet someone for a dessert date over some chocolate and coffee."
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2017-10-18,5.0,"L. A. Burdick is partnering with Devoción to create something unique, and unique it is.

This is where you get introduced to a fascinating world of decadence, where chocolate is not just a food, but rather an art. Here you can experience some delectable chocolate enhanced by the flavor of the only farm fresh coffee in the world.

Their pastries are delicious, but their bonbons are the reason you should come here.My favorite was the Macallan (12-year-old Macallan whisky added to a two-layer interior of dark ganache and pistachio marzipan, enrobed with dark chocolate and garnish with a pistachio). However, they have so many choices it's hard to choose. The Fig, for example (dark chocolate ganache with fig and port wine) is particularly delicious, but you really can't go wrong with any other choice. They take such a great care (and pride) in their products, that it's almost impossible to be disappointed.

Their different types of coffee are tasty, but their espresso is out-of-this-world. Sure, it's $2.75 for just a shot, but you won't find a more flavorful, complete, rich and smooth taste of coffee anywhere else. Truly phenomenal. 

If you want to treat your friends (and yourself) to something special, this IS the right place."
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2018-01-07,5.0,"The hanging twinkly lights from the ceiling originally caught my attention as I was walking to Dominique Ansel's bakery for hot chocolate. The long lines there made my friends and I back track to LA Burdick simply because of how cozy the place looked and a gut feeling that there would be hot chocolate. 

Glad for those long lines at Ansel's bakery or we wouldn't have discovered how delicious the hot chocolate here was. Frothy and just the right amount of sweetness and consistency. Not watered down and also not like someone just melted a hershey bar and gave it to you to drink. 

Was in a rush so got it to-go but even if we stayed, there wasn't much seating. Wish there was more seating since most customers (like me) tend to take their time with their treats. 

It's a couple of steps up to the counter from the entryway but also noticed that there is a wheelchair escalator. 

Would definitely be back for more hot chocolate and would love to try their other decadent desserts.

tldr; 5 stars for the hot chocolate and ambiance"
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2018-03-13,4.0,"This place is decorated so beautifully! I love all the dangling lights. There's a broad assortment of chocolates, drinking chocolate, and some coffee variants. 

I ordered the milk hot chocolate (~$6). I'll admit it's pretty, but it's not drop dead delicious. It does have a very strong, melted chocolate taste, which is great! I wish there was more marshmallow, creamy essence. 

Cappuccino: my friend got this and was extremely disappointed. According to her, they didn't make it properly. Perhaps avoid this. 

It's a fabulous place to catch up with friends. There's about 4 tables, otherwise not much seating available."

96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2019-07-07,3.0,"I was really disappointed with this place. I have tried Burdick's chocolate in Boston and I was expecting the same flavor. Unfortunately I didn't get it. I'm not sure what it was but it had a weird flavor. The cake though was good and the quality was the same. If you haven't been to the one in Boston, this is a good option, specially during a cold day."

Brought my boyfriend here and tried the milk hot chocolate. I was really blown away by the hot chocolate -- just a bit frothy at the top, with a depth and complexity to the chocolate flavor that made it rich but not too sweet. I'm definitely interested in trying out the dark hot chocolate next (they also have other specialty flavors).

The interior was also really beautiful! They had holiday string lights dangling from the ceiling (these caught my eye originally and made me stop to come in) and it looked like a winter wonderland. 

Definitely stop by if you have a sweet tooth for chocolate!"

Recently, visited during NYC's cold storm week. It was nice to land upon this store front and enjoy a cup of hot dark chocolate (the only down side is we weren't able to order in and sit down and enjoy). We were a little disappointed since with the cold weather our hot chocolate become cold chocolate in a short duration of time. They also offer varies types of chocolate pieces/bars, etc. Would love to check out this place another time and enjoy a hot cup of hot dark chocolate."
96,l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5,2017-10-29,3.0,"Very cute and fancy chocolates, like their signature chocolate mice and penguins.  I tried a number of the chocolates and overall found the ganache to all be a tad too sweet for me.  I also tried a couple of their pastries, namely the Burdick and the linzer torte, which were good and actually not too cloyingly sweet, which is a plus, but neither pastry was that memorable.  I found the texture of the pastries to be on the bready side and personally could've used a bit more crunch.

Not my favorite chocolates, but everything is cute and pretty, so I would still consider this as a gift.

Note they are also partnering with Devocion to offer some great coffee."

Of all the tables we were the last ones to sit down and the first ones that ""had"" to leave. 
Chocolate is amazing, but maybe try not to hire petty, angry and unpleasant young ladies that need to be rude to make themselves feel better about the world."

First on the pastries- loved that they were not too sweet, full of spice, but also very well balanced.

And the bonbons- really the stars of the show! You could instantly taste the quality of the chocolate. Each bite, however small, was packed full of rich chocolate flavor, along with whichever liqueur or spice he decided to incorporate. Any even more amazing is the fact that he cuts them all by hand!

He also makes ridiculously cute chocolate mice, penguins, and ghosts, and had a phenomenal chocolate haunted house on display."

Chocolate is so good! The inside is cozy (probably because it was brick af the day I went there and relatively empty). I do enjoy walking through this part of Soho and the desserts are expensive and decadent and snobby and that is exactly what I want from a store that only has locations in Harvard Square and Soho. All the various hot chocolates and cakes and little squares (idk wtf those are called) are so tasty. If you have a milk allergy, the soy hot chocolate is kinda weird so I would not recommend. 

I thought it was in Los Angeles at first because my Google Maps said so, but alas it is not."

Walking up to the counter, you feel like you're in a lodge in the mountains with their light wood paneling. The chocolate products pop out at you, causing much drooling and indecisiveness when ordering. The ladies at the counter were kind and as sweet as the product they were selling. I'm easily disappointed with hot chocolate but this cup was simply heaven. I sipped and sipped and didn't want it to stop. I don't often repeat places but this one makes the list. I only went yesterday but I'm thinking about when I can go back again."

$10 for tea sounds expensive but they give you a POT and you also get *free refill* (score!) So if you're planning to study and stay for a couple of hours or so, you can order hot loose tea leaves and you can always refill!

The workers r nice and can recommend you the popular drinks and they have elines cheesecake for $4 which is sooo soft and delicate. I will definitely come back! Even though it looks small, Theres enough seating that you'll be able to find a seat soon enough. I had a lovely study session here and would come back!

97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2020-01-27,1.0,"Holy shit first time I've been to a cafe that had absolutely horrid customer service which is too bad because the atmosphere looked alright. 
I was walking by with my wife and family but my wife had needed to use a restroom so we walked our happy cold butts in there. Now mind you I already was going to get myself a hot tea so this was going to be a good stop for us.
Immediately upon trying to use the bathroom the disaster happened, not only was my wife loudly told she needs to make a purchase first even while I am at the register in middle of ordering drinks but he bathroom manager simply didn't let her in until AFTER I paid. While this was really unnecessary I was embarrassed but tried to rationalize it that they problaly get a lot of people using their bathroom and not paying. 
So I order two teas and try to sit down with  my mother and sisTer in law while I wait for my wife and the bathroom manager is constantly shooTing us dirty looks and talking to his co worker and making gestures at us. We are the only party in the section.
By the way the tea sucked it was really bitter and tasted old but it was cheap so ok.
The last straw was when they loudly and openly tried to argue with my mother in law an older Chinese lady because she was trying to throw out a trash cup of bubble tea from coco's in their trash can. They embarrassed a 65 year old woman for such a petty reason, embarrassed me for vouching for them because I had come here before, and embarrassed my wife. I honestly hope someone talks to these employees mainly the bathroom manager and I guess the barista for giving us trash tea, I guess she assumed we weren't regulars or weren't staying long.
In summary, employees are extremely rude  if you want to use their facilities, the tea can be hit or miss because I have come before and the tea was fresh and floral. Today I ordered the same tea I always ordered and it was very bitter and tasted like dirt. Lastly there is no professionalism they will loudly and openly embarrass you in their establishment, so much for customer service."

WHAT

This is a very cute and friendly little cafe to hang out at when you are in the wonderful little sleepy town known locally as New York City.

When you're in the Chinatown District, there's a lot of great Boba shops, and honestly some of them can be a little unfriendly and abrasive. However this particular one could not be any more friendly if it tried, and I don't think it has tried to be more friendly because it's already perfectly friendly.

I'm not a huge fan of the Boba here, but some of the other drinks are excellent and the decor is absolutely lovely.

All in all, it's one of the nicest places to hang out in Chinatown. I would recommend coming in here to anybody, but maybe skip the bubble tea because I'm a huge fan of Bubble Tea in general, and this isn't some of the best stuff that you'll find.

The 5 star is specifically for the lovely service, great decor, and products in general other than the Boba.

Now it's time for me to slide into your DMs, and by your DMs, I mean the next review, which you have to admit is a pretty slick move on my part. Perhaps they should rename it the Slick Road Cafe."

But there is a minimum) Me and my friend got a teapot to split and I got waffles with green tea ice cream. I loved the little serving cups for the tea. They are so dainty and small. The waffles was delicious and massive. I was pretty pleased to see lots of people studying here. Very quiet relaxed environment.

One thing that bothered me was the restroom. It was so wet and cold. Kinda gave me the creeps. Aside from the bathroom situation, this place is great. Staff is nice and friendly. I'll return again."

97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2019-11-08,4.0,The prices are pretty decent. The guy will refill the tea pot (with the tea bag in it) with hot water after you are almost done. So you get more than just one pot. The Oolong Orange Tea we got were $6 and we got 2 rounds of it. The space is pretty comfortable. Taking one star off because I've only been there once.

97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2019-01-07,2.0,"Came here with friends to catch up over coffee and was disappointed with both the drinks and the service.

- Drinks: I ordered ""grapefruit"" from the ""Fresh Fruit"" section of their menu and what I got was not even remotely fresh grapefruit juice--definitely more along the lines of Tang (that orange powdered drink). Friends who ordered coffee were equally disappointed with their drinks. Based on previous reviews, I guess tea is their forte.

- Service: Of my group of six people, five ordered drinks. After we sat down with our drinks, within 5 minutes, one of the staff members came over with a menu to ask the remaining person to order. Having just had lunch, the last member of our party politely declined. However, the staff member insisted that if he didn't order, we would all have to leave. I'd understand if only 1-3 members of our group ordered and we were taking up their space for a long time/loitering--but it felt unreasonable when we'd just sat down and 5/6 people ordered drinks."

The fruity drinks aren't that great but who comes here for that? I usually come here for some coffee while I study and it's alright nothing amazing but it's better than Dunkin' Donuts! There are pastries if you get hungry while studying or hanging out with some friends. 

The cashier which is also the barista is super nice and when I have specific demands for my drinks, he fulfills them with no extra charge."

They are so spot of with their customer service! Weber they see that your tea pot water is low, they coke refill it for you! As many times as needed!

97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2019-03-18,5.0,Very good prices! In the heart of China town! Excellent selection of straw colors! I ordered the iced black milk tea and it tasted very delicious!! Very speedy service!!! Has a bathroom inside!
97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2019-08-11,2.0,Got their regular latte with regular milk and oof was that bad. Two ingredients. One nasty experience.
97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2018-12-26,5.0,Love their tea! A whole pot of tea is only $6 and they give you hot water refills. Got the rose green tea which smelled amazing and settled my uneasy stomach.
97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2018-10-28,5.0,"Really cute decor, and has lots of seating space! The nice cashier noticed that I was looking for a table that had access to outlets (which, by the way, this place has many with large extension cords as well), and motioned me over when she noticed a group getting up to leave. It was super nice! Also the bubble tea (I got peach tea with jelly) was inexpensive and refreshingly tart."
97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2016-11-13,3.0,"Was never a huge coffee person and don't drink that much tea - I'm not exactly sure how this happened, but now I subsist almost solely on water and tonic water. Or just remain badly dehydrated. This is all to say that when I made a BLEH face right after I took a sip, there's nothing wrong with Silk Road Cafe's Americano, I just hate coffee that's not laden with sugar. Or coffee in general. 

My friend's caramel hazelnut milkshake with lychee, on the other hand, was creamy and milky without being overly sweet. The menu also features fruit smoothies and various teas meant for two people (though I'm sure one person could take care of it), as well as bagels, waffles, and sweet toast. If you're craving actual dessert, they have Eileen's cheesecakes for $4 and shaved ice. 

The two people manning the cashier and making the drinks were really nice. Not crowded at all on a Sunday morning during lunchtime. Probably one of the few coffee houses/cafes/bakeries in Chinatown that takes plastic."
97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2017-05-01,4.0,"Back again!!! 

Although it isn't that close to both Q and D train stations, it was worth the walk! You can neverrrrr go wrong with the mango tea with aloe jelly! SUPER REFRESHING ON A HOT APRIL DAY! 

LOVEEEEEEEEEE ITTTT!"
97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2017-01-21,3.0,"Decent Wifi connection.

Pretty quiet place to do work and study, or just hangout. The staff is usually very nice.The food is okay, but no ac in the summer."

97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2016-08-23,4.0,"Eileen's cheesecake for $4 or a mostly boba-based business that was quite brisk late afternoon/early evening, but I was craving shaved ice and it wasn't available last time I tried in June (it's very seasonal here apparently). The $5 Sunset ice with 2 free toppings -- pop boba (which they warned me about 3 different times & ways, presumably because I'm white*) and condensed milk (they'd run out of taro) -- was very refreshing.

*There's some stuff hanging from the ceiling so low that it hits your head at some of the tables."
97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2016-11-27,4.0,"I highly recommend their peach green tea with bubbles (tapioca pearls). Their milk tea is made from powdered milk, as are most places around the U.S., so I didn't order that. Their tea pots come in cute little glass pots with two cups each.

This is a great place to chat with friends or to do work. 

There's a decent amount of seating available.

They do accept credit cards."
97,silk-road-cafe-new-york,2018-04-15,5.0,I was so pleased to discover this cozy comfortable tea house right on Mott street in Chinatown.  My friend and I regularly go down there to have foot massages at he Renew Day Spa.  Having a delicious  beautiful pot of hot tea at the Silk Road Cafe was a perfect complement to our outing.  They have some  top quality teas that start at $6 per pot.  I has the Jasmine Rose Green tea. It was so delicious I bought some to take home.  I also enjoyed it he decor and relaxed atmosphere.
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-04-06,5.0,Thank you so much for thinking of your local ER staff during this pandemic! Those were (past tense because we devoured them) hands down the best cookies I've ever had in my LIFE! Your sweetness (you see what I did there) brightened our day!
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-04-12,5.0,"This place screams quality when you walk in. There's something about the sleek design and dark blue accent color that makes you think well, I'm going to spend a fair bit in cash and calories but that's OK.

They have a lot in the case to stare at, but you can't leave without getting a brioche donut. They are soft and airy and chewy, like pockets of heaven. The coffee is very good, and if you order a drink, they will sometimes give you a small cookie or piece of chocolate to go with it. 

Seating is limited. There are some spots in the front, but they are usually always occupied. You'll have better luck in the back: I suspect most of the tourists who drop in don't realize there's a back room. The space may be limited but it doesn't deter people from bringing their laptops and camping out. I don't blame them. Getting work done is a lot easier on a sugar + caffeine rush."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-04-20,4.0,"The other reviews have pretty much covered the lay of the land in terms of what's amazing at this tiny, unassuming bakery (aka everything) but I have a ""oh NYC"" story about the place. 

My friends and I came here one beautiful summer afternoon to try to grab some of the dark chocolate brownies, only to find a teeming line that snaked a few doors down. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone bobbling near the entrance and trying to get in, only to be rebuffed by a few semi-cranky New Yorkers who said, in less polite language, to please line up and wait like the rest of us. The person then left in a huff. We didn't find out until we got to the cashier (who kept shrugging) that it was Emma Roberts and her assistant who wanted to get their mitts on the last of the brioche donuts. 

MZD is not cheap but it's delicious and I think I prefer the flavors/textures over somewhere like DZ, which skews more towards the sweet and fluffy side of things. Hands down, my favorite is the MZD bar (or, as my friend called it, the ""bougie Snickers"") - loaded with chewy oats, nuts, and caramel. I've tried making a somewhat healthier version at home but it just didn't turn out the same. It comes as a hefty square puck and will fuel an entire day of wandering around the Village and SoHo. 

Their brioche buns and cookies definitely stand out and, to me at least, are worth paying the little extra. I don't think their croissants are as exceptional and once had an unbelievably dry piece of chocolate cake. Coffee drinks are quite expensive."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-04-10,5.0,"I'm the biggest fan of this cute bakery nestled in Greenwich village! The store has surprisingly a lot of seating area and makes for a great place to meet with friends or just enjoy a cup of their coffee. 

I tried the brioche doughnut and it was incredible - my only regret was not grabbing another for the go! I'm excited to go back and try the other pastries."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-04-14,4.0,Stopped by the 3-day popup last week and grabbed a few treats. Chocolate crinkle cookies were amazing and had the richness of a brownie. Also loved the apricot tart bar. Can't wait until they're back!
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-01-06,4.0,"We were in the West Village, while there we decided to come by this bakery for breakfast. I'm not in the know, so I had no clue about the James Beard nomination and all that stuff until after my visit.

Friendly greeting by the staff when we walked in, very neighborhood-y feel, wasn't crazy busy like midtown crowds, relaxing comfy vibe. Nice looking display so we just chose some items that looked good. 

We got the Old Fashioned Doughnut and their popular Brioche Doughnut and Choux pastry nugget ball. To me it was definitely more fancy and sophisticated type of pastry, it was very good!  Not too crazy sweet, nicely made, satisfying for breakfast, a cup of coffee and I was good to go! Tasty La Colombe coffee too. 

This shop has some seating in the front, I think there may be some in the back too, but I didn't go back there. Pricing was on the higher side, staff was friendly and helpful. Glad to stop by and would come back, while in the area, it's not far from the ""Friends"" apartment."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2019-10-23,5.0,"The croissant is out of this world. Cripsy on the outside and buttery goodness inside. One of the best crossaints I've ever tasted (I've had a LOT and I'm french). Chocolate cookie with powder is amazing too!!

I will definitely be back!"
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-02-07,4.0,"We STAN a good cafe/bakery. 

Post-dinner on our way home, we stopped by to grab a quick bite of dessert, and even though it was end of day and there were limited choices left in the display, the pastries we picked were still incredibly solid. The atmosphere was surprisingly still bustling for being close to closing time (which I take as a good sign!). We both loved how soft the brioche doughnut was but with just the right amount of bite. Decadent but worth every morsel.

Will need to come back ASAP to try more of the menu."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2019-12-09,5.0,"A blogger I follow had mentioned this bakery so when I found myself in the neighborhood, I decided to check it out for myself. I am so glad I did. I was trying to order a box of treats to bring back as a souvenir for my family and asked if there were any premade. The employee working said they typically don't pre-make them so that the items will be as fresh as possible, but he could go run downstairs and check to see if all the components of the gift box were made fresh and could be thrown together. He was back in a flash, with a freshly prepared box all bundled up. 

And of course, I couldn't leave without trying something myself so I ordered a brioche donut and I DEVOURED it. At first I was confused by the shape, but then realized the donut hole simply sits on the top of the donut (they're not attached as I imagined). There's some sugar lightly dusted on the outside but the inside is filled with a custard that just sets it apart (and was entirely unexpected). I don't typically like filled donuts (mostly cuz they're overfilled and messy) but this is my new exception. My biggest regret is I didn't get a second. Will definitely return here...and will possibly be sneaking some treats out of the box for my family!"
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-02-23,4.0,"Mah-Ze-Dahr's unassuming storefront - deep blue doors, panels, and an awning, with simple gold lettering on the window - doesn't do the bakery justice. It's easy to miss from the outside, but peer in and notice the clean, modern look, the assortment of cakes and pastries displayed on marble slabs, and café-style seating. The main area is small, but there's a communal table in the back that accommodates additional guests.

The dark chocolate brownie immediately caught my eye, its richness readily apparent. Dusted with powdered sugar, which isn't needed (but also doesn't hurt), the brownie's top layer is slightly crispy. Beneath it lies the dense, yet chewy base. The intensity of the dark chocolate was the deciding factor for me, and ultimately the reason why these brownies easily rank among my personal top three in the city.

The cookies aren't to be overlooked either, particularly the gingersnap. With pieces of candied ginger and crunchy ends, it's a seasonal favorite; it has just the right amount of spice, a soft center, and a coating of crystallized sugar. The chocolate chip cookie is pretty good too, although not quite on the same level as the gingersnap.

Honestly, I'd make a special trip for the brownie alone, but since there's still so much I haven't tried at Mah-Ze-Dahr, I'll have to make some room first."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-03-01,4.0,"Very cute bakery in Chelsea! They have a good bit of places to sit and my ginger snap cookie was to was die. I keep thinking about it!!!

I also got the banana bread, but I haven't eaten it yet. I'll follow up when I do.

The reason I gave 4 stars is because they do not take cash and I wasn't aware of this until I was checking out (only had cash). Luckily I ended up accidentally bringing my card some how and was able to pay. Maybe put up a sign? 

Besides that, it was great. Will be back!"
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2019-09-26,5.0,"I've been ordering from this place for years but never had a chance to actually visit during my trips to the city. This time however I knew I wanted to see the bakery itself. If there is ever an ambience that combines sophistication, chic and delicious...Mah-ze-dar has it. The aesthetic is clean, neutral gray to dark blue, sleek and also comfy. You can tell thought was put into the design. The decor is showcases the lovely bakes on display. I tried the brioche donut and it was pillowy soft with just the right about it delicate sweetness, the filling was also creamy but not at all this overly sugary. I also had the seasonal onion focaccia.....just perfect.
Overall I'll be back before my i have to leave because Mah-ze-dar has hit the spot of fine baking that lets you actually taste the substance behind the icing and sugar."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-03-16,5.0,"I haven't written a review for a while but this one is definitely warranted. I had this bakery saved for a while and by chance I was walking by. I was happy to meet the owner who kindly told me to return back on Saturday in order to get a chance to choose a variety of baked goods since it was already late in the day. In the meantime, she gave me a complimentary bag of homemade granola--which is CRACK. Not kidding; it's very good and I almost ate the whole bag now haha. Anyways, I did come back on Saturday and tried the following:
-Almond espresso chocolate croissant
-Cinnamon bun sticky bun
-Latte with oat milk

SO RICH BUT SO GOOD. Honestly, the bun was the BEST and I know it went straight to my buns hahaha. 

I would definitely come back; recommend it highly :)"

I came here for the hot chocolate according to a Google search... 

Overall: 8.8/10

The Google review did not disappoint. The hot chocolate was definitely good, make sure to ask for the Marshmellow on top and have it burnt a little. The chocolate was smooth, not too strong and you can definitely tell it's not nesquik. 

The cakes and pastries there are amazing. The carrot cake was really really really good. The cake slice itself goes for like $8 a slice kind of like @ladymcakes . Not a single thing to complain about here. 

From what you see here, I spent around $35-$40"
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2019-06-30,3.0,"Cute cafe with decent pastries, coffee, and ice cream. The mah-ze-Dahr bar is not too sweet or chocolaty, crumbles well, and is underwhelming to taste after reading the list of ingredients- salted caramel, toasted pecans, chocolate chips. 

The banana cake is moist and not too sweet, and again underwhelming. 

Free water available in the hall toward the ice cream parlor and bathroom and friendly staff."

Everything is so well made like an art you cant really have a favorite. The cheesecake is amazing, the croissants are perfection, the chocolate chip cookies are yum, all the cakes are a perfect combo to my tea, and the brioche donuts....omgomgomg"
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-01-01,5.0,"Hot damn that is one fine bakery. What was better, the chocolate orange danish (and I loathe fruit and chocolate but this one was fabulous), the vanilla cream stuffed donut (heaven) or the justifiably famous chocolate cookie? Go on, walk to the next place on your list instead of taking the train and GET. THEM. ALL. Your new years' resolution should be more Mah-Ze-Dahr, fewer ho-hum bakeries who don't meet the mark. We didn't even look at the cakes (it was too early but they looked fabulous), or get to enjoy the lovely, inviting space. On top of all that, the staff were chipper and charming even on an early new year's morning.  

Here's to a Mah-Ze-Dahr opening in Brooklyn in 2020 :)"
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2019-12-05,5.0,"Finally found a bakery that I wanted to return over again!! I got to Mah ze dahr early this morning because I couldn't sleep well last night. So I thought maybe a warm, freshly baked croissant can make me feel better. Well, I was a little bummed when they hadn't had any croissant at 7:45. But I saw the infamous Brioche Donut and ordered it instead; it's also on my pastry list anyway! 

The Brioche Donut was one of the best pastry/dessert i have ever had in my life!!!! I fell in love with it, and the bakery, in my first bite. The crust was soft, chewy and not oily at all. The inner layers were airy, resembling a croissant rather than dende like a donut. It reminded me of the cronut somehow lol! The filing was perfect- I wish all pastries' filings achieve this level of delicacy and elegance. It was subtly sweet, really creamy and soft, and had a hint a sweet vanilla smell. The creamy rather than absurdly sweet filing was perfect for the brioche because the outer crust was sweet enough and was covered in sugar. It really complimented the pastry! I finished the brioche donut within minutes and had to resist from ordering more pastries when I was there. They all looked so attractive and convincing after reading all the reviews on Yelp. The croissants came out fresh and hot around 8:30AM; so if you wanna get those come after this time! 

Mah ze dahr bakery  serves coffee from La Colombe (my favorites!!!) But they didn't have my Black and Tan cold brew so I ended up not getting my coffee there.  It also has a lot of seats. At the entrance there're cushioned seats and small table that are perfect for people to grab a quick bite at a restaurants or stay for a while to read book. At the back there're counters with charging outlets for those want to work on their laptops. Further I believe there are larger tables for group hangouts! 

I will definitely revisit to gradually try everything they offer because they look and smell heavenly! I'll have to do it one at a time because moderation is key!! So maybe I'll go to Mah Ze Dahr everyday to pick up one pastry then hahahah"

I was in the area and wanted to get a cake for my mom. She LOVES cheesecake and when I did a quick Yelp search I came across Mah Ze Dahr. It's a cute little bakery in the West Village which houses a lot of delicious treats, cakes and coffee. It's a little bit hidden so make sure you're on the lookout for it! There's plenty of seats in the bakery and there were a lot of people when I entered. I bought one of their signature cheesecakes and they packaged it really well. The service there was amazing and everyone was so friendly and nice.

My mom LOVED the cheesecake and I did as well. I was surprised by how light and citrusy it tasted and overall it was delicious. 

I stopped by their bakery a couple of times after my first encounter and always had a lovely experience."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2019-12-11,2.0,"I came in with high hopes after reading the reviews. I am a cake person and I saw they had a vanilla buttercream layer cake on display so that's what I got (clocked in at $7.90). It tasted like it had been sitting out for an entire day; cake was dry and stiff, not fluffy at all. And the frosting was quite flavorless, and had the consistency of Crisco. I will give an estar because the cake itself was well presented. I mean maybe they're better known for their pastries, but definitely not getting cake here again after this. 

12/19: got to try their brownie and cream donut today. The cream donut was outstanding, and I'm not even a donut person. Or a cream person. But the brownie was terrible; I've had better from a grocery store. It was dry and stiff, even having it in the morning when it should be fresh. I'd say this bakery is hit or miss, probably not coming back."

I stopped into Mah-Ze-Dahr on a Sunday afternoon for a coffee and a baked treat. The staff here was incredibly friendly and the shop was charming and sweet. 

I ended up ordering an old fashioned donut and a small coffee. The donut was absolutely delicious and lite. It didn't leave me feeling heavy or like I had over eaten. The coffee was a bit hot to drink at first but absolutely delightful after it had cooled a bit. I even ordered several cookies to go because I couldn't not decide. Everything was amazing and it was a perfect stop to make mid day. 

They have a weekend special cinnamon roll that they only make on Saturday and Sunday. I'll definitely be back to try it out! 

I highly suggest you stop here any day of the week to give them a try! 

No note: they do not accept cash."

The coffee was decent, not my favorite not my least favorite.  A bit too hot to consume. 

Check it out if you're in the village."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2019-04-17,5.0,"This spot is one of my favorite bakeries in the city. I find that they're always switch things up, so whenever I go, they have another baked good/cake/treat on display. I figure it's because they are always selling out and baking something new downstairs. 
Things I've tried that were definitely a thumbs up:
cream puffs, soft serve, savory focaccia (for people that don't like dessert), cheesecake, carrot cake, devil's food cake, vanilla cake.
Honestly, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose to order.
My go-to drink here is the definitely the tropical jardin iced tea. It's super refreshing and also healthy because it's only sweetened by the dried fruit in the tea leaves!"

Ambience is modern with simple, but clean decorations. The items are displayed on marble counterparts behind a glass pane. Seating is decent with a few tables in the front, a long hallway with bar style seating, and more tables in the back.

All the items we tried were delicious and decadent. The Heavenly Cheesecake and the Devil in Ganache cake were both really special and rich. Overall, their cakes were better than the doughnut options, even though the Brioche Doughnut was exceptionally unique. 

I would certainly visit Mah Ze Dar again! Definitely check them out!"
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2019-09-25,5.0,"Their brioche donut is what I wish the famous ""cronut"" was. 

The brioche donut is the best doughnut I've had in the city. Immediately when you take a bite, you know it. 
While the cronut is usually hard and sickly sweet, the brioche dough is dense, fluffy, and somehow melts in your mouth. The vanilla custard is flecked with vanilla bean and the perfect texture and sweetness. And there is just enough sugar on the outside. 
The only thing that could make this better is if the donut hole was filled. My god that would be amazing.

The cream puff is outstanding. I can never get choux pastry right, so I respect the texture of this one. Filling once again is on point. The only criticism is that it is very small. 

Old fashioned donuts are always my favorite. I love the mouth feel and how you can pull it apart. This one is unlike any I've tried before, it has quite a unique flavor. The glaze is also quite thick.

Skip the trip to Dominque Ansel, Dough, or Daily Provisions; Mah Zeh Dahr has the best doughnut."

I don't even know why she was rushing me because there wasn't a line.. it was just me.

She ordered the Devil's Ganache cake with a passionfruit layer (only available for Valentine's Day weekend but she got it for LNY) for only $16 and said it was really rich. Wish they offered that one in slices!

I was surprised that I was able to get seated so easily and it turns out that even though it is a pretty busy bakery, there's enough seating that I would definitely consider studying here. There was also no line for baked goods when I came here on a weekend afternoon, so it looks like quite a hidden gem."

I gave them another try and as you can see in the picture I received an extremely small piece of cheesecake! Yes it was still tasty but not $8 tasty, it was about half the size of a plastic spoon! And the chocolate explosion cookie that I ordered was small also but more importantly just okay, and for $2.50 not worth it. I would have continuously ordered delivery if I hadn't had two bad experiences in a row:("
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-01-12,4.0,"Updated review based on the cheesecake, which was tangy, cloud-like, ephemeral, and delicious. There's a bit of extra lemon that made it distinctive. Very well executed."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-03-26,4.0,"We had the hot chocolate and the vegetable focaccia. Both were satisfying. I wouldn't say either tops my list for options in the area, but they were well executed. We would like to return to try some of the treats that the bakery is known for."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2020-01-02,5.0,"excellent service and really kind and great people too. the coffee is SO good. it may be the best coffee i've had in a while. I got the espresso with milk and the brioche doughnut, since a local told me that the doughnut was to die for. 
the pastry was quite tasty and it was filled with sweet cream. since discovering this place, i've been back almost every morning. It is definitely the best coffee shop and bakery i've been to in new york so far."
98,mah-ze-dahr-bakery-new-york,2018-08-30,5.0,"Finally tried their popular brioche donut and it did not disappoint. Take note that yes the donut is from brioche bread BUT it is covered in sugar granules. My point is if you like your desserts semi-sweet, then this is not for you (then again not sure what donut would be)! The bread itself is nothing special...now the vanilla bean (assuming it's vanilla bean due to the black specks in it) custard/cream? Wow. The only qualm about this donut is that it's not really a 50:50 ratio between the custard and the bread but A. I figure that wouldn't be the easiest thing to make in donut form and B. It's not an inadequate amount either. 

The staff is super friendly and notified me that they sell out of the brioche donuts at spontaneous times. This definitely makes sense as the first time I went (Friday, around 3 pm) they sold out and I had to ""settle"" for an old fashioned donut. I wouldn't say it's as good as the brioche donut but don't be mistaken, it's pretty solid as well. I will definitely come back for their soft swerve, cookies, and other goodies."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2020-01-04,5.0,"This is a cute little hidden spot in soho. Prices are great, especially for the variety of things they carry. 

I got a plain Darjeeling Earl Grey, $3 and my friend tried the vegan chocolate chip cookie which was actually edible and tasted nothing like Playdoh .

They have more interesting things on the menu (like the ""Nutella Latte"" which sounds like a dream) but we stopped here after having lunch. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to chat over coffee!"
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2020-03-06,3.0,"A small, hidden coffee shop, in the Bowery/East Village area. 

I had some time to kill before I checked out of my hotel, so I popped into Yours Truly to get some brew and answer some emails. 

While the coffee was decent, I wouldn't say this is a coffee shop I'd spend a lot of time in. It's a bit worn down, there's not a lot of space, and the free wi-fi is only good for 30 minutes. Hey, maybe they didn't design this space as a place to hang around in for a while, but I just didn't feel like it was a welcoming environment. 

The barista was also a bit rude when I asked for oat milk on the side and for the wifi password. Maybe this is a common thing for baristas to be standoffish and rude in New York, but this Canadian wasn't used to it. 

If I'm in the area next, I'll probably skip out on this spot and walk a few extra blocks to find some place a bit more inviting."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2020-02-04,2.0,"This coffee shop is really at great location, and I liked to stop by often to do some work and a coffe.
But....
There is a huge problem with stuff working there. Not everyone I guess. There is one guy, I always lately see him working as barista, kind of cold/rude .. almost like he is disgusted to talk or serve ppl.
If I asked for something he made me feel as I am unvelcomed or he is been bothered. I don't know if is the way he just talk or he is not really ppl person. 
Anyways, too bad because the place it's cute, could be little updated. The cups see through, the glass one, that they use to serve americano in- just weird. 
I think regular mugs are just fine if ppl want coffee to stay."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2020-05-14,2.0,"Cute place with no bathroom and the rudest person at the counter. She has perfected her scowl, one customer, a time."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-06-14,4.0,"Visited from CA with the wife and made our way to this quiet little shop one morning for coffee. We both ordered cold brews and the woman behind the counter had them ready in no time. 

We enjoyed the coffee. Not a ton more to say about this place other than it's small, quiet, wasn't busy when we went, offers pastries (although we didn't partake) and we were in and out quickly...place checked all the boxes for a solid coffee shop experience.

Fun fact: My wife talks even more when she drinks cold brew."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-07-07,5.0,"This is the cutest coffee shop with the loveliest baristas! I love stopping in here when I'm down in SoHo. It's very tiny but it's hardly ever crowded- which I LOVE. It feels like a hidden gem to me :) 

It has a lot of yummy coffee and espresso options. The lattes are delicious and the pastries and amazing as well. 

There's also a cute window seat where you can take in the scenery happening down in SoHo. You'll definitely enjoy Yours Truly!!"
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-05-01,4.0,"I came across this tiny little shop while dilly dallying about, looking for some coffee and a snack. Luckily, it was an off time so there was only one other person sitting in there. Seating is very limited inside...I'd say that probably only 5 could sit in there comfortably. It's probably a spot that people normally just grab-and-go. 

Walking in, the employee behind the counter was friendly in her greeting. They have the standard cafe options and some limited pastries. I got a small coffee and a small almond croissant - $7. Not too bad. I think the coffee they serve is Intelligentsia? Well, it was good. They have a little station with sugars, creamers, etc., trash/recycling bins, and a tray where you can put your dirty dishes/cups. 

It's a cute little shop and quiet when I went, so I was able to enjoy my coffee and read my book for a little bit. As I have a few more appointments in the neighborhood coming up, I will probably frequent this place more. Definitely recommend it for grab-and-go or visiting during non-peak hours. Enjoy! :)"
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-02-04,3.0,"A bit more expensive than other coffee shops in the area, but a solid product nonetheless.

It's a small space, so this probably isn't the kind of spot you'll want to bring a large group to. But with a small sitting area, it's totally possible to pop in and drink your coffee on premise if that's your thing. I imagine most of their customers grab and go, though.

There doesn't seem to be a credit card minimum which is always welcome."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2018-11-18,4.0,"New York City is known for its big businesses.  Whether it is Fifth Avenue shopping or Times Square's splash and pizzazz, New York City likes it BIG.  However, sometimes you just want to go to a tiny coffee shop tucked away in a building in downtown Manhattan, and ""Yours Truly"" fits that bill.  A large glass window store front has a cute logo painted on and draws the eye into the small shop with space for about eight to ten people or thereabouts.

I walked in and ordered a Chai Latte and a Vegan peanut butter cookie.  Service was quick and friendly (especially given that it was almost 7PM on a Friday).  When I brought my drink over to the fixings station to get a lid, I noticed an old fashioned coffee grinder mounted on the wall - and it worked!  There's even a cute sign calling the grinding a work out , which was very fun.  I love old touches like this and gave the crank a few turns and delighted as I watched ground coffee drop into the container attached to the bottom of the grinder.

The Latte was good, but I would have preferred it being spicier.  That said, it had a different flavor than most I have had and I enjoyed it.  The cookie was good, especially considering it is vegan and they are trying to replicate a very specific flavor.  It does not quite pack the ""punch"" of a real peanut butter cookie but it was a nice substitute.

I would definitely go back to Yours Truly if I were in the area.  It is a cute place that is well worth the visit."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-07-17,2.0,"Stopped in for an iced americano. The coffee was just ok. Barista was a bit cold/rude, seems the customers were somewhat of an inconvenience. Will not be back."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2020-01-02,5.0,Needed something to stir my post-holiday stupor. I ordered a Mr Fahrenheit because 1) what a great name and 2) it sounded like a spicy hot chocolate coffee. It was so good! I loved the little kick from the cayenne - it's a perfect winter drink. My friend really liked her Nutella latte too. Will definitely be back to try that!
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-04-05,4.0,This is a cute small cafe hidden around Soho. They had what I craved which was a nutella latte. It is on the pricier end but the nutella latte wasn't bad and my friends and I were able to grab a seat to chat for about an hour which is very nice (they never tried to tell us we had to leave. which is AWESOME.)
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-06-03,4.0,Good coffee. This spot is quaint with 3 tables and a window seat. The small selection of pastries looks fresh and good - but didn't try.
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-02-07,4.0,"Oat milk Nutella latte was perfect! Very limited seating, but there is free WiFi and a fabulous playlist."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-08-18,1.0,Absolutely terrible matcha latte. Just tasted like milk. Small and not much selection either.
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2018-11-02,4.0,"I come here for the almond croissants. Sometimes I get espresso along with it. The almond croissants are insanely good, either that or I'm just not a croissant connoisseur. But I think they are just insanely good and they run out fast.

The gals working there don't seem to recognize me even tho I would think I'm a regular croissant-er, which is kinna nice for some anonymity."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2018-12-22,4.0,I ordered Nutella Latte and a chocolate croissant. They're decent. I read good reviews about their croissants. The croissant I had was indeed really good but it'd be better if it was warmed up. They should invest in an oven.
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-06-02,3.0,"Cute shop, air conditioned, no line.  Coffee ok.  I have had better coffee in NYC. No more details to add."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2018-12-31,5.0,This is such a hidden gem! The service was amazing and the barista definitely knew how to make a delicious cortado. This is also the first place i been to that uses macadamia milk. Double points for that
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-07-10,5.0,"Love this spot.  Great coffee and pastries in this hidden gem.  

Mood Mender was originally a special and now is on the permanent menu item because it is so good.  

The staff here is always super nice as well.  I left my bag in here once and they held it for me."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-07-07,1.0,Poor coffee. I ordered a cappuccino and the end result looked like it could've come out of an automated hotel machine - really bubbly foam and scalding coffee.
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2017-07-07,5.0,"Tiny coffee shop that serves delicious iced coffee. Definitely on the stronger side, so I wouldn't recommend drinking it black unless you're like me and you're used to it. Flavor really packs a punch! Seating is pretty limited though. They do have this cute bench near the front window that's pretty picturesque. I'm sure many, many selfies have been taken there."

Four Stars


Another great coffee place offered on the Cups App. Get it and you could save $2 on a $4 Cold Brew. You use my code 25PN5 and we both get $10 free dollars that could be 5 free cups of coffee. 

This shop is small and quaint. It has a large window and window bench. There are 3 two-top tables and a high seated bench running along the white brick wall. 

The menu is simple. Coffee 2.5/3. Espresso 3. Espresso + Milk $4. Cold Brew 4. 

The cold brew came in a 16oz clear plastic cup. The ice came in large cylindrical pieces. The coffee was dark leather brown with no visible oil. It was lightly bitter with a full flavor and lingering mouth feel. The caffeine was moderate to high. Overall, a upbeat, bright, and I crowded place to relax or have a chat."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2018-09-24,3.0,"Went back and forth about writing this review because the coffee here is really good and I love the Dank banana bread.  The staff however is less than friendly.  I always say ""hi, how are you?"" and it is always met with practically disdain at having to interact beyond a coffee order.  This is pretty consistent and it's just disappointing because I work nearby and have been in many a time now.  At this point I'll walk the extra two blocks where the coffee is just as good and the staff are super friendly.

99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2016-08-31,5.0,"Intelligentsia coffee bean is being served here! Such a great discovery on my daily run into this neighborhood. With lots of bakeries and even some specialty drinks (can you skip Nutella latte? How about the Mr.sweet tooth?), I simply had a hard decision to make among all the goodies.

Chill vibe, loved this place a lot."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2018-11-14,5.0,This is small cute place on busy street. Coffees smell drive me crazy. Very friendly staff. Latin music and very delicious coffee. So many different kinds of coffee! I recommend this place.
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2018-09-26,5.0,"I don't know how I would survive without this coffee shop. I work the morning shift nearby and visit them five times a week (at least). The morning staff is awesome - Jess knows what I want before I do. (She also turned me on to the 'Mood Mender' -- highly recommend this delicious speciality tea drink, even though I'm die-hard coffee v tea.) I seriously look forward to seeing her every morning! Place is always clean, cute & friendly."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2019-03-25,4.0,"I came by to do some work but it's very small: 3 small tables and a little window nook. Barista nice enough - I don't drink coffee so I'm not here to judge that. I had a delicious croissant but it took a few mins bc they use a toaster oven, which was fine with me. They don't have butter, though."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2017-05-12,4.0,"AHH!
Okay, this place is awesome. They have awesome magazine selections and awesome coffee selections too. BUT!! WHY DO YOU ALWAYS MESS UP MY ORDER...........
okay I really want to give you guys 5 stars but it's like you guys are either not paying attention or what...
I went there one time with my co-worker after lunch. The NUTELLA LATTE WITH ALMOND MILK. That's all I've been ordering E.V.E.R.Y single time I go there. But apparently they tend to mess up my order except for the first time I went there....

First experience: AWESOME, HEAVENLY, it's so close to my office, Imma come here often, YES

Second experience: They used whole milk instead of almond milk, and the guy seem to be like a manger apologized cuz he made the coffee and it's okay because it's just a milk and I'm just a little bit of lactose intolerant but what ever, it's not gonna kill me.

Third experience: I patiently waited for my coffee that I tasted in my first experience, looking forward to start my day with very rich coffee with chocolate nutella...

guess what.... I sensed that the color looked a lot whiter than usual.....

and I had a zip... 

It was nutella latte... without shot..........

how.... can you guys do this to me......so sad... now I'm drinking $6 chocolate milk in my office..........

so disappointing :''(
it's because i know how good of a coffee they can make....

---------------------

I went back and told the person about the coffee with no shot and he gave me another one for freeeeeee

:D Awesome place haha"
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2015-09-06,3.0,"Really hot inside this place on a hot day.

Mostly hot coffees and teas. Iced coffee is .50 more and there was one iced tea option.

Cute decor, nice and relaxed atmosphere."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2016-04-18,4.0,"Came for coffee with my sister. This place is a nice nook to escape the busyness of the city. Atmosphere was very relaxed and chill, and the barista was very friendly.

After ordering our drinks, we stayed there for around three hours chatting without any complaints from staff. 

Coffee was average, nothing special to note. A small cup with milk cost me $2.50. 

Would recommend for a cozy and welcoming place to grab a drink."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2015-06-25,5.0,"I passed by this establishment a few times and never had the chance to go in. Finally visited this cute cafe with a friend today and although it was small, it was not crowded at all. 

I ordered a latte and asked for soy milk. Unfortunately, they only have almond milk. That's fine with me but just in case anyone specifically wants soy milk, they don't seem to have that option. Their coffee beans are from intelligentsia! 

My friend ordered a Mood Mender and loved it. My latte was very on point as well. The barista was nice and friendly. Will definitely return to yours truly when I'm in the neighborhood."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2015-06-25,5.0,"This place is small but comfy/homey feeling. My friend and I went when it wasn't busy and it was nice having the place to ourselves. It was a nice day today but the inside of the store has no circulation and it was getting super hot while it's almost 8-10 degrees cooler outside. 

They serve doughnuts from Dough here and have other snacks such as cookies. I personally do not drink coffee since it gets me jittery and a bad headache. I was pleased to see some tea options. The Mood Mender stood out to me because it had mint tea along with something else and honey almond milk. I had my first sip and the mint is really strong and refreshing! The honey almond milk add subtle touches to the drink. I love that this is a milk tea and finished it super quickly. I was tempted to get another but knew better ]:

The Son of Arnold Palmer also sounded super interesting if you're into ice tea with lemonade this will definitely be a hit. I forget but i'm pretty sure the difference is the type of tea that is used for this drink. I'm thinking it said it's a mint tea but don't hold me too it!

If you're going to get something here I highly suggest getting the CUPS app. This app let you buy drinks from cafes at a cheaper price and if you sign up your first cup is FREE!"
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2017-09-27,3.0,"The place smelled like coffee when I walked in - good start but a bad finish.

Happy staff!

Rebel Review: 3 stars."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2018-09-04,2.0,"Wasn't thrilled with anything about this cafe. The coffee was okay at best. I was looking for a good place to do sim e work and the space was empty for reasons that became obvious. The chairs and tables are at awkward heights, not good for working. The music was loud and the machines are as well. Better place if you're looking to just grab some quick coffee and go."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2015-10-15,5.0,"So...I literally just had the best tea I've ever had. I almost don't want to say that because it's too grand of a title but...yea. 

Amazing service, cute little spot and got the Blend 333 tea for $3 and was just so surprised at how simple and unique it was. I know, it's just tea. Anyhow, check it out!! + they take card/American Express which isn't always the case for small places."
99,yours-truly-new-york-4,2015-08-11,5.0,"Good coffee and DOUGH DOUGHNUTS!!! Yum! There were a few tables to sit at and it wasn't bust when I went (Wednesday at 2) 

Iced coffee was $4 and the doughnut was $3.5

They didn't have utensils for the dough though."

The cafe offered a variety of sweets, coffee and teas. Their nutella late was perfect for today's rainy weather, it wasn't too sweet and it was filled with flavor. My friend ordered an iced dirty chai and she mentioned that it was one of the better ones that she had (and she is a coffee addict)!"

Can't help but think that the reviewer who called someone a witch more than deserved the treatment she received. As far as employees not knowing about their coffee, once again, can't help but think that the reviewer wanted to know what mountain in Kenya the beans came from, or what time of the day they were harvested. Some people can ask the stupidest questions.
Every body there has always been very nice to me, but then, I was nice to them. Porto Rico team, keep up the good work, and stay well.

100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2019-03-15,5.0,"Porto Rico is actual more of coffee beans shop than a coffee shop. 

the store is small but well organized. you can order a variety of hot and cold coffee drinks (drip, cold brew, Americano, Latté, and many more) as well as teas at the register. all the coffee and tea condiments and add-ins are on a small ledge across from the cashier. there is no seating inside, but there is a tiny bench outside. the rest of the store is a sea of different coffee beans in burlap sacks. there are some small bites as well as candy, but the name of the game here is really coffee. 

I favor the drip and Americanos here. the prices are wallet friendly for the area. i don't ""coffee connoisseur"" here but the coffee is good, hot, and has the expected caffeine kick. me like. 

the staff? young. friendly and chill.

100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2019-08-02,4.0,Unique cozy little coffee shop. It has bags of coffee everywhere and the smell really overwhelms you when you get in.  It also has a cool vibe with them blasting fabolous. For those older folks Fabolous is a rapper. They don't have any seats inside but they do have a bench outside. Aside from coffee they also have some treats in here. They have some pastries but not a ton of them. It is a great place to grab a coffee on the go. The service is friendly and the vibe is right. What else do you want a coffee shop to be? Come check it out!
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2020-03-02,5.0,"I grabbed three pounds of beans and can't wait to try them. I've been coming here for years and was thrilled it's still around. It still has that cozy general store vibe and is owned by the same family for more than a century. Reasonable prices too. An East Village institution.
Update: I ground the Peters organic beans and they were delicious- smooth and fresh. I will make another trip when I run out of beans."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2020-01-19,4.0,"This place is so awesome! They have tons of open bags of coffee beans all over the shop so the moment you walk in the smell of freshly roasted beans is the only thing you smell! It's amazing. I got a latte to-go which was fjne but I would definitely recommend going here for fresh beans, that's their specialty! I can't wait to try some."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2019-04-16,4.0,"This place is amazing. I have never been to place like this. I appreciated the decaf choices. Usually there isn't that many. What I didn't appreciate is the barista didn't allow my husband to try the beans before purchase. But, with my friend another time they did. So, I guess they pick and choose they want to give service to."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2019-06-22,5.0,Travelled from Cali to reunite with this coffee. Be prepared to leave with lbs of awesome coffee! This coffee is strong but so good. So many different flavors and regions. Such a fan.

100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2019-09-12,5.0,"Probably my absolute favorite place to grab a cup of coffee. Affordable and THE BEST. Both hot or iced work for me. Iced stays strong too. Love all the servers in there plus they usually play great tunes.

It's a classic neighborhood spot. Any time I go and sit on that bench with my dog we meet tons of new and repeat people and other dogs. Just a friendly community staple. 

I even get my coffee beans from here. I've  tried a bunch of different types based on questions I've asked the staff, who are always helpful. 

Don't forget to try the rugellah! They were never my cookie of choice but now everytme I go there I have to get at least a few.. Usually at least 6...2 apricot, 2 choco, and 2 raspberry.


Ahhhh just writing about it makes me wanna sit out there with the locals and all our dogs right now."

I'm a frequent visitor of the Greenwich Village store and that one has a much better layout. Their cashier is in the front and their coffee bar is in the back, which means a ton of people aren't loitering around in the front either waiting for their coffee or waiting to pay.

So next time I'm there and the rather large, maybe Latina girl is about to wait on me I will pass her along to the person behind me.  Everyone else in that store is pleasant to deal with"
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2019-12-15,5.0,What a lovely store! I make the trip down to E Village just to get their beans. Great tasting coffee in many varieties and the line moves quickly to get your beans scooped and bagged by the friendly staff. Couldn't ask for more!
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2019-12-19,5.0,"Love the coffee here, very friend staff. This place is a landmark. Highly recommend for coffee lovers. Try the chocolate covered coffee beans."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2019-03-10,3.0,"Beans can be stale here since everything is in open air bags. Makes the store smell incredible, but that smell is flavor leaking out of the beans.  Some Kenya AA I got here had the flavour profile of wet cardboard.  Your best bet are the higher volume Colombians. Layout is always annoying-- there's just no room. Prices are reasonable, though. Love their Vietnamese style coffee."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2017-07-14,5.0,"On my mission to support local coffee shops instead of the big players, I came across Porto Rico Importing and it's been my favorite since! High quality coffee and tea for an extremely good price. Plus their loyalty card is the most generous one I've seen in NYC so far: Buy 5 beverages, get one for free. Very happy I found this place!"
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2016-01-19,5.0,"Fresh Coffee & Great Prices

The Porto Rico coffee company is exactly what you want from a coffee shop. The amazing smell of fresh coffee beans that you can smell and see before you purchase them.

When you walk into this tiny shop you will notice that it is packed with people but there are more than enough attentive staff to get you all your coffee needs.

I typical come here to pick up a few pounds of coffee and get a fresh cup of one of the four flavors they are brewing which cost less than $2. The pound of coffee changes by the kind you want and they have an awesome variety including organic coffee.

If you are looking for a great cup of coffee for a great price with an extremely friendly staff come here. 

In addition there is a bench outside to sip on your coffee.

In short:
-Great coffee
-Fair prices
-Friendly staff"
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2016-02-03,5.0,"I love and will always love Porto Rico coffee.  It's my go-to for all my coffee bean needs.  I usually go to the West Village/Greenwich Village location, but decided to try this one out since I was nearby.  If you think the Bleecker St location is cramped... try coming to this one!  There is barely enough space for a line to even form.  You basically have to go all the way to the back and make your way back out to the front where the registers are.  Luckily, I went in knowing what I wanted and left with a smooth experience.  Others who might not know what coffee Porto Rico offers might have some issues navigating through the line of people.

For me, my go-to is always the Indian Monsoon (sometimes known as Indian Malabar).  I like my coffees bold, but smooth.  This medium roast coffee does just that without being too bitter or too light.  Perfect with a dash of milk and a little sugar and only $10 for a whole pound!

If you know what you want, this location is great - get in and get out.  If you'd like to browse a little more and get to know your coffees, visit the Bleecker St location."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2018-09-01,5.0,"Porto Rico Importing is my go-to place for coffee beans. When you first step in you are cocooned in the most pleasant aroma of high-quality coffee. The selection of coffee is very large, it's all very good and cheap to reasonably priced. The people working here are coffee experts and really know their coffee. Their recommendations are always on point. Really, you can't go wrong here.

Top tip: Buy whole bean and get a grinder to keep your coffee fresher and tastier longer. You'll thank me every morning."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2019-02-28,5.0,"i am addicted to coffee now. i hope you're happy. 

also they have a 'buy 5 get 1 free' punch card so take that, starbucks"
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2015-12-26,5.0,"Even if you don't go in, just stand outside long enough and the wonderful aroma will bring you in.

The inside is a tiny place with magical coffee and extraordinary service. There is a display of all sorts of creamers in a case when you walk in. Prices were reasonable.

If you do not believe that coffee and tea can be intoxicating, then you have never been here. As if the air was not full enough of the smells, part of me wanted to just get handfuls of the coffee beans and just get my nose as close as I could to them. Wrong I know, but it was truly my thoughts. 

We did not leave with any coffee this time around, but this place is an amazing coffee lovers place that should not be missed if your in the city."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2019-01-29,4.0,Had really good coffee at the store.  Fascinating store with lots of coffee equipment and beans at really good prices.  I've had beans here that were quote good and would go back to try more beans.
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2018-07-26,5.0,"Best coffee spot in the area hands-down, would even say one of the best in NYC. Lots of variety, good deals on coffees and tea
Bring your own mug/thermos for a $1 fill
They have several types of milk to add to your coffee too
Great place"
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2017-05-08,5.0,Lot of variety. Coffee was high quality as per my fiancé. Workers inside were friendly.
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2018-04-22,5.0,An east village staple with fresh coffee any way you want it along with amazing deals on coffee grounds to bring home. They have almond and soy options a as well.
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2017-12-26,5.0,Porto Rico is the best and always smells so amazing inside. They have a huge selection of coffee beans as well as hot drinks. My current favorite is the danish blend but everything is good so you can't go wrong. The staff are very knowledgeable and can recommend something if you're overwhelmed. They also have punch cards so you can earn free coffee!
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2018-06-24,5.0,"I come here for their coconut flavor coffee. It's special and taste good. They do have blue berry flavor, it tastes like blue berry muffin~"
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2017-12-24,5.0,Amazing selection of coffee and imported coffee beans.  My new favorite coffee shop. Love supporting a local shop!  You can smell the aroma down the block. The staff here is incredibly friendly!! I'll definitely be a repeat customer
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2017-03-05,5.0,"I stumbled across this gem today while running around east village on a freezing cold day - and I'm so glad I did!

$2 for a JUMBO sized coffee. Yes, $2. Organic Mexican blend was the drip today and it was delicious - tart, light, but strong. 

ALSO - they offer almond milk as a milk or creamer substitute if you want it. and you don't have to ask, it's already out on the counter for you. very rare let alone for a $2 coffee spot. 

I don't own a coffee machine but for those that do - they have tons and tons of blends from different regions and the sales people seemed very knowledgeable.

Heads up - very small space so it's grab and go not a sit down work place."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2018-11-09,5.0,"I'm positively addicted! I love this place. If you are a coffee lover this is where you wanna be. I get a pound Vienna Brazilian (also called medium Brazilian) and without it I'm lost. The staff is very nice, which I'm sure is challenging because of how busy it gets. Also I've met people from other cities and countries that have to bring some back home through their travels. 
Ok I know it's just coffee. BUT ITS IMPORTANT!!!
(Also their pricing is really good)"
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2018-10-27,4.0,"This is the best place to grab fresh beans in the city. The only reason I have to leave a star off is that I've had my espresso machine serviced here several times, and while they do good work, the turnaround is always longer than the time quoted. Fortunately my machine is just for personal use.. but you know. Coffee is important."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2018-10-04,5.0,"Terrific coffee, and great service. I used to go here quite a bit when I lived in New York and always had wonderful experiences. I recently found out they deliver -- and am super glad they do!"
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2018-02-24,5.0,"This is the single best place in NYC to buy coffee -- if you're a coffee connoisseur like I am. There is a wide range of coffee, and the prices can't be beat. The service is outstanding. Sometimes there's a massive line. But if you go at night --
like I do -- after work, it's fine. You can buy a single cup, or like I do, 2 lbs at a time. I drink about 3 cups at home before work, and I need to be at work at 6:00 AM. So I have found the best ""eye opener"" that exists in NYC. Fortunately the location is near my home. However, it's worth the trip if you need to take the train there."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2018-10-03,5.0,Great place to get your fresh beans. Very wide selection and they import and do the roasting. The prices are very fair compared to many other places. Always a wide choice of beans even for me who drinks decaffeinated. In the back you can buy your coffee drinks at a price lower then anywhere else.
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2016-03-06,5.0,"As my wife and I are walking out of a brunch place unsatisfied with the quality of the coffee there, we spot this place at the corner of our eye. We walk in thinking t would just be a little hole in the wall coffee shop but it was so much more than that. They had so many different types of beans! You could pick what you want to drink and they grind on the spot! There is no where to sit here. Grab your cappuccino/coffee/etc and go. 

Pricing is excellent and they take credit cards! Excellent service too. This place is an absolute gem."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2017-03-27,5.0,"Great selection of coffee beans & tea. There's another bigger branch of this on the west side on 201 Bleecker, which I assume is the original. This one's definitely cozy, but still has a huge variety to choose from. 

I highly recommend the Auggie's & Cafe blend for coffee beans, and the Butterfly Sencha for tea, also been eyeing Moroccan Mint & Chamomile. I still have yet to try a lot of the other options, but it's hard because I love these ones so much. They pack them by increments of pounds, so half, 1lb, etc. If this is your first time buying beans I suggest going with a half pound and having them grind it for you if you don't already have a grinder at home (but honestly you should be grinding these right before you make your coffee). 

They have coffee and tea accessories and serve coffee to go, they feature a different blend everyday. I haven't tried their over the counter coffee, but I practically make my coffee from their beans everyday. Always a great cup, highly recommended for coffee enthusiasts."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2017-07-05,5.0,"Things one can find when not looking. Cute old school neighborhood shop. You can smell the coffee from a block up. Hot as you-know-what in there (it was a hot day to start with, and the coffee making inside probably didn't help), so I feel bad for the employees but they were super nice and helpful. I wasn't looking to buy anything, but saw that they have a good selection of tea and ended up with 2 tea selections as gifts. Moroccan Mint and another one, both were just over $3 for quarter pound, which was a good amount for tasting/sampling and fairly priced.

Definitely stop by and get yourself some coffee & tea (to drink on the go or beans/leaves to take home)."
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2015-11-07,5.0,"Awesome coffee 
Taste the French vanilla ;)
You can relax and sip your coffee on the bench outside 
Might be crowded on coffee pick hour ;)"
100,porto-rico-importing-co-new-york-3,2016-01-22,4.0,"My second visit here was better than the first because the staff was much more friendly. She was patient with my questions and gave me good recommendations.
Porto Rico Co has huge selection of coffee beans with great prices. My favorites so far are Organic Mexican and Sumatra. You can buy whole beans or let them grind for you. They also sell coffee drinks in store. Definitely worth a visit."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-05-11,5.0,"I discovered this welcoming place when my puppy got his shots and was finally allowed outside. I am so happy we walked by one day in May 2018! 

We have joined a group of amazing pets & pet guardians in the past 2 years. Our world has become so much better due to Boris & Horton. I have not only found furry friends for my little dude, but have also connected with vetted trainers, sitters/walkers, rescue organizations, pet friendly events & places to travel, treats/food, and so much more. 

The food is so good (Roasted Tomato Hummus on Sourdough!), and the coffee is even better (Large Iced Eloise please!). Their retail section displays small & local vendors (Maison de Paws treats!), and I buy almost everything for my pup there (Tiny Wolf sweaters are too cute!). 

The staff is beyond kind, approachable, and patient (sh*t literally happens!). We cannot wait to attend events in person again (so my pup can eat all the cake!), but we are so happy weekly Trivia is now hosted online. And the take out window is open daily now for my coffee kick & treats for my dude. 

Thank you Logan & Coppy for creating this oasis in the city!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-03-23,4.0,"Super cute dog cafe in the East Village. Stopped by to catch up with a friend over coffee on a Thursday afternoon. The staff were super friendly and attentive to both dogs and customers. The cafe is divided into a cafe side where you order and the dog side, but you can walk between both sides. 
Great cafe to do work (if you don't get easily distracted by the adorable dogs running around) or just hang out. 
I ordered their matcha special - a blueberry matcha - and wasn't very impressed by it, but will definitely come back for their coffee and the dogs!!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-03-11,5.0,"My dog LOVED our trip to Boris and Horton. He met other dogs, chilled with me while I worked, and we even took photos at the little photobooth/dress up station. 

The matcha was great! The avocado toast was alright - the lettuce was weird to include. 

My only con was that the wifi was slow. 


I will be back this weekend!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-02-23,5.0,"This place is the coolest! Dog owner or not, this cafe will welcome you. I came here during a Monday around 230pm and there was a good amount of people already. Most there had dogs (I was an exception!) but everyone is super friendly and lets you pet or play with their dog.

Dogs can be off leash while you work, (free WiFi!) and it seems like a super chill spot to work while enjoying the company of your fur baby :)"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-12-26,5.0,"This is my French bull dog's favorite alternative to the dog park during colder weather.

This place is fantastic. I discovered it a couple of months ago when I was walking my dog to the Tompkins square dog run. The staff is very nice and the food comes from well-known places like Balthazar. 

I now frequent this café on weekends and grab a coffee to bring back while I watch my dog play in the store-side. All dogs are off-leash and are able to run around freely playing with others. 

Toby, my dog, is even going to have his birthday party here! There's a spot with a photo booth, and ability to purchase food & drinks along with a cake. Our friends and their dogs are going to love it!

If it were not for Boris and Horton, I'd either have one grumpy cooped-up dog or a very cold one!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-02-24,5.0,I've been coming back here since I moved out from queens to the city. My pup still doesn't like their pawtisserie but he loves all the other treats and doggy Ice cream I get him. Great place to work with my pup here if it's not a holiday. If it's a holiday there is no where to sit.  The mushroom melt is to die for and the tomato soup pairs well with it. I always get these when i drop by around lunch time on mondays to do work. Unsweetened ice tea is good for any day.
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-11-11,4.0,"I was in the neighborhood with my friend and were looking for a place to grab a coffee. We stumbled upon Boris & Horton and what a great find! 

I got their matcha latte with oat milk. The matcha was a bit bitter, but I added a dash of brown sugar and it was perfect. 

My friend and I also shared the mushroom grilled cheese and the banana almond butter toast. The grilled cheese was delicious-- I would definitely recommend it! It was grilled to the perfect crunchiness, the cheese was fully melted, and the veggies added some flare. The toast was served on a thicker but soft bread; however it just tasted average. I added some cinnamon on mine to give it a bit more flavor.

The cafe itself is super cute. They have a seating section for dogs and a separate section (separated by two doors) for no pets. While we sat in the no pet section, I walked into the dog area to use the restroom and it looked fun! It's decorated cutely and the room just felt happy :) 

While I was only visiting NYC, this was a great neighborhood find!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-01-29,5.0,"Been a regular for a while now with my puppy (he's been going there since he was a wee bb), and consistently have received wonderful service from the staff and owners! Since I go often I've made it  a routine to first check their calendar prior to heading there, so I can expect what's going on. 

Things that sometimes are a bummer but no fault to the cafe: 
1) sometimes other dogs are aggressive to my puppy and other dogs. Most times owners will correct their dog. I think more people have to realize it is very much like an indoor dog park and same rules apply. 
2) double doors, not a very hard concept to understand, just read the sign before opening the door. It amazes me how so many people choose to ignore the signs outside and try to pry open 2 doors at the same time. 
3) weekends are super crowded and rowdy. Sometimes I can't get a seat which kinda sucks but we just come back another time. 


Separate: food items are hit or miss, I love their grilled cheeses and pastries. I've tried a few toasts however not my favorite at the price point offered. 

They have some wonderful events and activities, some are ticketed. Great way to enjoy something together with your dog or if you don't have a dog- someone else's dog. 

All in all we always have a great experience at Boris & Horton! Looking forward to more fun things to do there :) 

Lily & Woofles"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-03-31,2.0,"Super clever idea.  The rooms are divided, which is how they legally can have dogs in a restaurant, which I can only assume is normally illegal.  So, things are very separated and it just works.  What doesn't work is the food.  It's like people who have no restaurant experience are making sandwiches and toasts.  I've been here twice with my neighbors pug (which I walk sometimes) and might stop again for a cup of coffee, but i won't eat."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-01-27,4.0,"My dog has so much fun when she comes here! At first it can be overwhelming for both of us due to how crowded it can get on the weekend, but we adjust and have a good time.

I've had a few of their teas and snacks such as grilled cheese and haven't been disappointed. My dog enjoys some of the treats which is nice as she is very picky. The food they offer for dogs is kinda overpriced for what it is but they've gotta make rent, ya know?

Employees are pretty attentive to ensure dogs are not engaging in naughty behavior. I also feel like the customers here are generally responsible enough to know their dog is good with other dogs and occasionally children. It's nice that I've never seen a dog fight break out here."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-08-14,5.0,"You probably heard of this place if you own a  dog (or love dogs). One door (to your left) leads to where you order your drink or food, the other (on the right) is where you can enjoy your drink/food and have your dog hang out. I've been here a couple of times and each time I've been here, it's been a pleasurable experience. They also have adoption events and pop-up events as well! I have no complaints about the staff. In fact, all of the staff members are top notch! During one of the pop-up events that they held, my dog just kept marking on the side of the walls (despite having to wipe it every time) and a staff was nice enough to provide a disposable belly band for him.

I've only tried the drinks over here and enjoyed them so far. From iced matcha lattes to cold brews, and a bark & stormy (cold brew, ginger syrup, and lemonade), I'm sure something will quench your thirst. Plus, they have treats that your dogs may enjoy too!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-04-25,5.0,"As far as I know, the only spot in the city where you can eat with your pet indoors. Two separate entrances for the cafe/kitchen and the seating area where you can be with your dog. Easily got a table on a Friday night and quickly went in to order some food/drinks.

Despite getting in an hour before close, the kitchen was already done for the night. Instead, settled on a beer ($7) and a bag of chips ($3). Took the items to the separate eating/seating area where dogs are allowed to roam leashlessly. While there, also got to shop around the ""pet store"" portion of the establishment, where they sell treats, toys, and other pet nick knacks.  

Definitely a cool place to hang around other dogs and even take pics with the free photo booth. Although I wish this spot stayed open later, glad it exists for the option to bring your pet indoors."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-11-10,4.0,"Adorable little trendy coffee shop where you can bring your furry friends. You can enjoy your morning Joe and your dog can meet K9 friends. I enjoyed a cafe latte skim milk and cinnamon, just the right amount of caffeine to start my morning. My beautiful daughter ordered a  Cold Oak Milk Latte, very interesting taste.  We split a  warm buttery delicious croissant. Great concept and friendly atmosphere. They also sell treats for your doggy."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-05-11,5.0,"The happiest place on NYC!!! Everything about this place makes my heart full: the puppies (all dogs are puppies), the staff, the coffee, the wine, the snax, the cute decor! If you haven't visited it is a must!! They have fun events too! Follow their IG for more info"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-09-29,4.0,"Boris and Horton is a lovely place to spend the afternoon indoors with friendly dogs. While the food was not impressive (extremely sour avocado toast with hard toast for $11), the lassie (lavender drink) wasn't bad. This is a safe space to let your dog roam freely and the cafe has a two door system to prevent dogs from escaping. Just note that you order your food on the side with dogs, but go to the other entrance to pick up your food when it's ready. Unfortunately, dogs are not allowed in the area you pick up food. Also note that other dogs may jump on you, eye your food, or even salivate by your feet. However, people who come here generally really love dogs and do not mind. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience, just not the food."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-05-11,5.0,"By far my favorite place in NYC. I moved to the city last year and I lived for the afternoons where I could sit here and enjoy coffee and a book. The dog part itself is so much cleaner than I thought it would be, they are amazing about cleaning up. The decor is adorable and the photo booth is so cute! The only thing I wish is that it were bigger! The food and drinks are amazing. I honestly couldn't love this place any more!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"My wife, my puppy and I absolutely love this place! 

The ambiance is welcoming, staff is friendly, coffee (Tumeric late) is great, pastries and food has integrity and flavor, and most patrons are warm and welcoming... 

We discovered this place accidentally and have made it a regular spot whenever we are in town. They have a great merch section, treats for dogs, and even a photo booth with costumes! On one visit they even had a comedy show in the evening and it was a blast!

Sprinkles (see below) even celebrated his birthday at the cafe and tried some peanut butter bacon ice cream!

I hear they also offer adoptions... What a great place... 

We highly recommend it..."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-11-10,5.0,"Excellent coffee, adorable aesthetic, and most of all dog-friendly. 

My dog (a toy poodle, classic lap dog) was loving the humans, cranky with puppies, and indifferent to the rest. And that was ok. Dogs can be dogs there: bark, jump, play, sleep. It feels like home in a sense. And it's very clean."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-09-30,5.0,"Absolute gem of a cafe! With details like double doors that only open one at a time to ensure the safety of all their canine patrons to a dog friendly photo booth and delicious offerings for hoomans and pups what's not to love? 

I just wish San Francisco had a place (or two) like Boris and Horton! *hint hint, nudge nudge*"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-03-08,5.0,The happiest place on earth. I am a college student and miss my dog so much. I go here to study and  see all the cute puppies. This place genuinly helps my mental health. Good coffee. Good snacks. Great dogs!
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-08-01,5.0,"What more can I say? A place where we can walk in and play with dogs for free?! This is dog heaven! We don't even have our own dogs but the people here are kind enough to let us play with their dogs. Plus the dogs enjoy being pet too! Granted people should buy something when coming here, but you can always just get some ""puppy ice cream"" for $4/cup and give it to one of the dogs! 

Also, some general rules: there is a rule for not bringing in laptops on weekends. If you just want the cafe vibe, there is a separate area for more concentrated studying. However, the play area with dogs also has tables and chairs, so if you want to relax and read a book or use your laptop on weekends, feel free to do so! A warning though, sometimes the dogs will jump on the tables and chairs!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-01-29,5.0,"My dog Beau loves coming to this place more than anything else in the world. It's the perfect place to socialize your pup. Just about every single dog in here is cute and clean and well behaved. If there is even the slightest doubt that a dog is not well behaved, one of the employees will make sure that everything gets nipped in the bud, in a gentle way. The café is a very calming and therapeutic environment for both the dogs as well as their owners. I love the grilled cheese sandwiches. Plenty of treats and cool clothing available for the dogs as well here. I've been a regular here and I'll come back many more times in the future. Thank God for places like this. As a matter of fact I think this is the only dog café in New York City. People travel like 45 minutes just to have the dog in a fun and safe surrounding for a little bit. Highly recommend!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-08-20,5.0,"This cafe is an absolute GEM. The cafe is broken up into two parts (for health code regulations I'm sure). You enter in the traditional cafe area, and get your drink and/or food. They have a great variety of coffee offerings (including a super intriguing lavender latte). I went for an iced green tea, and I was splendidly surprised at the great quality tea they have. Then I got to head back into the dog area of the cafe. This is PRIME for sitting and enjoying a coffee and people/dog watching. Big dogs, small dogs, puppies and old doggos galore. Good drinks, good dogs-there is absolutely no downside. :)"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2018-11-18,5.0,"Cutest cafe with lots of space for our 4 legged friends to run around!

Staff is amazing and they interact so well with the people and the pups - very inviting and with a huge smile! And the cafe offers a small selection of eats for the people and animals, as well as coffee, tea, beer, and wine items for the people. (There are two sections split off from one another - one is purely for humans, and the other is a mix of both. You can order at either station, but the food/drink pick up is at the human side only. Dogs are not allowed here - I am assuming for sanitary reasons.)

This was a great find by my friend who's a dog owner. I may not own any dogs of my own, but I love watching dogs and playing with them. And this was the perfect place to do that. The dogs ran around freely. And I feel like dog people are people with big hearts, so it's a very trusting and friendly environment by the staff and customers alike.

I'll be back for sure!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,"Pleaseeeee open one of these on the west side somewhere!!! I LOVE this cafe. It feels like a dog park where you can relax and enjoy cafe drinks/food. They have fun events all the time, so recommend following the calendar. My dog gets spoiled with ice cream or treats every time as well! If this was closer to me, we'd go every weekend."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-12-06,5.0,"This place is incredibly welcoming and such a fun treat especially for the cold weather! No entry fee-- and you don't HAVE to have a dog to enjoy the relaxing setting, and some playful companions to meet! All the dogs I've seen there so far in my visits have been very well mannered, and are the type to socialize well. However, like my dog, some are a bit hesitant and will just enjoy your own company. All the dog owners I've met so far definitely understand boundaries, and definitely understand the rules of the land: keep close eye on your companion and be mindful of others. 
Other than that food is good! It's to be expected from any café but it's your usual drinks, pastries, and brunchy items. Even some food for your furry friend! 
Stopping by for a little bit will never hurt!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2018-10-06,5.0,"One of the coolest concepts in NYC!  It's the first FDA approved dog-friendly coffee establishment in NYC.  

They have a window on the outside, if you have your pup with you, you can order your coffee, grab a dog treat and head around the corner to the dog entrance, similar to a free dog daycare but you are there with your pup the whole time.  They have a doggy photo booth, dog treats, leashes, collars, bags, hats, t-shirts, dog tags, dog toys, and all sorts of other accessories.  They also have trivia on certain nights where you can win freebies (they have all sorts of cool events they have throughout the week - so look them up), and will close the dog area for private events if you want to throw your pup a bday party.

They also have another entrance - we'll call that the area where if you don't like dogs you can go into.

I stop in here every time I'm in the city because its a feel good kind of place.  Every dog owner is responsible and respectful and it actually opens more people up to talking when they have their furry friend around.  The owners of this place are exceptionally nice people, and are always around.  If you love dogs as much as I do, then you'll be doing yourself a favor by bringing your pooch down here where big dogs and small dogs can connect.

Cheers & Enjoy!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2018-12-02,5.0,"I had been meaning to check this place out since I heard of its opening and it did not disappoint.  It is wonderful to have a space that actually encourages you to bring your dog along.  The owners of the place, father and daughter, made sure to work out with the health department to meet all the standards required to make this place possible. 

The large open area they recently expanded into provides tons of space for curious and playful dogs to explore and play with other dogs and humans alike as they roam around off leash.  There is a photobooth as well to dress your pup in and capture evidence of your fun time there.

In the separate space where you can purchase food and beverages there are desserts, coffee, wine, and sandwiches.  And there grilled cheese sandwiches are fabulously cheesy, the kind when you pull put a slice of it the cheese just stretches for like a foot between the two halves!

The spaces, both dog and cafe areas, are clean and smell perfectly fresh, and delectable even when it comes to the food and drinks.

They also host trivia nights here and other events.

This place is a truly a gem and I look forward to coming back here with my dog who really enjoyed herself while here!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-07-03,5.0,"I love this cafe because not only do I get to bring my pup but everyone especially the owner is very friendly. This is my second time here and I don't mind traveling all the way from uptown because the ambiance is chill and lively all at the same time thanks to all the dogs that make this one of the happiest places in NYC. 

There's a food side and a dog side and you can order on both sides as they will call your name no matter which side you're on. There's a free photo booth for taking pics of your pup in costume and lovely artwork on the walls for sale as well. There isn't much in the way of purchases for your pup with the exception of a few treats and novelty toys but the point is to have a nice drink/snack and relax or get some work done using the free WiFi while your dog socializes or snoozes."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2018-09-18,5.0,"We had such a happy Saturday here with our boy Gerbert. All you do is drink cappuccinos and watch your dog go absolutely nuts, playing freely with a bunch of other dogs in a cleaner, nicer dog park. 

The photo shoot, led by photographer Rachel, was incredible. Her and her team's dedication and professionalism to getting the photos of your dog is amazing, especially since it is FREE and there is no guarantee you'll buy the photos after. Of course, after looking at them all, I think I will :D

There's even a photo booth for you and your dog! And it moves! Like a gif! That's another batch of photos you get later on, like a nice little post-holiday present that arrives in your inbox.

Get the avocado toast and a coffee and delight in how happy you and your dog are at this gorgeous dog cafe. 

5 Stars!!!!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-11-23,5.0,This place is wonderful!!! You can bring your dog and order food or dog treats from the cafe. Staff is fantastic!
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-02-29,5.0,Dog friendly cafe! Get your coffee and food in the cafe section then bring it over to the dog side.
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-02-17,5.0,"An ABSOLUTE GEM! :'^) I could go on and on about this place but I recommend doing yourself a favor and just going there to experience it yourself, because each visit will be different, but all, of a high level of amazing (that is, assuming there are dogs each time you visit) 

Instead, I'll briefly go into the food. I always get their coffee when I go to visit the dogs and that itself is a great time, but one time I got their banana bread with labneh and honey and oh honey, oh honey, just when I thought this experience couldn't get any better, it did -- an amazing pastry in one hand and dogs galore in the other. 

Also, I saw Steven Lim here working once which was also pretty neat. 

Food: 7.5/10
Place: 10/10
Price: 6/10"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-02-08,4.0,"we came on a weekend and this place was PACKED.
there were so many dogs, a little chaotic.
there was not a lot of space for us to sit and eat our food.
regardless, obviously the cafe is more for dogs than for humans, so the chaos is understandable.
i loved the free Photo Booth!!
my dog definitely loved it here as he got to meet so many dogs.
there are some unruly dogs so even though its off leash, please pay attention to your dog !"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-01-12,2.0,"I've been coming here with my dog for a while now but today I saw something pretty concerning.  The empty table next to me had big chunks of chocolate muffin spread all over the table from the last customer (chunks, not just crumbs). One of the employees came to wipe up the table but instead of picking up the CHOCOLATE muffin pieces, she brushed ALL of it onto the floor with her rag....where there are dozens of dogs running around.  

I told her that it's chocolate and she said something along the lines of ""Oh we don't serve anything that's toxic to dogs and there is very little chocolate in those"". How do you know where that chocolate muffin came from? How do you know that chocolate muffin wasn't something a customer brought from outside? And chocolate or not, why do you brush the leftover food onto the floor? Because you're too lazy to clean it up and the dogs will eat it anyways? What if one of the dogs had an allergy? Mind you, this wasn't the first time I saw her brushing food onto the floor. The first time it wasn't chocolate so I didn't say anything, just kept an eye on my dog so he doesn't eat it.

The employee didn't really seem to give a crap even though I said ""It's chocolate"" and ""the dogs might eat it"" and still left the chocolate muffin pieces on the floor, so I immediately got up and took my dog home. He ain't getting poisoned today."
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-01-06,1.0,"I honestly really wanted to like this place. Came with my little pup. I tried ordering on the dog side, but there were no workers there at noon time. Weird. Then, one came in and she just kept walking around and saying hi to the dogs and ignored the fact that I was waiting there ready to order. I had to flag her down and ask if I could order on this side, but she was like ""oh...yeah. You can order right here"" pointing to where I was waiting for over 5 minutes. You then pick up your coffee on the other side. The barista didn't even call names for the drinks and it was busy so I was just waiting there until I checked the receipt attached to the coffee that was sitting there. Coffee was eh and food was overpriced. Half the dogs were well behaved and the other half needed their owners to keep them in check. Just because you're at a dog cafe, doesn't mean the dogs should be allowed to jump on strangers and try to rummage through our bags. Not cool.

But real talk. Go to Third Rail for better coffee, real customer service, & dog friendly vibes"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-01-24,5.0,"This place is amazing. It's the best dog friendly place I've been to in Manhattan. They have a great system for keeping up to health code - you can easily order and go get your food from another part of the coffee shop. Owners keep an eye on your off leash dogs and even clean up messes. It's a delight. 

Moral of this review - bring your dog, duh"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-02-25,5.0,"One of my favorite spots. Love the coffee, the dogs (even if you don't have one), and the sense of community. Cant wait to go again this Sunday!"
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2020-02-23,5.0,Cutest cafe in NYC! Awesome for dog lovers and people who just need some animal loving. Don't come here if you aren't okay with dogs jumping on you/ on your lap. This place is as much for you as the pups!!
101,boris-and-horton-new-york,2019-06-16,4.0,"I love taking my dog here to this spot when I discovered they opened a year or so ago. During that period they made some great renovations and changes to create better flow and space for dogs and people to enjoy.

I've bought many dog items them from their shop as well that are unique and fun such as bandanas, poop bag holders and treats! 

The staff has always been very courteous and kind with everyone. 

The only feedback I have is staff have also been really pre occupied by the one door at a time section. I've been politely reminded once one door at a time as I did forget! Also other customers or new customers don't know or forget as well which makes the scene even more chaotic. 

At some point, it was chaotic and one of the girls said I could go through first to exit the store. I went through and on the other side of the door was an angry, agitated customer who immediately reprimanded me for opening both doors which I didn't? 

After trying to really sort out the stress I felt from that incident, the store may need to figure out a better way to have one door open at a time, such as a technology or mechanism where when 1 door is opened, the other door automatically locks until the first door shuts. This may help reduce some tension among customers and staff when it comes to that particular entry/exit area. 

Either way, I still would go here. I love how friendly the dogs are, staff are polite, kind and courteous. To me, the grilled cheese is my favorite as well as the Eloise and the Matcha lemonade all iced!"
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2020-03-11,4.0,"It smells good in here. Because it smells like coffee. It's cute in here. Because there are plants. Snake plant and cacti and hanging plants and a giant monstera to be specific. It's cozy in here. Because the bar stools are comfy and there's a vinyl collection, art, and overall chill vibe. 

Little Canal has been here for four years and although I've frequented their neighbor Jajaja next door, I only noticed it today. And I'm glad. Because it made for a cozy, chill, stop-in with Other half selections on the menu on the way to meet a friend."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2020-02-28,5.0,"Full disclosure, I've never sat in or ordered food at Little Canal; I've only had their coffee, and their coffee is amazing. AH. MAY. ZING. I know that in the city, where there are quality coffee shops seemingly on every block, you might wonder just how good Little Canal could be, but I'm telling you, it's really good. Go there just for their COLD BREW, regardless of the weather; it's so dark yet clean tasting, you get all of the chocolatey notes but without any of the harshness. As someone who does slow pours at home and has made his own cold brews, I give a ton of props to Little Canal for the quality of their coffee (they brew Madcap, which is a roaster from Detroit), as well as the quality of the finished product.

Again, I know nothing about their food or eat-in experience, but their coffee is amazing."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-12-19,5.0,"Just moved to the area and although there are many cafe's to choose from, this one is my favorite to stop into.

Everyone that works there has always been super friendly, I love that it feels like a ""neighborhood"" spot, and great job to the staff considering that it's consistently busy and they've managed to keep the cozy vibe going strong.

The cold brew is tasty and buzzy without being too anxiety inducing, and  I've only ever tried the hangover wrap (delicious and accurate for it's described purpose) but I look forward to trying one of their salads soon cause when I spot them on other people's tables I get food envy.

Lastly and equally important (maybe this is just me), they have the cutest coffee stamp card in the city. There I said it."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-09-02,4.0,"Stopped in here to kill some time while waiting for a table at Jajaja next door. Prices are a bit high but the cold brew that I had was excellent, and there's plenty of seating. 

Would return to try some of the food, the wraps looked good!"
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-12-14,5.0,"Daytime: cafe. Nighttime: chillest, coziest bar you could want. Come for the vibes, stay for the vibes and also the drink prices that won't break the bank. 

I came here on a weeknight around 7 and the tables pretty steadily turned over while I was there so you don't have to wait too long for a seat.

Highly recommend this spot for a date, intimate setting for a couple friends, and drinks before dinner, or drinks before your next round of drinks elsewhere. Love, love, love."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-11-04,4.0,"I always end up in here after I go to the Metrograph and don't want to spend $17 on a Spritz at their Commissary. Little Canal has a similarly chill and hip atmosphere but with less pretense-it's really more of a cafe and it's fine that way. By night this is mainly a wine bar, though they have a nice selection of beers and they even have a bootleg Spritz (re: not Aperol and therefore merely a lower-case ""spritzer."" I'm sure somebody somewhere will tut-tut me on the ancient usage and makeup of Cappelletti but I'll give it to you straight: flavor-wise it's a bootleg Aperol but with a more bubble-gum-ish and more bitter quality that tastes more complex and less refined in comparison to the perfection that is Aperol imo) that's a little funky but drinkable. Wine starts at around the $10 - $12 range, and the pours are generous, and the servers always nice. Get your unlimited water from a self-pour jug in the corner.

I don't know, mostly this is just a quiet and chill place to hang. I've never seen it super crowded because it's small enough it discourages huge crowds. So while the prices aren't the lowest, it's really just the perfect wine-for-one or two-person hang joint that hits the step-above-a-dive and step-below-a-hipster-wine-bar spot. Personally, I prefer that middle ground. 

Also somebody below said this place has no bathrooms? There is definitely a bathroom -- another bonus for such a small place."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2020-05-09,5.0,"My favorite coffee shop! Staff are friendly and nice. I really like the coffee beans they use here, very fresh and nice. My favorite drinks are the latte and cortado. Brought my friend here last time and she absolutely loved it. They also have a wide selection of syrups and milk selections. They also have bakery items like croissants and also menu food items for a quick brunch. Although the line is sometimes long especially in the morning, it moves pretty fast and you get what you pay for. They also have a stamp card, so after around 10 drinks you can qualify for a free drink!"
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-09-01,4.0,"What a pleasant surprise! We walked by this place in east Broadway Chinatown. Very friendly service, and amazing cold brew coffee. I found most cold brew coffee can be very strong since I drank my coffee black. Little Canal's cold brew coffee is perfect drinking it black. It gave you a thick flavorful coffee taste but not too strong. If you are in the area, give it a try. I will definitely come back."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-05-26,3.0,"This canal is certainly not a copy nor a small replica of the renowned Grand Canal, Jing-Hang Grand Canal 大運河.  My favorite canal is (always will be) the Grand Canal of China 大運河 for its beauty and extensive long history dating back to Sui Dynasty (581-618).  It is beautiful runs through small ancient villages and the longest functioning artificial river in the world.  (source: https://www.britannica.com/place/China/Waterways#ref589628)

A coffee shop that sits on the peripheral areas of Chinatown Manhattan.  There are pastries, coffee, tea and beer and wine only.  Following a delightful Sunday brunch I need something extra as a glass of Prosecco $9 finished my day.  Seating is limited which means no facilities on site.  No pet policy is noted visibily in signage.  Business card also act as a loyalty program card is available for grabs.  Customer service is attentive and the ordering line moves moderately.  The clientele appears very sketchy and brusque, brazen and takes pleasure bullying Asian woman who patronize alone.  Are you a freak like me who frequently dine alone? I was approached by a vulgar Lo Fan who take pleasure with joking comments ""that's my table!"" while his party were exiting.  Another Lo Fan patron sitting with his female friend blurted out ""he was being a asshole!"" Indeed, egregiously vulgar dude with no respect."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-03-18,5.0,"Barbie has a massive gushing Amazon river, whereas I just have a Little Canal. And I like Little C-anal, but Big D-anal is easily my fave.

As far as this place goes, it's my new favourite bar in Manhattan because I popped in here and ask to use the bathroom and she was really nice about it.

It was so urgent and I totally exploded and then I cleaned myself up (TMIII) and cleaned the bathroom thoroughly (oops) and then I came out and gave her a dollar and she didn't want to take it but I insisted because nobody else in the damn entire portion of the island was going to let customers or myself use their bathroom. Bravo. Also lots of cute people in here.

So next time I came to town, this is where I chose to bring a friend to grab a drink between eats and Boba! See, when you're lovely to me, I am lovely back.

It's expensive but friendly, would get 4 stars, but because of the bathroom incident, it's 5."

102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-02-10,5.0,"For a late night beer or a wine, this is the place to be!  While not able to accommodate a lot of people, I think it's cozy atmosphere is one of its most endearing qualities.  We enjoyed the music (from a turntable, how awesome!), a locally brewed beer, and a house wine.  

We had had a busy day of playing tourist and this was the perfect place to unwind and talk about our day.  As we were there on Jan 2nd or 3rd we had the place almost to ourselves with only a few tables occupied.  I can't speak for the food items but the people who did order certainly didn't send any food back on their plates!

I would have liked to have eaten breakfast there as they had an excellent selection of coffees and breakfast items.  Oh well, hopefully next time!  

I highly recommend Little Canal, we really enjoyed ourselves and thank the team for their hospitality!

The space is bright and airy with large windows that look out onto the street. There are a few bar stools as well as about 6 tables that can fit about 2-3 people each. They have coffee, tea, pastries, breakfast bowls/bagels and sandwiches to choose from. I would definitely recommend coming here if in the area and looking for a place to grab some coffee or a quick lunch."

The interior is small, cozy and intimate.  The person that help me was not.  He wasn't very friendly or personable.  Ordered an iced oat latte ($6.00).  The drink was good (nothing to rave or go out of my way to).  If you're looking to catch up with a friend, I think this would be a great place to go to (if there is room)."

The food is cooked really well, it's nothing that is so exotic or special but it's breakfast food made well. What more would you ask for? I got the Hangover Wrap and it was a great hearty breakfast that kept me full for only $7/$8. Great prices here, really great coffee, sweet employees who work here - overall a great spot. Definitely would recommend, I didn't get a pastry here this time, but the girl next to me did and I've made a mental note that next time I come here I'm getting one of their baked goods. Literally looked so mouthwatering!"
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2018-11-29,3.0,This is place is so cute and refreshing. It is a vegetarian cafe which I was not aware of until I read the menu. I still proceeded to eat breakfast here because it was open and close to the buses. I ordered the egg sandwich which was way too spicy for me. It was inedible. The egg however was fluffy and I like the size of the sandwich for it to be $8. Good vibes here but I probably won't be back. -@agirlsgottaeatt

While waiting for our lunch spot to open, I needed caffeine to wake up just a bit...  I yelped, found Little Canal, saw some lovely cafe art, so here we are... 

Barista/Cashier - took our orders, ""Americano"" - probably the easiest thing to make... and somehow managed to eff'ed it up majorly.  I'm not a coffee snob.  But I love coffee.  And what we got... was NOT in any way actual drinkable coffee.  Americano is supposed to be dark & rich... this version took a long ""water-bath"" and stayed in the tub.  Yes... it was so watered down, I seriously questioned if I accidentally took someone else's decaf?!?! 

Trying to salvage a too watered down coffee is like trying to get your ""permed curls"" to go straight.  Impossible. 

IDK... maybe an off day? Maybe the food is better than their coffee?  Whatever the reason may be... if you want to stay a boutique coffee place, serve up coffee that won't disappoint.  $3 Americano - fancy tap water more like. 

Happy Java Hunting Yelpers!

102,little-canal-new-york-2,2017-10-03,4.0,"While Little Canal serves as my #2 coffee shop purely because of proximity to my apartment, there's no denying this is one of the best places for coffee, pastries, savory snacks, and even a wine or beer anywhere in the lower Lower East Side. 

A small shop, but they pack a punch. With paninis, doughnuts, craft beer and wine options, and all the coffee drinks you could hope for, it's what every neighborhood should have as a community gathering place.

They seem to open 30-60 minutes earlier than other coffee shops in the area, so I find that to be particularly convenient when I have an early morning before hopping on the F train right outside."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2018-09-25,4.0,"This use to be my spot! I miss it. I lived on Ludlow just around the corner. The people who work here are the friendliest-- I am not a morning person and they always brightened my day. The coffee here is fairly priced and very good. Also their cheddar scallion scones are great. 

The space they have is small but super homey and welcoming. It stays fairly quiet for this reason as well.

At night they do a great happy hour. It was one of my favorite date spots because of the small quaint atmosphere and ability to have a real conversation. Great spot for people watching as well."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2020-02-20,4.0,"I've passed Little Canal many times and always wanted to enter, and today I finally did. Great atmosphere, service, music and menu - felt I was back in Paris."

I really wanted to love this place if only for the convenience (i practically live in the area) but $5 for a meh cold brew is really just...meh. The drip coffee's also meh, the service is meh, the prices dont justify, and while the space is definitely modern and trendy, there's normally no space to kick back and rest because the hipsters love to pack in spots like this. Won't be frequenting."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2020-02-13,5.0,"Great baristas. Cool vibe. Warm friendly service. But the best part is the quality of the food that comes out of the tiny almost invisible kitchen. The breakfast sandwiches are generous and...somehow special because somebody back in the little kitchen actually cares. Same goes for the breakfast plate...can't remember everything that was in it, just that it was great. Like the name suggests, the place is tiny but that contributes to the charm and friendly vibe. These people care about their customers and are trying to make them happy. What's cooler than that?"

This is a wonderful spot for morning coffee but the cappuccino needs a bit more work. They are beautiful but lack the kick. The pastry in the front looks delicious and too pretty to even consume. I skip that but settle with a cup of heart shape cappuccino. Price is $3.75.

102,little-canal-new-york-2,2017-04-26,4.0,"Cute spot for coffee and pastries if you're ever in the area. This cafe is less than 10 minutes away from my apartment, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop. In general, the coffees and lattes are pretty good but nothing stands out. 

The last time I came here with my boyfriend, we ordered off of their food menu. We both ordered sandwiches - I decided to go with a classic egg sandwich, while my boyfriend ordered the prosciutto, cheese and ham sandwich. I've never  had jam on a prosciutto sandwich, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The salty prosciutto actually paired nicely with the sweet jam. The next time I visit, I'll probably ordered the prosciutto sandwich - I'd definitely say it's worth trying."

We walked in and were amazed to discover that this cute corner cafe not only had coffee beverages, but also served beer, wine, and light bites.  We grabbed seats at the quiet bar, happy to find a place to talk in peace.  While my companion had the Cabernet Franc, I selected the Gruner Vetliner, which was fabulous!  It was crisp and bright with a slight fruity finish.  Their food menu sounded enjoyable, but I would have to try that another time.  

If you were in the area and wanted a relaxed place to grab a drink, caffeinated or alcoholic, Little Canal would be the perfect stop."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2018-10-18,5.0,"What a cute little place! The location is cool and the space is really nice. They do a great job of fitting people into a smaller space, and the bartender was super accommodating (and friendly!) with our large group. The service was quick and friendly and I was so happy with their cider selection; they had one of my favorite ciders, Downeast. I would love to come back for coffee and breakfast during the day!"
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-03-22,4.0,"Friendly staff , great coffee (we took cappuccino , americano and espresso ) perfect start for the day"
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2018-09-15,5.0,"Young and hip is an exclusive experience. You must be in the know or have your head stuck in the window to know that this is a coffee shop called Little Canal in the Lower Eastside of Manhattan. Interestingly, there is no business signage. Walked in at noon on Sunday and the place was filled.
.
The service attendant was quick and quite charming. Tried their mocha  coffee with almond croissant  freshly delivered from Balthazar (amazing French restaurant and bakery). I should note that their bagel, which I did not try is from Kossar's Bialys. Both Balthazar and Kossar's are considered New York institutions. The cost was $8.50 with tip. The almond croissants was the perfect combination of flaky, soft and just enough sweetness from a gooey almond paste in the center. unfortunately, the mocha coffee was really weak, watered down and bland.
.
While enjoying this Sunday treat I was watching a cute dog tied up to the post. The set up is kind of tight as it was a full house, the ambiance chill  music was perfect background volume. I spied a turntable with vinyl records on a shelf. The decor is tasteful minimal in style with white subway tiles and hanging diner lights. I'd say  check it out. Fun and intriguing!"
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-07-01,5.0,"Great chai and so close to my apartment. The location is great, right by the subway and next to my favorite vegan Mexican place. I wasn't expecting a lot when I came here, but their chai has the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. They also serve food here which I didn't realize! I plan to try their sandwich menu next time."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-01-25,1.0,"So you can't use your laptop....on the tables and also not on counters; only just by the window. I'm at a coffee shop and want to sip my coffee and WORK. Stupid hipster joint and your dumbass ""rules."" Miss my olden days LES..."
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-06-07,5.0,"Bless this place for being a cafe in the mroning AND a bar in the evening.  Which means not only can you have a cortado with your kouign amann or avocado toast in the morning, but you can also have a beer AND a cookie in the evening!"
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2018-12-21,5.0,Great little coffee shop in Chinatown. Great customer service. Will be back for sure!
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2018-06-24,1.0,"I ordered a regular latte without ice, and I got a half cut of latte? Only half.....and I paid full price. It's ridiculous!"
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2017-10-01,4.0,This is one of my favorite local cafes in the area. The people are nice and the coffee is delicious. My favorite drinks are the latte and the mocha. The lattes are so rich and smooth and the mocha is never too sweet. The atmosphere is great. The cafe is small but they have large windows that allows for great natural sunlight. I see people studying there all the time and one day I may just join them with a lovely book in my hand.
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2019-09-24,1.0,I got charged $8 for a croissant and iced coffee. I think that was a bit pricey so I won't be coming back.
102,little-canal-new-york-2,2017-07-12,3.0,"I thought of this is a really cute place on the corner of Canal Street. It has many many different varieties of Beverages and including alcohol. The staff was very accommodating and the seats are very comfortable if you like sitting on wooden chairs and stools. Overall I think it's a very cute place and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's interested to stop by for a cup of joe before it happened on the MTA. 

I I like the pictures of the cappuccino and I tried it for myself The Taste is a little too bitter for me but if you like cappuccino to be better than this is a cup for you.

The reason I gave this place three stars was because the seating was a little tight and the chairs were missing cushions."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-23,4.0,"Spacious, lots of seating, reasonable prices. The medium latte I had was good, I have yet to have any of their food, and am intrigued by the new Spanish latte. Shall return, possibly to a different location to change it up."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-10,3.0,"A spacious cafe with tons of seating options! It is a bit louder here because there's so many people, but it often isnt too difficult to find seating. The day I went, there was a private event around 6PM so it definitely got super loud then. 

Their cold brew was a bit too weak for my taste, but their americano was dark and strong (I love my black coffee bitter and dark). Overall, good place to sit and get work done!"
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-28,4.0,"All I had was an espresso but they had a lot of pastry/food selections especially considering this is a tiny space.  My barista was very friendly and helpful.  

I know this is a very ""small sample size"" but I got a really good feeling about this place."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-12,4.0,"Although I tried to live healthily by minimizing caffeine and sugar in my diet, there are mornings I just can't function properly without those two substances!!
 I decided to go to Think Coffee this morning to grab a cup of coffee for my long day. As usual, I have an almond latte (I think it has become a benchmark drink for me) and an almond croissant (just because why not). I intended to take away but Think Coffee's coziness lured me to stay for a while. The coffee was one of the best I've had. The coffee was strong and smelled great;the almond milk foam was extremely creamy. However, the almond croissant could be better. I liked the taste but not the texture. It was served cold and was too dense for my liking. I wish it were more airy and flaky.
I think Think Coffee is a great study spot. The ambiance is very tranquil as people mainly go here alone for work. The drinks are not cheap but if you factor in the hours you stay to work then it becomes reasonable. I guess I'll study here instead of in NYU's crowded study spots from now on."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-07,4.0,"Love their philanthropic efforts and really appreciate the amount of vegan/gluten-free options. However, the coffee takes a long time due to long lines. It's understandable with how crowded the place is but it's definitely not somewhere I'd go if I'm in a rush. At first, I thought it was because I ordered a dirty chai with almond milk which has more components than your typical drink but even an iced coffee (no milk/sugar/etc) has taken a bit of time to come out. I was also disappointed that both times I ordered a muffin they didn't warm it up or even offer to.

All that said, I really enjoyed my drinks and the muffins! I've had the blueberry muffin and the pumpkin cranberry muffin (both gf/v) and they were great. Not overly dry or grainy like many gluten-free muffins are. I've ordered the oatmeal before as well and it was a great warm breakfast on a rainy morning.

Am I going to go out of my way to come to Think Coffee? No. If I'm in the area and need a lunch to-go? I'll definitely consider it."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-10,3.0,"Pros:
Strong coffee
Cheap prices
Pastries, sandwiches, and one soup available
Lots of seating 
Strong WiFi
Fast barista

Cons:
Always so busy 
Mostly NYU students
Too few outlets
Watery tomato soup (but love the chicken in it)
Impatient service"
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-18,4.0,"Honestly, I only came in here for a few minutes to grab some coffee on the way to meet with a friend, so I can't speak very comprehensively as to the overall experience. Here goes nothing though...

Food [4/5] - By food, I mean coffee of course. The cold brew was satisfying, especially on such a hot day.

Service [4/5] - The cashier was nice, and my coffee was out within a few minutes.

Ambiance [5/5] - This place has a great vibe, and definitely beats out the Starbucks's and Pret's. Solid place to study it seems like.

Value [4/5] - Pretty average price for the coffee, though the cup was big enough to satisfy and caffeinate me to the right level."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-10,1.0,Their wifi doesn't work and they don't do anything about it. Attitude is unacceptable. But they don't warn you before purchase.
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-11,4.0,I've been wanting to try Think Coffee and I finally decided to check it out last weekend. We ordered a Spanish Latte and a hot chocolate because it is starting to get chilly outside. This location is huge with lots of seating. It is perfect if you are with a group or if you are solo and need to get work done. The customer service is on point! I also liked chalkboard signs in the coffee shop. The Spanish Latte and Hot Chocolate was delicious but not the best. I would definitely visit Think Coffee again!
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-17,3.0,Normally a good spot but you're out of luck if the internet isn't working. Staff can't / refuses to even reset the router
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-10,4.0,"This cafe is close to NYU so it's pretty packed. They have lots out outlets, wifi, 2 bathrooms, and it's close to the R. While there is much seating, it's not really available since the cafe is usually packed. People tend to stay here and study for a while so I'd recommend coming early or late. The person who took my order was kind of rude, but the rest of the staff was nice. The lighting is really dim and yellow here and they play loud music. I'd only come back here really early or late."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-18,4.0,One of the more cozy Think COffee locations.  This one is on Mercer Street.  The coffee is great - good luck finding a place to sit to drink it!  The barista on the day I went was nice and worked fast.  I'll be back for sure.
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-07,3.0,Hot chocolate came out kinda cold and drinks are average. But solid study spot if you can find seat lol. Staff and music selection is only reason gave 3 stars otherwise it would be a stretch for 2.
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-03-13,3.0,"Pros: 

- Amazing amount of seating
- Natural light in front seating area 
- Good wifi
- Nice service

I ordered an oat chai latte and was not a huge fan. I watched the barista make my drink and it appears their chai is a generic concentrate that they buy. It's a very spicy chai and a bit sweet, but I was not a fan and would not order again. 

I would come back to try out their coffees if I needed a place to sit with friends."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-25,5.0,I love coffee and I love the aesthetic and quality Think Coffee has! I've gone to several locations​ and they have all been amazing and I​ don't doubt that every other location is great too! (: This coffee is perfect for an in and out trip or a lengthy homework visit!
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-01,4.0,"A good place to study given the spacious area with plenty of tables and seats.

Only problem is when I was there at least none of the outlets were working so make sure to come with fully charged electronics if you're planning to do work here for awhile.

I got their coffee which was decent.

Overall, decent coffee and good study vibes."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-01,5.0,"Tasty coffee and pleasant staff.

The pastries looked fantastic.

They have beer on tap and a big ""dining"" room."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-17,4.0,"Decent place with plenty of tables to lounge, albeit being busy and loud inside. 

I opted for a hot chocolate which was made relatively quickly. It wasn't amazing and didn't have a decadent, rich chocolate flavor I was hoping for, but it did the job."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-14,2.0,"Asked for a Cappuccino and I was given a mini latte. Any barista knows not to use the same milk that they just used. Milk has to be cold to foam up correctly. Waste of money. Should've ordered a latte, at least i would've gotten my moneys worth."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2017-09-22,2.0,"Think coffee has a decent amount of seating, although it does fill up quickly. I went here on a Sunday afternoon and got the Spanish Latte ($4.25). It was good coffee, but nothing special, and definitely not worth its price. 

They do have wifi, but I was disappointed with how slow it was. They seem to filter social media sites (making them load slower than usual) but they also weren't able to support the site that I listen to my class lectures on. It's utterly frustrating when you buy a tiny, over-priced coffee, and then can't even stay at the cafe and be productive. They have tons of students and young professionals who come here to get work done, so this was just absurd."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-07,5.0,"Delicious, fast, friendly! Lots of options and tasty treats! Smallish space. Clean, good standing room when waiting for drink. 

I got a Spanish latte which was delightful!"
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-23,3.0,"I am a bit over Think Coffee, at least this location (On Mercer). The coffee is entirely o.k. It is slow and in the mornings some of the baristas are a bit grumpy. Others are very nice, however. I do think the idea of supporting unexploited growers, but I just wish the standard blends were just a little more flavorful."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2017-06-12,2.0,"Think coffee could be great if it weren't so dirty. In my visit, there was trash on the floor, a used empty glass on the table for several hours, and the floor outlets were clogged with rust and dust and unusable. And the bathroom is another story on its own. Gross.

The good: it's very spacious, probably one of the largest in the neighborhood. 
They offer beer and wine in addition to the usual coffee and pastries."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-18,3.0,"Awesome place to get work done, but the baked goods are super stale and very pricey. The place is slammed with nyu undergrads, but I think the super friendly staff, huge seating area, and chill vibe will make me come back"
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-03,4.0,"This is one of my go-to coffee spots in the city. I've liked pretty much any drink I've ever tried here: cold brew, lattes, and green tea lattes are all classics that get the job done.
There is a lot of seating here, and while some people camp out, you normally don't have to wait more than a few minutes for someone to get up. All of their cups are compostable or recyclable which is really lovely. This place is definitely a little more expensive than Dunks or Starbucks, but the drinks here are stronger and their mission is pretty lovely."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-16,5.0,"Love their iced matcha lattes and everything bagel. Matcha latte isn't too bitter or too sweet. The everything bagel has flavor throughout the dough. Compared to just flavoring on top. Feels extremely homie. Love the board games and the art designed menu. Super quick, even on a busy morning."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-03,2.0,"Decent coffee & snacks, but everything here is slightly overpriced. I'm no coffee expert, so perhaps I have little appreciation for different coffee flavors. However, after trying coffee here a handful of times, and realizing the coffee is smaller & pricier than other coffee spots, I have gone back to Starbucks. Even the bagels here are pricier than actual bagel shops (i.e. Brooklyn Bagel down the block), which makes no sense to me. I've stayed away since"
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2017-03-26,5.0,"This is one of the few places around NYU where you can rest your laptop on a table in a cafe and work or meet with people- that alone merits 5 stars- but it gets even better from there.  

Sustainably minded packaging and socially minded coffee sourcing.  True cold Brew.  Locally made pastries and the best yeasty bagels only to be consumed by those who are not gluten sensitive, with thick cream cheese, Nutella, peanut butter, jelly, or butter.  

After 11am they start serving soups, grilled cheese, and other sandwiches.  After 1pm, the wine bar and beer fridge open up.  So, in one day, you could experience three different offerings only available at those times of day.  

If you arrive before 10am, you get best choice or spots.  If you arrive after 1pm expect to hone your table stalking skills or get the courage to ask about sharing a larger spot."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2017-01-05,3.0,"Service - Not great. The woman who took my order was rude.

Ambience - Very homey and cozy, with the hustle and bustle of New York City.

Interior - Rustic.

Latte - Unsweetened normally but I put some raw sugar and cinnamon in it and it was delicious. I can't tell if it was the espresso itself that was good or the add-ins that are naturally good. 

*Note: The bathroom is absolutely disgusting and so small. It reeks like a subway bathroom. There isn't a hook to hang your coat or purse either."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-31,3.0,"The coffee is pretty good, and it has *a lot* of space! Great for getting some work done or hanging out and catching up with friends. The only reason I'm giving it a low review is because  the staff wasn't very friendly and came off a bit rude."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2016-10-29,3.0,"Think Coffee is located conveniently close to NYU's main ""campus,"" which made it a supposedly good spot to get some coffee and work done while waiting for my sister to get out of class. After ordering a latte in the long mid-morning line, I hustled into a small corner table (which also housed a much needed outlet) right behind the coffee counter. It was a little crowded, especially when some guy decided to move his seat, computer, coffee and Calvin Klein briefs right in front of me. Yikes. 

Wifi was TERRIBLE. I had the worst time keeping a strong connection. Don't think you can use too much bandwidth here, so do what you can offline - I eventually used my phone as a hotspot so I could send some important work emails. 

Even so, I took my time sipping my latte in the busy and crowded coffee shop. There were a few pastry offerings available, as well as some other food options, so I picked up a chocolate croissant to accompany my latte. While it wasn't bad, I wish they could have heated it up - it just didn't seem to taste super fresh at room temp (slightly cold). 

Think Coffee is one of those places where I can grab a drink and snack to go, but not a recommended study spot, in my opinion, unless you're trying to avoid internet streaming. If I wanted a place with mediocre wifi and abundant wall outlets, I would have just gone to Starbucks (which is actually where I ended up after this). The only redeeming qualities are the solid espresso and somewhat chill atmosphere. But that's all you need in a coffee shop, really. Just don't advertise wifi if it's not dependable."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2017-12-03,4.0,"I come here at least twice a week to got some coffee! 

On mercer street right next to the NYU campus so it's always busy. 

This place is always full so I won't count on it as a good studying spot, but it does have free wifi and it is good for studying if you do find a spot. Generally the space is pretty big and there are managed tables

The pastries are okay but the donuts are good. 
Sandwiches are also okay but I've had better ones

The coffee is good. I also enjoy the almond milk matcha latte they've been offering lately. Teas are also good. - drink wise its good

The service is not really that fast but its not too slow, but you won't get coffee in a rush. 

Clean restrooms"
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-01,4.0,"Unrelated to the rest of my review: Get the COCONUT DOUGHNUT. So freaking good.

Anyway, this is a 3-star review with respect to Think Coffee as a study spot. If you're just looking for coffee or ambiance or other things, idk what to tell you--I don't know anything about good coffee and you really shouldn't be coming this close to NYU for good ambiance.

This particular location is pretty spacious and has ample seating while maintaining a hip charm to it. My only quip is that it's a tad dark in the back so if you want to fast-track your way to eye-strain city then perch on one of the tables or couches in the back. Otherwise, get here a bit early to snag a seat in the front or hover."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-02-06,4.0,"It is very crowded and while there are a lot of seats, it seems like a great place for some people to camp out all day.

I like to judge coffee places by the basics, so I got a Cappuccino, in a real china cup, medium made with three shots of espresso. It did the trick, very good and worth every penny."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-28,2.0,"Coffee's kind of expensive, as are the donuts from Dō. Main pain point for me was the fact that the people behind the counter were louder than all the clientele put together. Dropping things, screaming with laughter, what have you. Come on, some of us are trying to get work done."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-15,3.0,It's alright ordered a chai tea latte and it wasn't sweet enough... and the price could've been better
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2018-08-23,4.0,"Good location and atmosphere for meeting others. Open space and diversified seating arrangement as well. Too bad I do not drink coffee and can only comment on their lemonade. I thought lemonade and orange juice were a bit pricey for not being freshly made, but nonetheless refreshing. Lemonade was a bit on the sour end, but employees were accommodating and added ice to help with the cooling and a little lift to taste :)."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-17,3.0,"Pretty spacious coffee spot. They didn't have anything I wanted to eat, but it's good as a place to study and fill up on coffee. Lots of seating like Darya said! They do have a decent selection of pastries if you're into that. There are places with better coffee and food, but if you want the space and you're nearby, come here. It's in a very convenient location, especially for NYU students."
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2017-07-05,3.0,"My friend recommended we meet up at this coffee spot since we'd both be near Washington Square Park this weekend. I got there a few minutes before she did and after checking it out I'd say I'm a fan!

The place was spacious and open, with lots of available seating and natural light coming into the front part of the store. In the back there were tons of table to sit at, which is where we ended up enjoying our coffee and conversation.

The only negative part about this place was how dirty some table were and especially the bathroom too! If I could give staff once piece of advice it would be to at least have one person periodically clean the common spaces. It would've made this review 5 stars!"
103,think-coffee-new-york-2,2017-06-25,4.0,"Great coffee shop to study at. They have a front area where the cashier and barista are located at along with a couple of seats but they also have a back section with many tables and chairs. My friend and I arrived at around 12:30 and had no trouble finding a table but when we left at around 4:30 the place was packed and our seats got taken the minute we got up. The drinks here are pretty good as well. I got a large Spanish latte for $5.50 and it did not taste watered down at all. Music wasn't too loud but not exactly ideal if you're looking for a quiet study place since people are having conversations as well. Bathrooms were not dirty. Overall, nice place to hang out/study with friends and located in a very trendy area right across from NYU."
104,t2-new-york,2019-12-01,5.0,"I love visiting the T2 store every time I'm in NYC!  This store is 100% WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE, which is such a welcome change from many other small-ish NYC stores!  The employees are always very pleasant and helpful, usually can answer questions about teas, and are always happy to move anything that might be in the way of a wheelchair.

Their teas are nice...but honestly?  I'm mostly here for the beautiful, interesting, unique teawares!!  They have their own line, and then sell designs by other companies, such as Bonnie & Neil.  This is an Australian company, and they don't necessarily sell all the items on their website in this particular store, but they DO also feature extra-fancy teawares in their store that can't be found on their website.  For example, I once saw a Lomonosov teapot in this store, and nearly drowned in a puddle of my own drool!!

The prices are reasonable and definitely in line with other tea purveyors, especially in the US.  I definitely recommend checking out this shop next time you're in the area!"
104,t2-new-york,2019-12-16,2.0,"I have been to this store a multitude of times in the last few months, and wile I love the products I have always experienced the same dismissive and insulting service. 
On my first visit I was exited to take my time and find a few gems, so I was in the store for about twenty/ thirty minutes. 
Once I was on line to pay, the woman in front of me (white woman) was offered gift wrapping on a cup she was getting. 
So when I was  paying for a cup set and matching tea box I was surprised that I had to ask the merchant about gift wrapping. 
I didn't take it personally at the time. 
The second time I was buying a gift for a friend of mine, so I curated a beautiful collection of teas, cup and saucer and tea steeping basket. 
Again I had to ask for gift wrapping. 
I was starting to notice a trend, but nothing would clue me into my last most disappointing experience. 
This time I purchased nine gift sets and not only was I not offered gift wrapping, but the cashier packed everything into one bag, so the bag was bursting open. 
He was holding the bag as you would a large bucket of water. 
So I asked him if he could gift wrap the items, and if he could separate it into two bags, as he started to wrap the first gift set I noticed the price tag that he was leaving on the package. 
By now I'm over it, I asked if in stead of wrapping them, if he could just give the wrapping paper and I would wrap them myself. 
He looks over to another cashier who is wrapping for another person and she tells him to ""just give her that paper over there"" nudging her head to a bucket of dull papers on the floor. 
He started filling my second bag with rolls of brown and beige wrapping paper. 
I had to ask him two more times for the colorful wrapping paper EVERYONE ELS WAS GETTING. 
The thing is, I love this brand, and I shouldn't have to stop what I love because of the people that work in this store."
104,t2-new-york,2019-02-15,5.0,"I decided to come in here because I love teas and I love colors! This store has both! What a wonderful trip I made. Of course I bought some teas to take home with me! I think I could live here if they let me. Now that's scary!

So far I have tried many types. I bought the mixed teas in one box and another box of Japanese Secha because one of the employees recommended that. They have great employees by the way. I know the taste of Japanese Sencha but I wanted from T2! Amazing choice! I love this store. The display is perfect. They include cute colorful teapots right in the middle of the store, colorful boxes on shelves on the wall, demo stand on the other side. Yes they make teas for you to try them. If you like some you may buy them.

All in all, this is one of the best stores to consider. I'm going back to get myself more!"
104,t2-new-york,2019-01-24,5.0,"I love tea so this store is so beautiful for me! I always step in to try out some of the samples and check out what's on sale as they have great promotions. Most recently, I got a matte teacup and saucer set for $9.60 (60% off) and a banana black loose leaf tea box for $6.90 (50% off).

I also have their French Earl grey which is is one of my favorite flavors of theirs as well as the Rose Green Tea.

They have plenty of samples to try in the store and I'm pretty indecisive so last time I was in, they brewed a variety of small samples just for me to help me decide which I greatly appreciated. They also gave me a sample of Rose Black tea and Rose Green tea to try at home.

I will definitely be back soon!"
104,t2-new-york,2020-03-09,4.0,"Went to checkout some teas. Plus for having some out, I like to try the quality and I really liked one of them. Staff was right there and answered any question I had. Ended up buying the green rose tea and a nice mug with infuser for my wife. The tea sets are VERY nice looking, but in the pricey side. The bug alone was $32, mist expensive one I bought so far haha. After trying the tea it's also very good. Unfortunately, they didn't have the tea I wanted in the smaller container and didn't mention if they would get more any time soon and after looking some mire it was part of a sampling set that the sales associate failed to mention, so I figured I won't buy it. 

Overall a really good place to check out."
104,t2-new-york,2017-07-17,4.0,"Cute boutique tea studio in SoHo.
I love the idea of the square tea boxes arranged in rows like library books 
The staff is friendly and went out of their way to find a ginger tea for us.
I have to say though as a life long tea drinker from child hood that the place has a museum/boutique like quality 

You will find a large variety of herbal blends and loose leaf varieties that are unusual combinations of herbs and teas. 

The place is pricey though and it certainly has a modern take on the ancient blend which to me is both a strength and a weakness when hit looking for the simple original varieties. Small space, packs in a large volume of blends 

On a hot summer day you can have a cool tea to go as well."
104,t2-new-york,2016-10-19,3.0,"I shift between Hot Cocoa and Chai Latte before heading to work: And, unless you have a restaurant-grade Chai Latte machine at home (or work) which I don't- to deliver frothy results, it simply won't work. 

Paul hooked me up with a cold Matcha mix sample drink that was subtle in taste before I went shopping around. He was also kind enough to tell me all about their loose leaf and bagged teas. Tea Cups were all beautiful- but a pink one, was so cute, I had to get it. Wall to wall tea boxes make up one side of the T2 shop and Tea accessories all around. 

I thought their concept was ok- really nothing out of this world. But it was a bigger pill to swallow when even the most basic 'Vanilla' & 'Chai' flavors aren't offered as a 'blend' tea bag and must be purchased separately (if you want). The most exciting part of my experience was their individually wrapped teas in delicate mesh bags with bits and chunks of spices. Though I don't agree with their prices, it was worth a try."
104,t2-new-york,2018-10-31,5.0,"My favorite tea place. Selection of teas range from green teas (my favorite), breakfast teas, and a lot others. They're all loose leaf with some in teabags, but I love that they have sample tin boxes for you to smell. They also have a lot of niche items like adorable strainers that come with a Russian doll keychain. I also really love their teapots which reminds me of stained glass patterns. It's right off the Prince Street R/W line so it's convenient if you're coming from there. Workers are friendly and they often have sales. Last week, teapots were 40% off!"

Ask for any of them they will hook you up on the BEST deal and the newest stuff !!!! 
They hooked us up on 2 fabulous teapots with peacocks, and wrapped them up for us so they wouldn't break while walking Nolita, the teas were there for you to try, I know if you buy something or if it's your birthday you get a cup of tea Togo for free !!!! 
Soooooo Good take it !!!!"
104,t2-new-york,2017-06-06,5.0,"Instead of bookcase with rows of books in a library, there lies a collection of tea bountiful variety! It rhymes!  Riddle me not!

I was entertained with the boxed, colorful selections on the shelves!

One of the staff members approached me and I asked for recommendations of lavender and along the lines of fragrant grace!  She recommended Red, Green, Dreamy since I mentioned Roobios is my favorite tea type. Picked that up.

Smelled New York Breakfast and was enchanted with the name.  I asked for a taster and was pleasantly surprised with a slight twist on a mix of cinnamon, vanilla and honey.  Adored it and wouldn't mind waking up to the sunshine and energy of New York bliss!  Well named.  Unicorn!

The same girl who helped me also checked in again and mentioned the French Earl Grey, which was fused with multi-flower petals like rose, sunflower and mallow. Not only is this floral and aromatic, it is also beautifully blended with Bergamot and other fruity notes.

I love tea that is specifically chosen based on one's whimsical preference!  

T2 was worth walking to, from central downtown.  Noted and marked in my book of favorites on tea stops!"
104,t2-new-york,2017-12-24,5.0,"This place is amazing. Amazing loose tea, amazing tea sets, but most importantly amazing service. They're having a great sale currently ($40 originally for the two set tea pack for only $10 now)! I stumbled upon this place yesterday and felt obliged to step in- it's so cute! When I saw the sale and came home, my sister wanted to buy more sets so we called the next morning and they were really accommodating and even told us about more flavors on sale as well! The manager also offered to gift wrap them and when we came to pick them up I was pleasantly surprised. They wrapped them so well in lovely gift paper, added string with a name tag, and labeled each box with which dual tea pack it was. Definitely will visit again- they go above and beyond!"
104,t2-new-york,2018-07-10,5.0,"I love this boutique tea shop! It has walls of loose leaf teas, and a beautiful display of various tea sets you can buy. They have a good collection of samples for you to try. I tried most of the samples, and liked everything I tried. Even the fruity teas (and I'm not a huge fruity tea fan). The place smells divine! The staff here is excellent. They were very good about explaining their teas and wares. I would love a chance to come back!"
104,t2-new-york,2016-10-14,4.0,"If you love tea, you're probably very healthy. And this is the place for you! Such a cool Australian-based company that sells alllllll the tea and none of the shade.

They have great unique flavors and standard favorites like black, green, lemon etc. I really like white and red teas, and they have them all. These teas are sold loose but they're soooo easy to make.

This is a great place to get a unique hostess or thank you gift."
104,t2-new-york,2015-01-03,4.0,"Fancy, colorful tea store with lots of options, fun designs, and plenty of teas to try. There are teas lined up to the ceiling, making you feel like you're in a candy shop.

I do find the space a little cramped, especially with a lot of people inside and ogling the teas.

Head to the back for some very pretty teapots and teacups."
104,t2-new-york,2018-03-27,3.0,"I purchased a Matcha flask and was told I would get a free matcha fillip whenever I bring in the flask. I made a trip down to Soho today only to be told the offer is good only on Fridays. Okay. I was not told that crucial information.  I understand sometimes there is communication issues. It would have been nice to get at least an apology for not informing me the specifics of the offer.  

I love my flask and the matcha I purchased as well as the free matcha offer (even though it's only on Fridays).  Wish there was more effort put into clear communication with the customer. So they get three stars instead of five."
104,t2-new-york,2016-04-23,5.0,"I really could not believe my eyes when I stepped inside and saw a huge wall of tea selections. Yes, that was how amazing T2 was! My friend was looking for some rose fruity teas so they introduced us three different kinds, each with very detailed explanations. If you were not quite sure about the flavors, they did provide tea samples at the front so that you could take a sip, ice or hot.

It was a bit pricey though, if you are buying tea sets or complements, but they ARE pretty and make girls go nuts!

I would recommend the Green Rose or Black Rose tea. The Arctic Ice is also good, and Vanilla Mint is a very soothing evening herbal tea. 
You can expect to spend about $30 on two teas. 
P.S don't forget to check out their cute collection of tea pots and tea cups!"
104,t2-new-york,2017-09-22,5.0,I sometimes go to this shop because I love tea. There are many tea leaves there. And there are many cute tea cup sets. It's my recommended tea store.
104,t2-new-york,2016-03-27,5.0,"I love this store!!

We were wandering around SoHo and came upon this adorable tea shop. They offered plenty of samples of their extremely delicious tea. We especially enjoyed their chocolate based teas. Green Tea with chocolate was absolutely decadent!!

The staff is super friendly and extremely accommodating. They also have a lot of tea accessories."
104,t2-new-york,2016-10-02,5.0,"Really cute little store in the heart of SoHo with the widest selection of teas around. They have whites, blacks, greens, and probably a 100 variations/flavors of each of them. The entire wall of the store is lined with boxes of tea and there are about 4-5 samples of brewed tea in the front of the store. You can purchase loose leaf, tea bags, or any related accessories lined up near the back of the store. The latter of which includes tea pots, strainers, cups, and china. 

The staff is excellent and there to help you with any questions related to brewing. Make sure to ask them for samples of any of the teas that aren't already brewed up front!! I tried apricot and it had some of the most real fruit flavors/aromas I've experienced!"
104,t2-new-york,2018-07-27,1.0,The manager at this store is an idiot. Multiple times going into this store and the service is bad or slow or both.
104,t2-new-york,2016-01-19,5.0,"Cutest tea place everrrr!!! I got T2 teas as Christmas gift last year (last month) and i haven't had time to try them yet. However a friend needed tea gifts so I suggested T2 and went with her. We tried a couple sample teas (we didn't fancy them) and when we asked for rose tea, we were introduced with about 6 of them. We tried the plain rose tea, which was amazing. I was very tempted to purchase one for myself but I only have 5 boxes of unopened teas to finish. They are rose buds and look so pretty. My friend ended up getting that rose tea and one with green tea as well. They sell tea sets with many different designs.  

Loyalty card: I got a stamp card and a card with bar code. The stamp card allows you a free tea after you buy 11 teas. So for example my friend bought 2 teas at once, that would be 2 stamps. I am not very sure what the one with the bar code is but I am guessing it's some sort of reward system."
104,t2-new-york,2017-06-15,5.0,"What a fantastic place to shop. I came here on a trends excursion and everything was displayed beautifully. The products are easily accessible and clear, something that I've come to appreciate when shopping in the tiny stores in NY. They offered samples of chilled tea and I recommend the Cosmo Crush, wow! The employees were very helpful to our group and knowledgeable about the ingredients in the tea."
104,t2-new-york,2016-12-28,5.0,"Finally found T2! Super cool tea shop with free flowing samples and a helpful staff. Well organized by tea/leaf type) and easy to shop.

Everything in here is giftable and lovely, but I basically shopped for my own tea supply for the next 2 months."
104,t2-new-york,2017-12-14,5.0,I always walk by this shop and finally deciders to stop in. The had a delicious sample and I was hooked. Honestly I literally want everything. The teas smell so good. I bought the chai and peppermint. Can't wait to try them.
104,t2-new-york,2016-09-22,4.0,"Don't be the shameless woman in front of us filling up two separate Thermos containers to the brim with two different samples. Let everyone enjoy the great teas...well, maybe not the spinach one."
104,t2-new-york,2014-11-11,4.0,"This store is very chic and inviting. Like any other tea house there are several varieties to taste that are both hot and cold. What sets this place apart from Teavana and Davids Tea is that you can really interact with the tea on your own pace, without having a sales associate linger over you; or needed to ask an associate to see and experience a can of tea, while the waft the aroma on your face. This place also has a lot of gift set offerings as well. Definitely worthwhile checking out - especially if youre a true tea aficionado."
104,t2-new-york,2017-10-12,4.0,"Nice place to buy teacups and teapots. The designs are very different from other tea shops. Looks like Russian inspired designs. The tea flavors and combination is kinda weird and definitely an acquired taste. But it's very different from David's Tea, Teaforte, Harney & sons, and other tea shops. Worth checking out. I do love their variety of tea infusers, strainers. Very interesting designs.  I did pickup some while I was in the shop. Also their fruit inspired teas are nice $10 each but I got the banana shape one.  They also offer tea sampling. So do go try some tea."
104,t2-new-york,2016-12-04,5.0,"This is my favorite go to tea shop ever! They have tons of tea collections, fantastic bottles and free tea fill up every Friday! The store has every tea that you are looking for, from herbal to black teas! I highly recommend going there and trying their sample teas!"

Try it - you'll love it.
my only question is ... why isn't there a listing for the UWS store?"
104,t2-new-york,2018-08-02,5.0,"HUUUUGE thanks to Malka and Noa for helping me with my selections! This place has a super friendly atmosphere, and they'll even let you sample the teas before you buy! After the great experience I've had today, I know I'll be coming back soon."
104,t2-new-york,2016-02-22,5.0,"After coming here I never want to go to a Teavana again. This store is beautiful-the brightly colored wall/shelf filled with a matrix of tea tins is super fun to look at. This place lets you brew a pot of tea you want to try. I came out with a great (albeit expensive) snow dragon jasmine tea. Also props to customer service, no one is pushy and they seem pretty knowledgeable with each tea they sell."
104,t2-new-york,2015-12-21,5.0,"T2 is a very chic store. Its aesthetic is colorful and bright, and its aroma warmly inviting. There is a huge variety of tea that ranges from Asian to English. Certain tea leaves can come loosely, in bags... Some come packaged beautifully for gifts. There is a diverse selection of tea tools, cutlery, pots and cups. It has pretty much everything. Staff is super friendly but not overbearing. I'm able to leisurely browse the shop without the pressure of having to buy something immediately, so I'm able to really take my time to choose the product I'm truly happy with."
104,t2-new-york,2014-10-24,4.0,"I had just met with the CEO of Rituals Cosmetics & was walking along Prince Street when I spotted T2 across the street because of its large front windows looking into a super colorful shop.  At first, I thought it was a stationery store.  Then I spotted the tea sampling station near the entrance -- Two hot & one cold.  Further in, pumpkin chai with honey & soy was served.  I'm usually not a fan of coconut, but the white white cocoa is delicious.  Iced Southern Sunrise was also yummy.  

Many other teas are offered, in colorful packaging, some with cute names like Gorgeous Geisha & Terrific Toffee.  Along the right wall sits at least 30 types of different teas, each with a canister for smelling & looking.  In the center of the store, teas are bagged.  Colorful ceramics in at least 3 different styles are sprinkled around the store.  An Australian chain, this location is their first US shop.  Greg, the merchandise designer has been with T2 for nine years & he describes his style as ""quirky"".  The entire staff is very friendly & helpful."
104,t2-new-york,2017-01-22,4.0,"T2 has three locations in NYC, and is an Australian based company. The workers are trained on proper tea etiquette (Ask them for advice on steep time, temperature, etc) and knowledgable about the goods (They themselves are allowed to try all the teas). Though they have several pre-brewed samples out, they will literally make you a sample of anything in the store. I would say you are better off getting snazzy clear teapots on Amazon and basic teas like english breakfast in Trader Joe's because they are way cheaper. My favorite tea is the Jade Mountain, which is truly unique-- it has Japanese GMC (giving it a nutty flavor derived from brown rice) and hazelnut tones. The Caramel Brownie is disgusting-- you really should ask for samples of anything before buying it, as smell is not always a good indication of taste."
104,t2-new-york,2016-01-14,5.0,"I was walking around SoHo and I was craving a warm beverage, walked right past T2 and noticed they had samples. Walked out with a few boxes of tea. I really thought T2 was Japanese due to the aesthetics and attention to detail throughout the store. To my surprise it's an Australian tea company with the most unique tea flavors I've stumbled upon. They had such a large variety of green, white, black, herbal & just about any other tea you can think of. They also sell tea accessories for brewing. It's like a candy shop for tea aficionados. They were sampling Jade Mountain and I fell in love, I regret only buying one box, went through it in less than a week (not kidding). I would describe it as a gen mai cha chocolate bar - no really, the hints of cocoa and almond make it super decadent, yet the gen gives it a light and fresh flavor. I would brew it and mix it into my almond milk before bed. I highly recommend it! Service was wonderful and price was reasonable! I highly recommend T2 and will be back next time if in NYC."
104,t2-new-york,2015-03-01,4.0,Great new tea shop in Soho. Apparently they're an Auzzie brand. Everyone in the store was very helpful and showed us many different samples of teas. They also get creative and introduced me to different ways to blend two types or adding additional ingredients. The one I loved and ended up getting was mixing the matcha with soy milk and honey. Don't forget to get the bamboo whisk to make it frothy.
104,t2-new-york,2017-08-11,5.0,"Awesome, warm and friendly staff.  The prices for the tea are high. Really nice teaware. Very colorful store."

105,debutea-new-york,2020-03-10,5.0,"I am originally from CA, residing in AZ, visited NY for spring break & Debutea was probably the best salted cheese I have ever had!! 

I got oolong tea with salted cheese & light boba..  I'm literally a boba connoisseur.. Lol. But Debutea seriously had the best salted cheese I ever had!! The salted cheese wasn't too salty & wasn't too sweet. It was thick & creamy with the right amount of salt!! I haven't stopped thinking about the the salted cheese since I had it yesterday!!"
105,debutea-new-york,2020-05-06,4.0,"I ordered a strawberry sunset 2.0 with cheese foam and it was really good. I was expecting icy frozen blended strawberries, but my drink was not icy at all. I'm usually not a fan of cheese foam in general, but I read in the reviews that theirs is not too salty. I'm glad I got it because it added another layer of flavor and texture to the drink, almost like a strawberry cheesecake. 

One star off because the price is a bit steep. I ordered on an app for pickup so it was a little more than normal, but even the base price is a lot for a drink (I think $6.50 + $0.75 cheese foam). Would come again for a treat myself in the future."
105,debutea-new-york,2020-01-16,4.0,"Drinks - I've had both their Brown Sugar Milk Tea and Tea Latte. Taste wise, they both are pretty good but I prefer the tea latte more because their tea quality is really good; plus it looks nicer with the matcha sprinkle or some sort! The star must be their boba though. I love the texture of their boba and it compliments the drink really well.

Ambiance - The shop is pretty small so seating is a bit hard to get when its crowded but its really cute! They provide free water too in a dispenser so thats a plus!

Price - These days, boba's are pretty pricey wherever you go so I'd say they're standard in terms of price.

Service - They were really patient with my order since I suck at choosing what to eat/drink. Regardless, they were very helpful in explaining what the different drinks are and were friendly too.

Overall, love this tea/boba shop! Get their boba because its so darn good. Its chewy, soft, and sweet. You'll dream of boba afterwards."
105,debutea-new-york,2020-01-15,4.0,"Got their regular brown sugar bubble tea and it was good. Perfect amount of sweetness and boba was chewy yet soft. Staff was friendly and quick to make the drinks. Cafe is small but cute. There is a pretty flower wall near the window for some nice instagrammable shots. Free wi-fi and outlets available if anyone is looking to get some work done.

Don't know whether it was because it was super cold outside in contrast to it being super warm in the cafe, but it felt quite muggy inside. My glasses fogged up right away upon entering the cafe.

Overall, decent place to get some bubble tea."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"Strawberry sunset with cheese foam- very good tea jasmine tea flavor to go along with the strawberry pieces. Cheese foam is an additional $0.50. 

YangZhiGanLu- mixture of coconut, mango, sago, and grapefruit pulp. Apparently it's only available after 1:30pm and about 20 available a day. Anything limited has to be good, right? It sure was! Nice sweet and thick drink but not too overwhelming with coconut. 

Cute place with a few seats. Came here on a weekday. No wait.
These specialty drinks are a bit pricey- about $8 each. It's a nice treat. Other tea drinks are standard price, around $5."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-12-26,4.0,"I tried their strawberry sunset and it was sooo good. It's a mixture of jasmine tea and strawberry, which gives the perfect balance of sweet and refreshing taste. A lot fo people add the cheese foam on top which sounds really good, but I personally like drinking fruity tea on its own so I got mine without it.

While it is pretty pricey as it's $7.50, but I have to admit that I do crave it time to time and it does taste delicious. It was also conveniently located near NYU so I used to come here a lot more often to grab a fruity drink or boba. However, I wouldn't consider this place a sit-down spot as  the space is very limited."
105,debutea-new-york,2020-01-27,4.0,"I finally got to try Debutea's cheese foam and actually thought it was really good. The reason why I said actually is because I feel like it could either be a hit or a miss. The employees were wonderful and very patient in helping me and my indecisiveness decide on which tea I wanted. I ended up getting the rose tea (cold) with cheese foam and I wasn't disappointed. The best description I have for the cheese foam is that it tastes like melted cheesecake. That may not be the best analogy I have and not all of my friends were over the moon about it but I liked it. For what it's worth, they also have a lot of boba and regular tea options as well."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-09-29,5.0,"I recommend the signature fruit tea (I got the one with jasmine green tea)! It comes in a large cup and comes with a fork so you can eat the fruit inside later. It tasted mostly like fruit juice, which I was pretty satisfied with because it was refreshing for a hot day.

We ordered 3 teas and it took a while to get our order, so be ready to wait."
105,debutea-new-york,2020-04-24,4.0,"Best cheese milk tea ever!!! They have nice ambience as well, service is a little slow as most of the time there's only one person working. It may sound weird and new but it's worth the try I loved it ever since :)"
105,debutea-new-york,2019-06-25,4.0,"Debutea prides itself with natural ingredients.  My favorite is the Taro bubble tea that contains PURÉED taro, not your typical purple powder that is used at your run of the mill bubble tea place.   The drink is also not overly sweet by default and the bubbles have a nice consistency. 

Also enjoyed the classic fruit tea that contains 9 different pieces of fruit in the tea.  Like having a fruit salad and ice tea in one.  

Prices are high but so is the quality.  Casual place and efficient service."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-07-06,4.0,"One of many tea shops in this area, Debutea seems to specialize in fruit teas and cheese tea. The shop itself has a lot of fun decorations and a few tables and seats. I opted for a four seasons cheese tea, which is a light oolong base with the ""cheese"" foam on top. 

The drink was pretty average especially with the higher price tag. The cheese foam on top does have a lot of salty flavor (reminiscent of heavy cream). 

However I think the tea base was too light to stand up to the cheese foam. It tasted quite watered down. I think a bolder black tea would have been a better combination."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-06-25,4.0,"Love the cheese foam tea here always! 
Tried the Rose Puer cheese foam this time but it was too sweet for me, still like the regular Rose cheese foam more. 
Dangerous because it's so addicting. 

5 star for the tea / 3 star for the cashier lady with bad attitude"
105,debutea-new-york,2019-11-05,4.0,"This fancy little bubble tea shop has quite a lot of trendy things going for it right now. Debutea has the cheese foam tea which is definitely not what I expected. It's not like drinking foamy cheddar. The cheese tea is light, airy, and ever so slightly savory and cheese reminiscent. They also have the black sugar milk tea. It's not life changing or worth lining up in Flushing for 45 minutes but it is good! The tea at Debutea is what I think really shines. The quality of tea is really refreshing and authentic to tea taste without an excessive amount of sugars or artificial flavors. The teas here are not cheap, but the store is cute and the drinks are good!"
105,debutea-new-york,2019-10-06,5.0,"If there is a ""10 STAR"" review, I would give it to this place. I was out with a friend a few months ago chilling at WSP when she suddenly said, ""have you tried cheese tea before?"" and I'm like ""cheese wha?"" I would have never imagined this combination of flavors. 

We came to Debutea and the first thing my eyes captured on the menu was the ""cherry blossom"" flavor. Cherry blossom is one of my favorite smells that I had wished to eat  and I finally did. I got the cherry blossom hot cheese tea, which is my ultimate favorite at Debutea. 

Since then, I literally take every visitor I have to try this place (or an excuse to drink more cheese tea). Whenever I'm in the area, I always go there. I tried many things from their menu and everything I tasted from flavors I like was good. Cherry blossom is a winner tho! You have to try it, or else, you've never been in NYC!"
105,debutea-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,"Had a signature fruit tea here and it was delicious and very refreshing. This is a small quaint high quality tea shop. The signature fruit tea had, you guessed it, fresh fruit in it. It was not overly sweet and tasted very fresh and natural...if that makes sense. Definitely recommend stopping by if you are in the mood for a refreshing pick me up. This place is better than most tea shops."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-03-29,5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the taro milk tea here - REAL CHUNKS OF TARO IN THIS TEA. Also isnt too sweet, which is definitely a plus. 

Got this milk tea hot on a cold day in NY and it was just the right thing to warm the soul. Would recommend"
105,debutea-new-york,2019-11-17,5.0,"It's soooo weird for me to love a tea place that isn't about boba, but here I am.

A coworker stumbled upon this place, fell in absolute love with it and started coming here at least once a day. And she's such a gem that she wanted to see how I would react to this place. And truthfully, I was skeptical at first. Because, like I said, most of my tea love revolves around boba. And while they have it here, it's not something that I ever find myself wanting here.

It's just good tea here. Good, solid tea with actual, fresh, natural fruits. Like they advertise. And it's absolutely delicious. And even with the peach, or the grape, or the dragonfruit (well dragonfruit doesn't really have that much flavor, but I digress), or any other stuff they add, the tea still comes through. And it's not over-steeped to try to compete with the fruit or anything, the tea is balanced and fruit compliments.

And yea, they have cute decor, some clearly meant draw in an insta crowd, but they don't need that here because their drinks are solid."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-03-09,5.0,"If they make it wrong, then just ask them for a NEW TEA
If you still hate it, then you can yell ""SCREW TEA""
But this is quite unlikely because this product is TRUE TEA
Some of Manhattan's best Boba's at DEBUTEA!

I brought my gf here when her period was DUE TEA
I looked down at her skirt, and I noticed a red HUE TEA
I shoulda told her but I didn't, so she never KNEW TEA
She left bloodstains on the seat, but she really loved DEBUTEA!

It's so good, it'll catch on faster than the FLU TEA
It tasted so yummy that my nether regions GREW TEA
I found it so sexy, I dropped to my knees and BLEW TEA
That's TMI but IDC, just come and try DEBUTEA!

WHAT!

It's a pleasure to be review #101!

Extraordinarily busy boba shop in the West Village not too far from MacDougal Street. A lot of the college students of the area and people from all over Manhattan in general come here to get their boba fix.

On the one hand I like it a hell of a lot, but on the other hand it could be better, especially in terms of wait time.

The drink on the other hand was really yum, if a little expensive. I got a truly lovely brown sugar milk tea, which was delicious, and - as you can see - is served in a mason jar.

It was extremely memorable and I enjoyed every sip.

So if you're sick of pictures of me
And the legs and high heels of Barbie
There's one antidote
Get some balls in your throat
Get Brown Sugar Milk at Debutea!"
105,debutea-new-york,2019-12-06,1.0,"This tea shop is super close to the NYU campus and I would always come here for boba. Debuted tends to be a little pricer than other chain stores such as Kungfu Tea and GongCha, but the taste and the quality of the tea is solid.

However, when I got my fruit tea recently, I noticed that there's a label sticking around on one of the orange peels. This is disgusting and truly concerning-- do they actually WASH their fruits?? Also, customer service is simply bad. I contacted Debutea two weeks ago on Facebook and never heard back from them. When I visit the store, service is slow and not that friendly. I WOULD NOT COME BACK"
105,debutea-new-york,2019-11-20,5.0,"I had a wonderful evening tucked into a corner chair of this shop, sipping on a cherry blossom cheese foam tea and reading a book. The cheese foam can be intense and polarizing, but I personally love the combination of salty, creamy foam and sweet tea. The moment that the slightly fruity cherry blossom tea breaks through the cheese foam is divine! 
I've also tried the rose tea with cheese foam, which I didn't like quite as much, just because I preferred the fruity over the floral tea. The taro milk tea is quite rich, as they use real taro for the base. I can't wait to try more of their drinks and spend more relaxing evenings here."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-03-24,5.0,"I think the ambiance is really cute here if you want to sit with friends and just enjoy your time. They have some nice decorative touches and colors. 

I had the cheese foam cherry blossom with boba ($5.99) and it blew me away! I think the flavors blended well together and my drink was multifaceted as it had three clear layers which was aesthetically pleasing for instagram. I have to say each flavor came through pleasantly. The cherry blossom and the tea still shone even with the boba and cheese foam. The cheese foam was absolutely delicious.

I would love to come back to try their other cheese foam flavors such as the Rose Pu-erh."
105,debutea-new-york,2020-03-11,3.0,The only thing that is stupid and technically illegal is that they will charge you extra .50$ for a hot tea which is not saying anything at the menu. Its only .50$ but its not mentioned anywhere in the menu.
105,debutea-new-york,2019-10-19,2.0,"The real disappointing thing to find out was that they had run out of coffee here by like 3:00 pm, among other problems.

I really wanted to come back here to try the salted cheese foam, since it was one of my favorites. It turns out that they only have a limited set of things that go on the cheese foam. I asked them if they could put cheese foam on my coffee, for instance, and they told me that they couldn't do it (however this was also impossible because as I mentioned they had run out of coffee).

I opted for some sort of latte with cheese tea, since this was the most similar to coffee that I could think of. The tea is actually not bad. The problem is that these guys cheese foam tastes way more like milk foam than cheese foam. It is a lot heavier, milkier, and less salty than the cheese foam over at happy lemon, which I much prefer. I can't say that I'd never come back here, but I wasn't wild about my experience."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-10-01,3.0,"Overall, the place is nice and I don't need to wait for long because I've arrived at 4pm.

However, there's too little  芋泥in 芋泥脏脏茶. It makes this drink really tastes like normal bubble tea, but it should've be thicker and smoothier."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-06-20,5.0,Came here to avoid food with a friend and their teas are pretty good. The place is cozy and the staffs are very nice. I got the cheese matcha latte that was lactose free and it was delicious. It's a great place to go to if you just wanna catch up with a friend or gossip. I do plan to cone here again and try all the teas.
105,debutea-new-york,2018-11-17,2.0,"- Only carry lactose-free whole milk, no almond or soy 
- They'll give you a sample of the cheese topping if you really push for it 
- Cheese teas calories 200 each, lattes 100, brewed teas 0 
- Not a fan of the Four Seasons cheese tea - the cream cheese topping tastes like semen - didn't even finish a third of it 
- Strawberry tea tastes like a 7-11 slushie - pass 
- Grapefruit tea was delicious and saved the day 
- Place is modern oriental vibe with fun East Asian decor and vibe 
- Fun for a tea adventure, and great that it's open late, but didn't enjoy it all that much"
105,debutea-new-york,2018-11-04,5.0,"Really interesting. I have to admit I was a bit sceptical about the cheese froth as that really sounded not very good to me but I know you don't know until you get so I tried and not I'm glad I did.

I took a cold jasmine tea cheese froth drink with bubbles. At first, the cheese froth was overwhelmingly thick and salty and I thought oh God what did I get but Then as I drank more and got the delicious sweet jasmine tea, I fell in love. The sweetness and jasmine flavour from the tea combined with the saltiness of the cheese froth was downright delicious. The bubbles themselves are delicately sweet and perfectly chewy


Overall I loved it and suggest you try it at least once!"
105,debutea-new-york,2018-10-24,3.0,"Cherry Blossom W/Cheese Foam- ew. The cheese foam significantly affected the taste of the cherry blossom tea, which resulted in some syrup-y taste. I've had better cheese foam from Happy Lemon and Mi Tea. The cheese foam here doesn't taste that good. The adjustable half-covered lids are especially annoying to drink from, since the drink tends to spill. 

I was going to give this review 2 stars for the not-so-great cheese foam drink, but Debutea redeemed itself with the Brown Sugar Bubble Tea!- the packaging is so cute! The drink could use a lil more boba tho. I can never get enough of boba. The brown sugar bubble tea was surprisingly not too sweet, and tasted pretty good."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-07-12,4.0,"I found this spot on yelp while searching for a bubble tea shop to go to for dessert after a tasty lunch. We walked from street to street and arrived at the tiny bit cozy tea shop. The interior had a few tables and chairs for sitting. The air conditioning was not working so it was pretty hot inside. We ordered the brown sugar boba and jasmine tea with cheese and boba. The drinks were made quickly and reasonably priced for bubble tea. I really liked the presentation of the brown sugar boba drink - they gave us a reusable plastic bottle that looked and felt nice and weighty. The drink was good- not too sweet, rich and creamy, and had bobas that were slightly chewy. The jasmine tea with cheese was very delicious - the cheese topping was fresh, just the right amount of salt, very rich and creamy and satisfying. I would definitely come back for more when I'm in the area!"
105,debutea-new-york,2019-07-04,2.0,"I had been here once before while doing a conference at NYU and quite enjoyed my experience. However, last night's visit to Debutea was much less impressive. 

We went about 30 minutes before closing. I don't know if it was because we were taking a little longer than usual to order (my friends had never been there before so I was explaining to them what I've tried and what I'll probably get). The girl behind the register looked at us and in a snarky tone said ""We close in 30 minutes."" I knew that was her way of trying to get us to hurry, but honestly, there's no one behind us in line and yes, we knew when we showed up that the shop was closing soon so there was no need for the attitude.

I ended up ordering a large bobo tea and my friend said that she would get the same but medium sized. The girl rolled her eyes and told her that they don't have a medium size. Apparently, it comes only in SMALL and LARGE so we had to specify that it was the small that she wanted because of course, saying that she wanted a medium one meant that she didn't know what to register that size as. She could have just said that it comes just in small and large but instead, she said they don't have medium and so my friend had to ask what sizes they had then. 

I asked if it was at all possible to lessen the amount of syrup from the brown sugar that got coated and before I even finished asking my question, the girl was already shaking her head. 

Drinks ended up being okay. The brown sugar boba was very hot when it came out but the milk cooled it so quickly that it got chewy rather fast. My other friend got the Rose Cheese Foam tea. He said the Cheese Foam was better than he thought it would be but the rose tea was lacking flavor. 

Drinks: 3 stars
Service: 1 star"
105,debutea-new-york,2019-12-11,3.0,"Place wasn't bad. Let me say that. But with all the bubble tea hype in the past couple years, this is not the best, nor is it the cheapest soooo not sure I would pick coming back here in particular over Boba Guys or The Alley. I had their Boba Milk Tea and the boba wasn't as chewy as I like and the tea wasn't as strong as I like. It wasn't flavorless though, not bad but I don't think I'd come back unless someone insisted. Interior is small but cute!"
105,debutea-new-york,2019-04-18,4.0,"Chill vibes and cool space on NYU campus area. Good place to get tea. $7 card minimum which is kind of annoying. Try the cheese tea! It's so unique and if you can deal with cottage cheese, you can handle this. I like the decor inside and the place is clean."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-06-15,3.0,"I came due to the rave reviews about the cheese foam tea. The place was bright, clean and well-decorated, with a few small tables for patrons. I ordered the cherry blossom cheese foam while my friend had the Bobo tea. At first taste, the cheese foam has a unique salty cream cheese flavor that contrasted with the milder tea flavor at the bottom. While it was novel, I am not blown away by the taste nor the price. The tea itself is mild, with a nice scent, which would have been refreshing to drink on a summer day, the cheese foam overpowered it, covering up the taste. The Bobo tea was also quite underwhelming, like any other bubble tea out there, which doesn't justify the $5.75 price tag."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-03-19,5.0,"Debutea - One of my favorite spots for milk tea in the city.

I used to order Osmanthus tea or Rose Crown all the time, but today I tried Ruby Red and it's amazing! Very Fruity - tasted like the summer of Taiwan (though I never been there before lol

And look at the thick cheese foam(i know it may sound gross but believe me you will love it if you try it!!

The only downside it's they only take cards when you spend $7+, which means you always need to pay cash if you want to buy 1 drink only. :("
105,debutea-new-york,2019-05-27,4.0,"It's a hidden cute little tea shop with quite a bit of options, we got the super pineapple with jasmine tea on this hot day. It was very refreshing but wish the tea taste was a bit stronger so we don't just taste the pineapple juice"

Got taro bobo tea and it's not bad! There's so much taro in it that I have to eat taro after finishing the drink haha and it's kinda hard(?
Would like to try more other drinks"
105,debutea-new-york,2018-11-10,3.0,"Cheese foam and green tea was very interesting. 

The green tea portion was good, but I'm definitely not a fan of the cheese foam. It is way too thick and the tea wasn't able to penetrate through it until you finished a lot of the foam. The foam flavor also overpowered the tea and I definitely don't recommend unless you love cheese. 

Not a knock on this place but I not sure who loves having cheese foam. More like a novelty gone wrong."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-09-01,4.0,"Enjoyed the Cheese Matcha Latte. Nice, cutely decorated cafe to just hang out and chat with a few friends for a while. There's probably enough seating inside for about 10-15 people, and there's a bench outside."
105,debutea-new-york,2018-08-29,2.0,"Came here in the evening and was curious about the cheese foam and hoping to try that and the fruit tea. Ambience is very chic and looks like I stepped into a west elm catalog. The drink was different and not what you'd expect from hearing about it. It was quite sweet and tasted like cream cheese. The fruit tea was also very refreshing. 

Now, I give 2 stars because of the steep prices and the poor customer service we received. It took quite awhile for us to be attended to while we were the only one in the cafe that was going to order. When asking about the cheese foam tea we were told to read the description rather than hear directly from the employee working there. It was off putting and rather dismissive. 

Overall, drinks were tasty, but pricey and served with a lack of customer service."
105,debutea-new-york,2019-11-17,3.0,Nice presentation but taste is average. Ordered boba tea with brown sugar. Felt like I was drinking plain warm milk..:(
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2020-03-05,5.0,"Macao Imperial Tea is a gem. I came here for the first time a few days ago, and ordered their Grapefruit Yakult. I've had similar drinks at other tea establishments, but I've found this same drink to be much better at Macao Imperial Tea. They've definitely got their grapefruit to Yakult ratio down to a science. I am excited to try their other drinks out in the future and will make this place a must when I'm in Chinatown. 

If you check in on Yelp you get 10% off, so that was a plus! I went through their menu and found other teas I can't wait to try on my next visit. Enjoy!"
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2020-02-17,4.0,"I highly recommend the blue curacao soda and cherry blossom soda from their soda series. They are $5.50 each. For one, they look too beautiful to drink! The cherry blossom soda is served with actual fresh cherry blossoms inside. The blue curacao soda taste like lemonade with citrus. Another thing I really love about this tea house are their bottles. Their special drinks are serves in adorable bottles that are reusable. 

One downside is that there was too much ice in proportion to the drink. When I finished the drink, the bottle was still 3/4 filled with ice cubes. 

I also tried their Special drink For Me (strawberry milkshake $6.75) before at their koreatown location and I remember the staff told me I couldn't adjust to light ice. Other than that, the drinks are super yummy!

Also this location has stamp cards! If you buy 10 drinks, you get 1 free!"
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2020-01-17,5.0,"I really don't understand how
People can dislike Bubble Tea now
There's so many good places
And this one's an Oasis
In Chinatown NY called Macao

And I don't know when, why, or how
But I need a Boba right now
So if we're close to Flushing
Then we should be rushing
For a Lemon Black Tea from Macao!

You may have seen various farm animals of mine, such as my pig, my goat (he's the goat), and my chicken. But have you seen Macao? It's here.

They offered super friendly service and they even recognized me from Yelp (lol) which was awesome. Chinatown in Manhattan has a lot of boba options, but this is one of the nicer ones, and one of my fave locations of Macao with yummy drinks and super fresh decor... looks brand new, in fact.

But then I brought Barbie here for what would have been my 3rd trip and it didn't go so well.

I've always loved this location and I love the service and the drinks are great too, and comparing it to the ones that I've recently discovered in Atlanta and Philadelphia, I would have said that this was one of my favourites as well as the ones in Brooklyn and Queens.

But the problem is that when I brought Barbie here about 15 minutes before closing, they had just closed up, and gave me a dirty look, and I didn't really appreciate that very much to be honest.

Still, life goes on and I'm sure I'll give them another try, but that left a slightly sour taste in my mouth. And not even from the drinks.

If that sort of thing happens again, they'll be losing some stars, I tell thee.

So although these drinks may look ethereal
At least they don't taste like bad cereal
Like at Momofuku
(If you like it, f*** you)
F*** that, let's get Macao Imperial!"
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-10-05,2.0,"The staff is nice. 

The drinks are kind of bland. The teas are not very strong. 

What surprised me the most was their mango slush contained milk...only found out after I ordered it. Then after asking them about it, they said ALL their SLUSH contains milk. Nonetheless, I thought the mango one tasted pretty good. I only got to try it because the person I intended to buy it for is SUPER lactose intolerant.

The glass bottle is nice but I definitely did not think it through when I ordered mine. Never did I consider needing my big straw and not being able to close the cover."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-09-08,3.0,"Doesn't impress me.  Nothing extraordinary from the ordinary.  Excessive fruit embedded for fruit tea.  I requested fresh fruit tea with ice and grass jelly $5.50 as the topping and nothing else, nothing more.  A simple request.  Is this extremely difficult to understand and fullfill? The fresh fruit contents were large pieces of pineapple, red grape, peach, strawberry, and orange.  Large chunks of fruit in a ice tea does not impress me for being distinct to separate from competition.  All I desired was grass jelly as the sole topping but the fruit overpowered the entire drink.   Large is the only option size for fruit tea.  Customer service is average.

Seating is limited but in a cool air conditioned environment.  After I checked-in I forgot to notify the cashier of Yelp mobile check-in offer."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-07-27,2.0,"Ordered through a food delivery courier on a hot summer day.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed and neither of us finished even a quarter of our drinks.  

I obviously can't speak about the staff experience or the location. 

Food: We each ordered a large Jasmine Milk Tea with boba at 30% sweetness and regular ice.  I'm not sure if they don't put a lot of ice or if it melted on the way to us (even though it was in an insulated carrier).  You can only pick less ice via the app when ordering otherwise I would've asked for extra ice.  

The tea itself did not have much of a Jasmine flavor. It was barely a hint of Jasmine, if even that.  The boba had a very strong honey flavor that could be considered overpowering except, the Jasmine tea flavor was lacking, so it only seemed overpowering.  

The boba was really chewy and the center was brittle which is a sign that it didn't seem completely cooked through.  

Overall, not a place I'd try again. There are better ones in NYC."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-05-04,4.0,"Macao Tea is a pretty solid place with a good ongoing number of happy customers. I recommend any tea with cheese foams.

106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-11-25,5.0,I loved the cheese foam bubble tea. It was a great and the service was good. They gave affordable prices and a very extensive menu.
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-05-08,4.0,"I always get so excited when Flushing restaurants and shops open up in Manhattan and was not disappointed by Macao Imperial Tea.

I stopped by on a rainy Saturday afternoon with a friend. My friend ordered one of the cheese foam drinks, and I got a brown sugar milk tea. My friend really liked his drink, but didn't love it - I think it was more a function of trying cheese foam for the first time than Macao Imperial Tea itself. I absolutely loved my brown sugar milk tea, which is like an elevated version of a normal milk tea essentially. There were definitely some unique drinks that I'd come back to try. 

The employees there were super nice and much chattier than I'm used to for a tea shop in the area, but I love that!

Like most tea shops these days, you can opt for different levels of sugar and ice. The boba that day was pretty sweet, so I'd definitely recommend you go down on the sugar level. 

The stoppers they use here are heart shaped - super cute. You can also get souvenir glass panda cups that are really cute.

Great new tea spot near Chinatown! I happened to be around the area and saw their store on Hester and went in to give it a try. I ordered the cheese foam with ruby black tea, and ordered a size M at 30% sugar and 30% ice. Total bill came around $4.90 for a size M. Decent sized cup of tea. 

Tea itself was very light and refreshing, like the way I like it! The cheese foam is my kryptonite - salted to a right level, but thick and creamy which definitely adds more flavor to my tea. Highly recommend Macao Imperial now that I know they have a new location in Manhattan!

I said no ice because I wasn't going to drink my drink until a few hours later.  I didn't want the ice to dilute my drink.  They ended up giving me ice.  I didn't want the drink to go to waste so I sucked it up and kept it.  Because there was ice, I had to drink it first so I could taste it.  It was just okay.  Nothing special.  

They also changed the cups so the cups are no longer IG friendly and pretty if you want something to IG/if that's something you care about."

106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-09-08,5.0,"Got the brown sugar milk tea with boba, 50% sugar, regular ice, and original uji matcha with grass jelly, 50% sugar, 30% ice. Both were great! I would rec going down to 30% sugar for the brown sugar milk tea because it's pretty sweet even at 50%. The uji matcha has a strong matcha taste which is how I like it. Will come back again when I'm in the area! Also, there is some seating inside (3 small tables and a counter)."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-07-18,5.0,"I love this place. I was first introduced to their quality tea at their Flushing location. I enjoy their bear shaped caps on their collectible glasses they sell. Their prices are a little high, but I think it is worth it. The tea here is obviously high quality, and so long as they can keep this quality up, this will be one of my top spots."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-08-02,5.0,"Flavor of original tea stronger and more tasty than normal bubble teas. I was pleasantly surprised, thought it would be another regular bubble tea shop same as all the other chains.
I got the Ali tea original with no sugar no ice and with egg pudding. Will definitely visit again."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-07-21,4.0,"I stopped by here with a friend to try it out. I tried the Black Sugar Milk Tea with bubbles and my friend tried the Roasted Oolong Milk Tea with bubbles. I am a huge boba fan and this place didn't disappoint. Apparently you can also upgrade for a $1 to a ""soda cup."" There are also special drink options that come with a cute panda cup. The place has a nice setup and plenty of seats to hang out while you finish your drink."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-05-19,4.0,"I love the tea there it's currently my favourite tea spot. But the one bad thing about this place is the bubbles aren't good. So I only get the drinks without the tea. I wish their bubbles would improve otherwise I'd be here everyday. Their cheese foam is also mad good. And their passion fruit green tea is my current favorite. It's different then your regular one, get the 50% sugar tho because it's ridiculously sweet. (Just the passionfruit gt)."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-06-01,5.0,"I'm addicted to the cheese foam spring fresh tea. Maybe because it reminds me of the 8 years i spent living in Asia... it's fresh, clean... a taste of youth- if ever it can be embodied in a sip of anything, this is it. Large cheese foam spring fresh tea with 30% sugar and 30% ice. No bubbles. Trust me."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-03-31,5.0,This place has plenty of seating compared to other boba spots and also they take card with no minimum required.  I ordered the A-Li Mountain Pearl Milk Tea while my friend got the Taro Milk Tea.  I would say this boba place is above average because it tastes much better than chain stores like kung fu tea and Vivi's.  Quite surprised that there aren't as much customers.
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-03-14,3.0,"The taste was decent for their bubble tea and strawberry juice. Although the bear glass is very cute and very endurance. Although it was a gift drink, so I didn't get to go in to the store and know the servers or the surroundings the drink was decent. Including the glass I think it was somewhere around $10 with tax already. The Bible's was a bit tough though."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-03-04,5.0,Delicious! Stopped by today and received fast efficient service. I ordered the cheese foam jasmine tea and it was delicious!!!! I don't think it's actuallly cheese but I'm not 100% sure what it is. It's salty and very good as a topper to the tea. Will return!
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-10-22,5.0,"Literally one of my favorite drink places we went to while in Chinatown! We got the Summer Lemon Soda, the mango drink and the matcha slush with boba. The summer lemon soda was so refreshing! I wish I had one right now. The matcha slush was also good and the ""bubbles"" were the right level of chewiness! The mango drink was also good but it was more on the sweeter side for my taste."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-08-10,1.0,"I came here on a Saturday evening and the place was dead. The drinks taste very, very average, so nothing ""imperial."" Also, they never said ""thank you"" when they should since I gave them business. Drinks start around $5 after taxes. I asked if there was a bathroom, and they said no. Nothing special about this place. I'd be really surprised if it makes it through the end of 2019."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-04-23,4.0,We ordered the milk tea with oats + red bean and a brown sugar milk tea. We did not get an option to adjust the sugar level but flavor was good for both of us. Drinks had good ratio of drink and chewable. Would come back even with the heavy bubble tea competition in the neighborhood.
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-04-14,4.0,"The tea here is pretty unique, we ordered the cheese foam uji matcha which is similar to the seasoned Matcha from king fu tea. 

I have to say it is pretty smooth and they don't add too much ice to it so you do get your money worth.

We haven't tried other things yet but they do sound pretty interesting. If you have been to most of the other bubble tea place and want something more special I think it is worth a try."
106,macao-imperial-tea-new-york,2019-03-13,5.0,"Found this spot while on lunch break in Chinatown and I'm so glad I did. Got the cheese foam pineapple tea and it's absolutely delicious! The cheese foam is unlike anything I've had before, it's salty, which I was surprised about, but the perfect balance to a sweet tea drink. It's like a sweet cheesy custard but much thinner. The flavor it brings reminds me of the sea salt people add to salted caramel or a rich chocolate dessert. Normally I get a bit tired of my drink about halfway through, but this one was perfect and I loved every bit of it. Would definitely recommend getting something with the cheese foam if you do pay this place a visit. 

The shop itself is not big, but it does have a few tables and a bench along the window. They also allow you to pay by card, but I think there is a $5 minimum."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-11-21,5.0,"I absolutely love this place. It's my go-to lunch spot in the area. They have large platters of food for only $10-12.

This time I ordered enchiladas which comes with yellow rice and black beans. It might be a simple order but so full of flavor! And that goes with any of the orders from there! My other go to order is roasted chicken with rice and beans. 10/10 recommend.

If you're in the area or this place happened to catch your attention- give it a try! The menu is very diverse and they even have daily specials for each day of the week."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-09-11,3.0,"Really good food. I just don't know if they overcharge non Spanish speakers lol I got charged $11 instead of $9.  my pernil didn't come with beans or salad. Just the rice and soup. Is that normal? Cause the menu says differently 

And I also got charged $11 instead of $9 


UPDATE:

Went again for lunch and again, got overcharged. This time $13 instead of $9. Not sure if it's bc I ordered something else but I will go again next time and see what they say. Also the lady asked me if I wanted rice and beans and ofc I said yes. But I came back again to only yellow rice."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-09-16,4.0,This is your classic NYC mom and pops joint. Old school.  Simple menu. Great sandwiches. We usually hit this place once or twice each time we come to NYC. Recommend the Mexican eggs - perfect if you need a huge breakfast.
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-06-13,5.0,"I've walked passed this place for years not knowing that it was a gold mine. Finally tried it and it was just what I was expecting.  Delicious pernil with great flavor. So juicy. Grilled chicken with peppers and onions was outstanding. Will definitely be going back regularly. Loved the waitress as well, so cute, so sweet."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-09-28,4.0,"I walked a mile to this place from my hotel, and as someone who cant really get mofongo where I live, having dinner at this place was a really enjoyable experience. Although the online menu I think is a little outdated, as the price for camarofongo is listed for $13 but was listed for $15 at the restaurant, it was absolutely amazing. 

This establishment is small and could perhaps be considered a little hole in the wall; the diner layout of this place causes for the heat to not ventilate well and it can be a bit hot inside the coffeeshop, but I still highly encourage anybody seeking Puerto Rican/Dominican food in lower Manhattan to go! The wait for my food was definitely worth it, as the camarofongo was fresh, hot, and delicious. It was beautifully adorned with a salad and avocados around the camarofongo. My dish came with plenty of the yummy thick sauce that makes this dish so yummy. I would be back."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-04-25,5.0,"Delicious, authentic and a friendly crew as well! Tax inclusive pricing is nice, and the environment is like a 1950s diner that was written into existence for Westside Story. The menu has a wide range of traditional and creatively modern selections."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-11-15,5.0,The Dominican food is really good!!! The sancocho tasted just like my mom's.  BEST DOMINICAN FOOD IN TOWN!
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-02-09,5.0,"This is my favorite Latino restaurant in Manhattan! I've been coming here for years, every time I'm the city. I've had eggs, rice, beans, tostones, chicken.... many things on the menu and I have loved everything I've received! The chicharron de pollo is juicy and seasoned to perfection. Will be back again!"
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-07-12,5.0,"I took the R train here during my lunch break - which should tell you how good it is! This is seriously the kind of place you go out of the way for.

Westside Coffee Shop is a very no-frills establishment, probably intended more for take out (but they do have tables, and I believe, sit down service). I ordered the pork mofongo (which, sadly, does not come with a side of rice, but the portion is large enough that I was glad I didn't have any more food!) and my order was ready relatively quickly, and stayed warm and fresh on my train ride back to the office. The delicious garlicky smell had my mouthwatering the entire time, and had me wishing I either worked closer or had decided to eat there!

But finally, I dug into that mofongo, and all I have to say is: WOW. This was some of the best mofongo I ever had, and I love that they give you the gravy, because sometimes the dish can get a little dry, and pouring a bit of gravy over it is just the thing. You also get a little bit of salad on the side complete with avocado (when is avocado not extra? Amazing!).

Lastly, the price is unbeatable. I paid less than $10 for at least two meals worth of food. I've read in other reviews that their Dominican menu is the way to go, and while I haven't tried anything else, I can vouch that it is a must try!"
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-11-06,5.0,"I found this spot when I used to work in downtown town Manhattan.  Each dish has that flavor of the griddle.  Bistec with onions and peppers, so tasty you'll shovel it in.  I can't decide what to get each time I go, so I start thinking hours beforehand, dreaming of crispy pollo or chuleta's.  I love it all.  Might be a bit greasy but that's fine because it gets the job done.  Great place to share platters with a friend.  Friendly staff, and quite busy around lunch."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-11-24,5.0,"This made my entire NY trip. Being Dominican, getting homemade food away from home was god sent. The food is amazing, service is amazing, vibes are amazing. I absolutely love everything about this ""hole in the wall"" as we would say in Detroit. I'm obsessed. Definitely going to miss it here!!"
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-04-27,5.0,"For a small Spanish restaurant in TriBeCa, it's pretty good. It's a taste of the hood while in the city for cheap. They serve breakfast, Mexican food, and Dominican food. 

I ordered chuletas (fried porkchops) with yellow rice and black beans. It was delicious and for $13 I believe. Service was quick and you can easily dine in."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-11-26,2.0,This place has horrible service . The food is okay but i only to it cause it's convenient.
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-11-16,5.0,"Being from Los Angeles, I do not consider myself a Dominican food expert but I am a foodie and I do not need to speak spanish to know that this spot is on point!!! I planted myself at the cozy little diner counter and spent about an hour shoving mouthfuls of chicken, fried plantains, beans and rice in my face until I was on the verge of exploding. In between bites I observed what I thought was an arguement about to turn into a fist fight but then I realized it's New York, they are not going to kill each other, that is just their way of chatting."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-03-01,5.0,"What a find this place was. An inauspicious, Dominican and American style luncheonette, I just happened in because I was hungry and there was a parking spot. But what a revelation. The food was superlative. The tostones were the best I've ever tasted. Along with that I had very fresh eggs, very tasty Dominican style salami, sauteed onions, and cheese. And great cafe con leche. The lady who seems to run the kitchen and may be the owner of the place is a doll, she's just like somebody's mother, and makes you feel wanted :)  A gem in my book."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-08-08,1.0,"Ordered 2 chicken quesadillas.

What I got were 2 soggy tortillas stacked on top of each other and some chicken with bones. All this underneath the salad, rice & beans. Definitely doesn't look like a quesadilla, unless the meaning of it changed since I last had it.

At first, I actually thought I only got my sides delivered to me. Who would've thought that the 'quesadillas' were hidden underneath my sides? Called the restaurant and they just told me to 'dig to the bottom and you'll find them there.' What?

Oh and food was meh. Too many chicken bones, not enough chicken. Didn't like the taste of it. Didn't touch the soggy tortillas because that's just gross. Ended up throwing 98% of it out in the trash. Just wasted $13. Ugh."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-11-07,5.0,"For anyone with an appreciation for Dominican breakfast food, they have mungu on the menu and serve Cafe Bustelo coffee. My Dominican grandmother will only drink Cafe Bustelo coffee so I felt at home as I sat at the bar and the ladies behind the counter served me mounds of delicious food. This is a divey spot full of regulars who are greeted in the native Spanish tongue of the workers. Designed like a diner, your food is cooked in front of you as telenovelas play in the background. 

Skip your regular over priced brunch spot and give this place a try. You won't regret it!"
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-04-30,5.0,"#I was looking for a quick place to eat and get a beer or two in the area. This fit the bill.

They didn't have the fish soup I wanted or the codfish stew, which were the specials of the day. So I got the Roast Pork ($10.50) with rice and beans. So much food. So much #Roast Pork. Hadn't seen that much pork on a plate in along time.

I liked the #hot sauce on the side. It's not overly spicy. Just a good smokey flavor.

There was some #weird guy that kept dancing in the restaurant and messing with this one dude and trying to talk to his #girlfriend. I couldn't tell if he was friends with the dude or worked there or what. But the dude didn't look like he liked the dancing guy ...even if they were #friends."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-06-19,4.0,"I stumbled upon this little treasure trove and picked up a menu and went off to do my research. I'm the type that looks at price tags and refuse to spend a penny unless I've some sort of sense of security that the odds of a good meal will be in my favor. But I digress. I opted to go with the fried porkchops, yellow rice and salad (instead of beans, which was an option). The chops were seasoned well enough for me, but could've used a little more Sazon in my personal opinion.  Rice was good, salad was basic (I dressed the salad myself, like a big girl). The highlight of this lovely find? The portions are YUGE!!! For $13 I was able to have a big lunch and have plenty of leftovers for today. You just cannot beat that with a stick. You. Can. Not. Oh, by the way, don't go for the ambiance, there isn't any. And my gut tells me to stick to the Dominican food and avoid the Mexican fare, it doesn't seem to be their strong suit."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-06-22,5.0,"Little hole in the wall place with amazing standard breakfast fare. The Huevos Rancheros are phenomenal. The hot sauce they serve it with is so flavorful and quite spicy, but perfect amount of heat if you like things spicy. The coffee is nothing special, but not bad. Staff was efficient and friendly. I will eat here again."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-01-06,5.0,"I used to work across the street from Westside in 1987. The first time I had a roast pork burrito. Last week I  wonder if they were still around, did a Google search and to my surprise they were still there. I wasn't sure if it was the same owner and same taste. Took a chance today to check it out surprisingly the same owner. I ordered the Roast pork burrito and couldn't wait to get home to eat. I am delighted taste the same perfection from 1987."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-01-12,5.0,This place is gold. A real find! Very local diner style. But what I had was nothing short of fabulous.
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-11-17,1.0,"I'm only giving them 1star because my friend likes her food. 

One piece of advice- check your food before you leave!!! I ordered the nachos and enchilada combo. It comes with rice, salad, and beans. They put everything in one dish and it was the most mushy crap ever! First, I checked the meal before I left and they didn't even put the enchilada and one lady was like yea, the cook put it in there on the side, she asked the cook and he, with an attitude, was like I put it in there! She failed to show me but lifted a nacho, like I'm dumb, and said it's right here. I gave her a look and then said to him in Spanish, no there's nothing here. Like are you freaking kidding me? And then, they made me a whole new plate of mushy mess. 

The cashier lady with such an attitude was saying nasty stuff about me in Spanish, not knowing that my friend speaks Spanish and heard the whole thing. My friend explained to her in Spanish that I didn't get what I ordered, so why wouldn't I complain and look through my food?! The cashier proceeded to say that I only ordered nachos and the other lady who worked there corrected her too. The cashier didn't even know who's food was who's when she was checking people out, to say anything. So disorganized. 

If you have nasty stuff to say, at least say it in the language of the person you're talking bad about. I would love to understand how ""wrong I was"". 

It's such a mess in there and the food was one big mess too. I love Spanish food, especially Dominican food. I would never come here again."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-07-05,4.0,"Great place for a good cheap lunch surrounded by plenty of atmosphere. 
The portions are exceedingly generous. One taco with rice & beans is plenty. 
Cofees good too.
"" Do you have Gluten Free?"" gets you a  blank stare 
Very High marks !"
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-11-06,4.0,"Delicious Dominican food; my coworkers and I ordered everything from camrofongo to oxtails, rice and beans and everything was phenomenal. It's usually pretty hard to find good, authentic, dominican/caribbean food in this area, so this place is on point. Only thing I would recommend is order wayyy ahead,the wait time was ridiculously long."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-08-14,5.0,"This humble restaurant is one of the greatest places I've ever eaten. The bean and cheese burrito is so good! I order it with mixed red and black beans, with a little bowl of hot sauce on the side. The price Is so low, and the quality is so high. You will feel good all-day after eating this :)"
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-08-31,5.0,What a fantastic lunch. Not to mention the affordable price. Very happy I found this place.
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-10-05,5.0,"Best authentic Latin food I have ever had in this area. I highly recommend their steak sandwich, although just about everything on their menu is mouthwatering good!"
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-04-29,3.0,"Like other reviewers I too had bones in my meal. I got the enchiladas combo which comes with 2 enchiladas (your choice of meat), beans and rice. 

They forgot I was dining in and packed my food to go. I still ate it from the container, it was good for the price. Not a stand out dish but it did fill me up. However the bones did throw me off."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-02-18,5.0,"This is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood. There aren't many vegetarian options but I still love it - I get their amazing cheese enchilada plate every time (they do also have a smaller a la carte enchilada if you're not super hungry, as the plates are pretty big).

My boyfriend usually goes for the pork, with rice and beans, and he's upset when they're sold out for the day because it's his favorite dish. He says the stews are excellent, though. The bathroom is always pretty gross, which is the only downfall. I've wanted to use the restroom but been too disgusted to deal with cleaning it up first that I've  waited to go somewhere else. It would be nice if they kept it clean but they're usually so busy cooking in the back (and they probably don't think their customers are that gross and inconsiderate!) 

The service is great, I love all the cooks and waitresses. They're always pleasant and no matter how busy they are, they take the time to talk to everyone and make sure they're getting what they need."

107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-12-16,5.0,"Just had a nachos enchilada, and it was too much food for one person, and only $11. Very good tasty Mexican food. They had some special sauce which was too hot for me, but I do not eat very spicy food so for others it's probably not hot. But it was yummy.
Thanks to the other reviews for making it easy for me to go here."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-03-29,4.0,"This place needs to change its damn name; so deceiving! Seems like it's a dinner but they mainly serve Latin food. It may be that they took over a diner and simply kept the name? In any case, this is legit a pretty good Latin place for the area. Mainly Mexican and carribean foods. Their rice is cooked perfectly. Their fish is incredible and the pernil was good. Simple food. Large portions. Inexpensive. A must try hole in the wall."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-03-24,5.0,Always a save when you don't want to walk too far for lunch or if you are craving a good portion of Dominican food.  I usually have roast pork with yellow rice sans beans (gotta watch that waistline).  Their portions are so big that they usually last me for at least 3 meals.  And even if you have to reheat it ...it does not lose its flavoring.  Yum!
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2013-11-12,5.0,"You Would never suspect how great this place is from the outside.

A Couple of years ago I happened to walk by  and decided to go in for some café con Leché.
Since then I have become a devoted patron.
The Rice and Beans are by far the best I have ever had.
The Monfungo is out of this world as well as the Arroz con Pollo,

The Service is exceptional.
It's a Homey place where all feel welcome."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2013-11-16,5.0,"My daughter and I stumbled across this place while on a ""el cheapo"" shopping trip on Canal St. a few weeks ago. It was 10AM and most of the chinese joints were not open yet... and we had to eat.

While I know that this place's specialty is beef stew, beans, rice... etc. I had to have a burger, and this was one of the best burgers I've ever had... No shit. It was that good. I don't know what sort of spicing was in it but it was perfection, as was the totally fresh lettuce, tomatoes and pickle that came with it... all for $4.50.... Unbelievable."
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-01-14,5.0,AMAZING! this place is fucking great! dishes are huge. food is tasty if you stick to the mexican dominiicna shit. fuck the burger. vegetarian kinda hard here. but rice beans basic and filling plus the cheeses enchiladas are good.  the beef or chicken stew soups are best with bones in it. breakfast is classic. coffee if a bit filthy but wakes you up. best clientele cause its across from post office and staff is always friendly. has beer if you want to avoid the shit bars around here. bathroom is small and fucked up smells like piss and bleach constantly but i kinda cool.
107,westside-coffee-shop-new-york,2014-09-24,5.0,"This place is fantastic. I've eaten lunch on numerous occasions here; the portions are incredible and the good is delicious. The roast pork with yellow rice and black beans is such a good, fortifying meal, I find it difficult to try anything else. Today though, I had the stewed chicken and it was delicious.

Oh, it's dirt cheap and the people are so friendly. A great NYC gem!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2020-02-14,5.0,"I came here with a party of 2 around 11:30 am, and waited for about twenty minutes for a table. There isn't any inside waiting space so we had to wait outside - be prepared for weather! 

Once we were inside, I was surprised to find that there was another table section towards the back of the restaurant. The food I ordered was the Brekkie Board and Aussie Iced Latte. Within the brekkie board was a half portion of the avocado smash and collective granola on top of yogurt. Although these were half portions, the entire board was very filling. I also enjoyed the Aussie Iced Latte - although there's a scoop of vanilla ice you could still taste the coffee nodes and the drink wasn't too sweet.

Unfortunately, in my friend's salad there was a hard rock mixed in there which he had bit into. We brought attention to this to the staff, and they handled the situation really well. They apologized profusely, gathered his contact information, and comped the meal. I'm giving them 5 stars because of how they handled this situation with the addition of how good the food is."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2020-03-07,1.0,"As i look up the word 'slow' from the previous reviews at least 25 pop up. Yes they are incredibly, ridiculously slow. I've never been to a bluestone that is this slow in their service. They're not mean or rude but come on. Weekend breakfast does not mean they can take 20 mins to make my coffee.

I got there a little after 9 and left after 10am. It took them 15mins to come around to me to get my coffee order. After that another 20 mins to come back asking if I'm ready to order... yes I am. Still no coffee. I put in my order and wonder if they forgot. They bring me coffee then. I was wondering if the coffee had been sitting but looking at the foam they had just made it. I waited another 20 mins for my brekkie board to arrive. All in all you need a good bit of time and patience if you want to eat here. My server (or anyone else) never came around to get my check or to see if everything came out right. I walked up to the counter to pay. I heard someone else complaining they've been waiting for their coffee for half an hour. I would've eaten sooner if I had ordered delivery instead.

Also there was this incredibly loud and annoying guy who would not stop being on the phone. Saturday 9am, can't we get some peace around here? People were leaving because of him. The space is tiny and people have to cram. He was clearly disturbing everyone else around him including me but no one bothered to speak to this dude. 

What can I say, just another saturday breakfast in nyc."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2020-02-10,2.0,"The coffee is too expensive ($4.13) for the ounces you get.  And the avocado toast is too darn expensive. 

To be completely honest, I drink coffee from one of the many coffee houses here on F street everyday; however, their coffee just isn't good.  

I would pay the high price for coffee if it was good, but it is not.  Sorry!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2020-01-12,4.0,"I adore Bluestone Lane. I have been to this location twice and also to a smaller location near Times Square. I have gotten the Brekkie Board with gluten free bread both times and it is delicious. My friend got the Vegetarian Big Brekkie and enjoyed it too. This location can get quite busy so be prepared to wait if you're there on the weekend. However, all of the servers I spoke to were great and very attentive. 
Will definitely continue to frequent this place for brunch as I am in the area most weekends!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-10-29,5.0,"Popped in here for a late breakfast on the recommendation of a friend. The cafe is very charming, with plenty of seating. It was pretty busy considering it was almost 2 o'clock. 
I ordered the Aussie iced latte, which is served with ice cream instead of cream. For food, I got the avocado toast and added a poached egg. The dish featured a large slice of sourdough bread topped with goat feta, smashed avocado, tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts, salt and pepper. I was expecting a small spread of avocado, but was pleasant surprised to find a heap instead. The poached egg was runny and topped off the toast perfectly. 
My boyfriend ordered the chicken salad sandwich with veggie chips and really enjoyed it. The veggie chips were pretty tasty.
Service was quick and friendly, not overbearing whatsoever. If I lived in NYC, this would be a place that I would come regularly!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2020-02-26,4.0,"Stopped in this morning to grab some breakfast. I came in around 10 (on a Wednesday morning) and there were seats available. I've walked past on the weekends and it is always packed. I sat at a window table and the waitress quickly greeted me. I ordered a flat white with almond milk to start. It came out quickly. I ordered the banana bread for my meal. It also came out pretty quickly. The bread was toasted, but it wasn't as dense as it hoped for. The whipped ricotta was pretty plain. I wish it had some honey or something mixed in. Also wish it came with more fruit on top. Next time, I would get the brekkie board that comes with half avocado toast and half yogurt parfait. It sounds awesome! The service was great and it is truly the cutest little cafe."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-08-22,4.0,"The avocado smash was ok. Certainly the bread reminded me of the Aussie spirit. But it was too hard for me lol. I had it with poached egg, with runny yolk, just how I like it. 

The coffee (I had flat white) was really great. Strong, full body, and creamy.

This is a nice cafe."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2020-03-16,4.0,"I like the vibe here. Something about this cafe seems French and relaxed, with the translucently colored decanters and Breton striped awnings. The tables are small, leading to more intimate gatherings- something I find cozy and enjoy. I could've had a more attentive waiter, But I will definitely be coming back to this place to try it again. I tried the hamburger with a sunny side up egg on it and it was very delicious"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-05-09,4.0,"3.5 stars, rounding up. 

The is one of those new modern West Village gems, perfect for a cup of latte, a lunch with a friend or a work from home but not at home location. The coffee and the service are the best reasons to come here. 

The cafe it self is small, but cozy, with nice window seat tables in addition to a bar seating area and now with warmer weather, al fresco dining. 

The coffee here is AMAZING. One of the best iced lattes I've had--and I drink a lot of coffee. I also recommend calorie splurging on their Aussie Iced Latte; it's like a regular latte, but instead of ice, there's ice cream & fuck yes it's worth it. 

I ordered the Green Baked Eggs--2 eggs with spinach, mushrooms, cheese, & chimichurri sauce.  This is where the stars are deducted. The slice of Balthazar's bread was great by itself but it was also necessary to cut the amount of salt in the dish. It was really hard to finish and unfortunate bc the dish  itself would've been 100 if it was just less sodium-laden. 

All the servers I noticed were so pleasant and also helpful! Everyone was smiling that genuine sincere smile of happiness. It was like buying groceries at Trader Joe's, where the politeness is so on point, sometimes I'm a bit worried if everyone is just on Valium. 

I'll definitely return if I'm in the neighborhood again."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-11-19,4.0,"I stopped in with some co-workers for a Monday morning brunch. It's bright, clean, and cute inside. It was pretty empty so we were seated immediately.

I went with a chai to start, it was cinnamony and delicious. I had the banana bread for my main course and I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was great. It was 2 slices of grilled banana bread drizzled with honey, fruit, nuts, and a delicious whipped ricotta. When I was able to get everything in one bite it was perfection! 

Pop into this is a cute little Aussie spot when you have a moment to sit down and enjoy some brunch."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-09-14,5.0,"Food : 4/5   Price: 4/5   Service: 5/5   Ambience : 5/5

Cute quaint Australian cafe with delicious and healthy food.

Avocado smash ($13) - 5/5. Delicious sourdough bread with nice crust, fresh avocado, sprinkled with cherry tomatoes and goat cheese!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-10-12,2.0,"Had lunch at Bluestone Lane Collective this past week...it was really disappointing.

Ambiance is fine. We had to wait a bit for a table and we did get one outside, which was nice. But the table was rusty and filthy, and we had to ask for it to be cleaned.

Service was not great. Staff was friendly but the restaurant was understaffed so we had to hunt someone down every time we needed something.

Food was not great either:

-Banana bread was fine tastewise (according to my husband) but it was barely two bites. Disappointing portion size.

-Breakfast bowl was bland and tasteless. I had to add salt. Lots of salt. And it still wasn't good.

-Avocado smash was fine but the bread was soggy.

Our bill was $60+ and we left hungry and rather disappointed. We won't be returning."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-08-02,5.0,One of the best breakfasts that I have had in a long time. I got the full Aussie breakfast - the bacon was so great and the avocado toast was extremely fresh. I also got an iced chai latte - the best iced chai i have ever had in my life! Get it with oat milk. The service was also great. We sat outside and it was really nice! Will definitely be returning
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2020-01-12,5.0,"I love this location of Bluestone Lane. It's very convenient and though it can get crowded, there are lots of tables (including ones that are outside when the weather is nice). The menu is great and they have a good selection of coffee and tea drinks. The service has always been good when I've been here and if you don't want to wait for a table, you can get drinks to go. Definitely a must go to if in the area!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2018-12-23,5.0,"Bluestone Lane was incredible!
I ordered a cappuccino, which was not only delicious but also beautiful!
I also ordered the rainbow bowl which was also delicious and incredibly plated. 
I enjoyed the small size of the restaurant as it contributed to a cozy atmosphere. I sat at the counter and looked out to the street, people watching from inside. 
Can't wait to return!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2020-05-17,2.0,"Just purchased the $29 Mimosa Pack and walked over to pick up only to find that the location had run out of Prosecco... When we asked for a refund, staff member said they could still provide the OJ but we declined as a mimosa without Prosecco defeats the purpose. Next time, void the order rather than accept an order that you can't fill! Definitely not the time to piss off local loyal customers...."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2020-03-04,1.0,I used to be a regular at Bluestone Lane until the SECOND time I found a short and curly human hair in my avocado toast. Absolutely disgusting and unsanitary. I suggest dining elsewhere.
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-07-13,5.0,"Went here for a late brunch on a Saturday, seated quickly on the patio after arrival. We order an iced chai (best in town) and iced latte to start, then chose the Big Brekkie and Smoked Salmon Bowl with a poached egg. Bacon was extra crispy and the poached eggs were perfect. 
The service was quick and attentive, but we also didn't feel rushed to pay the bill and leave so we were able to enjoy the patio after our meal."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-11-06,4.0,"Such a cute and quaint west village spot for healthy breakfast, lunch, coffee, or tea. Really friendly and lovely staff that makes you feel very welcomed (which was a nice surprise)! Enjoyed my bowl that I as loaded with spinach, quinoa, veggies, and I added poached eggs on top. Would have given this spot 5 stars, {forgive me for the following millennial statement, but...} their WiFi was horrible and they literally had zero electrical outlets. In order to do lunch outside of office in the city, it's kind of a must now days for cafes that charge a good amount for coffee (the second the tech improvements are made I'll definitely stop in and add the additional star). May sound ridiculous, but at least an outlet for a charger really makes the difference now days ;) 5 star service and food!!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2020-02-29,1.0,"I have been to a lot of bluestone lane locations and this was by far the worst one. The location is tiny and the staff is extremely rude. I went in for a quick latte to go today. I ordered quickly and it took them 14 minutes to make me a single latte.while I was waiting they told me to go wait outside in the cold... because I was in other people's way that were coming in.... so they made me stand outside in the freezing cold to wait ten minutes because they couldn't make a latte in a normal about of time.. if your going  to charge $5 for a tiny latte that takes 14 minutes to make at least make the customer not stand in the freezing cold. 

Disappointing."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-08-05,5.0,"Came here for brunch and actually really enjoyed it. Service was prompt and friendly. We sat outside on a summer afternoon and it was very nice, almost reminded me of being in Paris or something since the tables are just on the sidewalk. The watermelon bellinis were delicious and went down so fast. I got the avocado smash and man that's a lot of avocado. I would definitely go back again for brunch."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2018-11-22,5.0,"My fiancé and I have been fans of bluestone lane for awhile! What lured us in months ago is their Aussie iced latte (ice cream in my espresso?! Yes please!), but we stuck around because bluestone honestly just makes good coffee. In the colder months we just opt for our lattes and cappuccinos which always come out strong and smooth. Never any burnt milk with bubbles floating in the cup like some coffee shops do. 

Now I wish I could give way more than 5 stars because their customer service cannot be topped. We always frequent the midtown locations during work hours, but I wanted to do my engagement shoot at this specific location and initially reached out just for permission. I was not going to risk being kicked out of an establishment because I didn't do something as simple as asking. Nick Stone not only gave me the OK, but also connected me with Michael, the GM to ensure that my photo shoot goes off without a hitch. A huge thank you from us for the warm lattes and hot choco + a picture perfect day!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2018-12-17,3.0,"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  I really only come here if I'm in the area and don't feel like walking to go to a better brunch place.  I usually order the green baked eggs (spinach, eggs, feta cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms. chimichurri, Balthazar toast) on the brunch menu.  I really only order it because it has the most vegetables.  It's fresh, delicious, and not too heavy.  It's a bit watery (due to the spinach and the tomatoes) but if you add chili oil, it tastes really good.  As of late, it's getting harder and harder to get a table for brunch.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table at 11:30 AM which usually is not a busy time.  Also, their service has gotten super slow.  I have to wait a long time to get anything: water, check, etc.  I will have to have to come here earlier to get a table, at least they do open at 8:00 AM."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2018-11-28,5.0,Edit 11/2018: the big brekkie is also great and definitely enough for two people to share. Regular drip coffee is decent as well.
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-05-28,4.0,Not a bad place for brunch.    The food was good and the service was decent.   It seemed like everyone helps each other out because we got the feeling someone different was bringing our drinks or food every time.  Would go back
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2018-11-29,5.0,"Quick service. Their piccolo, matcha latte (that comes with almond milk), avocado smash and yogurt and granola were all delicious. Nice small intimate cafe. Highly recommend!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-05-26,5.0,Very good coffee; very nice staff; good music over their sound system and lots of outdoor tables. Expensive but quality.
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2017-12-19,5.0,"Get here early in the morning to beat the very trendy do-they-work folks, skip the tired avocado toast and order the green baked skillet eggs and the banana bread surrounded by honey, walnuts and a dollop of ricotta cheese. The eggs are cooked with tons of spinach, tomatoes, feta and a chimichurri sauce that is incredibly flavorful, while the bread is just the right amount of sweet and hearty. Even the cappuccino has a nice sprinkling of cocoa across it, making it extra-extra good. This spot really thinks about the details, and you can taste. 

5 stars!!!!!!!!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2018-03-27,4.0,"Good brunch spot, but with very limited seating. 
Food was good, but I had the golden latte (made with tumeric) which I wasn't a fan of. Towards the bottom of the cup, it was definitely gritty -- what I presume to be tumeric remains. The shashushka (baked eggs) dish and the breakfast board are the popular items here, and I can see why."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2017-11-22,5.0,"There are so many WONDERFUL things to say about this place. 

For the Location: Beautifully set in the West Village, you'll want to sit outside to people watch and just in general get a beautiful view of the city. 

For the food: I can only describe it in three words which is fresh, flavorful and light. Every option here is made with natural ingredients and you get to taste whole flavors opposed to an artificial taste. Go for the Cashew Butter toast (seriously amazing), avocado toast or go wild and get yourself the Moroccan chicken sandwich (thank me later!) 

For the Service: The staff here is so friendly, and the food comes out very quick! You won't have to worry about getting an unfriendly person serving you ! 

Overall this is a great place in terms of food, service and aesthetic for all you Instagram lovers!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2018-10-27,4.0,"Came back to Bluestone Lane to give it a second try. Once I got there I was seated immediately, service was a lot better compared to last time. Everyone was very friendly. Both me and my boyfriend ordered the BL Big Brekkie, it was really delicious, the tomato was well seasoned and roasted. The only problem I had was the vinaigrette dressing for the salad. It was way too sour and because the salad was right next to my toast, it made parts of my toast sour, which I did not enjoy. But overall we had a great experience, I would definitely recommend the BL Big Brekkie if you come here for brunch, it's very filling and super tasty. My favorite part was the chorizo and the eggs!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2018-03-10,4.0,"I stopped by completely on a whim. It was freezing outside and I wanted to find someplace warm to thaw out and grab a latte. Since I was alone I was able to get seated right away by the window. 

I decided to get something  to eat since I could be seated immediately. I had the bacon and egg sandwich with a golden latte. Great portion size -- not too big or too small. I'd say most of the dishes I saw around me we're well portioned. You walk away feeling satisfied but not uncomfortably full. 

Service was speedy and efficient despite how busy it was. I admire the waitstaff's ability to navigate in there since it's such a tight space. At first glance it looks like the only seating available is in the front facing the street. There's more seating around the corner in the back but it's still a bit cramped.

I can't fault this place for anything and will definitely return."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-04-23,4.0,"Bluestone Lane is more of a dining cafe than a coffee shop FYI. Despite my mistake, I was happy to visit this charming cafe. Service was great and staff were super friendly. I just wanted a coffee to refuel after walking around Greenwich and the staff were happy to allow me to sit and order. Design space is excellent although seating indoors near the window can be cramped."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2018-08-09,3.0,"Good coffee and summer lemonades. However they are really really slow. We ordered take away for seven people and it took them 20 minutes to get our drinks, and the shop was not even that crowded. They also forgot to bring any straws when they hand over us the coffee. Not recommended."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-02-10,5.0,"Great coffee and awesome service! 

I was just carrying cash today, in need of early morning caffeine. The host was super sweet --  reminded me they are card/Apple pay only. But the barista, Michael, graciously whipped up an amazing flat white, and told me to just come by later. THANK YOU for making a freezing day warmer!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-09-13,1.0,"I live next door to this location and I still walk two and a half blocks to get my coffee elsewhere. The service is just that bad. Amazingly, the waitstaff also serves as bouncers who bar you entry into the establishment without speaking to them first. I've actually been blocked from going through the doorway by waitstaff on multiple occasions. If it's a to-go order, expect to wait outside. I've given this place so many chances and every time I leave disappointed. They have no respect for their neighbors or for any of their customers. My favorite time of the day is after 6pm when Bluestone is CLOSED. The coffee is good, but it's not worth the hassle!"
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2017-11-30,4.0,"I was so so SO excited to find this place the last time I visited New York. I studied abroad in Australia for a few months and it was so nostalgic to find an Australian brunch place. So I HAD to go!

This place, like most Australian brunch spots, is super aesthetic, colorful, modern and sleek. One thing you must note before coming here is that the space itself is tiny, like TINY. So be prepared to squeeze through the restaurant and bump into a few people. At first I didn't know this was a chain, so that's helpful to note as well. Also, due to the small size of the resto, wait times can be a bit long. So be prepared!

My friend and I both got flat whites. I ordered an avocado toast and added bacon and a poached egg to it. I forgot what my friend ordered but we really enjoyed our meal! We were sitting really close to the parties next to us so expect that as well. Also this place is pretty pricey for brunch (welcome to NY) but it was a nice meal to splurge on. This place is a hit."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2017-10-10,4.0,"So delicious!!!

Walked in here on a Saturday morning, very busy. Waited for a table for two for about 20 min... Not that bad.

I ordered the avocado smash with a poached egg and as a drink an iced chai latte. BEST TASTING THINGS EVER. The drink was to die for. The avocado toast was very good, only complaint was that the poached egg was overcooked.

My friend ordered the half avocado toast with a poached egg and a side of a granola bowl with fruit. She claims it was very tasty but that the poached egg was overcooked as well.

Service was good, food took a little slower than usual but the food just tasted really good.

Recommend highly for brunch and definitely order the iced chai latte, it is PERFECTION."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2018-12-20,2.0,"Pros:
- Food seems pretty healthy.
- This place seems to emphasize nutrition over taste, which is refreshing.

Cons
- What I had tasted pretty bland
- They employ weird tricks to you to tip more, like defaulting to 18% without an option of 10% or 15%, and calculating tip based on the sales tax, which as far as I know is against the rules."
108,bluestone-lane-new-york-3,2019-05-20,4.0,"This was my first time eating at Bluestone Lane and it was incredible! The food was amazing and so tasty! My iced latte was also very good! I'm very picky but I was able to order what I liked and it came out delicious. The service was very nice as well! One of the waitresses was from Australian and she was so sweet! The only thing is the price, it was a lot more than I imagined for myself, but worth it. For toast with scrambled eggs, bacon, & toast with an iced latte my total was $25. But, still very good and very filling!"
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2020-02-24,5.0,"I stumbled in here after another great meal at Ssambar.  Ordered an espresso and stood at the counter talking and drinking it.  Not only was it a very delicious and well pulled shot but from the conversation, I think this place gets it, as I define that.

My shot was Columbian which often, can go badly.  This one though had a ton of nuance and none of that ""diner"" coffee flavor that many Columbian beans end up with as a result of their mistreatment.

What we talked about was the benefit of lighter roasted beans for espresso.  Not only talked about, but agreed upon.  No, no, no, charcoal coffee for me."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2020-02-29,5.0,I stopped in here for a coffee on this cold day and it was so nice and warm in here in more than one way. You can tell it's a neighborhood place with its regulars. Everyone is extremely friendly and the coffee is great to boot! So happy I decided to try it. Heartwarming experience really. Highly recommend!
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2020-02-20,4.0,"Cute spot! The food is good and the coffee is strong. Seating is a bit hard, as the benches don't have any tables so you have to either hold your food or put it on the bench which takes up space that someone else could use to sit."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2019-05-27,3.0,"Blah, nothing too exciting here. They poured too much milk in the iced latte and the espresso taste was either masked by the milk or simply was just not that flavorful.

I will not be returning for another drink."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2019-03-06,5.0,"One of our travel goals is always to sample coffee from third wave espresso venues in the new locations we travel to.  My husband is a fan of straight espresso, while I usually go for a specialty latte or a nut milk latter.  At Everyman, we were both satisfied!  We both enjoyed our drinks a good deal, and the environment could not have been more welcoming.  The name itself says it all: this espresso is for every man (they even had a sign outside that said, in giant block lettering, that they also served BLACK COFFEE).  The baristas were cheerful and welcoming, and you could tell that several of the patrons inside were regulars.  Definitely a comforting spot to pop into on a cold morning in the East Village."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-09-09,4.0,"When in NYC, you can order a cup of joe at every corner (literally). When my wife and I visit, we go on a coffee tour. We split one latte at 4-5 coffee shops in one neighborhood within a 1-2 time span. Everyman Espresso was one of the best we found in its area. Here's why:

1) Latte: They use quality beans and froth the milk making their latte very creamy. It almost doesn't need sugar.

2) Owner: Hugh Jackman owns it. Enough said.

3) Space: It's large for NYC and has plenty of seating including a bench out front. It used to be an old theater and the movie posters remain on the walls as decorations."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-04-08,5.0,"Happening to be in the area and in desperate need of coffee, I grabbed a Small Coffee and a mouth watering Cheddar Jalapeño Scone at Everyman. Coffee was superb and the Scone was packed with Cheddar with a nice kick to it; thanks to the Jalapeño!

I love the relaxed causal atmosphere and feel the name ""Everyman"" really does fit the vibe.

With countless Starbucks taking over, it's nice to have a real deal coffee shop in the area."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-06-23,4.0,"VEGAN OPTIONS - Yes. Almond and Oat milk (Oatly)

Stopped in for a cappuccino with oat milk. The drink was very well made - good foam and overall consistency. They use Counter Culture beans. The flavour of the espresso was delicious - there's barely any need for sugar. 

The alternative milk was $0.75 extra, which is a bit steep. But since the drink was made well I will come back when I'm in the area."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2019-05-10,2.0,"Coffee has a burnt taste and smell which is not my style.

Place is bright and roomie. There's 4 tables which mostly occupied but there's more bench to sit."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-07-30,4.0,"Damn good coffee.  A bit pricey, but very very smooth and rich without the bitterness.  And woohoo for oat milk!

This is a big space and comfortable, if you can find a seat, which is oftentimes doubtful.

Baristas are hit or miss when it comes to friendliness, but they sure know how to pull their shots."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-03-25,3.0,"***Decent selection, Quick service, Pricey***

There's a good amount of seating. But it's connected to a theater so there's a lot of people that come in and out. Barista was very friendly and quick to make the drink. It is a bit pricey for the amount of coffee you're getting."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2019-01-31,5.0,Coffee is amazing. Quick and friendly service. Can we dim the lights just a little bit though?
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2019-01-06,3.0,It's a nice big cafe with lots of tables. It's got a young trendy vibe. It can get crowded at times. We had lattes and they were just OK. Both lattes tasted different. There were no consistency between two cups. They don't have milk out. They ask you if you want sugar added to your latte. They use counter culture beans.
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-10-17,4.0,"I would consider this one of the best lattes I've ever had. It was just so creamy. Maybe it was an effect of my first foray into oat milk but I just thought it was super good. They also have wifi, which was randomly fast for certain things but slow for others."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-06-23,4.0,"Counter culture beans, well-made, come one come all!

Mocha I had here and then sat at the table for the next 12 hours, just cuz they're cool like that."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-11-06,4.0,"Everyman Espresso is a great alternative to the commercial coffee chains that dominate Union Square. I came here to catch up with a friend and it had all the qualities of a great coffee shop: reasonably cozy, solid coffee, lots of seating. This isn't the ""cutest"" coffee place, if that matters to you (no couches or bougie decor) however it gets the job done and is a solid go-to when you're not in the mood for Starbucks, LPQ, or Think (which, for me, is always!)

Next time, I'll try the pastries!"
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2019-04-12,1.0,"4$ for 1 espresso? They dont know anything about italian espresso...study more and less attitude! Bad experience, waste of money"
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2017-10-04,4.0,"Awesome little cafe/beer/wine spot at the front of a theater company's performance venue.  

Their chai tea had the perfect spiciness. Really enjoyed it and the general decor of the place.  They've got wifi, FYI. 

Only complaint is that they didn't have air conditioning or even fans working and it was quite warm. The doors being open was not sufficient to keep it comfy."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-02-11,2.0,"There is a theater in this coffee shop which will have you question whether you are at a coffee shop to enjoy a cup of coffee and have a good conversation with a friend or if you are sitting in the lounge of a theater. 

To me it felt like the latter. Theater was the main attraction and I felt weird sitting there with my coffee. The place was packed! The crowds of people waiting in such a tiny space left no room for personal space. The cafe was unbearably loud with baristas yelling out orders, theater staff yelling out instructions, and loud chatters among the waiting crowd. 

The cafe itself is poorly decorated with awkward seating arrangements. The drinks are over priced too($4.50 for americano and average of $4 for tea). 

I definitely wouldn't come here to meet up friends or work/study. Coffee is decent so maybe take out coffee if overpriced coffee is your thing. Sadly, there are too many other coffee shops around here with quality coffee and relaxing atmosphere to come back to this place."

Great espresso & turmeric lattes.
many dairy free milk options - the BEST oat milk ever!! 
Also sell REDD bars - baristas were super friendly and personable. 

Highly recommend."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2019-03-17,5.0,Really cute stop in East Village! I went in for a quick cappuccino and was not disappointed  It appears to be a two person operation. The service was very speedy. It's also spacious inside with a decent amount of seating.
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-07-28,4.0,"This is a nice coffee shop near Union Square, something to avoid Starbucks and the mediocre Think Coffee nearby. Great Americano and plenty of seats. Free WiFi, but no outlets unfortunately. Good place to catch up with a friend."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-04-28,4.0,"Good, but pricey, hipster coffee. Basically what it is. It fits the neighborhood and as a former NYU student, it's really convenient and close to Union Square. So if you're not looking for a Starbucks or Think, then Everyman Espresso is a good reprieve."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2017-01-07,5.0,I tried soy cappuccino and regular latte and they were pretty good. They tasted strong so I liked a lot. It looked like a small cafe from outside but it's spacious inside. I would come back here again.
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2016-11-15,3.0,"I stopped in here for a pick me up and to get some work done. I found the baristas to be nice, the espresso was solid, their wifi  was pretty good, and they have an open floor plan with a decent amount of seating (though it can fill up quickly). When in the area, I'd stop by again."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2017-02-15,5.0,"Consistently great coffee, super smooth espresso, friendly staff, but just a tad more expensive than most coffee shops.

I've had the cortado - super strong flavor, a cappuccino - super smooth and creamy, and the BEST iced americano with a splash of soy milk I've ever had. Didn't know it was possible for pure americanos to taste so chocolate-y and caramel-y!! That's when you know their espresso is A++++"
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2016-11-05,3.0,"Yes, it is very spacious inside and good for a quick cup of coffee or if you were meeting up with someone to chat. However, if you plan on bringing a laptop there to try to get some work done, I would advise you to go elsewhere. The internet was super slow. I felt like I travelled back in time to the days where people used to use dial up and had to wait for a webpage to load. Also, there are barely any plugs anywhere to charge your electronics. The coffee was okay, nothing to rave about. I wouldn't come back, unless other coffee shops around the area had no seating available."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2017-01-25,4.0,"It is definitely one of the better coffee shops in New York. I have had top notch lattes both times I have visited here. The one thing I do not love about this shop is that the baristas cap the drink for you. I usually like to take a moment to enjoy the latte art. During my first time here, the barista capped it, got confused who ordered the drink, and swung it around smearing her great artwork when she tried to figure out whose drink it was. On my second visit, I noticed the cashier was capping the drinks after the barista made them. My solution? I pre-emptively grabbed a cap and the latte. Of course, both lattes tasted great. I just needed a good picture for documentation purposes.

I was not that impressed by this coffee shop. The staff was friendly, alternative looking, and very efficient. There were four small tables with comfortable faux red leather covered chairs. There is a four seater out facing window. Lastly there is plenty of bench space along the left hand side wall. It also houses the classic stage company box office. 

I ordered an ice coffee and they added the cream for me. The cost was $3.75. The cup was generic clear plastic. The ice was regular. The coffee was nothing special. A bit bitter. Medium high acidity. Chocolate and roasted nuts were the dominant flavors. 

When it gets cold again. I will try their espresso."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2019-06-06,1.0,"It's not the coffee, although it's incredibly overpriced for Counterculture beans ... I wonder if they realize that every coffee shop in the area uses those beans. It's the service -- Not sure why, but every time I'm in there, I feel like I'm being treated differently from every white thespian that walks through the door. They are not friendly to me, and I will not be returning."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2019-06-06,5.0,"Owner is super sweet and we had a chance to meet his adorable dog. Coffee is great and there is room to stop, sit, and relax. There is a cute bench outside as well."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2017-09-06,2.0,"I had bookmarked this coffeeshop a couple of months ago, so when the opportunity presented itself, I was eager to try it out. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. 

First disappointment was walking in. It looked like an old, run-down coffeeshop. Yet there was nothing charming about it. It was lacking in character.... The benches and small stools instead of tables made my heart sink. Just looked uncomfortable, and as it was my only option, it was in fact uncomfortable. 

After glancing at the menu, my next heartbreak was the prices. No way was I going to pay $5 for a latte. Sorry. So I settled on the $2.50 drip. The first sip wasn't the best coffee I've ever had. It was very sour. I was grateful that it came in a small cup, thus being easy to finish quickly. 

My last disappointment actually irked me the most. The place was full but there were still a few seats. However, it was so loud in there. Unfortunately, I'm not talking about the customers. The barista working the shift was having a loud conversation with his buddy. So I guess the patrons had to raise their voices to be heard by their friends, resulting in a not at all relaxing environment. 

I'm sad because I really was excited to try this place. But it had absolutely no outstanding qualities. Oh wait, there's one. They have quite a few restrooms, that are clean and fully stocked."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-10-31,5.0,"Yummy black coffee, the beans are great! Good sitting, friendly staff and felt like I could stay there for hours if I wanted to."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-03-21,5.0,"Friendly baristas, delicious coffee and a calm and quiet atmosphere.

I've had their lattes and they're exceptional. The macaroons are delectable and I have to stop myself from buying more than one! 

I appreciate that the barista asks you if you want your beverage sweetened - no pretension there, well done!"
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2018-03-01,5.0,I came here a while back but will never forget the time I went. First off it's a great place cool people. I love love love the coffee. The taste the notes of my drinks were amazing. Some people say you can't taste the difference between coffee on certain places LIES. I loved the coffee over here in N.Y. I contemplated even going back to Cali ahaha. But if your ever on the other side of the country TRY IT!
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2017-10-11,5.0,"This is absolutely one of the best espresso spots in the city. Great service and a great espresso pull. Good basic coffee drinks as well, little snacks to munch on. Big plus: collocated in the same space with Classic Stage Company (CSC), one of the best smaller theatres in the city and one which I support. The owner, Sam Penix, is also an outstanding person--always looking for ways to help people and the community around him. This place gets an A++."
109,everyman-espresso-new-york,2016-05-21,5.0,"Another something-man! I have been to mad man, laughing man, and this time, Everyman!

This damn-fine (as they called themselves, fair enough) coffee shop is unlike many of its neighbors in this area, that it offers a large space to really sit down and sip their espresso, one thing I'm longing for after a morning run from the west coast. At the same time, similar to everyone else, Everyman does provide a cool setup inside the coffee shop and a well-executed shot of cappuccino! Well done!

Those donut lovers, good news! They carry the signature donuts from the renown car wash place Underwest, so no need to travel all the way. Their huge croissant also looks so attractive, have to give a try on my next visit.

Their coffee was delicious and the best part was they have oat milk to choose from. I purchased two packs of their coffee bean which came with a cup of free coffee. 

The only thing I might be hesitant to visit again is the location, it was not easy for me to get there."

I don't know why I've never noticed it before, because I've definitely parked my car on the same block a couple of times. My friend and I stopped by because it was one of the few cafes near my apartment open early on Sunday morning.

The menu is really simple, but they brew a mean cup of joe! We both ordered iced lattes, which were really delicious, but what I really enjoyed was the ambiance of the cafe. It is sparsely decorated, but thoughtfully so, and there is plenty of sitting and standing room whether you want to sit at the counter or at a table. We hung around and studied for an hour before heading off to breakfast, and it was a really enjoyable study session, given the quiet din of the other patrons and the natural sunlight! I could study here for hours!!

They also have free wifi and a bathroom available for customers, although I didn't notice any outlets available. Oh well! I'm hoping that given its discrete location, it will stay a hidden gem (MY hidden gem) for the foreseeable future! :)"

110,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-3,2015-10-14,5.0,"If only I lived closer!

I haven't been to the other locations, but I chose to come to this one based on reviews and pictures that said it was roomier. It definitely was! Tons of space, free wifi, AND not at all crowded? It's heaven for anyone who wants some quiet time to work or read! Not to mention the fact that they have great customer service and simple coffee options that they do perfectly.

I love a place that makes me feel at home, and 9th Street did just that. No stuck-up attitudes, no rush of people, and no rush to leave. I enjoyed sipping on my espresso over ice and milk for a good hour or two (I drink very slowly...) while reading. The coffee itself was great: creamy, smooth, and strong. I believe it was about $4.25, which for the size was very reasonable.

Overall, a wonderful coffee shop with everything in terms of ambience, price, and taste. I'll definitely take the time to make another trip."

But if you're looking for a simple, high quality cup of coffee or espresso, then definitely give this place a try. I just had a cup of drip coffee and it was a generous size for the price; I couldn't even finish the whole cup. The coffee was warm and smooth-tasting. I also loved that they have ""for here"" options for both hot and iced coffee so you don't have to use a plastic cup if you're going to stay anyway. The cafe has a pleasant atmosphere that's great for getting some work done. The only thing I didn't love was the chairs--they were kind of uncomfortable. I probably wouldn't come here for a super long amount of time but that's a pretty minor detail."

Located on 9th and C with a Citibike station directly across the street, Ninth Street Espresso is the ideal coffee shop. The large open windows provide plenty of natural light to work There is free wifi. There is ample seating. A four sitter street facing bench with stools. 8 two-top tables - most of which were unoccupied. There is also a counter by the service area complete with periodicals such as the New York Times.  The smooth jazz had uptempo feel that wouldn't disruptive to work or conversation. 

 I had a cappuccino ($4 cash only) to stay. The taller narrower cup was nice change of pace. There was a nice foam leaf design. The espresso was moderately bitter but gave you that caffeinated feeling. There was just enough milk to smooth out the taste."

My only criticism is that they run out of the cheese and chilli savoury pastry too fast each day. Far enough east to remain a true neighbourhood spot. Perfect coffee, made with love. Bit too much jazz sometimes, but it's just as likely to be Morrissey. Always a selection of extraordinarily handsome dogs outside. An East Village gem."

We had some time to kill before heading into Miracle on 9th Street the other week and the bouncer suggested we go there for some coffee first. I needed some caffeine to get wired up for my evening of cocktail consuming so it was a great idea.

Kind of a simple bare bones spot that is both relaxing and quiet. Good music playing at a low level. A few people were in there on computers using the wifi. Pretty damn good coffee.

Tasty ginger sugar cookies too. Because, you know, suger and caffeine for the win before the 18 drinks I was about to have."

Cost is average and quality is on par with any other coffee joint. It's a great place to study and meet with someone special. There's also a lot of natural light that bleeds through during the day time. The baristas know what they doing and are super chill. Hit it up ma peoples."

Service -3/5

You serve yourself kind of service. You take your coffee and then go. Free wifi.

110,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-3,2014-05-10,5.0,"The drinks here are pricey but so delicious! First time I came, I ordered an iced latte, which was $4.50. It's the best iced latte I have had yet - a perfect blend of espresso, milk, and ice. I have also gotten their warm latte which was also spectacular. I do tend to prefer my lattes a bit on the milkier side, so maybe the baristas at Ninth Street just get me.

Both the decor and menu are minimalistic. The coffee menu only offers brewed coffee, iced, espresso, and ""espresso with milk,"" which I'm assuming encompasses all kinds of drinks such as lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, etc. The vibe here on weekdays is really chill and quiet, great for reading, studying, or just general relaxation. I see a lot of parents come here with their young children. They do not offer wifi on the weekends however, which I'm sure is a big bummer for a lot of students in the area. Also, cash only!!"

They have bathrooms.  And free wifi.  And lots of tables and chairs.  Be careful on weekends this is a lethal combination and seating is non-existant.

Cool black Marzocco GB/5 like the other 2 locations. They get their brazilian blend (Alphabet City) from Dallis Bros in Queens/BK.  Love the black mugs with their logo and ditto on the logo on the metal storefront.  Black is in!

Love the coffee menu - you won't see macchiato, latte or flat white here.  Just 3/6/9/12 ounces.  I'm still in metric here, so have no idea what that really means.  Don't worry, small/med/large/xl or old-style macchiato/cappuccino or still understood by staff."

Cash only

They don't do any crazy syrups for coffee. They can do an iced mocha, which is what I ordered and it was delish.

The coffee itself is rich and thick, a bit nutty but so perfect.

Def must try."

They have walnut buns with raisins with a good amount of whole ingredients.  Their black sesame buns really pack in good flavor.
One star off for the big cakes.  Bought a birthday cake but felt a bit  like it was not as natural as I would like.  I like cakes made with ingredients I can pronounce.  Would like to see ingredient list.  I am pretty sure it would have stuff I can't pronounce.  I guess I will
have to stick to Whole Foods 

update:

prices have gone up and their walnut raisin bun quality gone a bit down"

Fillings sounded delicious..green tea, red bean mousse filling....strawberries..chocolate in the other.  But both cakes were tasteless.  Not too sweet, but just blah..Cake part itself was like eating air.  Waste of calories!

Like we all have learned with other things in life ...cute to look at..but should just leave it at that. :)"

The cake was larger and prettier than I expected.  There were large pieces of fruit on top (strawberries, mango, blackberries, grapes, raspberries) and inside the cake (mango).  The fruit was fresh, not canned. The cake was fresh, delicious, and light.  It was a bit pricey for a Chinatown cake ($37) but the quality was higher and the portion was larger than other Chinese bakeries.  They do provide candles and a cake cutter.  I would come back here again to buy another birthday cake.  FYI - they do take credit cards."

111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2018-04-28,4.0,"Hard to give a thorough review since all I bought were two of Audrey Bakery & Cafe's ""Healthy Buns.""


Each bun was not that large but pretty hefty.

Visually the bun looked the part of the healthy moniker being both topped and studded with items like sesame seeds, raisins, carrots, and maybe sunflower seeds.

Continuing the healthy theme, its off-brown color made me think the bun's bread was a multigrain dough. 

When cutting the bun open, the above additions are evident as slivers of carrots were embedded in the bread as were raisins and what looked to be sunflower seeds.


The bun was very tasty as the above additions added flavor and texture to each bite. 

I also enjoyed the bun's texture having a balance of crumbly and still being moist."
111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2018-02-19,4.0,"My parents ordered a beautiful rose themed, green tea cake from this bakery for a birthday. The cake was beautifully adorned with real roses and baby's breath flowers! 
The green tea cake was airy and moist with fruit in the middle and some type of small crispy ball, but most of all, it tasted fresh. The cream was mild in sweetness, creamy but not heavy in taste. I feel like the ingredients here are a lot fresher than other Chinese bakeries.  The bakery also looked cleaner and a little nicer than the other Chinatown places. 
Although we didn't try any of the bakery items or other cakes, I had the impression that this bakery is more akin to Paris Baguette (but nicer) than to your standard Chinese bakery. 
The buns were also more creative and inspiring."

My spouse and I grabbed a few items, but what stood out to me (and the reason for the 4 stars) was the custard bun. The slightly sweet fluffy white bread and the perfectly light flavor of the custard filling was just what I was hoping for. Even though I was so full from lunch, I still ate almost the entire bun by myself!"
111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2018-10-07,3.0,"Semi new bakery with some fresh takes.

I wasn't sure at first if I was supposed to be helped or I had to help myself.  I ended up just grabbing a tray myself and went at it.  The baked goods were behind 'drawers' which you pulled on to open.  You have to pull them out full otherwise the drawers would self close in you.  

There were favorites I had seen before and some interesting takes on others that made me kinda stand there a bit longer than I normally would to digest what I wanted to grab.  In the end I just went with what I thought I knew, a pineapple bun and a cold milk tea on a Monday morning. 

The bun was good, with and understated flavor.  I kinda wish it had more coconut flavor and a better filling to be honest.  It wasn't as rich as I thought it would be.

The milk tea was standard.  I wanted it a bit sweeter but otherwise it was neither better or worse than what I would get at any other bakery in the vicinity.

Service was friendly and they accept credit cards."
111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2017-11-02,4.0,"I'll preface this by saying that there is a ton of potential here and I may just not have hit all the best parts that this place has to offer. I stopped by for a breakfast bun and I saw some really intricate and new age stuff here that's just plain cool. I bought a green tea bun with a custard filling and red bean topping that I thought was going to be amazing. It was pretty good, actually. The bun was soft, the cream was sweet but not overpowering, but the beans were a bit hard. They weren't undercooked, but just not the mushier kinds you would expect in an Asian dessert or in a green tea pastry.

There were a lot of other cool innovative items I'll look to try next time. I definitely want to check out their japanese cheesecake... I've been hooked on it all year and can't get enough of it. There's also a cutesy sushi roll made of cake and some ham and egg fillings that look like an Instagrammer's dream.

Next time!"
111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2018-04-01,3.0,"This place is super cute! The staff is very friendly and they have an assortment of desserts like macaroons, birthday cakes, pudding and different types of buns and sandwiches etc. 

The cakes and desserts are very pretty but don't be fooled -- some are perfect for people who like subtle flavors. It isn't for people who have a sweet tooth. 

I ordered the Green Tea Mousse Cake which was perfect texture wise that it was creamy and smooth but doesn't have a lot of taste to it. Couldn't really taste the green tea which is a bit disappointing but some of their desserts are a hit or a miss. My sister bought a Tiramisu birthday cake once and it was pretty good so it is definitely a hit or miss at times. 

I wouldn't really recommend this place since there are a bunch of other bakeries that have better cakes and are guaranteed all the time rather than once in awhile."
111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2017-01-17,2.0,"If you're a tourist searching for the most authentic bakery in Chinatown, go anywhere else you would save yourself money. If you're a local resident looking for a quick bite, walk another block. If you're just debating between which bakery to go to, don't come here it's really nothing extraordinary, just overpriced. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not mad, they were not rude to me, I'm just saying the truth. 

The interior design of the bakery is innovative compared to most in Chinatown, NY. The place looks clean. All the pastries and cakes appear exquisite, especially the cakes. They're almost too pretty to eat. I was happy to find their milk bread, which is a soft and fluffy loaf of bread that I usually find only in Japanese bakeries. The ones in Chinese bakeries are not as fluffy. So I bought it and tried it with others. What a disappointment! We all agree that the bread was too dry and tough but not stale yet, almost there though. The texture and taste was worse than those in other bakeries but more expensive. 

I'm fond of garlic bread and cheese sticks so I bought one here. It was not good. It taste like it's been out for too long. The ones from Fay Da bakery are much better. We bought other pastries too but they all taste either similar or worse than other places. 

Overall, everything here looks good, and it's just the looks. It doesn't actually taste that good. The prices are too high for its quality. Similar are available for a better value."
111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2017-04-22,4.0,"I can only comment on the cakes here, and I really like it.  The interior is more modern compared to a lot of the other bakeries in Chinatown.  The small cakes they offer also are different and modern compared to other bakeries.

I feel like they implemented the pastry and buttercream/whipped cream in their cakes better compared to other Chinese bakeries.  You know how dry Chinese bakery cakes are like?  The cakes here are definitely a bit more richer. 

Their mousse cakes are pretty good and I found their choux tart to be quite similar to those at Paris Baguette (except there's a bit more of cake filling the middle of the tart that's underneath the pastry cream).

The green tea red bean mousse cake is very light, fragrant, and not overly sweet.  The cake had a layer of green tea that had a gelatin texture.  There's red beans embedded into the green tea cake, this can be a turn off for some people.

Overall a pretty solid choice for getting small cakes and pastries in the area.  I'm not saying they're the creme a la creme of bakeries, but they're decent."
111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2017-12-09,4.0,"I think ""Yay! I'm a fan"" pretty much sums up how I feel about this place. I came here by chance and I got a chicken sandwich and a small honey lemon tea for breakfast, total $3.75. The tea was your standard honey lemon tea, kind of hard to mess up. The chicken sandwich was really delicious. The bread was soft, chicken was tender, perfect amount of mayo, and lettuce still has crunch (there's also 2 halved tomato slices, but I hate tomatoes, so I took them out). I also saw they had caramel pudding and I was thinking of getting it, but that's not really something you eat for breakfast lol
I'll definitely come back for that sandwich and maybe some other stuff"
111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2018-08-10,3.0,"When Audrey first opened in Chinatown, I was excited. Finally, there is an Asian bakery that is not that typical and traditional HK style you normally find in the hood, not that there is anything wrong with typical/traditional HK bakeries. It's just for health conscious. Heavy lards are normally used in the dough for extra flavor, texture and aroma in those bakeries. Audrey advertised, they don't use lards. 

Their decor was a bit different, more stylish, more cafe-esque, and provided beyond pan-Asian buns/loaves (well, mostly Taiwanese/Japanese/Hong Kong styles of sweet and savory buns). They also have some European style breads that target people with more health conscious. Prices range a bit higher in the hood, but acceptable. 

It seems, recently, Audrey is making herself a bit overwhelmed for too many fusions of styles they try to offer. First, the size of their buns got noticeably smaller and was not that tasty and fresh as it once be and the presentation-wide, ugh.... Look at this sponge cake sushi roll, the nori can barely stay on the cake....(on the positive side, the mayo in the middle of the roll gone bad next day, so I guess I should take it as a good sign, as it might mean the mayo didn't have too many unwanted additives.)

Get better, Audrey. I want to return and have a tasty and presentable bun next time. I cant tell you how many times that I wanted a Japanese hand roll bread but only to be repulsed by its sloppy wrapping."
111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2017-12-31,4.0,Amazing Longevity Cake available in this bakery! Just need to place the order three hours in advance. We chose green tea and mango flavors which was fresh and light. The 8 inch cake was huge and could definitely feed about 12-14 people. Their bread and cake selection is large.
111,audrey-bakery-and-cafe-new-york-2,2016-11-02,4.0,"There are countless bakeries in Chinatown where you can pick up common Chinese pastries and cream-based, fruit-centered Birthday cakes.  However, there aren't many Chinese bakeries that are as innovative and creative like Audrey's.  They create the cutest birthday cakes with unique flavor and fruit combinations.  For instance, we recently purchased a matcha, mango cake for my father's birthday.  Not only was the cake airy and light and easy on the eye - the mango and matcha actually worked well together.  My entire family absolutely loved it, with people having seconds - including my little nephew!  Mind you, he just had a huge meal prior to the two pieces of fairly large cake.

Along with the cake, I also left the bakery with a bag full of buns to munch on for the next few days.  While some of the buns tasted like traditional Chinese pastries, none of them were in any shape or form, aesthetically or palatably the same.  They're almost ... fusion Chinese buns, with a modern twist.  I have yet to sample their drinks, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were just as amazing as their pastries and cakes."

I usually get the fish sandwich and chocolate mousse cake which is so yummy. I have tried the bread pudding but ehh really not good for me.

The chocolate mousse cake is light and goes well with coffee. I see they sell cakes because when I get on subway after work. There always seems to be riders carrying their cake boxes.. hahaha

Prior to today, I had never in my life considered eating a piece of gluten free cake. I went into your store thinking it was just a regular bakery using regular flour. I ate one of your delicious pieces of cake, seemingly savoring the gluten that I'm so used to. 

This morning, I was telling my friend how yesterday, I ate the most delicious cake in New York City from Posh Pop. She said ""It's gluten-free!"" I said ""That's impossible. It was literally the best piece of cake I've ever had in my life."" So I went to your website, and now I'm a believer in gluten-free cake. 

Posh Pop, even though I am not gluten intolerant, you are now my go-to cake place!

My husband is constantly wowed by the fact that all their goodies ARE gluten free, because he says they taste too good to be gluten free.

My personal favorites are the Twix Cheesecake (OMFG), the funfetti cookies and the Samoa cookies.  I haven't had the pleasure of visiting in person, only mailed myself and my mom delicious treats, so I really look forward to being able to visit in person and try a few in store only delectables, but I have ordered A TON of their stuff (brownies, cookies, cakes, cheesecakes and pies) and have never been disappointed.  Even super picky about his apple pie dad was blown away by the pie I sent over. 

Their shipping is LIGHTENING fast, everything is packed beautifully and holy crap it is so delicious.

So worth the money!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE Posh Pop Bakeshop!"

My items arrived approximately 3 days after I ordered, which is great. If you order over$35, the shipping is free, which is an added bonus. So far, I've tried a piece of everything and they did not disappoint. I threw them in the microwave to give them the fresh out of the oven feel. Everything was delicious!

113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-12-22,3.0,"We came here after a hard day of dragging my boyfriend shopping with me (#2020yearoftheaccessories). We walked in after a thorough yelp search to find the best pastry to accompany the tea we would later purchase.

We walked in, there wasn't a clear menu or instructions, but I perused until I found what I was looking for: birthday cake and pumpkin cinnamon rolls. We were delighted and anticipating the diabetes that would soon follow. 

We ordered and promptly found seats. Unfortunately, the cinnamon roll was not warm, which would have really elevated the dessert. Presently, it was dry, the icing was too sweet, and the dough was not well spiced. If I was blindfolded, I would have been unlikely to differentiate between a pumpkin cinnamon roll and a regular cinnamon. Was very disappointed by this. Fortunately, boyfriend had high hopes for the birthday cake, which delivered. He felt like trash afterwards, but really enjoyed eating 2 desserts in the moment. The icing was also very sweet, but that is how he likes it. The cake itself was also multilayered and very tall. Sandwiched between the layers were sheets of birthday icing. 

Overall, an average bakery for the area, I am likely to take my business elsewhere, especially because the tables were dirty and the pastry-tenders were not very helpful. Might come back because boyfriend enjoyed it."

The carrot cake needed more frosting to balance out and I couldn't figure out why the pistachio cake was salty. It didn't taste like pistachio at all. 

Don't be fooled by the looks. This place is just not up to par with other vegan/gluten free bakeries and its way overpriced."

My sister-in-law was appalled to see a rat, or some sort of animal, had ripped through the box and ate a good chunk of the cake, which she immediately threw out. 

I made multiple efforts to get in touch with Posh Pop Bakeshop -  phone calls, emails, DMs and comments on their very active Instagram. I never heard back. I ended up disputing the charge in order to get my money back.

A few days later I called on a whim and low and behind, someone answered. The man that answered seemed completely unfazed by the situation and said that he was the one who received emails and he did not see mine, but that I should resend it. He also said it was not his fault what happened in transit, it was UPS's fault. I would like to note there is no definitive proof this happened while in transit.

I forwarded my email that I had followed up on multiple times and still have not heard back. And now having seen similar reviews on Yelp stating shipping issues, it is clear that this is a reoccurring problem Posh Pop Bakeshop does not care to address. There was zero service recovery effort made by Posh Pop Bakeshop.

In NYC, an issue like this is completely understandable, but Posh Pop Bakeshop has gone out of their way to make already stressful times even more challenging. They do not care about charging for a service they cannot deliver on and they do not care about their customers."

They have a pretty wide selection of creative desserts- mini sized cheesecake squares, cookies (including cookies stuffed with other cookies such as an red velvet cookie with oreos inside) and different types of pies that are half off on Friday's. 

The cookie was delicious, however be prepared to also buy a drink because this was the richest dessert I've had in my entire life. The pie was also good, but I took a solid amount of it home with me to reheat later... it was nowhere near as good leftover.

That being said, just about anything you get at the store and eat right there in the storefront is gonna be delicious, and there's enough of a selection for just about anybody to satisfy ANY and all cravings."

113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-01-21,3.0,"I recently stopped back into the Posh Pop Bakeshop to enjoy some pastries for dessert.  Unsurprisingly, their few tables were taken, so we had to stand to eat our treats.  The first item we sampled was the Nutella-Stuffed Red Velvet Cookie, which was as gooey as one would expect from its name.  The rich gobs of hazelnut were not the sole indiscretion in the cookie; white chocolate chips further enhanced the treat with creamy decadence.  The red velvet cookie, itself, however, was extremely bland and lacked cocoa flavor.  I was not impressed.  

The Smore's Bar, on the other hand, went above and beyond what one might envision for this fireside snack.  The graham cracker crust contained a chocolate chip cookie base and a marshmallow filling.  This already indulgent bar was then topped with toasted marshmallow, drizzles of white and dark chocolate, graham cracker crumbles, and a mini Hershey's bar.   Essentially, it was a two-layer Smore.

While I had only had a bite or two of the cookie, I completely devoured my half of the Smore's Bar.  I feel like the Posh Pop Bakeshop has some clear winning desserts and others that are just average.  With that being said, I would be happy to sample as many sweets as necessary in order to make that distinction!"

I decided to have some items shipped. I ordered two orders of pop tarts and two orders of chocolate chip cookies. The chocolate chip cookies are good, a little bit too dry for my taste. Good size, and not too sweet. I was incredibly disappointed with the pop tarts. They melted during delivery, and hardened up again by the time they reached me. I didn't care much about how they looked because I didn't purchased them with the purpose of posting photos online. However, the plastic package used for each individual pop tart melted into the frosting. Because of this, I spent a long time pulling out threads from the pastry and had to investigate eat bite before eating it. It took so long and was honestly so offputting that I ended up throwing the other three away. I was so disappointed with the experience, and they were way too sweet for my liking. I contacted them, including photos, but never received a response. If you plan on ordering delivery, I highly recommend ordering nothing with frosting, marshmallows or anything else that can melt."

I tried the Oreo cookies and cream cake and the vanilla sprinkles cake, and both were slightly disappointing; the cake was dry and crumbly. The frosting was exceptionally good (maybe, a bit too sweet, though, which only worked because it balanced out how tasteless the cake was). Having cake that is not remarkably moist is common of gluten-free baked goods, so I was disappointed to see the continuation of this trend in a bakery that is entirely gluten free. 

I was very intrigued by a number of the cheesecakes (and cinnamon rolls!) that were offered, so I am looking forward to going back to give Posh Pop another chance."

We also liked the cinnamon bun. it wasn't too sweet.  I wish it had been a bit goo-ier, but otherwise it was super tasty.

113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-03-21,2.0,"We ordered delivery from here after seeing the great reviews on Yelp and their beautiful IG account. Unfortunately did not live up to expectations. 
We ordered three things: 
1. S'mores brownie - it was hard as a rock when we received it! I hate to nuke it in the microwave for almost a minute to get it soft enough to get a fork through. Brownie tasted ok once heated up. The marshmallow on top didn't taste right. 
2. Cookies and creme cheesecake - this was decent but wasn't great. It wasn't super fresh as the side of the slice had hardened and changed color a bit. 
3. Chocolate chip cookie- My husband and I were only able to bare one bite. It was very dry, chalky, and had a very odd taste. The cookie went to the garbage sadly. 

Not sure how we received such a failure of an order. We were looking forward to being regulars at this place, but that definitely won't be happening."
113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-07-02,5.0,"I'm giving this place 5 stars from the perspective of a GF bakery but would still give it a 4 even if it wasn't.  This bakery is super cute and they pack tons of options considering it's not huge.  I ordered the cookies and cream cake with a vanilla oat milk cappuccino and my partner ordered the mile high mousse.  Going in, I didn't know this place was GF so while the taste of the cake was great but the texture was a bit different and at that moment I heard someone say everything was GF so then it made sense!  Having had other GF treats before the texture was familiar.  The cappuccino was delicious and creamy, the perfect compliment to any dessert!  The mile high mousse was really good and probably my favorite between the two desserts we got.  

Customer service was great and they have ample seating so you can enjoy your desserts on the spot.  I would definitely go back!"

113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-06-20,2.0,"We were not blown away by Posh Pop Bakeshop.

We saw this adorable bakery from across the street and knew we had to try it for dessert. My girls were immediately drawn to the showcases of yummy treats. I told my older daughter that if the cakes were good, we would order one for her upcoming birthday. 

The service was great, the counter person was very friendly and patient as we made our selections. We had:

- S'mores Cake - Chocolate overload. My chocolate addicted daughter couldn't get it down, it was too rich!

- Pistachio Cake - The cake was okay if a bit dry, the frosting had almost a refrigerator taste. Not. Good.

- S'mores Cookie - It was ok, no better than Insomnia Cookie

- Girls Count Samoas Cookie - I love me some Samoas cookies, but this was way too rich. 

Unfortunately the treats looked way better than they tasted. I don't think we would come back."
113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-05-25,3.0,"Everything is so pretty here... BUT the flour used in confetti cookie is definitley bean based. Expect that bitter legume lingering taste. I think there should be a warning sign of this before you buy. Also, straws are cardboard kind so bless the environment but taste buds not so much."
113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-06-18,3.0,"One of those bakeries where it's hard to choose something as you walk inside. Large assortment of baked good with interesting takes on classic favorites.

Wanted to try a few things, so ordered everything that caught my eye:
Samoa Cookie ($6) - high end format of the girl scout favorite, heavy on the coconut and butter, not enough balance
Chocolate PB Brownie Bar ($6) - dense brownie cake with a wonderful buttercream frosting on top, good mix of peanut butter
Rich Chocolate Cake Slice ($8.50) - super intense chocolate flavor, you will absolutely need a glass of milk
Chocolate Chip Cookie ($6?) - giant sized cookie with an odd after taste. 

Prices are high but the portions are large as well (it will take a few people to finish the above). Certainly a hit-or-miss kind of spot, though worth giving a try."
113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-07-18,3.0,"When I entered this adorable place in Greenwich I was so excited.  The cookies seem as if they've been sent from fat heaven.    I should have eaten one there and while it was warm.  Instead I had a little cheesecake and my daughter a brownie.  

They were super nice but hesitant to honor my free yelp cake pop because I was due one from my check in. That bothered me but I wasn't going to fuss. Just a note to people- don't get excited, they are stingy about their Yelp offers.

Anyway, I wouldn't advise buying cookies and saving for another day.  They didn't hold up well or taste very good later- unlike other bakeries. 

However, I would love to go again on my next trip to try one warm.  Red velvet with cheesecake in the middle - yum!!!"
113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-06-09,4.0,"This is my type of place which a friend and I happened upon after having dinner in the West Village area. I instantly fell in love with the decor of pale pink roses, mirrors and bright circular lights, showcasing white, pink, green, brown cakes, cupcakes, bars, cookies, cake pops and more sweet treats! 

I tried 4 different items from this bakery: S'mores bar, cheesecake cupcake with pink frosting, s'mores cookie and chocolate peanut butter cake pop, which I got for free by checking into the shop on Yelp.

My favorite was definitely the s'mores bar, which was humongous and very thick. There was graham cracker crust with chocolate filling and melted marshmallow. On top, there were graham cracker crumbles and a piece of Hershey chocolate. I tried it both heated up and frozen. Both versions were absolutely delectable! The chocolate was rich, creamy and sweet. The marshmallow was extremely gooey and permeated each bite, which was impressive because there usually isn't enough marshmallow in desserts. The crust was tasty as well - Quite buttery and slightly crunchy, yet still soft and moist. 

After the s'mores bar, I enjoyed the cheesecake cupcake the most. It came with perfect pale pink frosting which was light and fluffy as a cloud. The cheesecake part was incredibly creamy and flavorful. The graham cracker crust was a little bit tough but paired well with the rest of the dessert.

My friend got the s'mores cookie, which was on display at the window and what initially drew us in. The cookie was a decent size, but not so large that it warranted the $6.50 price tag. I expected it to cost half that amount. I thought it tasted just okay. There were only a few swirls of marshmallow which was definitely not enough. The chocolate was warm and mouthwatering, which made it more like a chocolate chip cookie than a s'mores one.

I was disappointed by the chocolate peanut butter cake pop. There was only a small amount of peanut butter on top and the inside was completely chocolate cake. I expected there to be all peanut butter filling in the center. I guess I should have went with the lady's suggestion of cookies and cream. I wish they had a birthday cake flavor though. 

The folks were behind the counter were very friendly and nice. I would certainly come back to try other desserts from their extensive variety!"

We walked by the bakery headed to a different destination but stopped right in the front due to their welcoming lights, beautiful interior and delicious cookies out in the display. Plenty of options from cheesecakes, bars, cupcakes, cakes and even gluten free options. The creative of the bakers are on full display with many unique flavors/ideas. The aesthetic is beautiful, flower walls, pink neon signage and posters. I highly recommend for a post dinner spot by to this lovely bakeshop."

Presentation was beautiful, so much to choose from. I got the cookies n cream cake and if you check in, you get a free cake pop. Really cute place with pink flowers adorning the walls, and they have water on the side.

Cake itself was a bit dry (not sure if it's cuz it's GF) but the Oreo frosting was really good! My friend got a peach pie and that was tasty. I really wanted the s'mores cookie which sold out, so I'll come back one day to try it."
113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-12-02,3.0,"The $6 price point for a cookie a bit absurd unless it's the best the city has to offer. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. The chocolate chip cookie was indeed large, but the flavor was merely reminiscent of what I'd expect of a fantastic cookie. I hadn't thought about it until I looked online, but if the in-store cookies are as dairy free as those sold online, that probably explains it. A great option if you can't have dairy, but if you can, I'd suggest going to another spot to satisfy that chocolatey craving"

We strolled in a super hot summer day. We were in search for some new treats and this place stood out. We were greeted by Kyle & asked him to walk us through some of the best selections. He is very kind and patient . 

We finally decided on the red velvet nuetella stuffed cookie & the s'mores bar. Excellent selections. Kyle warmed the treats up making them extra gooey and that more delicious. 

If you are looking for a cute little dessert spot either to pick up and go, or for a little coffee date, make your way to Posh Pop you will not be disappointed."

My friends and I walked in on a Saturday afternoon and were immediately greeted by the cinnamon-chocolate-y aroma as well as a friendly server. I ended up purchasing a pepperoni pizza pretzel, which was made with a combination of potato and tapioca flour. This made for a very light and airy crumb, kind of like a pao de queijo."

I decided to grab a coffee and a cinnamon bun to go. The coffee was okay, nothing special. The cinnamon bun was pretty good, it wasn't overly sweet, and it was a nice texture; the frosting just made this better.
Everyone there was super friendly and patient, which is always a plus.
I will definitely come back to try some of the other items."

I just tried the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake, and it was incredible. Super moist chocolate cake, great peanut butter frosting, a perfect slice of cake. I also tried the Raspberry Lemon Tart, which was also unbelievably good and just the right amount of sweet.

Located across the street from Sweets by Chloe, this family owned shop should definitely give it a run for its money as they are making some of the best desserts around (gluten free or not). I am coming back ASAP for their cinnamon buns."
113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-10-14,2.0,"From the outside it looks really cute. The cakes look amazing but don't be fooled by the appearance. The pistachio cake didn't even taste like pistachio it was just a really plain cake. Got some berry cake, it tastes like the boxed strawberry cake you can make at home and didn't have actually berries in it. It was dry and just crumbled up when I put my fork in. Was it sitting on display for a while? For about 8 dollars a slice I'd probably just go to Lady M's or Magnolias for some cake. Honestly think I can see the dryness through the picture. Only giving two stars because the coffee was good but I can get better coffee elsewhere for less money. The latte was about 5.50."
113,posh-pop-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-02-01,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place. Let me start with the good. The folks behind the counter were super friendly and the space is absolutely adorable. The baked goods look beautiful.

But when it came to the actual food? Ehhhhhhhh. We got a twix and a slice of funfetti cake. They were both incredibly overpriced at 8/8.50 each. The cake slice was tiny compared to other places like buttercup bake shop. And the cake was so dry and tasted stale. I took two bites and threw the rest out. The twix was just okay, like okay in the sense that all things with sugar are generally palatable and so my husband actually finished it."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2019-12-28,5.0,If you want to get some good tea iced or hot for a nice stroll around the village this is the place to go. They will basically brew any tea you want for a reasonable price and the service is absolutely fantastic. When my tea was finished I longed for more.

We ended up getting the green passion fruit which had a more floral smell we were looking for. At $5/ounce, it's a pretty fair price though on the higher side."

There are loads of options and a very friendly staff to assist you with making your choices. You can buy a cup of hot or cold tea or tea to consume later. I lucked out, they had a scratch off promotion and I won a free cup of the flavored seasonal hot tea which was the flavor Sleigh Ride. It was a herbal fruity festive flavored delight with hints of cinnamon and other nutty flavor. Also be sure to check out the back of the store that often has a selection of sale items."

Customer service: 5 stars
Music: 2 stars

I stopped in for a quick cup of tea before work yesterday and loved many aspects of this place. The employee who served me was very friendly and helpful. They have an absolutely massive selection of tea--seriously, the front wall must have had like 200 teas on it. I went for the tea of the day, which was an apple cider flavored tea. It came in a monstrous cup and was only 2.75! 

My tea was interesting--it had a light apple cider flavor without the richness or sweetness of cider. Drinking it was like daydreaming about memories of drinking apple cider. I liked it but I probs wouldn't order it again because the selection is so absurdly big that it seems silly to get the same thing twice. 

My only qualm with DavidsTea is the atmosphere--their vibe was a little all over the place. It has a nice, simplistic decor, so i would expect them to play relaxing music, but when I came in around 3 on a weekday they were blasting Livin' on a Prayer at a very high volume, which made it very difficult to read the book I had brought with me. I would strongly suggest a more subdued playlist for this place. But otherwise, it was a good experience and I'd recommend giving it a try."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2016-10-16,5.0,"As a tea lover I must say, this place was heaven for me. Upon walking in, it smelled absolutely divine, I instantly felt relaxed. I have brewed DavidsTea at home before but I never been to a DavidsTea store and it was such a pleasant experience for me. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the teas. If you like a certain type of tea, they will hand select teas to your preference and they all smell amazing! It's actually really hard to make a decision on which one to get because you just want to try them all. I guarantee anyone that comes in this store will find a tea they really like.

They also have teas you can sample. I came here recently so they had teas that were cold for the summer. I'm assuming they have hot teas to try when the weather gets colder. What I love about DavidsTea is they have a lot of organic options. There's also a lot of tea gear you can get - literally anything you can think of tea related plus more! The store itself is adorable - the color theme they use for the products are bright, cheery and colorful. The store is spacious, clean and absolutely delightful.  I just want to buy everything here.. or maybe live here. I highly recommend this place for any tea lover."

She pulled down an impressive array of different types of green and herbal teas for me to smell before I ultimately made a (difficult) decision! In the end I went with The Glow, an herbal tea that was soothing, light, and yet delicately sweet at the same time. I became an instant fan! 

This place is more of a tea shop where you can grab tea and nicely packaged traveling mugs/tea-related presents to go than a sit-down cafe. There's a huge variety of every tea you can imagine-both eastern and western. It's on the pricier end but well justified I think for the quality of the tea that you get!

The workers here are super nice, knowledgeable and patient. The guy who helped me taught me so much about tea! Unfortunately, so much that I forgot a majority of it, so I'll probably be asking again on my next visit =x. Good thing they are patient people, eh*?

114,davidstea-new-york-8,2016-06-07,4.0,"DavidsTea is a premium loose-leaf tea retailer. We stopped in their West Village location during a trip to New York. I had heard good things about the tea, but I had never been to DavidsTea so one of the store employees was kind enough to show us around the store and helped us choose several teas. 

During my visit I purchased the ""Forever Nuts"" herbal tea with almonds, apples, and cinnamon. This tea smells so heavenly and was one of my favorite purchases. I am a fan of Teavana's Jasmine Dragon Phoenix Pearls so I decided to try DavidsTea ""Dragon Pearls"" green tea. This jasmine flower scented tea is one of the store's pricier teas because the tea is hand-rolled. I also purchased the ""Magic Dragon"" herbal tea with dragon fruit, apple, rosehip, hibiscus, and blackberry leaves. Another great tea!

Side note: Don't make the mistake of mentioning the store's competitor, Teavana. When the sales clerk asked if I had ever been to DavidsTea I told her ""no, but I had been to Teavana"". Wrong response. I was immediately informed that the tea at DavidsTea is all-natural and so much better than Teavana. I'm not a tea expert, but the tea looks pretty similar to me. DavidsTea does have a slightly better selection with more innovative flavors. If the tea at DavidsTea is all natural and contains no artificial flavors I am really confused why their bags state that the tea contains artificial flavors."

I usually walk over to the Upper East Side location during my lunch break and hit up the West Village location since I'm in the area all the time.  The staff is always extremely nice and helpful - especially when I ask to smell 5 different flavors each time!  

I always try to get something new and seasonal (whether it's iced or warm) and prefer it without sweetener or milk.  Bestie is obsessed with their matcha lattes (they have some many different variations of matcha).  Cotton Candy is SUPER fun, banana nut bread lattes are awesome, movie night smells magical and the Glitter & Gold sparkles... love them all!"

Yes, it goes get spurts of crowds every now and again, but everyone here is very friendly and knowledgable about the tea they sell.

The loose teas themselves are wonderful. David's Tea has everything from straightforward teas to interesting blends to higher end Japanese green teas like Gyokuro. Whatever you like and no matter what your mood is, you'll be able to find a tea for you here. And unlike other companies, they don't use hard selling tactics or overpour here. They will let you smell as many teas as you want and there always is a tea or two that they are giving samples of.

Great teas, reasonable prices, good service. Definitely worth stopping by if you are in the area or even going out of your way to try it."

Who even shops at a tea shop?"" I saw the woman offering free samples outside and randomly decided to try one. When I did, I was hooked!

The employees here are so friendly, passionate, funny, and incredibly knowledgeable. The expertise and enthusiasm is really what made me love this place. My OCD was in complete check and heaven when I saw the (possibly hundreds) of color coded canisters of flavored teas behind the register. The world just seemed right when I saw such an orderly wall! We were allowed to smell and learn about many of the teas, I saw and learned about movie night, and I was hooked. Anything with popcorn is bound to be amazing, and my ""movie night"" iced tea was no exception, excellent flavor! I cannot wait to come by and enjoy more flavors. You can get tea hot or cold, latte style, or pop/soda style where they add carbonation. 

There is so much tea gear here for make your own tea at home! I can't wait to get started, I'm hooked! Very cute interior design and vibe going on."

They have a tea menu, in which you can purchase either hot, iced, latte, teapop (carbonated), or a pot of tea; you can also purchase by the tin.  They also offer tea accessories, such as tea mugs, teapots, tea makers, kettles, frothers, spoons, etc.  The employee that helped us, Sarah, was very sweet, and she worked with us to offer her suggestions and recommendations - there were a variety of loose leaf tea that we did plenty of sniff testing of, and finally decided to try out two:  the Sleigh Ride (smelled like spices; had it in the form of an iced tea with honey as a sweetener) and the Queen of Tarts (organic; cranberry-focused; had it in a form of a teapop, unsweetened).  The Sleigh Ride was okay, but I think there was too much of the honey, as it was overly sweet; in addition, the taste of the spices were a little less than subtle.  The teapop, which sounded delicious and yummy, was also a little underwhelming; the Queen of Tarts in this form was just okay, and I don't think the sweetener would have helped.  I liked how the cups were of generous size, though; there was also some seating within as well , so you can sit down and enjoy your cup of brew.

The staff are very helpful and will make suggestions or help you find something if you were looking for something specific. They have these samples separated in the canisters so that you can see and smell them to get an idea of how they will taste. Many of them get quite expensive, especially the more unique/specialty ones, but the basics are very reasonable. They are sold in bags, which can hold any amount you wish to buy, or tins which are 3 oz. They make for good gifts, but as I said, they can get expensive because small amounts don't look like much.  Some of them had little stars or snowflakes, and the bags are opaque and sealed, so I ended up transferring the gifted ones into tiny mason jars to split them up.

They do also make tea available to buy, but it's not a cozy place. It is quite the opposite actually, sanitized, almost like an Apple store for tea. So it is an option, but I would plan on taking it to go as it doesn't appear they expect anyone to relax there for long."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2017-01-01,5.0,"Wow! We had such a wonderful experience here. Obviously, the tea is wonderful, but the customer service we received was really exceptional. The employees were super friendly, fun, and knowledgeable. Duran, Tae, and Eddie in particular were just wonderful. 

I will be back soon!"
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2012-12-09,5.0,"David's Tea is absolutely FABULOUS. New favorite study spot, deep conversation spot, peace and relaxation spot, knitting spot, reading spot - it's utterly perfect for any introverted activity.

The service is unsurpassable. My tea companion was looking for a tip jar, but there was not one to be found. Sad. :( I should've gotten the woman's name - though I'm sure I can update it when I find out, since I'll be sure to frequent David's Tea - who was so incredibly warm and helpful. We tried the tea of the day (or month?) - Mamma Mia, which was quite good. When I told her that I liked floral and nutty teas, she promptly brought out a tasteful assortment of distinctive, amazing teas for us to waft. They were all fantastic, but we were totally blown away by the Forever Nuts. 

$5 for a whole pot of transcendental tea, two rounded, simply-decorated cups in a sturdy wooden tray, generous seating, and free wifi? This is absolutely unbelievable. We ended up not studying, as we had anticipated - though I can assert that it IS possible, since we saw people on their laptops - because we were so blown away by the tea. Normally, tea is a soothing complement to pleasant conversation; in this case, this tea was so mind-blowingly good that it replaced conversation (for a while). We definitely could've just sat there and drunk tea for the whole time, relishing the unparalleled experience of sipping fantastic tea in a carefully thought-out, tranquil environment. (Fishing ball lightbulbs, pictures in frames from the perspective of lying on the grass, pastel colors ...) 

They do offer milk and sweetener (agave, I think - at least, that's what I saw on the counter), but we declined. Forever nuts really doesn't need any additional sweetener. It's this incredible blend of floral and nutty flavors, and it has a stunning garnet color (thanks to the beet root) - all natural. Absolutely wonderful. :) 

I am confused about the times though because they closed at 10pm (instead of 11pm). :/"
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2017-01-28,5.0,A very charming tea store/boutique in the west village.  Very friendly sales staff to help you either buy loose tea or just one to have right now.  So many choices and flavors.  About half of them have caffeine and the other half do not.  I think this place is perfect hence the five stars.  It is worth stopping in even if you are just shopping for a gift for someone else.  Check it out!
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2015-02-24,5.0,"I became familiar with David's tea at their UES location and fell in love - and as a result of my Christmas present to her, my roommate is now in love.

Recently I visited the West Village location. This review is for David's Tea as a whole but also for the WV location.

Ever since moving to NYC I was trying to find a good tea shop comparable to my SoFla favorite. David's Tea won me over for their diversity of tea flavors, and ability to smell the scents from their wall displays. 

David's Tea also offers many accessories, slightly overpriced but that is to be expected in a place like this- BUT they tend to offer good deals (BOGO, discount on teas, etc). 

You can get your tea hot or cold, latte, or as 'pop' (soda)..which I've never tried. 

If you're staying they serve the tea in to-stay mugs, which will always win me over. 

The staff at the UES and WV location were friendly knowledgeable and helpful. Both locations also offer cozy space of about 2-3 tables if you'd like to sit down, read a little, chat with friends.

I'm especially excited for the summertime so I can get my iced tea in their summer season flavors."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2013-03-05,4.0,"Stopped in here after I was tempted with a free sample from the girl standing outside. The staff was so friendly and asked what kind of teas I liked. Then one brought down like 8-10 different teas for me to smell. The teas were all so different and the girl who helped me was super knowledgeable and described each one to me. I ended up just getting a vanilla orchid oolong iced tea since I promised not to buy anything before I went inside but it was very difficult to resist all the amazing teas. The girl also showed me how they made the iced tea which was pretty cool.

I'm more of a coffee person than tea but the sweet and helpful staff at David's Tea absolutely sold me and I will be for sure coming back. I also got to see David himself! Nice to see that the owner is not above visiting his retail locations."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2012-07-12,5.0,"What an overwhelmingly, exciting, intoxicating, tea party. 

As I was browsing the wall of tea reading descriptions, a sweet voice started talking to me. I turned around and with a big smile, I was handed a sip of the Goji Pop tea. It made me sigh and reeled me in. 

Then I was then asked, ""do I drink coffee"". ""Why yes I do"", I replied 

She, in her yellow sundress, gold visor, and blingy jewelry, poured me a swig of Coffee Pu'erh. I immediately thought, there is no way I'm going to like this. She brought over the canister so i could take a sniff but really, I was floored at first sip. I said, ""I'll take some"" right on the spot. 

I consider boiling water cooking, so one was concerned on how one would attempt to make this tea at home. 

Que DAVIDsTEA steeper. A genius gadget for tea drinkers and especially this newb. She gave me a quick lesson and that was all that was needed. Seriously as easy as 1-2-3. And inexpensive at only $19.50 for all the tea wonders it will make.

I smelled canister after canister of tea. I was in awe as she described every single one of them with just as much excitement as the first. 

I decided on The Big Apple to enjoy while all my tea goodies were getting packaged up. I headed over to the cozy seating area and used up their free WiFi and started drafting this review.  As I sipped, I felt the homage to New York in tea form. It was the perfect tea for this experience. It enamored me just as this city does and how this tea experience did. 

Then BAM! 1,000 yelp reviews.

LaToya (she's the she I mentioned above), THANK YOU SO MUCH for a delightful afternoon tea party. Your genuine charm paired, with the exquisiteness of the tea, has made me a huge fan and a loyal customer for life."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2014-09-18,4.0,"I was in NYC this past weekend and I must say I am a fan of David's Tea ! I wish they had down in South Florida ! I really do love the loose tea's and all the creations and kinds they have came out with. I purchased Kiwi's Big Adventure, Green Seduction, Magic Dragon and Buddha's Blend. I could've bought a few more but was limited on travel space. Everything smelled so yummy and they had such a different variety than the competitor I usually buy my tea from.. 

I wanted to give a special thanks to Ryan who helped me out and had me sampling all of his favorites and tea's that also caught my eye. The tea's are great ! Ryan really put his time in to making us feel like we were the only people in the store sampling and smelling the scents/aromas of the teas. Very friendly and I can't wait to make some more purchases online ! :)"
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2016-08-26,5.0,"I was a regular here while living in NYC. The staff are among the most talented and hilarious young people I've had the pleasure of being in the presence of. They have a variety of different teas, tea cups, and tea pots. This was always a favorite study spot for me because the atmosphere was very friendly and inviting. They have a good variety of different seasonal flavors of their tea's. I highly recommend you walk in and check them out when you're cruising Bleeker Street in the West Village."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2017-01-10,5.0,Great place to get a wide variety of teas. This is my go place. Mothers helper is great to get a good night sleep and turmeric tea is great for energy.
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2017-10-19,5.0,"Wonderful store! My first time in and I wanted to try a variety of sample sizes I had written down from checking their site.  The staff was helpful and friendly, letting me smell all of the different blends and suggesting some based on what I was buying. They also steeped one that was delicious and tasted like cantaloupe."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2018-02-05,2.0,"Certain teas are great and I come here a lot. When I stopped by today, the door was locked but the staff was still inside. The people working there started shouting at me with major attitude, ""Can you NOT see?!"" Pointing to a renovation in the back (it's hard to see past the back wall with the sun glare on the windows). Not sure the attitude is necessary, considering there is zero sign/notice on the door. For equally good tea and a kinder and more knowledgeable staff, go to McNulty's a few blocks away instead."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2012-05-14,5.0,"Oooh David, you know how to make my kettle whistle. With a clean, bright, happy layout, an impressive selection of mixed teas, tons of tea making paraphenalia, and happy salesclerks, David has totally converted me. Tea here is FUN - it comes in rainbows of colors and flavors like birthday cake and love potion. The tea experience is not stuffy or pompous - it is creative and energetic! Maybe its because the company is based in Canada?

I wandererd about the store aimlessly oohing over the various cups, pitchers, and loose teas. I noted the long tables and couches in the back for reclining and the counter and stools in the front for people watching. Then I meandered back up the the rainbow counter and looked at the teas displayed on the wall in their happy canisters. I commented that I really liked ginger, could I smell the honeybush lemon ginger? The saleslady immediately jumped into to action. She pulled no less than ten canisters, gushing she looooved ginger, and I must absolutely smell each one of the teas. She showed me greens, herbals, rooibos, chocolates, and chais. She knew where they were from, the caffiene content, the flavors in the mixes, and which were better iced or hot. 

I tried a north african mint iced tea with agave. At $2.50 for a large cup, it was refreshing, affordable, and just exactly what I needed to end my evening. It also included a hint of my favorite ginger. I will have to go back eventually - there must be at least three things in the store that I want for my wedding registry and a long list of teas I have yet to sample. 

want to try:
jade oolong chai
honeybush lemon ginger
sweet ginger heat
gails cold remedy"
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2017-01-02,3.0,"I recently visited with a friend and we were looking for a place to sit down and chat that was not a bar. We found DavidsTea which was supposed to be open until 10 pm and went inside for a delicious strawberry rhubarb tea which they had brewing as a tea of the day. The clerk was very pleasant and helpful.

The store has a great variety of  loose teas for purchase and take home. Not that many varieties available for consumption on the spot.

However, after we had gotten our teas at 855 pm we sat down on a couch the manager came over and said that they would be closing at 9 pm. I told her that yelp and the companies website said that they were open to 10 pm. She then  said that the information was incorrect. 

We took our teas and left and wandered around the area in the cool air.

The tea was great, the customer service of the manager needs some work."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2016-06-06,4.0,"When the tea's good, it's really good. 

For this season - 

 The Sangria (chilled) is dead on!
Raspberry Mojito 

 & Pineapple mojito 

What happened to the last star? There are some flat-ish / off / slightly over-priced compared to other stores on the market teas, too. Many of the fruity blends smells too strong and tastes sour."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2013-10-10,3.0,"Popped in here a few times because friends are fans.

Most of the teas are flavored, and to my taste come out looking and smelling more like potpourri than anything.  They do offer several plain teas, and these seem to be of good quality, but nothing you wouldn't get at any tea shop or online.

There's a bit of seating in the back but it doesn't offer the coziness you might imagine when hearing the words ""tea shop""--the sharp white decor and tea-themed knickknacks reminded me more of something like the MoMA gift shop.

If you're a fan of flavored teas, this place may be a 5-star experience for you.  Otherwise, there's not much reason to come here.

Staff were awesome--friendly and fun to interact with."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2016-03-12,3.0,"Super cute place. The guy working the counter was great. Energetic, friendly and helpful.  He asked us what we were in mood for and made some great suggestions. Tea was delish, just I balked at paying more than $4.00 for a cup of tea.  I get it, coffee and tea places are expensive  and this ain't lipton--but still.  I'd go again. It's just money right?"
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2013-10-30,5.0,"After my first experience at this location, I was hooked. This tea shop sells mostly tea blends. They have a wide selection to choose from (green, black, rooibos, herbal, white, mate, pu'reh and oolong) their regular selection with rotating seasonal blends. My current favorite tea blend I have been obsessing over is their pistachio cream tea, which will be rotating out. There are gift sets stocked on their shelves if you need to buy a gift for someone.

In the shelves they sell tea pots, tea sets, tea tools and travel canisters. I actually purchased two of their travel timolinos. I love that the timolino has an infuser compartment inside to hold the tea I decide to brew. It can keep your tea either hot or cold for hours. Last time I took the timolino on a day trip, the tea stayed hot for over five hours. 

When visiting the store they usually have one or two samples in pitchers to try from. You can ask a staff member for help if you are unsure what to purchase. If you end up purchasing 4oz or more, you are given the option to place your tea in a canister. The canister will keep your tea fresher for a longer time period. If you would like a brewed cup of tea or pot of tea to share with friends, the staff can whip that up for you too. 

My friends and I stopped by here after dinner in the West Village. The staff were very nice to set us up with two pots of tea to drink from and chat. We enjoyed our time hanging out there that we ended up staying there till closing. We were shocked that the staff did not rush us out. They just told us to take our time. 

This is a place that my friends and I will be returning to."
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2017-06-05,5.0,"I am not a tea drinker, but was feeling a little cold coming on with a scratchy throat and itchy eyes and just happened upon David's tea on Bleecker. Such a beautiful store. I asked the manager what he would recommend for an oncoming cold and he recommended an organic peppermint amour tea and gave me a giant cup of piping hot tea ON THE HOUSE. Will go back 100 times because of that kindness! And...it made me feel better!"
114,davidstea-new-york-8,2016-09-11,5.0,"If you're reading this and you haven't been to David's Tea yet, you have to go. This company is the best. The staff is always friendly and helpful-- I swear David's has the best customer service of any company that I've ever interacted with. And in each of their stores, including this one, you can buy a cup of tea to go, or buy loose-leaf tea and accessories to take home. And the best part? It's not that expensive! Forget Teavana or other pretentious tea shops that overcharge you. David's gives you great quality loose-leaf tea at reasonable prices. 

I should add that I'm a total tea snob, and this is my favorite tea company, so that is really saying something. Now I pretty much only buy my tea from David's, and I drink about 2-3 cups of tea per day. They have every variety you could want-- black, green, oolong, herbal, mate, white, rooibos. Straight teas, flavored teas, everything. They always have samples available, and they'll let you smell each tea before you buy it, so you get a sense of what it will taste like. Not only is David's great for tea lovers, I've also found that it's the perfect way to introduce loose-leaf tea to people who don't drink tea regularly. Once I got hooked on David's, I introduced it to my boyfriend, best friend, roommate, and mom. Now everyone loves it. They also have fun sets and packages that make great gifts. You really can't go wrong here."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-03-29,5.0,"While being stuck at home and avoiding the world I could not stop thinking about Caffé Panna. My husband and I put on our masks, gloves, scarves and we drove to the city knowing that Caffé Panna was allowing us to do online orders and pickup was through a small window. Pretty much no contact!!! My husband ran to the window showed the order receipt and we were given our Delicious Nilla Grape and PBJ pint and red flag. Guy behind the window was taking all precautions. Thank you Caffé Panna for helping my family with our craving for normalcy"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-06-04,5.0,"Caffe Panna is back open! My boyfriend and I walked up and grabbed a rhubarb rye cookie pint - amazing. The mix-ins were distributed throughout the pint rather than just sitting on top, because Caffe Panna does not mess around. 

Next time: Hoping to try an affogato!"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-03-11,5.0,"Have you ever had a moment of pure and utter bliss which left you with a paralyzing joy and an ever-lasting smile? I experienced this moment with each and every spoonful of Caffe Panna!

Ice cream is my favorite dessert and so when I saw Caffe Panna's tantalizing pictures on Instagram, I knew I had to visit. They have 5 classic flavors that stay the same, but also 5 unique and rotating daily flavors, so there is always something new and exciting to try.

I ordered a single scoop and asked for 1/2 scoops of 2 flavors with Panna, an Italian whipped cream, atop ($4.75: Panna is on the house). The samples I tried were both so delicious that I could not choose just one. The 2 half scoops were actually very substantial and left me very satisfied. My friends ordered the daily affogato sundae ($10), which contains a pre-destined daily flavor, seasonal toppings, panna, and a shot of espresso. Unfortunately, I could not partake in this affogato adventure because I was sick. 

I chose the Red Flag and the Coffee Ginger Cookie. The Red Flag is a classic flavor and holds all of the flavors and decadence of a strawberry cheesecake. The base is a sweet cream icecream, decorated with strawberry swirls and graham cracker crunch. The coffee ginger cookie had candied ginger hidden in the smooth and creamy coffee base with perfectly chewy ginger cookie cubes from Citycakes! I also opted for their complementary Panna topping, which was the airiest whipped cream I have ever had; I felt like I was on Cloud 9. The Daily Affogato Sundae my friends ordered came with the Coffee Ginger Cookie flavor as well. It also had Amaro chocolate chards, candied ginger, and of course, the espresso pour-over. 

I guess all I am trying to say is... this was the best ice cream I have ever experienced in my 25 years of living. I'm already trying to plan my next visit even though it is a bit of a trek for me. Near, far, wherever you are, make sure your heart goes on.... TO CAFFE PANNA!!!"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-03-08,5.0,"Best Ice Cream in NYC.

Not only does this place have an amazing selection of ice cream, they also change their flavors every day. With these new flavors, they create an affogato sundae ($10), a daily sundae ($10), and a very special sundae ($15). Recently, they started to incorporate a lot of baked goods so, for example, you can have a cookie a la mode.

Quite frankly, there are too many unique flavors to say which one is the best. But I must emphasize, do not be afraid to try something new. You might think a flavor sounds weird or the combination wouldn't work, but I think there's a good chance you will enjoy it. Their staff is also very friendly and patient when answering questions and giving out samples.

Lastly, constantly check their social media (Instagram) to see their daily flavors. There have been rare occasions that the flavors sounded just okay to me. Not every visit will blow you away, but I guess it's a good excuse to keep trying new flavors to see what you like.

Cons: It can get crowded and there is not a lot of seating, so you might have to stand or wait a bit for spot to open up. They do run out of some flavors and baked goods, so don't expect a certain flavor to be there if you come too late.

Tips: (1) They have pints (of flavors from yesterday) in a small freezer all the way to the right next to the cashier if you missed out. Or you can get a flavor of the day in a pint for a slightly cheaper price. Not sure the exact price because I haven't purchased one yet. (2) They have sparkling water on tap, and I love having it when I'm eating a sundae to balance out the sweetness. (3) Always get panna. It's free and it's amazing."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-04-09,5.0,"I loved this place. It's a cute and cozy cafe. Nice even when it was really cold outside. Service is nice and respectful. Brandon knew a lot about the ice cream and was patient as I sampled. They put this huge dollop of panna cotta, which tasted like a really thick whipped cream, on your order. They had dairy free options too. There were also a lot of other choices on the menu, which looked really cool. Sundaes, affogato, cafe or chocolate con panna. All looked yummy! Praying that things are back to normal. This place is worth visiting again and again. A lot of customers seemed to be regulars."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-01-26,4.0,"Strolled here off of the recommendation of my friend. We took our seats at the bar and quickly decided that we were gonna go with the Affogato Sundae. As another user mentioned previously, the line does move rather slowly. I think it's because the same people who take your order and ring you up also prepare your order as well. 

Our Sundae was made pretty quickly. The barista was patient enough with us to make sure that our cameras were ready before she poured the espresso shot over our ice cream. The Affogato itself was very good. As expected with any Sundae, it's very sweet, and definitely shareable. The cafe conveniently set up water taps at the side of the bar so patrons can get their water as needed without having to flag down an employee. 

The combination of nuts, espresso, ice cream, cookie crumble and caramel drizzle was sinfully delicious. I would definitely have it again. There was a woman (who most likely was the owner or manager) going around to make sure that everyone was tended to.

I don't frequent the east side but when I do, I'll make a stop back to Cafe Panna."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-05-25,5.0,"Some of the most interesting ice cream combinations. They have great quality ice cream. I never knew that olive oil could work so well in desserts. A little bit pricy, but i would go all out and get one of their signature sundays and share between 2 people"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-01-01,4.0,"There has been so much hype surrounding this new gelateria/coffee shop and with very good reason too (shout out to @foodbabyny for being a great hype man). 

My friend and I stopped by around 8 PM and it wasn't terribly crowded - just a couple of people catching up / on their laptops but an open queue. The staff behind the counter were very friendly and knowledgeable regarding all of our questions. They were even kind enough to indulge us in all of our sample requests (the interesting flavors were too difficult to choose from blind).

We ended up choosing a cumin flavor as well as a pie flavor. The cumin was vibrant in color and bursting with flavor but was a bit strong after a while so it's best paired with another flavor to help tone it down. The pie was so yummy and we appreciated the pie chunks as well! 

Overall, the flavors are really inventive and yummy. The prices are a bit expensive - a flight of 5/6 small scoops was $20+ - so definitely bring a friend or a date to come indulge."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-01-26,5.0,"This place has been on my list for a long time, I finally checked it out with a friend, and I'm glad we did.
They have a really cool menu, which seems to change often.  My friend and I ended up getting at the Affogato to share and I'm glad we did, it was a bit too heavy for me. 
The ice cream was delicious , but it was the espresso that I loved the most. It was nice and sweet, had a great flavor to it..
The affogato had a cool cookie crumble at the bottom which was amazing! 

Definitely would like to return and try some other items."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,"The hype is real. I came to try their ice cream but will definitely be back to try their sundaes. They have 5 regular flavors they have everyday and 4 special flavors of the day. I tried 3 of these 4 flavors and wow. They were all so rich in flavor and creamy. I decided to go with the espresso hazelnut and chocolate mint cheesecake. The espresso flavor was strong and there were enough candies hazelnuts in it to balance it out well. The chocolate mint cheesecake had a cheesecake cream cheese swirl, you saw the swirl in the ice cream but the flavor was in every bite as well as the graham crunch. I got the two scoops in a cone, the cone had a subtly sweet flavor and very light and crunchy. Totally worth getting. My two scoops on a cone cost about $9, yes pricey, but I would do it again. 

They have counter seats and well a couple of small tables. I see people doing work as well as people sitting at the coffee counter and enjoying coffee. A very nice clean space. Can't wait to try their coffee as well."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-01-14,5.0,"By far my favorite ice cream in the city. I can't get enough of this place and it's unfortunately within walking distance of my apartment. I wish it wasn't and I couldn't get here easily because I'm pretty sure I've already gained a few pounds already.

The flavors here change daily and are posted on their Instagram. My favorites so far have been the red flag and lemon pound cake. I'm ashamed to say how many flavors I've tried but everything has been different shades of amazing.

If you go:
Get the waffle cone. (It is one of the better ones I've had.)
Get the cream.

You won't regret it."

I will for sure to return."

Wow.

This place has it down. Though it is sort of a newcomer to the scene, Caffe Panna is running like a well-oiled machine. With a slew of strong flavors and new specials every day, Caffe Panna will have you coming back for more and more.

Also--I like the fact that they have a 5 scoop flight here so that you can try 5 different flavors--game changer.

The only downside to this place is that they only allow guests to try 2 flavors each, so I guess I'll have to come back to try some more.

Definitely worth checking out--and if you can swing it, go for the 5 scoop flight."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-12-19,4.0,"Delicious and creamy ice cream with great service! You can check the daily flavors on their instagram account. I ended up going for the quince honey lemon tea, which was delicious, and I also tried the coffee ginger flavor which was equally good. You can try as many flavors as you want before ordering. I'd also recommend getting the panna (which is free) on top - it was a denser, less sweat whipped cream. The sundaes looked delicious, and I'll definitely be back to try one.

Surprisingly, I also found Caffè Panna to be a nice place to get some work done. There is free wifi, a few tables/ bar stools and the music isn't too loud."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-11-02,5.0,"This is what dreams are made of 


My friends are die heart fans of Caffé Panna and now I know why. 

When you walk through their door, get ready for the whole experience and ready to try every single flavor. Everyday their menu changes, with new flavors and sundaes (be sure to follow them on Instagram to keep up!)There toppings are so original, you came have your ice cream topped with salt or drizzled with olive oil. 

Their staff is also so fantastic, they love working there and giving recommendations, and they really are the kindest humans. 

Aside from ice cream, they have a coffee shop inside as well which my next visit, I'll be sure to grab a cup of Joe! 

This isn't your ordinary ice cream shop, and if you're looking for a more exotic taste, want to feel like your in a European ice cream shop then this is the place for you. 

If you're lucky, you might even run into Instagrams famous food blogger FoodBaby there!"

116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-11-03,3.0,"Hmmm, this was kinda a surprising disappointment. Got two of the daily specials - oatmeal cookie and coconut 7 layer - with the Panna and graham cracker crumble. 

The whole towering concoction was a little too candied and sweet. The Panna was actually the best part because it wasn't trying so hard, it was just sweet, fresh cream. Maybe I shoulda stuck to the standard flavors? Wouldn't come back but glad I tried it."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-11-16,5.0,"One of my friends bought me three pints of ice cream from here as a present. It was both wonderful and terrible because I finished the pints in two or three days with very little help. 
I tried three of their flavors, spookier pumpkin (pumpkin with caramel and chocolate chips), mint chocolate chip, and oatmeal cookie. Mint chocolate chip was by far my favorite of the three. It had a rich, highly creamy texture. 
I didn't think the other two were as creamy, and the pumpkin was a little bit sweet for me, but overall, both were still good. At $13 a pint, these aren't cheap, but the flavors are interesting and unique, and I will definitely be coming into the store to try."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-02-18,4.0,"Apparently this is where everyone goes at 10PM on a Sunday. I stopped by with four friends after getting drinks and some food, and this place was PACKED. No seats and not even much space to stand. 

I can't speak to most of the menu, but the two vegan flavors on offer were great. It was a chocolate sorbet (which I believe is always available) and a really cool melon one which reminded me of Japan. They didn't have cones which was sad. I also didn't realize they had drizzles and I wish I had (though 1.50 for a little sauce does seem high). 

My friends got gelato or affogato and all seemed relatively pleased. Also we were eventually able to snag seats facing out - sitting in a row is not the most conducive for conversation, but at least everyone was able to sit while eating. 

I would definitely come back if in the area and hankering for something sweet. Hopefully there'll be another vegan flavor on rotation!"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-02-23,5.0,"Caffe Panna is the hottest ice cream in town and they prove it by being consistently packed even in the winter. Their ice cream flavors all scream pick me, and with the change in variety and daily switch of flavors, it's like being back at my old college haunting grounds of Ici, which I had on speed dial to call daily and determine whether the line for ice cream was worth braving that day. 

However, like most amazing ice cream shops, their biggest issue is their success. Everyone loves them, everyone wants to try them, the IG adds to the demand to try other products, but they can only fill so many orders at a time, resulting in a fixed amount of revenue that can be achieved especially with all of the large costs such as rent, labor, and food expenses. Lines are great but if your customers are waiting 30 minutes for a scoop and paying $10 on average, $20+ if you're lucky and they buy other products, you're not gonna be selling enough. 

I recommend looking at the bagel shops. It's been so fascinating to me how the bagel shops and Dominique Ansel have all taken a closer look at the fast casual chains and have revolutionized how they sell bagels/products and really segregated out who does what and eyemarked certain areas with clear signs. I definitely feel like Caffe Panna has been trying to do that but think having cute signs could help distinguish sections and focusing more on segregation of duties. I also feel like the bottleneck is all in the tasting side where there are so many great flavors that customers want to try everything and can be very indecisive and take their time to order. Lastly, they have started selling other products but I think figuring out how to market them further so that customers buy more and increase their average spend is the key to increasing revenues."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-10-18,5.0,"Ice with espresso poured over the top  - its the future !  Actually its an Affogato and if you haven't had one then you are missing out .

Love the ice creams here and staff are very welcoming and extremely helpful.

make sure you check out the flavors of the day ."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-10-20,5.0,"Caffe panna's gotten a lot of hype since they've opened (1 month ago). I have been here about 6 times since and every time it's been excellent. 

It's run by hailie Meyer, the daughter of Danny Meyer (eg maialino). She and her team make new flavors daily, along with a handful of classic flavors that are there daily. They're inventive and she works with different bakeries, chocolatier shops, etc to create her flavors. Similar to superiority burger gelato / sorbet flavors, caffe panna's flavors don't last long so make sure you go and try them. 

The space is fairly large. The gelato is on the right and the affogato is on the left. They have a daily sundae that rotates and you can make any order into an affogato. Their home made panna is incredible and free. 

It's delicious and a great new shop that opened up near flatiron. Go and experience caffe panna!"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-01-03,4.0,"Apple spice cake was really good, definitely get it with panna. Also good affogato sundae.

Have to say I wasn't impressed with pistachio flavor :/, much better pistachio at Gentile in Williamsburg."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-09-19,5.0,"I remember how my Grandma would give me a special treat as a kid by adding a scoop of ice cream De Dulce in an espresso cup of Cafe Bustelo. So When I heard about Caffe Panna, a new ice cream parlor specializing in coffee with Italian whipped cream, (dollop of panna), ice cream, I naturally wanted to try it.

The Ice Cream Pallor is mix modern with throwback look because of wood, marble, and tiles all around with the Coffee Bar with stools on one side and the Ice cream Bar on the other side a few tables on the opposite side. I came here for the espresso with ice cream but the  Sundaes and Cones looked good too.

So I got the Affogato Sundae as recommend by the proprietor Hallie Meyer herself.  Which has the daily ice cream flavor ( Cinnamon Sour Cream ),  Praline Pecans, Salted Caramel, whipped cream and espresso. They pour the coffee on top of the ice cream when they serve you.

And OMG it was exploding with flavors, warm and cold, nutty, creamy and sweet all together. I will skip the pecans next time because I was chewing instead of slurping but anyway it was real good, it wasn't like Grandma's, but I felt like that little kid again in kitchen with my spoon in hand.

I think most people will come here for the ice cream and this is what I could make out of the menu;

Scoops sizes Tiny, Regular, Tripla, at  $3.50, $6.50 and $8.50.

Main Ice Cream, First the classic flavors

     Vanilla
     Chocolate
     Red Flag    which is a strawberrys cheesecake
     Caffe Bianco Straciatella
     Chocolate Sorbet    which is dairy-free,
  
Then the daily flavors that change like;

     PB Cornberry
     Apricot Olive Oil or was that Pistachio ?
     Cinnamon Sour Cream

The Coffee Bar;

Espress startst $3.50 to $5 for latte,  the Caffe con Panna start at $5 and can run $7 to $10 depending what you add.

    Classico    with espresso, whipped cream, ice cream
    Chocolate   with whipped cream, ice cream
    Coffee    with ice cream
    Affogato   a classic chocolate
    Affogato Sundae     with whipped cream, espresso, crunches, and a drizzle
    Affogato   with daily ice cream flavors and special toppings
    Espresso
    Macchiato
    Cortado
    Cappuccino
    Latte
    Cold or Batch Brew

Drizzle are strawberry, apricot, ginger hazelnut, sour cherry swirls
Crunches are graham crunch, chocolate hazelnut, ganache chunks, salted caramel, and graham brittle

 I think their are plans to add Biscotti with different toppings"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-09-19,5.0,"Best new ice cream shop of the year, hands down, and already one of the top spots in NYC.

I have tried the excellent ice cream at several popups/festivals over the last year or two, so it is extremely exciting to be able to get it here permanently now. It just opened today, and I just ate way too much of the ice cream, but it's a good excuse when you have it this early with coffee in one of the amazing Affogato Sundaes.

The flavors will change often, so I will always be here. Today's Hungry Ranger special is among the best that Hallie has made, but there are so many that require several repeat visits."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-10-27,4.0,"What sets Caffe Panna apart from other ice cream parlors is what it was named for: fresh panna, and custom made affogatos. 

They have a rotating menu with 5 mainstay flavors and 5 that change on the daily. You can sample as many as you like, but trust me, the Red Flag is a MUST. It's a rich flavor that reminds you of strawberry cheesecake due to its jam, graham cracker crumble, and cream cheese flavor. When you order the affogato, you can choose 2 flavors. I went with the Red Flag and good ol' vanilla, with espresso and panna. It was a delightful dessert delivering a perfect compromise between a need for an indulgence and some caffeine. 

However, the whole experience of enjoying the affogato at the bar was soured because my friend and I waited over 15 minutes to get our order. We then asked the cashier what happened. He seemed flabbergasted and asked us what we had ordered originally. When we received the affogato, we were dismayed that it didn't come in a glass like the others.

Even so, I would come back to enjoy another affogato."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,"Here by way of none other than Mike Chau aka @foodbabyny and gladly so. Panna is one reason for me to come up north of SoHo (that and Tim Ho Wan). The daily sundaes are the perfect size for splitting a small after dinner treat if you don't  want to go overboard on sugar, or absolutely a single size serving if you need it to be as well. The daily sundae was something of a spiced pear ice cream with house made cornbread, pear drizzle, and panna aka whip. Would definitely come here more often if it were near my stomping grounds."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-09-19,5.0,"Hallie Meyer's reputation precedes her, not just because of her father's epic food and hospitality empire but because her love of ice cream is well documented online via @2girls2cones. For those who have followed her ice cream adventures it must come as no surprise that she's opened her very own venture dedicated to the dessert, in a large corner space on Irving Pl and 19th st no less. 

The counter to the left is dedicated to coffee. Affogatos, espressos, and the like. I zoomed straight to the ice cream counter to the right, where I sampled the specials, olive oil peach and cinnamon sour cherry. I got a sundae with the olive oil peach, apricot drizzle, graham crumble, and a healthy dollop of panna (italian whipped cream) on top. The olive oil flavor really came out in the best way, and made the ice cream as creamy as gelato.

I also enjoyed the Caffe Bianco Stracc on a cone with almond crumble on top. The coffee flavor comes out nicely and makes me want to order it in an affogato on my next visit. The bits of stracc (chocolate) were perfectly thin and added a beautiful texture to the delicious ice cream. The cone is one of the best I've had because of how buttery, thin, and crisp it is. I can't wait for all the flavors and creations Hallie has in store."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-10-12,5.0,"Caffe Panna has been HOT on my feed and I can hardly contain my excitement knowing there is such an amazing place that is not only serving up fierce flavors but is also open late! The menu is limited to ten flavors, five of which are staple (vanilla, chocolate, chocolate sorbet, straciatella, and strawberry cheesecake) and five of which change on a daily basis. You can access their daily offerings on their Instagram page! 

I've only been twice thus far, but because of its convenient location and quality gelato, I will most likely return on a regular basis (those daily flavors are too hard to resist!) I recently had their mint cheesecake chocolate swirl with a dollop of mint-infused panna (it's apparently imported from Piedmont!) which was incredible. It had a great contrast between the cool, sweet mint and the salty, fudge-y chocolate cake bites. The crunchy element from the Oreo, the chewy cake bits, and that soft fluffy panna easily made it one of my favorite desserts of the year. 

Located on a sunny corner of Irving Pl and E 19th Street, Caffe Panna is close by Union Sq but removed enough from the hustle and bustle to feel like a nice neighborhood joint. I can't comment on their espresso menu yet but perhaps an affogato sundae might be the perfect segue way. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, so don't be shy and swing by!"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-09-19,5.0,"GELATO OF THE GODS! With sensational sorbets and affogato too is born from my formerly favorite old school Japanese Restaurant. Absolutely incredible flavors and textures here!

I mean this is pure heaven and Haillie runs a tight ship. Cute seating on one of my most favorite Manhattan corners. Mangiamo gelato. That coffee con Panna steeped in coffee with chocolate pieces with that cone. Mama Mia Grazie for this mind blowing food experience!"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,"BEST. ICE. CREAM. SHOP. IN. NYC!!!

I discovered this place a few months ago and now I'm obsessed with this place. The inside is actually very spacious and there's a lot of seating (window seating is my favorite bc I love people watching). The shop is so cozy and homey - it's a great place to catch up with a friend / friends or get some work done. All the staff are so kind and sweet and always let me try as many flavors as I'd like. Red ranger is a classic choice that's always there and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes strawberries and graham crackers. On my latest visit, I was feeling affogato-ey, so I got the affogato sundae of the day (torched s'mores affogato with a double scoop since my boyfriend and I were sharing). No words other than WOW. If you love s'mores, you'd love this flavor. The torched s'mores really comes through and the crunch gives the sundae a wonderful texture. Of course, the giant dollop of panna ties the entire thing together and wouldn't be complete without it. 

Side note: you HAVE to check out their instagram page!! I follow them and religiously check their story every day since they post daily flavors every night beforehand. It's incredible. You can just tell there's so much love that goes into the ice cream they make and the staff are just so happy to work there. It really does make the experience in person amazing!!"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-11-14,5.0,"Best ice cream. Anywhere. Period. 

Had the sundae and it had an incredible mix of flavors and textures from creamsicle to olive oil. Who thought of putting whipped cream on ice cream - genius. Tastes so good.

Owner was out near the end of the day handing out samples - for the next day. Talk about creating a dependency. Would have definitely gone back if I was still around."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-02-20,5.0,"SO glad I was finally able to stop in here this weekend! I came in around 3 on Sunday it there was a decent number of people, despite the cold. I've been meaning to try caffe Panna since they opened because of the affogados and daily rotating flavors. I was really in the mood for just a good affogado, so that's what I got. A heads up, it is a bit pricey. I paid about $7-8 for a single scoop affogado. It came with the espresso on the side (for you to pour yourself) and was topped with panna and caramel (they offered the caramel and I highly suggest!). Wow! The ice cream itself is just absolutely delicious, even just the plain sweet cream. I will be back when I see a really appealing flavor on their instagram (which happens quite a bit honestly)! Then staff was so kind and quick as well. Overall, a lovely place with top notch dessert"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-02-01,5.0,"On two occasions, Caffe Panna really, really wow'ed. And I've only been there twice.

There's just something so magical about the textures in this place. Anyone can throw some toppings or a funky drizzle and call it a new flavor. Caffe Panna also does this--better than most others, I might add--but their sauces aren't their secret sauce. It's the ice cream itself, the fundamental, the thing that has nowhere to hide.

And there's no way to explain on this page the way the first spoon of ice cream with panna (whipped? cream of some sort) feels in your mouth. The way the temperature, sweetness, flavors spreads over your tongue and mouth is just so unique and satisfying.

I've complained in other reviews about paying $6 for an ice cream, but I can say with confidence that the sundae and special sundae for $10 or $15 are both absolute STEALS at Caffe Panna. You can taste the quality and effort.

If you want to be more of an adult and not eat like a pint of ice cream, they also have affogatos and their espresso smells amazing. But I've never been an adult and I get the sundae every time. #yolo #noragrets"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-02-09,5.0,"I had been eyeing this place for awhile since it was posted on Foodbaby's ig far before it opened and was present at their food festival.  Plus it is owned by the daughter of Danny Myer and love all of his restaurants (Shake Shack and Marta to name a few).  

It is amazing how she is able to think of new sundaes daily!  Keep watch on their ig for the new sundaes and affogato specials but honestly I don't think you could go wrong with any.  I tried the sundae special which was a dulce de leche cookie crumble, oh it was so good.  The ice cream itself was so smooth.  Another time I tried the affogato, oh my gosh.  The espresso was so smooth and then on top of a mint oreo ice cream with dark chocolate in it, it was pure heaven.  I also tried the Red Flag, a strawberry, graham cracker sweet cream ice cream and the concord grape and pistachio ice cream.  I typically don't like grape flavored stuff but that grape and pistachio combo was delicious.  And absolutely loved the strawberry and graham cracker combo, almost like strawberry shortcake.  Also got the passion fruit chipper cookie, a white chocolate chip cookie infused with passion fruit.  Yes it was $6 but it was a damn good cookie.  Great texture and flavor.  

I am still deciding if this is ice cream or gelato because the place has Italian vibes and the texture seems like it is more gelato but either way this place is incredible.  And you always have to go back for their new flavors!"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-01-21,5.0,"Hey- they open at 7a from M-F! & they have pastries!!!!
Their ice cream game is excellent. (I truly adore that stracciatella)
but wait.. YOU MUST MUST MUUUUUST jump on to that pistacchio golden raisin snickerdoodle. I regret not getting two or three...
This cookie is excellent. Besides the delicious flavor - the texture of this cookie is its own dimensional journey. The outer diameter is thinner, chewy and crispy. As you get closer to the center, the dome gets taller.  The top of that dome is this thin bake of sweet butter batter that is also crispy and as you bite down you encounter this chewy delicious semi-baked batter (it's baked & safe, i'm here to tell the story) and as you push through with your teeth you encounter yet another layer of thicker & chewy crispy cookie. The fact that you encounter all these textures and levels of chewyness is a trip. This cookie is phenomenal. I'm sad i didn't get back-up cookies.  GO HUNT FOR THE COOKIE! it's a MUST. MUST."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-01-20,5.0,"One of the best ice cream shops in NYC probably. I love how they rotate their flavors and specials on a daily. The employees here are super friendly and patient with us- I was being pretty indecisive with samples. Since it was my first time here, I ended up settling with their classic red flag, which is like a vanilla (?) base with strawberry and graham crackers, topped with graham cracker brittle and of course a dollop of panna(!!!!). Their brittle was soo yummy and it was just an explosion of extra graham cracker topping. The panna is really creamy and like a fancy version of whipped cream but way better. Worth coming here in 20degree weather and can't wait to keep coming back if I'm in the area!!"
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2020-01-22,4.0,"Flavors were pretty unique and scoops were decently generous. Was also asked if we wanted to top it off with some Italian cream! Of course we said yes ;-) Kind of expensive but comparable to Morgenstern's, Van Leeuwen, etc. Nothing crazy expensive but I wouldn't call it affordable either. 

We got three scoops - Hummingbird ginger pineapple, caramel apple, and red flag. The buttery bits of graham  cracker in red flag were really good and the jam in it was a nice balance of tart and sweet. The caramel apple was exactly what you would expect, nothing mind blowing but it's pretty standard. The Hummingbird one was probably the most unique. We weren't a huge fan of the ginger bits but that's on us because we knew it was in it. The other aspects of the ice cream for us were good enough that the ginger pieces didn't bother us too much. 

All of their ice cream was very heavy milk tasting, which we loved. I mean, as opposed to some icy or less rich flavored/textured ice cream/gelato, etc. however, all of the flavors were too sweet. I find that the bits and jams were not mixed in very evenly. Otherwise would come back again!  I read that their affogato is really good so I'd want to try that next time and maybe if they have any other flavors. 

The environment felt like a hipster, clean, minimalist cafe. Something that really weirded us out was that the workers there kept sampling the ice cream. They did use new spoons for each flavor but I felt like that's something that shouldn't be done in front of customers/when the shop is open. That definitely felt unprofessional and turned us off a little. 

In short, decent flavors that are executed ok (above average but not incredible) with average NYC pricing."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-09-25,5.0,"I was hesitant coming since it only opened recently but after seeing everyone's Instagram posts, I knew I had to get there and wouldn't mind waiting on a line. I came here on a Tuesday night and only waited a few minutes! The staff was very friendly and welcoming. I really liked the interior/setup.
Affogato has always been in my top favorite desserts so I had to try the sundae. It came with mint ice cream. ($11). I also ordered it decaf since it was nighttime. Delicious! I will definitely be back for more. Next time, might try just the ice cream."
116,caffè-panna-new-york,2019-12-12,5.0,"Cafe Panna is everything I've ever wanted in an ice cream spot. It's Insanely amazing ice cream. The plain chocolate flavor is the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had. All the daily special flavors are awesome even when they sound weird. Somehow they make the goat cheese ice cream taste so much better than it sounds. The interior is spacious with a lovely minimalist design. The staff is super friendly and lets you sample as many flavors as you like. The Panna is a revelation and so much better than whipped cream. Definitely top your ice cream with it and your coffee. Artisanal ice cream chains eat your hearts out this is my new favorite spot, possibly in all of NYC."

I feel not quitting this place ya."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2020-03-07,5.0,"Such a fabulous and healthy cafe. I can easily spend hours here. Their food are all natural, legit, and are packed with superfoods, which really suits their ""smart food for a good mood"" slogan. They don't use any sugar or dairy, and all of their nut milks are homemade. And for someone who doesn't like bread, this place makes their bread properly and nutritionally dense.

FOODS:
* Smoked Salmon Avocado Toast - It was so good. I loved how they're so generous with the avocado and how they seasoned it to perfection. I would recommend.
* Mushroom Jackfruit Sandwich - I'm overly impressed with the flavor. It's 100% vegan but surprisingly it tastes amazing and the jackfruit came out having the texture and flavor of salmon. I would definitely recommend. 
* Spicy Wild Caught Tuna Wrap - It was good. I liked the spicy kick to it. 
* Wild Pole Caught Tuna Sandwich - Meh. It tasted a bit heavy and fishy for me.
* Spicy Eggplant Jerky - Surprisingly very good.

DRINKS:
* Virgin Hot Cacao - It was so good and very unique but it came with a crazy price tag that makes absolutely no sense. 
* Golden Milk Latte - I had it with cashew milk and I loved how smooth the latte was.
* Hawaj White Coffee - I was initially hesitant to order this. However I ended up being really impressed. The flavor combination of ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves came together perfectly. They also topped this drink with small dried rose petals. Highly recommended.
* Hot Cacao - It was good. Very legit.
* Hot Ginger Tea - My friend had this and said it tasted like perfume.
* Matcha Latte - I got it with cashew milk. The latte itself was meh.

Their menu is seasonal and they're also part of MealPal... but their MealPal options are usually bottled smoothies on most days and Spicy Tuna Wrap once or twice a week."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-12-16,4.0,"I got a small coffee. I'm not a heavy coffee drink so I requested that they put more milk than coffee. I was really happy that the staff member did it with a smile. 

Often the smallest request can make people upset. However, I always try to give someone a chance and these staff members definitely deserved it!"

I always get the smoked Salmon avocado toast. The toast is thin and crispy served with heaping amounts of fresh avocado and savory smoked salmon. 

You can get fresh celery juice here or a very healthy juice. This is a great spot to people watch and get a bit of work done."

We also ordered black drip coffees that were excellent as well. As someone who truly appreciates a good black coffee, Dr. Smoods did not disappoint."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2020-04-07,1.0,Apparently they blame Japanese people for the virus epidemic as indicated via a piece of paper they stuck on the front of one of their storefront doors.
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-12-06,3.0,"If you want overly vibe-branded food with a lot of vegan/vegetarian options, this is the place for you. I got the avocado toast and soup combo, and added smoked salmon to the avocado toast for an extra $2. The avocado toast was SO small. It tasted good, but I was hungry like two hours later. The $2 of smoked salmon turned out to be two measly pieces. I got the tomato soup, which was actually amazing and one of the best tomato soups I've ever had. However, it came with micro greens and croutons, which is theoretically fine, but they came in individual plastic containers. For a place that seems so health conscious, I would expect them to be environmentally conscious as well, which this is NOT. For $15, this place does not deliver on value. The whole ""choose your Smood"" thing where each menu item is categorized as a different ""Smood"" is also way too gimmicky."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-10-13,4.0,"Dr. Smood in Soho is a quaint and lovely cafe/study spot with plenty of tables and space, especially upon our arrival around 10 on a Sunday morning.  The dimly lit space and the low volume music induced an atmosphere that was very relaxing.  I'd definitely go back to work even though there were a few outlets available.

My girlfriend and I stayed for a few hours, enjoying some of their signature smoothies.  I got the Acai ""Bowl"" 2 Go, which was a pleasant combination of creamy and fruity, while she got an avocado toast (basic) and a Blueberry Majik, which was small and healthy/oaty, respectively.  The drinks were presented with paper straws, giving an eco-friendly vibe.  The only issue I have is that the items are a tad overpriced (~$34 for all 3 items).

The demographic varied greatly throughout the time we were there, exhibiting a welcoming environment for all customers.  Overall, I'd give this place a 4.2/5, but it rounds to 4 (because math and Yelp only believes in whole numbers).  I look forward to returning!"
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-03-16,5.0,"Absolutely fabulous cafe! Love their concept of driving towards eating healthy and making superfoods your heroes! Also I really liked the vibe in the cafe, you could easily spend your afternoon there relaxing with friends or studying or working. 

Their food is as great too! We had their smoothies. The chocolate and the blueberry which were amazing! The chocolate tasted like chocolate milkshake without the guilty ingredients or sugar. Definitely a must try. The blueberry was also great! Had a prominent taste of the maca protein or hemp protein but I really like that taste. 

Also I like their concept of foods based on your moods. That is something new which I always dig! All in all an awesome place and I am infact going there again!!"
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-07-16,4.0,"Dr. Smood makes those too-rare smoothies that are legit tasty, but that you can kind of tell that you're having a healthy item, and not a dessert couched in the faux-health shell smoothie that is overly sweet or laden with crap. I mean, if I'm going to go in this direction, I want something actually healthy, and to save the desserts for dessert, right?

I've tried both the Green Protein (homemade almond milk, maca, plant protein powder, banana, avocado, kale, spinach, raw honey) and the Blueberry Majik (coconut milk, wild blueberry, lucuma, blue majik, sprouted buckwheat, date)--both were hearty and delicious and much more filling than your average smoothie--kept me filled about as long as a normal meal, and/or fueled for the gym. 

They also have good coffee and interesting sounding breakfast/lunch options. Staff is friendly, and it's a pretty big and comfy spot for the area (with free WiFi), so not a bad spot to plop down and rest or work for a bit either. They are a bit pricey--and credit only, which still massively, irrationally pisses me off, but hopefully someday soon legislation will rectify this."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2018-12-17,2.0,"This place has no kitchen so everything is pre made and refrigerated. Tried the avocado toast which was not great, the toast they use for it is odd. Cappuccino is  not great either. 

Update/Response:

Not sure why you saying ""...everything in the refrigerator is freshly made and delivered to our stores daily."" Needs to be corrected as it is exactly what I said. Everything other than a few items are pre made and refrigerated. The few items available are not what one would expect from the descriptions provided.

It is great that the bread is made of spelt flour and white millet flakes, but being that its not mentioned in the item description, you don't expect to get a cracker like bread that tastes bland. I wasn't comparing the bread to a ""soft and doughy"" bread just not what we received. 

Is the oatmeal you have on the menu made freshly to order too? Because I also ordered that and it literally tasted like microwave oatmeal which I'm not sure how else it would be prepared without a kitchen. 

I don't know how else I can explain the cappuccino other than it tasted like burned milk. I actually ordered two and they both tasted the same. 

I was just giving my honest feed back on my experience as I do with all the places I visit. 

Thank you."

There was only one person before me. The 2 people behind the counter consisted of the rude women taking care of the person in front of me at a very slow pace, and another staring into space.  I only ordered 2 large coffees with almond milk, they even got one wrong and had to fix it.  Won't go there again."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-09-27,5.0,"I had just gottten some gelato but then passed by this place and immediately became curious. I ordered the Hawaj Shake with an espresso shot and oh my was it good! It had some very interesting ingredients that included cashews, coconut oil, hawaj blend, and lucuma among others. The whipped cream probably did not add positively to the health factor but who cares.

I sat in the back in a very comfortable chair where I could just lounge and enjoy my shake after a tiring walk in the city. The only unfortunate thing was that it killed my appetite the rest of the day and I had made dinner reservations for that evening. On the flipside it makes for a great potential weight loss option."

They have multiple locations around the city and is a great place to grab a quick healthy lunch when you're on the go. I LOVE the vegan sandwich, the hummus is absolutely insane. It's so creamy and fresh and an excellent topping for the delicious sandwich. They have tons of options, from bowls to smoothies. I first found this magical spot in Miami and have been so happy to be able to try it in NYC! Enjoy! Xo"
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-06-10,4.0,"This place is a great place to hangout. The environment is good. Nice furniture & and food amount of seating. Youve got to do a little walking to find a good spot to sit and relax in this area. the staff is friendly too

But I have to say that I was a little disappointed bu their salmon sandwich. It wasn't terrible but I felt like is wasn't worth 15 bucks. 

the juice good though. I got a grapefruit juice.Seems like their selection of drinks was good. 

This is a good place to come and chill."

First walked in after an event where I just wanted something to eat Got the turkey in made with the ciabatta roll made with spelt and millet. As advertised it didn't make me hungry like regular wheat bread. Returned for brunch and had a crumble with chia hemp almond better and blueberry colius.  Delicious and surprisingly filling
My wife had a kale salad and was happy as well. I am knew to the health food scene and I suggest this place if you'd like to try this type of food"

Hawaj White coffee and the Golden Mylk are great choices as well! Kale works salad and Cashew kale salad delicious."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2018-03-19,2.0,"I had the chance to visit the Dr Smood location in Soho this last weekend as a place where my friends and I could catch up after a few weeks of not hanging out. I walked in hoping for a decent experience given the last time I was at their location in midtown, but left disappointed, confused, and literally with a bitter taste in my mouth.

I walked in around 5:30 PM on a Sunday evening and my friend had snagged a high top booth for us four near the entrance. After arriving my friend and I decided to order before the rest of our group arrived. We probably waited at the counter for about 10 minutes, with no one in front of us, until one of the baristas came up and asked us if we had ordered yet. We said no and he asked us what we liked. 

I asked for a regular drip coffee, to which he replied that they didn't have any currently brewing. I asked why that would be, especially if they didn't close for another two hours. He stated that it's because towards the end of the day they just don't brew it out of convenience. I found this surprising because almost every coffee shop I've been too will still serve coffee until the last minute their open, as a courteousness to their customers, not to their staff.

We went back to our seats after ordering and then inquired about sugar they had. As a forewarning, Dr. Smood prizes itself with being EXTREMELY organic. They do not serve any of their beverages with dairy and do not have pre-packages sugars of any kind. Instead we were left to use a coconut extract syrup that, to be honest, practically left our drinks to be undrinkable.

Also, several table tops noticeably had left over cups and trash that was not cleaned up for the entirety of time we were there. I'm not sure if the staff just didn't realize or if they didn't care. Regardless it made for a pretty poor experience in my mind. I'd highly suggest going to a different coffee shop if you're in the Soho area."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-06-21,1.0,"This place is a disgrace. I was there this afternoon enjoying my overpriced smoothie when out of nowhere this crazy woman started a fight with the man at the table next to her.
She claimed to be part owner of the place and in front of her kids and all the customers she was in this mans fave cursing like a crazy person on drugs.
She kept saying how rich she was and how she can get this man to leave 

I was Amazed at this behavior from this classless woman and to top it all off she did this in front of her kids.
Her husband just sat there and did nothing.

Finally the manager came over and didn't even listen to the man who was minding his own business before this verbal attack from the so called part owner
This place is a disgrace and I put in a call to my contacts at the post and sent them the video and the pictures I took of this crazy woman attacking this man.
Unreal experience"
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2018-11-04,5.0,"As someone who has some food intolerances, it was really nice to find a place that listed every ingredient and allergen in their foods. This was a very hip and pretty place near where my sister and I stayed while in NYC and we visited it probably three times. 

I was ecstatic when I saw that Dr Smood had a raw, unbaked cinnamon roll because I was upset to learn Rockin' Raw Vegan had closed, and with it, the best unbaked cinnamon rolls I'd ever eaten. I was hoping for a good replacement, but unfortunately Dr Smood's raw cinnamon roll was just okay. So. The search continues.

That said, we tried a number of coffees, smoothies, and chia pudding, and even avocado toast on flat bread. All were great. It's a bit expensive, but considering everything's organic and where they're situated, I guess that's to be expected."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-10-06,5.0,"LOVE Dr Smood!!   I go to the one on Madison Ave as its near my office and wish there was one where I live.  
The food is so good and so good for you.  its nice to have healthy options in NYC.   You can get a juice depending on what you're body needs.  All quality ingredients that heal your body.  The toasts are delicious and made from wholesome bread.  The soups and salads are great too.  I can't get enough.  I would give it 10 stars if I could!

please open one on the upper west side. Better than Joe and the Juice!!"
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-03-02,5.0,"Dragged my butt out on a snow day but the comfy seats and wide tables was worth changing my ~study~ environment. The place was a bit noisy around noon but overall the music and noise level wasn't that bad i.e. I was able to work without being distracted. Ordered the almond milk latte and cold turkey sandwich. Both were great! 

One caveat for those who need to charge their electronics is that the only outlets are located near the high chair areas."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2017-10-03,4.0,"If I could afford it, I'd probably spend the rest of my existence drinking lattes/smoothies and gnawing on veggie jerkies from Dr Smood's. Unfortunately, that's not the case and I'm definitely not looking or willing to shell out $10+ each time, nearing $20 for the grand total. All of their caffeinated drinks use house made mylk (mainly cashew) and when blended with the matcha latte, creates a silky and earthy bliss that wouldn't be attainable with regular milk. It comes unsweetened, yay! The eggplant jerky is egg-cellent but a bag alone costs $7.95 for probably 2 (or less) eggplants, sliced and dried. 

So everyone, pray for me to win the lottery so I can buy lots and lots of eggplant jerky. I'm kidding but really, splurge and try a bag at least ONCE in your lifetime.

On another note, I absolutely love the sitting area here. It's spacious and adorned with luxe couch/ accent chairs. Though seating is limited, it's definitely a prime spot for interviews/outside meetings if you're able to grab a table!"
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-11-02,5.0,"Good matcha latte (I had it with cashew milk). Also could be a good place to study and work in theory but there are next to no outlets so once my laptop died, I had to leave because there was nowhere to charge."

I was in a cruddy mood due to getting over an ear infection and couldn't hear well. I misheard the woman behind the register and thought she was waving me away when she was actually trying to ring me up sooner. Never mind the logistics, the point is I realized - after the fact - what had transpired and was impressed that she was so nice and professional even when I was being a butt head."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2020-01-10,4.0,Premium cafe with great customer service. Looked very new and trendy. I ordered a smoothie which really tasted good and fresh. Only had a pastry since I was in the area for a short time. Better than your standard Starbucks.

I work in soho, so I went to this location today and had another good experience. My cashew milk latte was made quickly, as well as my avocado toast to go! The coffee cup this time was a little misshapen, and the barista noticed and immediately gave me a new cup. Great service!"
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2020-02-03,4.0,Loved the strawberry shake! I think it's one of the healthiest I've ever tried. I also ordered the butternut squash soup and it was delightful.
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2018-04-14,2.0,"Cool interior, really meh coffee. Not worth the high price.

They don't use dairy milk. Only vegan milks like cashew which is salty for coffees. Latte was salty and bleh. Matcha was bitter and salty. Had to add a lot of syrup.
Overall good place to escape the crowds and heat but not for coffee.
Friendly enough though"

If you're looking to spend your money on sub-par offerings and a truly hostile environment, then I urge you to try this place. 

The owner was literally yelling at a paying customer using racial slurs and harsh-ing my mellow to say the least. She must've forgotten to take her lithium. Not what I want to ever encounter whilst in public, let alone while eating.

There are ample places to get your healthy soul glow on; this isn't one of those places. Keep looking and you will be glad you did. 
Bad vibes only here."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2018-10-22,5.0,"A trendy cafe with sandwiches, plenty of seating, and coffee, a great place to meet a friend.

FOOD: as a carnivore meeting a vegan friend here for a quick midday bite, we each found a sandwich to like here. I enjoyed the cold turkey sandwich (turkey, avocado, tomato, and pesto) which ironically is served warm, on a light toasty bread.

DRINKS: the coffees here looked great, but I enjoyed a iced black tea that was superb.

SEATING: despite a small exterior, there's plenty of room inside to sit and chat. It's a little too dark to get a lot of reading done, but perfect for catching up with an old friend."

117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2018-03-30,3.0,"This is where I had the most expensive cup of coffee I have ever had in my life. I got the white coffee, and while it was excellent with clearly quality ingredients, the price of over $6 for a 6 oz cup of coffee is a bit much. The seating area is very nice, with roomy tables and comfortable seats, but the tables are terribly dirty. I moved from one table to another, and both tables required me to clean it up before sitting. At one point, a staff person came by to clean up, but instead of cleaning the table, all he did was pick up a crumpled napkin off the table. There was still a lot of quinoa that could use cleaning! Or how about wiping down the tables, or at least offering to? While my coffee tasted excellent, I just cannot justify coming here again (except maybe to squat and work, since at this price, I think I've earned unlimited time at whatever seat I choose!).

Note: storefront is on Greene street, not Broome."
117,dr-smood-soho-organic-cafe-new-york-3,2019-07-01,5.0,This place is clean and really nice. Atmosphere is great and retailers are pleasant. Their juices are awesome.

118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2020-02-05,5.0,Best coffee in lower Manhattan! I am far too addicted to the draft oat milk latte. The perfect mix oof sweetness. I will struggle to make it to work without. Shouts outs to Owen for being the best barista!!
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-10,5.0,"My husband and I were staying in the financial district and I cannot tell you my delight when I realized that our hotel was a few mere blocks from a La Colombe. I haven't been able to have their coffee on a regular basis since living in Philadelphia. Sure I get the cans of draft latte at Wegmans and brew Corsica at home but nothing beats a draft latte straight from the tap. 

We walked down to La Colombe on a nice crisp fall weekend morning and I must say I was impressed by how well the small space was laid out. We were able to get in get our drinks and a pastry and snag a seat in the corner and enjoy the moment before heading out for the day. The whole time we did not feel rushed to leave like I sometimes do it a small cafe with limited seating. The coffee was high quality like I know to expect from this brand and the space was kept clean.

I wish I could say I would be back but in reality I don't go down to NYC very often."
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2019-08-02,5.0,"I fell in love with La Colombe Coffee since I first tasted them in my Midtown days! They are my top one, favorite coffee thus far! This place is the only place that I am willing to drink a latte - I'm normally a black coffee girl! Now, the coffee is not cheap here but you get real quality here so it's worth the splurge time to time.

Today I got the Iced Oat Milk Latte. They use Oatly oat milk which is also my favorite oat milk brand too! Perfect coffee paired with perfect oat milk, I am soooo in love! The way I would describe how it tastes like is oatmeal with coffee. For my lactose intolerance friends like myself, we can finally enjoy real good lattes here!"
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2019-03-30,4.0,"La Colombe is a very popular premium coffee shop, as you will quickly see from the long lines during peak hours. I have been a customer for years and during warmer weather, my go to drink is their draft latte which is creamy, delicious and refreshing. It's so good I usually scarf it down in a matter of minutes.

On my latest visit, the weather was cold so I decided to try their hot oat milk latte for a change. The drink was beautifully presented with latte art (a heart on top). The drink was hot, creamy and just the right strength. The oat milk also had a much milder after taste that other milk substitutes. I typically don't like to order most milk substitutes in hot drink because I don't generally like the after taste they have when steamed. The oat milk is a better option.

The downsides of La Colombe is the long line during peak hours, premium prices, and the lack of seating in their store. This is a grab and go place and not a good option if you are looking for a place to sit down and enjoy coffee with friends or do some work."
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-05,5.0,"I'll be honest, I love the drinks they make here. Anything that has espresso in it seems to come out world-class. There can be a line depending on the time of the day, but I've never regretted waiting. Seriously, give it a shot."

An iced oat latte is my go to drink, and La Colombe does it best. Gets packed in here in the mornings during the work rush, but the line moves very fast. Also love their ginger turmeric tea, and the baked goods! Try the vegan hemp scone or any of the croissants."
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2020-01-29,5.0,This coffee is delicious! This review is solely for coffee since my friend/coworker stops in the morning to get it for us. The hype is real. The coffee is smooth and flavorful and with the addition of sugar it's just right. She raves about this place all the time so I definitely have to make a trip. If you're in the area I'd definitely make a trip. It is on the pricey side so be aware but very worth it.
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2019-09-02,4.0,"Open virtually every day (open on Labor Day so I assume 365 is up for play). Draft lattes are fantastically creamy and quick to go. Cold and oat or regular so healthy options surely available for all drinks and milk styles. Negatives are no free WiFi from what I could tel, no sugar free flavors, and lack of seating. This place is a quick in and out type of coffee shop right near Wall Street. No lingering allowed and service is quick and diligent. Exactly what you want from a morning coffee shop."

A bit pricey at about $6 for the latte but well worth it for the experience. There was a HUGE line around the cafe and I can see why...

I will definitely stop by La Colombe again. Just. Too. Delicious. Wow.

Although I didn't try, the pastries also looked like a huge hit. 
If you're in a rush, this might not be the place to go. But I thought the line went relatively quickly and our lattes took about 5 min to actually make."

I came in the evening around 6 on a Saturday and the place was moderately busy. It had a cozy give inside and I was so happy to see brew on tap, although I went with a mocha since it was chilly outside.

Drinks were made quick and ready to go when cashier informed me she could not break a $100 dollar bill. I explained I had just finished a run and was not carrying my wallet. It was not like I was spending $3 dollars. Cashier rudely informed me there was nothing she could do. Tossed $20 dollars in coffee rather than cash a big bill. I suggested a sign and she said I was the only person to come in with a large bill. Great coffee it's a shame your staff at this location is so bad.

Here is where it goes wrong for me...I am a coffee snob, but I can't resist, well roasted beans, warm cup in the morning, so with that being written, I sure did not mind paying $3 for a small, black when it's right that is.  However, after going to La Colombe 5 days a week for over two months, is it too much to ask of the staff to get my order right? It's just small black, after all. Time to break up."

118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2017-12-26,4.0,"This place has very good coffee. So much so, the line usually it just about out the door and that's after it does a loop in the store.
They have a nice ""Coffee Bar"" but not much space to sit, when there is a long line.
They did however skip my coffee a few times and I got my coffee way after others who came in after me on line, so they lose some browny points for that."
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2018-09-26,5.0,"Pro: Superiror quality coffee

Neutral: definitely on the pricier end (but worth it)
Neutral: lines are usually very long but do move fast

Con: Almost no place to sit if you wanna stay there and drink your coffee


Overall definitely a 5-star rating"

Cute atmosphere and almond croissant and cappuccino delicious"
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2018-09-03,2.0,Nope.. over hyped. Neither the drink nor the food is worth praise or price.its right in financial district and it's a chic interior. Other than that no no. They don't have flavored lattes. I saw reviews of hazelnut latte. Then what was the? Anyways she couldn't explain me draft latte either. She said it's espresso and milk. Then what's normal latte? The croissant was dry and big. I have had chocolate croissants everywhere but never had to dig through whole croissant to taste the chocolate. Not worth the money. I'm not a drip coffee person so can't speak on that. I want flavor with a kick.. not there...total waste of money..
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2019-02-24,5.0,Come here with my fiance for the delicious iced oat milk latte. So so tasty and such a distinctive creamy taste. Complimentary sparkling water available. Pets not allowed.
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2019-04-05,5.0,"Oatmilk draft latte is mind blowing. Thank god for La Colombe because good readily accessible coffee is hard to come by. It is pricey but well worth it. The long lines are a bit frustrating when you want to do a grab and go, but luckily the oatmeal draft latte comes from tap so it's fast once you put your order in."

118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2017-01-31,5.0,"La Colombe has a tony feel similar to the expensive residences that line this area of Wall Street.  

The long cream colored marbled counter is perfect for drinking your espresso standing up Italian style.   The space is minimal with the only available seating being a long simple wood bench against the wall. 

The artist Arturo DiModica who did the Bull sculpture nearby supposedly has coffee here every morning.

Did you know that the charging Bill sculpture was originally a guerilla art installation?   He just set the sculpture up and now it's a permanent fixture there.  

After you drink your coffee standing up, and maybe have a fun exchange with some rich young stock market worker go check the bull out with all the tourists. 

Coffee pours are well prepared and they offer a few pastries too.  This place isn't open late but expect heavy traffic in the morning and around late afternoon when everyone's looking for a pick me up."
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2018-11-05,5.0,The coffee here will really jump start your day. The black and tan is typically my order and it's perfect every time! The lines are typically long but the staff is great at handling it! Overall a great location!
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2019-07-15,5.0,the staff is so nice. this coffee is freaking amazing. this will be my go to coffee place on my way to the ferry to the beaches. there is lines so make time for that. the line goes fast though.
118,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-3,2018-03-09,5.0,"Some of my favorite coffee I have had in the USA.
Their latte with oat milk was perfectly made, silky smooth, and the perfect temperature.

On a freezing NYC day, the coffee was like a nectar of the gods. 
The smoothness, and strength of the coffee was memorable, and I went back every day on my visit.

Doing some research, I realize they actually have some locations in LA, so now I can go get my fix locally. 
They definitely made a fan out of me at Colombe. I highly recommend them if you are looking for that coffee fix."

1. Something that tastes straight out of a home kitchen
2. Need something quick 
3. Want something healthy

Then THIS is your place. I've tried 3 things from here and all amazing (but some more bang for your buck). I've come here to grab dinner on a few occasions and based on those experiences, am recapping my memory.

1. Grandma's Chicken and Rice (10/10)- This was hearty, wholesome, and healthy. This truly tasted like something a grandma would make for their grandkids after school/dinner. It's clean (in the sense of not oily), and leaves you feeling perfect full.

2. Beef Chili Bowl (11/10!!!)- HOLY CRAP. I don't eat chili often, but on a cold day, I was craving this. and BOY WILL I NEVER GET CHILI ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. Their chili was absolutely divine. It was decadent, thick, and put me in a food coma afterwards (in the best way possible). I didn't feel ""heavy"" or like I needed a run after to burn it off. One thing that I cannot stop thinking about though, was the sweet potatoes that it came with. Now, I don't know if I got lucky that this batch of roasted sweet potato, but they were out of this world. It was so sweet, I couldn't believe it. I tried to look really closely to see if there was sugar on it because it legit tasted like candy sweet potato. COME AND GET THIS (so that it can stay on the menu for the next time I visit NYC). Please and thanks.

3. Chicken Zoodle Soup (8/10)- Sooooo this was great, but it is not a meal. More like a light snack. For the price, I would honestly have just gotten the chicken soup and then found myself some pasta of some sort to eat with it. But for the price of this, I'd DEFINITELY pay a few more bucks to get a bowl.

Ugh, I love this place so much."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2020-03-08,5.0,"This is my absolute favorite spot in the neighborhood. They serve the tastiest healthy food I've ever had. Seriously! Love you guys! The staff is always super warm and welcoming. 

They have the best avo toast - def get the egg! Their broths can be mixed with some of the bowls to make a hearty soup. But the broth and bowls are amazing on their own. 

When I'm not feeling my best their immunity broth has bought me back to life. Delivery is always speedy and although they get a bit crowded at lunch time it's worth the wait. 

If you're health conscious, into broths, and are ever in the neighborhood don't pass them up!"
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2020-03-02,5.0,"I WISH WE HAD ONE OF THESE IN LOS ANGELES! Love going to a place where it's easy to find good, real food that's tasty, too! Will want to try other things when I'm back in the city.

New Roots Bone Broth: I'm getting over an illness, so thought this would be a great way to help refresh my gut and system. The ginger is a little on the strong side (which I don't mind, but might deter others). So delicious and warming, especially on a chilly NYC day. Tip: they have a $30 reusable traveler that will save you $1 off your broth every time you bring it back. It's super cute and definitely worth it if you come often.

Mushroom Bolognese: Note to self--broth makes you fulllll... haha I already knew that, but alas, my eyes were bigger than my stomach on today's visit. Felt bad tossing a chunk of this, but it was really delicious with a smidge of heat. The mushrooms don't really overpower the flavor profile, rather, it serves more as a texture substitute for meat. I have a hate love relationship with zoodles. They often end up making the dish pretty wet, but the sauce really helped detract from that in this dish.

Free wifi and really warm inside, so a great place to stoop for a bit and get some work done."

119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2020-03-09,5.0,"Springbone Kitchen is filled to the brim with NYU undergrads and grad students at lunch - and I understand why. While I am simply a resident of the area, I think this is one of the best spots for a healthy bite to eat (because of the crowds, however, don't expect it to be super quick). Grandma's chicken and rice bowl is incredibly delicious and filling. I LOVE how you can make substitutions as well - I had the choice of swapping rice with dressed greens, sweet potatoes, cauliflower rice, etc. I went with the dressed greens and the meal was satiating and yummy. I tried the mushroom bolognese as well, which I didn't like as much as Grandma's. I would love for the website to have nutrition information on the meals - I'd like to know what exactly is in the sauce and how many carbs it is.

But that was until I saw the price of the bowl - just $13 - for what turned out to be this delicious assortment of tender, fresh chicken, beans, yummy rice, and creamy guacamole. 

Grabbed it and ate with my dog Gerbert on a bench in Washington Square. Livin' the dream! 

5 stars!!!!!"
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-11-22,3.0,"Pretty good..but think it's really overpriced for a cup of broth.

Buuut I know it takes a while to make broth - so, it may just not be for me.

I didn't try the other food products though.

This place is more of a grab and go, as there is limited seating."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-10-14,3.0,"Great concept mediocre execution! The hot sauce may be my favorite thing about this quick bites place. I also loved the paleo, healthy options. That said the business seems to struggle with disorganization. They were out of all buns for their burgers when we visited. So, we went with lettuce wraps and moved on with our lives. But then, we ordered food to stay and they packed it to go. Additionally they got the order wrong. The employees seemed confused and overwhelmed and it wasn't all that busy. It all worked out in the end and the food was good. I'd go again when I'm in the area but likely not seek it out."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-11-16,5.0,"Been to springbone a few times, and it never disappoints. I've had the fungi and grandmas chicken and rice, which come with a small side of bone broth. Both were so delicious!! 

Just note that there is limited seating so it's better for takeout or for a casual meal with a friend."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-02-04,3.0,"Love their broth, glad something like this finally opened up. I always drink broth at home as a pick me up when I'm hungry or feeling under the weather so having this is ultra convenient for NYU students. I got some food for the first time, I'd rate that alone 3 stars but considering it's freshness, locally sourced ingredients, & the 5star broth I opted for a 4 star. The spaghetti bolognese was a little bland & they didn't drain the zucchini enough so it was a bit of a watery mess, maybe better to eat in store and not to-go. I also got the side of sweet potato which was good but tiny for $5.
Highly recommend this place for broth, coffee or other healthy snacks. I appreciate the effort to make healthy food so will try it again."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-02-28,4.0,"Cold Wednesday night, stopped by this convenient place located near Washington Square Park. Bright interior with a large menu to the side for some quick healthy meal options.

Wasn't all that hungry, so settled on the medium Spicy Vegan Broth ($8). A warm mixture of mushroom broth, garlic, turmeric, and hot sauce served in what looks like a coffee cup. Easy to drink, as the hot sauce gave it a nice kick after each sip.

Solid choices for actual meals as well; probably best for a healthy lunch."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-12-12,5.0,"My favorite spot for broth!! I try to incorporate ""gut healing foods"" especially when the temperatures drop. Bone broth/broth in general always makes me feel  SO much better after i drink it. Springbone Kitchen has an awesome menu, and filled with gluten free options. 
I usually opt for the Grandma's Chicken and Rice Bowl (free range chicken, spanish bone broth rice, cabbage + Brussels sprouts) and  the classic chicken broth butttt if i feel like i'm coming down with something i'll get the  Immunity Broth with ginger, garlic, and vitamin C. Sometimes i'll add in collagen to my broth also! 
Springbone has an awesome variety of different add-ins/options such as hot sauce, lemon wedge, kimchi, rice, etc...
If you don't want rice in your bowl you can get quinoa or sweet potatoes (or even get those as sides). 
I really like Springbone Kitchen as they're definitely more ""health"" focused, but also go back to the basics. Growing up my mom ALWAYS made me drink bone broth/soups during the winter season saying it was super healthy for me, and only recently has bone broth been given a moment in the sun. 
Read up on the benefits and definitely try it!"
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2018-10-30,3.0,"Broth - that is what you get here. Especially if you've made some questionable decisions about food and drink before coming to Springbone. For those who prefer to chew their food, like me, there is an extended menu with other options. 

Pretty pricey food on that menu, but hey, it's sourced locally and the ingredients just taste so CLEAN. Feed me all the paleo food you got and I am a happy girl. I got the beef chilli bowl, which had a lot of quinoa and a decent amount of ground up beef. It was really tasty; the sweet potato complemented the ingredients so well. But the portions you get here are disappointing for the price, so keep that in mind when coming here.  

Tried the Mexican Bowl, and that was great. Tons of black beans, rice, and guac. The broth it comes with (on the side in a sample cup) was delicious! Now that I trust these people, I know I'm coming back for that! 

They were sadly out of the mushroom tea, so I got a plain herbal tea. It was alright, pretty simple, tasted like hot water. 

Love that they're open relatively late for the area and that their staff is pretty friendly. Their lack of space and a bathroom are whack, so just keep those in mind before stopping in. There's just a counter space and a picnic table, with there being seats for about 7-8 people. It's tight so don't come here for intimate conversations. Keep it casual, NYU students!

Suggestion: add calorie and protein counts to your menus. You'll attract so many more diners!"
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-04-23,5.0,"Wow, delicious is an understatement. 

Stopped by here on a Saturday night, had the liquid gold broth and the Mexican bowl, EXACTLY what my body needed. The quality of the chicken was incredible. One of the most soul satisfying and clean meals I've had in a while. 

Wish I could get the bone broth shipped out to Portland by the gallon! So incredible."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-04-04,4.0,"Ive been doing the Keto diet for about 7 months now and finding restaurants to eat at can be a pain. I scrubbed through Yelp to find this gem. Which is geared towards Paleo and a nod to Keto.

They also have a small section that sells various paleo/low carb friendly snacks

I ordered the Burger on paleo bun it was very yummy, couldve done with a little more seasoning but it sufficed. I got the riced cauliflower which def could use more seasoning. 

The broths were amazeballs! If you are Keto/Paleo this is a good spot to check out."

119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2020-01-07,3.0,I love that it's GF. I wish it had less fast food though. I wish it was all organic as well. Their selections are quick and easy though not as scrumptious as I was hoping. A step above Chloe.
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2018-02-04,2.0,"This review comes from someone who doesn't really understand the paleo or keto diets. So I probably was not the target audience of their meals.

I came inside Springbone Kitchen, not for the healthy alternatives to the most commonly eaten foods, but because I liked the way the place looked from the outside.

We gave our order to an absent-minded guy who only after ordering remembered that they were out of Spaghetti and Meatballs. After another failed attempt at ordering Grandma's chicken and rice (turns out they run out of dishes a lot), we finally settled on the Mexican bowl.

The Mexican bowl came with the blandest chicken I've ever had at a restaurant. I get that the chicken is free-range, but it would have continued to be free-range if only they have seasoned it. The wild rice tasted like they scraped the bottom of the pot and scooped the burnt ends (maybe they were running out of wild rice too?) to reach that concoction of hard rice with no flavor whatsoever. The beans were not seasoned (surprise!) and although they did a good job with the guac (don't know how you'd mess up guac anyway), there was just not enough of it to salvage that dish."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-07-27,4.0,Absolutely delicious gluten free and vegan modern options just 2 minutes from Washington square park! I got the Mexican bowl and it was super satisfying. The place is full of fun little cook books to read while you enjoy your bowl/coffee/smoothie/broth/pho! Only downside was a bit of disorganization as we waited longer than we should have to get our meal - don't know if that was just a problem that day but it didn't take away from the tasty meal! Would recommend.
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2018-12-13,3.0,"First time here and I must say I'm glad I found them for my Keto coffee and bone broth. Unfortunately on my second visit,  just about 30mins ago...the experience wasn't up to par.

Here's what's in the coffee:
Ghee: check
MCT oil: Check
Brewed Coffee: Check
Coffee grounds: Check..... err is that supposed to be there?? It's funny but I'm sure you get the picture (see below)"
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2018-09-12,5.0,"It makes me very happy to see Paleo/clean cooking places in the city.
Personally I can't stomach bone broth, but I have had many friends and family members who have seen great success with it. It basically saves lives! This place does not disappoint in their selection of bone broth.  If you can stomach it, go here and you won't be disappointed!
They also don't use canola oil which is great. Canola oil is a huge no-no on anyone's list who is eating clean, keto, etc. So always a positive! 
I had a simple breakfast (eggs & bacon) when I came with my friend on a Saturday morning and she had the caesar salad and both were amazing! 
They have a cute little section where you can buy ghee butter, dark chocolates, etc. The staff is friendly and helpful. 
I feel like I will be visiting shortly!"

 Everything's delicious!
First of all, the broths are legit. Those are amazing rich bone broths that will be you feel better instantly. 
The zucchini spaghetti with meatballs is my favorite dish. It comes with beef broth and its satisfying yet not heavy. Highly recommended! 
I also love the burrito bowl which come with chicken and chicken broth. This is by far the best burrito bowl ive ever had - the beans, the wild rice, the chicken, the salsa, the guacamole- everything is high quality and absolutely delicious.  
Highly recommended!"

Cute fast casual place near Washington Square Park and West 4th Street.  Cafe vibe inside with some seating.  The staff is friendly.  Cashless, no bathroom.  Wholesome food, sourced ethically, priced relative for the neighborhood.

I've had the chicken bone broth, sampled the beef broth as well as enjoyed grandma's chicken, the beef chili and the beef Bolognese.  

The food is balanced with vegetables and quite filling.  I found the Bolognese to be quite runny and the chicken in the grandma's chicken rice bowl to be dry.  Often times the Brussel sprouts aren't cooked long enough."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-02-06,5.0,"I'm obsessed with this broth place. Every time I'm in the area I get one. Highly recommend the classic chicken and classic beef broth. My favorite is the umami (they add mushroom and a pat of butter to the beef broth). So incredible.

It's on the pricy side ($10 for medium / $11-ish for large). 

Also do watch out. I burn my tongue every time cause I'm so eager to drink."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-01-21,5.0,"Woohoo! As good as it gets!  to quote Yelp when they provide a 5 star review. Honestly I have not stopped thinking about Springbone Kitchen since I stumbled in one day.  
Even if you are a virgin bone broth drinker, this spot will satisfy your desires. There are a variety of flavors to order  and they will let you sample as well.  Big respect to the founders that they added real quality food to the menu in addition to the broth, therefore if a broth friend wants to dine with a friend who likes eating full food they can! 

I went with the Liquid Gold, Kimchi Broth, and the Grandma's Chicken & Rice.  Talk about something that warms your heart and your gut.  Flavorful and delicious I was happy with both. I had one of the broths while dining in and one as a roadie.  You can taste the good-ness in the quality and I wish everyone had the opportunity to experience this restaurant quality.

Grandma's Chicken & Rice ($11.50) - Organic wild rice, free-range chicken, roasted carrots, brussels sprouts, organic braised kale, citrus-beet puree, Tango Chile sauce and side of chicken bone broth. I subbed the wild rice with their turmeric cauliflower rice for $1. The portions were a bit small given the price. The broth on the other hand, was average.

I want to give this place five stars but the service could really use some work!

The service can be really erratic. My orders are often wrong and with few people in the front, wait times or pick up times can be longer than they need to be. Also, the serving sizes vary a lot. 

There are several great great people working there, but on average, it can be frustrating to get your food.

I bought a frozen tub of the chicken broth to-go, but I was disappointed when I reheated it at home. It had a very weird taste and I couldn't even finish it. I'll stick with the beef flavor next time! That one's available in a frozen to-go variety, as well.

The beef broth here is on par with Brodo, but for a much more affordable price."

119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2018-12-17,4.0,"Super late with my review as I tried this spot back in October - but I had a craving again and it crossed my mind!

This spot saved me during my first round of Whole30 - I was tired of cooking every single meal and simply wanted some compliant takeout that someone else prepared for me. I've always been curious about Springbone because I love soups and broth! I googled Whole30 friendly spots in NYC and found an article on a food blog that mentioned Springbone. I'm subtracting a star for two reasons - one reason is it IS a tad on the pricier side and also because I asked the woman working that evening to confirm the dish I ordered was Whole30 compliant and she had no idea what I was talking about. I thought that was a little odd given this is known as a paleo friendly place. I tried inquiring about the ingredients as much as I could but got nowhere.

That being said - the food and broth are DELICIOUS! The broth was so good I still remember the flavor and have many times debated going back to get a broth instead of a coffee or snack if I was in the area! I ordered the Grandma's Chicken and Rice with cauliflower rice - wow, can these people properly prepare cauli rice! It tasted like regular rice, something I have not mastered yet. The chicken was also delicious and the various different flavors blended together quite well with a bit of a surprise here and there! I loved it!

Super excited that one of my health-conscious friends moved to the city and wants to check this spot out for lunch next week - and further excited that I start round 2 of Whole30 on January 2nd so I have an excuse to go back!"

The last 3-4 times we ordered, the food took forever, arrived cold, and certainly not fresh - over or under cooked rice, sides mis-portio, meat ice cold, etc.  Not exaggerating, every single time.  They used to come piping hot and delicious!  Now it seems more thrown together.  Imagine it's a symptom of their popularity.  Shame, because they were our go-to takeout.  Portions also decreased, which for a $30+ dinner, isn't acceptable."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2018-08-02,4.0,"This place was decent. I got the Mexican bowl and replaced cauliflower rice. I'd say it was a little pricey, but the bowl was tasty. The chicken tasted really yummy. The broth that came with it was very delicious as well. The staff was very kind and quick."
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2018-07-25,4.0,"The specialty here is the bone broths, but there are plenty of other clean options at this health food spot. I had the ""spaghetti"" bolognese made with zucchini noodles and was very pleasantly surprised. I think I may have even enjoyed the zoodles more than I would actual pasta! The whole dish was so comforting: I could definitely see myself eating this on a cold day. The spaghetti came with a side of beef bone broth that just wasn't my cup of tea. Sorry Springbone, I don't think I'll be hopping on the broth train anytime soon... but the zoodles were great!"
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2019-09-10,5.0,Picked up a bowl through the Food for All app here near closing time and it was delicious! Lots of food for the cheap price - including a piping hot broth shot.
119,springbone-kitchen-new-york,2018-04-28,4.0,"Springbone kitchen is a cool, super healthy spot near NYU. 

Some things I really love about it--
1)Sells so many of my favorite products, collagen, bars, ghee, coconut cult, dairy free ice cream and more!
2) They have a wide range of broths, breakfast, lunch and dinner options. 
3) They accommodate all food allergies and preferences. 

Things that have made my experience less than 100
1) It's quite small in here. The staff does an amazing job of serving quickly but it can easily feel super super crowded in here. 
2) The last two times I was in here the meals I've gotten have been a strange mix of hot and cold. Rachel's lamb and tabouleh has hot meatballs and cold tabouleh underneath. I guess that's expected but I found it hard to eat. I think I would have preferred everything to be either hot or cold. The other dish this happened with was the burger. The burger was hot but the caramelized mushrooms on top were cold somehow which again threw me off. 

The meat in both of these dishes was cooked superbly and the flavors all over were unreal but the hot/cold is strange to me. 

Still highly recommend this spot, especially for any of the broths!"
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2020-01-13,4.0,"Adorable bakery that is something like Instagram-famous. If you're hoping to take cute pics here, I would suggest not going on your day marked ""dressed down."" It was raining when we went and I was bare-faced in a ball cap and Darth Vader t-shirt and you know what, the pics are still decent and I think that speaks volumes about the cuteness of this shop.  

My friend and I shared a cupcake and it was delicious but more than that, it was adorable! The service was friendly. We were ""lucky"" to have the shop basically to ourselves for the entirety of our visit so we were able to carefully take as many pics as we wanted in relative peace and without judgment. 

It's a bit expensive to be an every day bakery type place, but it was totally manageable just splitting a cupcake and chatting for a bit in a really sweet, adorably decorated spot. Now that I've seen it, I likely would not return as there are SO MANY other spots to check out in NYC.

If you can't go without Flour Shop, Williams Sonoma carries a line of their products from baking mixes to food coloring and more."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2020-02-27,3.0,"Solely for presentation, they get 5 stars but if we're talking about taste, which really is the essence of a dessert, they're likely 2.5 to 3 stars. There's nothing special about the taste..same basic flavor no matter what style you order, explosion or otherwise. Their cakes are heavy on sweet cream cheese which really is the only flavor. If I were to summarize the last cake we ordered (thankfully a small one for an Instagram shoot for our pup's birthday) - on the outside it's cute & insta-worthy but on the inside it's a Plain Jane cake. 

You're better off with places like Dominique Ansel Bakery or evening Fay Da bakery in Chinatown than this place."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2020-01-05,2.0,"Eh. Overpriced cake balls. You're paying for the aesthetic here which is on point sure, but if you're looking for some good cakes to satisfy that sweet tooth, you can definitely find better in NYC.

The good parts - we'll give a nod to the classic vanilla cake truffle and chocolate cake truffle. The cookies and cream was too sweet for our liking. The other two were pretty decent. Overall though, the icing was just overwhelmingly sweet in the artificial sugar way. Not something you want to keep eating.

Food: 2/5
Service/Speed: 4/5
Price (college student budget): $$
Ambiance: Casual, some high top tables inside.

Would return & recommend? 2/5"
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-12-27,1.0,"Honestly, not worth the price.
It's just another phony branding gimmick with little substance. A luxury price-tag but without any service. t worth the price."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2020-01-28,5.0,My wife was dying to try Flour after seeing it on Food Network / Rachel Ray.  We only had a couple small cake bites but boy were they good.  I'm looking at buying my wife a Birthday Cake now...
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-06-18,3.0,"I came to Flour Shop with a friend, mostly because we were both enticed by the beautiful interior. 

The shop is a nice open space with colorful decorations. Unfortunately, there was not too much space to sit - just one long bench and two standing tables. Therefore, if it's a busy day you probably won't have a place in the store to enjoy your treats. So make sure to keep that in mind as well as the fact that there is no bathroom available. 

My friend and I got a cupcake to share. The aesthetics of the cake was adorable and the inner rainbow cake that ""exploded"" with sprinkles was so such a nice addition as well. However, the flavor of the cakes were just average, there was nothing really special about it. I do have to admit though that the cream cheese frosting it came with was delicious albeit a bit on the sweeter side. 

All in all, the dessert itself is not the most amazing quality for the price because most of that is definitely going towards the insta worthy pics."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-07-31,5.0,"Great experience. I am always on the hunt for Unicorn and Rainbows in any city. Ive managed to find that the most in NYC. 

Actually stumbled upon this place after shopping at Glossier cosmetics. To my surprise, I would be finding an amazing sprinkle filled cake!

We tried their mini version of the famous sprinkle spill cake ! It was fresh, moist, and of course wonderfully rainbow. The cake itself is still quite sweet, but the experience is really worth it! 

They also sell other items like cake balls that I enjoyed more over the cake cause its bite sized and easy to eat. Gonna crab a few more tomorrow and also try their cool cake rocket pop which is just the perfect portion of the sprinkle cake! 

Good service and great experience !"
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-08-01,3.0,"I had seen this bakery all over Instagram, and it looked adorable. I decided to give it a try last weekend since I was in the area.

We got a small sprinkle cake and a few cake balls to share. I actually liked the cake balls more than the cake. The sprinkle explosion when you cut the cake is a lot of fun, but the cake was a little too much on the sweet and sugary side for me. I'm also a frosting person and there wasn't a ton of frosting on the cake itself. The balls, though, were really moist and the perfect size.

I have to say the prices were on the high side. The small cake we got was $40 and served about 3-4. 

This place gets points for cuteness though. Inside is very spacious and colorful, and the desserts themselves are adorable. There are a couple tables inside to enjoy your dessert, as well as a cute rainbow wall for photo opps."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-05-08,5.0,"Ok, so I may be an adult, but I have never loved a cake more than the unicorn birthday cake I had from Flour Shop! I LOVE unicorns, so when I saw this cake online, I knew I needed it for my birthday. Also, the name of the cake is Cara the Magical Unicorn cake! It seemed like fate that me and this unicorn cake share the same name!

We pre-ordered the cake and it was ready when we got there. We transported it in a car for 2 hours and it looked just as perfect as it did in the store when we got it home. 

The outside was beautiful but the inside was so cool! There were so many layers of different colored vanilla cake with vanilla cream cheese frosting in between and on top. When you cut into the cake, hundreds of colorful sprinkles come spilling out! It's such a fun surprise! The taste was veryyyy sweet but perfect for someone like me that had a definite sweet tooth.

Overall, I would recommend this cake for any child or child at heart! I have never had such fun cutting into a cake before!"
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-05-10,5.0,"The service here is so great! Everyone inside was so nice and helpful. 

Today they gave away free cake balls and their push pops. They weren't anything to write home about but they were good and I love the colorful ambiance of the place. The employees were upbeat and kind and the music was so much fun."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-08-18,3.0,"The baked goods are mediocre. I got the famous rainbow push pop and it tasted like just any average  rainbow dyed layered cake with sweet frosting on the top. Of course, the push pop was super instagrammable due to the vibrant colors--on the cake and in the interior of the bakery. I also got two of their chocolates. They were alright and had more of a cookie dough filling than I expected. But because the taste of the baked goods is what I'm looking into the most, the cake and chocolates just werent enough to satisfy me. Other than the cute interior and colorful cakes, the tastiness or uniqueness was not there."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2018-12-24,4.0,"The space here is big and looks very clean.

There were a lot of cake balls on display as well as their famous 'surprise cakes'/ exploding cakes. There were large fancy white chairs and giant rainbows on the wall. The whole place looked very welcoming. Cake balls are $3 a piece and their rainbow cake pops are $8 each. Personally, I wouldn't buy one bite of cake for $3, but the Flour Shop is in SOHO, so I understand why its pricey. Everything here looked very nice too, so if you're looking for some place with very Instagrammable food, this is definitely the spot! You can get pretty photos of the food as well as nice photos of yourself in their fancy large white chairs."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-11-21,4.0,"Overall was OK, the place is beautiful for some pics. The cakes look adorable but regarding the flavor they're just fine, nothing too special considering the price. 

Wouldn't go back."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2018-11-26,5.0,"I was so worried about the taste of the cake because of the mixed reviews, but it was absolutely delicious. The icing was amazing!

I needed a last minute cake for my birthday trip to NY and this place was recommended. It was $150 for the cake to feed about 15-20 people and everyone loved it. The candy in the middle wasn't too sweet either, so definitely edible.

The store itself is cute and great for pics."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-05-26,1.0,"I admit that I went to Flour shop for the gram. I purchased rainbow cake push pop. It was pretty. I got pretty shots of cake push pop and the store decor to post on Instagram. That's all the positive things I can say about this place. 

Speaking of the taste, there's nothing special to talk about. The cake was bland with overly sweet cream and it wasn't as moist as it should be. 
Also, $8 is ridiculous for such a small piece of cake. The size of the cake push pop is not even half of standard cake slice. 

To sum up, this place is for 1 time experience. I will never return. There are so many pretty places that sell decent food/ dessert."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2020-01-03,5.0,Super cute shop!  Fun music. Unicorn cake was scrumptious and sparkly. Service was fabulous
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-05-10,4.0,"There was a Facebook birthday promotion event going on here today day. All the workers were so friendly and cheerful. The shop had balloons, confetti, and decorations everywhere. They gave out free samples of their cake pops which I would definitely recommend! I had the cookies and creme flavor and was pleased with the amount of flavor within the little ball. We also got to try a cake pop. Rainbow cake slices layered with icing in between. The cake was a little dry, but overall, it was aesthetically pleasing."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2018-09-22,4.0,"Cute place but not much variety. I wish they had more choices. The little truffles that I ordered were cute and they tasted okay. 

I visited this place because my sister wanted the rainbow cake that they sell. It sounded delicious and she would have loved it, but I wasn't able to transport it back home to Buffalo from NYC. 

This place seems to be one of those ""Instagram worthy"" places for cute photos. I'm not sure that the truffles actually taste that good but I'm glad I went. 

I would recommend this place if you want a cute photo and a small dessert if you're in Soho."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-03-26,4.0,So COOL! If you are in need of insta worthy pics with CAKE this is the place for you! The entire store is just loaded with flare and creativity that will take your photos to new heights! Also the cakes are really good and have candy inside ! It's pricey but if you want to try their flavors without too much out of your pocket I suggest getting an assortment of the cake balls and splitting them with someone. My fave was carrot cake and cookies and creme!
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-04-13,4.0,"Cool space + instagram-worthy food + original cakes.

Definitely overpriced - but pretty tasty after all! Worth the detour. Better than Milk or Baked by Melissa."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-02-20,3.0,"I'll admit it, I came for the 'Gram.  Totally clean, white and colorful at the same time makes for such an instagrammable place!  With that being said the concept is great!  I love the rainbows and feeling welcome to hang out in the pretty lounge area. The cakes and desserts were visually pleasing, especially seeing the rainbow cake filled with sprinkles that is all over the internet!  My son and I shared a push-pop which was basically a sampler of that pretty cake. It was good, but other than being really rainbow-y nothing in the flavor or texture was that special and it was definitely a bit pricey for a snack. Definitely still a worthwhile stop for a treat and to check out the rainbows!"
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2018-12-06,3.0,"This place is cute (for one time) because the little cakes are very expensive. (The small cakes are $39). I get that little candies come out of them (imagine a piñata spilling its candies out- its like having the piñata inside the cake). Its adorable for taking pictures as the colors that are displayed all over are vibrant (many rainbows) and all of the tweens like it. I treated my friends to the cake and bought a coffee here too. Unfortunately, they do not have a restroom, so we had to go down the street and wait on line at Starbucks to use theirs. It is definitely a fun place to visit in NoHo."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-09-30,4.0,"The cakes are good. The explosions are cute. The prices...are New York tourist trap-ish. The pizza cookie is pretty darned good with its white chocolate toppings and I love that they use cream cheese frosting on everything. I think. The folks who work there, it's like they know you're paying more than you should be for their wares and they're ultra nice. Like a, ""thanks for letting us overcharge you for our stuff"" kinda vibe. I dig it. Again the explosions are cute. Some things I don't mind paying a little extra for."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-02-27,5.0,My husband bought me the mini explosion cake for my birthday! Such a cute cake! It only feeds 2-4 people (very tiny slices). I loved it so much I think I might want one every year!!
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2018-06-24,4.0,"The cakes are actually very good. They look small for what you pay but 4 people couldn't even finish it. The inside candies are just for Instagram, they are too much sugar. However, the cake and icing had a good ratio. 
The staff was friendly and the inside was clean."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2018-03-15,3.0,"Flour Shop is an Instagrammer's heaven. The trendy decor and colourful aesthetic works well with the bright sprinkle cakes and smaller dessert offerings. The staff is welcoming and friendly and the shop immediately exudes a vibrant and fun vibe.

That being said, the rainbow sprinkle explosion cakes are not all that tasty. I think that the food colouring used to create the bright colours for the cake lead to a bit of an artificial taste. Unfortunately, the cake tastes like something that was concocted out of a laboratory rather than a kitchen. Despite this, I do think that the Flour Shop offers a unique experience with its explosion cake and it is worth trying for yourself especially if you are a dessert person (and an Instagram person)."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2018-04-28,4.0,"So many rainbow inside the shop! Instagramable cute dessert shop in Soho!

Location: It is in Soho, the dessert shop has a very cute interior! Rainbows, balloons and comfy seating are inside this cafe! You could take pictures as long as you want!

Service: she is really nice! Ask me if I wanted a rainbow patch because it looks good in my jacket! See my picture!

Food: RAINBOW CAKE POPS: it is soo good, my nephews love it! I didnt buy anything else but I think everything is good! They also serve coffee!

Price rating: 8 out of 10. The pop is 8 dollar per piece, kinda pricey.

So much fun taking pictures inside this dessert shop! Full of rainbows!"
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2018-10-11,5.0,"I fell in love with the Surprise Cakes on Instagram a while ago but never made the effort to actually go to Flour Shop. I walked by on my way to lunch today and decided to go back and buy a cake to surprise my teen.  

First of all the window display is so cheerful with a Geronimo balloons type display - very enticing on another grey, miserable, 100% humidity NYC day. The interior is definitely styled for Instagram photo ops though the baked goods display case was a bit sparse.  Regardless, I asked for the small Surprise cake. I know. $30 for a cake not much bigger than 4 cupcakes. I'm nuts but I love my kid.  Their packaging was also very cute - a branded box placed inside another branded box.  And then I Ubered home because I wasn't going to schlep a tiny $30 cake on the subway and risk melted frosting or some other catastrophe. So I guess it was a $60 cake all in.

ANYWAY, my teen happened to bring friends home after school and they were pretty thrilled by the sight of the cake.  My daughter might be the only kid with an Instagram account who had never hear of Flour Shop so it was fun to watch her cut into it as all the candies spilled out.  She kindly offered me a slice as well. I guess I'm feeling generous today but I do give this place 5 stars. The cake was dense and rich, the cream cheese frosting was excellent, and it was worth the $30 +Uber for the experience.  This is not your mom's Duncan Hines boxed mix. You only live once, and on a crappy grey day, this sugary rainbow wonder was the perfect antidote.

p.s. Extra points for lovely counter staff."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2017-11-15,5.0,"If you come here expecting a fun, silly time with over the top cakes and decor made for Instagram, you will have a good time.

Right now they are selling just cakes and cake balls, but more flavors and a full coffee bar are coming soon.

My 4 and 2 year olds loved the mini ""exploding"" rainbow cake ($30), which is completely covered in sprinkles, and when cut open, has a ton more sprinkles and chocolate pearls pour out. Before you complain about a lot of empty space in the middle of the cake, make sure you are aware of that and just go with the original rainbow if that's a problem for you.

I am interested in coming back for the all gold covered ""Karrot"" cake, as well as seeing what other flavors Amirah Kassem comes up with."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-08-08,4.0,"Great and easy to use service online. Cake tasted amazing. A bit pricy though, but would recommend."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2018-11-29,3.0,"The cake was very pretty - we got the small stuffed  funfetti cake. It was fun digging in, cutting it in half and seeing it explode. 

However, the cake itself felt a bit overwhelmingly sweet to me; also, each SMALL cake costs $30, so make sure you get a group of people to try it with so that it doesn't come off as overpriced."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-06-25,5.0,My Mother ordered me a 40th Unicorn candy filled Cake. It was beyond beautiful and delicious. It wasn't too sweet or dry. It was perfect. The delivery box they gave us was sturdy too. The candy inside was delicious as well. I froze half and as I thaw it out its still delicious. Thanks for helping in a wonderful birthday. And the price is right!
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2017-11-27,4.0,"It's a very instagrammable shop I noticed by the rainbow splash and the pop of balloons in the window. This is a cake shop and nothing in here is for the diabetic. If anything it'll make you more likely to head that way.

I didn't get the little rainbow cake but Rather some cake balls. The flavor of the peanut one is good but the others suffer the cake ball trap of being just too sugary without real true flavor. It's like eating a blondie without the delight of eating a blondie.

Still actually coming to this store is super fun. It'll take at least 20 minutes to pose for all the instagram shots you'll take."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2020-03-09,5.0,"My daughter ordered the explosion cake for her sister's birthday yesterday. It was absolutely incredible! It made the party! Cakes are a thing for my family and we research, order and purchase all over Manhattan. Never before have we been so pleased with a product. The appearance was a stunner --- oohs and aahs all around. The explosion of sprinkles and candy worked perfectly. And to top it off, the cake was delicious --- moist, dense, flavorful! Thank you so much, Flour Shop. You made our day!"
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-10-10,5.0,"For starters, the service was friendly and attentive. Thanks to the guy who helped us on 10/9 @ 3:30.

One part irresistibly adorable displays 
Mix in a sprinkle cake with a colorful surprise in the middle 

Flour Shop has the right recipe to ensure their business lands on every millennial's social media feed. 

And, surprisingly, they've got the right recipe for cake, too. Their sprinkle cake, which explodes with more sprinkles & candy-coated chocolates, actually tastes good! Each layer of moist cake was lightly frosted with a cream cheese icing. 

No cupcakes here; only cake pops, cake push pops, & a couple different sizes of explosion cake which don't come cheap."
120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2018-07-28,3.0,"Order: Rainbow Cake Pushpop was veryyyy sweet and was actually more for photos than flavor. 

Price: A lot of the items they offer are pretty pricey so the pushpop ($8) was the only thing I could really afford to splurge on... Oh and they don't accept cash so bring your card!

Atmosphere: The cashier ladies were very nice and the interior design made me feel like a unicorn threw up rainbow all over the place yet managed to keep the white tiles pristine and clean. Overall very instagram-worthy!"

120,flour-shop-new-york-2,2019-01-07,5.0,"This is a one of a kind experience. We shared a single cup cake served in a  cup made of chocolate . The store is something of a movie set and the other customers seemed out of the pages of a fashion magazine.  The staff seemed to love serving cake and really made the whole place seem real and fun. 
 And it was really the best cup cake I've ever seen and the best I've ever tasted.  Also the most expensive.  But no regrets.
It's an only in Manhattan experience and one I'm eager to repeat.
Fun!"

I hear they have great coffee, but I didn't get to try any today since I already had some earlier. However, we did order a Matcha w/water. The matcha was excellent and very rich and refreshing.

Cafe Grumpy is smaller than a Starbucks. There are a couple of sitting benches near the front. In the back, they have a few small tables along with a small sitting counter across from them."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2019-09-08,4.0,"I've always been a fan of Cafe Grumpy! I'm not a coffee drinker but the matcha here is amazing. I would give the chai latte a hard pass. I've had it a few times and kind of hate it. Which is why I took off a star.

Very quite place that has seating in the back to get work done."

The baristas are cool, and are always in great moods.  Talkative, and interesting.  How I don't remember their names, is beyond me.

Yes I drink the cold brew, if that wasn't obvious, although I recall the chocolate croissants are good too when I am feeling bold enough to eat butter.

There are a few tables for people to sit and read. I didn't notice any outlets here. 

As for drink, I was recommended to get the Cookie Butter Latte w/ Almond Milk. YUM!! This drink definitely hit the spot. It was so tasty that I really took my time to enjoy the latte. The combination of cookie butter with a hint of cinnamon definitely made it feel like Xmas morning. 

The baristas were super friendly too. I definitely would come back here to try their other drinks."

The service is so quick and the baristas are always super friendly and helpful. I had a cold brew to stay during this visit ($4 or so and it is everything you'd want in a cold brew and more), and I had a little left at the end and wanted to also grab another before heading out. The guy behind the counter made sure I was fine with pouring the rest of mine in a to-go cup and topping it off, and didn't charge me for a full one for my to-go one, which I really appreciated.

Typically the ""rule"" in Cafe Grumpy is no laptops, but someone was on a laptop this time so maybe that's changed and is a little more lax now.

Overall, prices are decent, coffee is wonderful, and service is great. Highly recommend."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2018-07-22,5.0,This is a five star coffee joint. I've been coming here for years and it's just as solid as ever. The barista eve took the time to dial in the espresso. It took a few minutes but man was it worth it. Perfect. And the cortado was great too.
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-04-18,4.0,"Brick.
Small.
Neighborhood.

As soon as I walked in & was greeted, I knew this was a neighborhood cafe.  And if you come in twice, you're treated as such.  Community is important, so I really appreciated that.

I also appreciated the sign out front that announced that they ""now serve matcha.""  Music to my eyes, ears, & tastebuds.

The matcha latte did not disappoint.  And w the cool & easygoing vibe, & the friendly & efficient baristas, there really is nothing grumpy about this Grumpy.

There might be a wait for your latte, though, like there was w mine on my first visit, even though it wasn't at all busy.  I know that I'm a product of Starbucks when I say that; I've unintentionally grown accustomed to the churn & burn service that Starbucks provides.  Here, it's far more laid back, & not cookie cutter or systematic.

And it didn't keep me from coming back.

4 stars."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2018-05-11,5.0,"This is probably going to be my go-to coffee shop in the area now! There's an ample amount of seating, and it never gets too crowded. There are tables, bar stools/seating, and benches along the wall. 

The coffee is amazing (especially the cold brew), and I was ecstatic to see that oat milk and almond milk are free! (At least they were on the particular day I went. 

Overall, it's a super chill vibe with minimal decor and mellow music that isn't distracting. Perfect place to rest while shopping, catch up with friends, or get some light work done."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2019-06-16,5.0,"No wifi but cafes that have wifi usually just have bad wifi anyways. Cell signal for AT&T inside is good so you can just go hotspot. Good coffee, nice interior, nice staff, nice vibe."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2019-09-15,5.0,Absolutely best coffee I've ever had. Barista was so nice & helpful. Super cute and chill vibes inside. Around the corner from my job and I'll be in every day from now on!
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2019-07-23,5.0,Nice low key spot for some coffee or espresso. Prices are great for the location and the atmosphere is accommodating to various vibes
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2018-09-10,4.0,"I just moved to new york recently, so I am trying out all the different cafes. 

Ambiance: it's more like a modern style cafe, high ceiling, small wood table. The only thing I would complain is the air quality since it's closed door at all time, it's a bit stuffy at first but you get used to it. 

Coffee: it's strong and yummy, I love it. I ordered a flat white, definitely would come back for its coffee. 

Plus side: they have a bathroom, it doesn't always happen in New York. 
They also have lots of other locations, so check it out."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-06-12,4.0,"I love grumpy cafe. It's one of my places-to-go when I want to relax or work. 

This is the first time that I visits this location. It's quite pretty and cozy but I didn't add 5 stars to this one because my husband and I are trying to fulfill the challenge of getting one coffee in every grumpy in NYC in one month and the girl in the counter didn't want to punch our card for coffe, just the one for the challenge . Besides that I still like this place and the area is beautiful"
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-01-01,5.0,"Knowledgeable staff that is interesting to talk to. They seem to be very passionate about what they are doing. Such a cozy location. 

The coffee tastings are an added bonus. Probably the best coffee to try black."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2019-02-17,5.0,Great atmosphere. Also had the best orange mocha. Not overly sweet and syrupy. Pure deliciousness.
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-02-07,5.0,"My bf is a coffee fanatic and frequents this place. I suggested Starbucks and he almost had a heart attack.. instead we came to Cafe Grumpy where the barista happily guided us throughout the different flavor profiles of the ""featured coffee brewed by the cup"" 

The pour over takes a few minutes. Check out the boutique next door while you're waiting! Coffee is worth the wait."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-01-29,3.0,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon after trying about 4 different coffee shops in the area beforehand with no luck in finding seating. Thankfully, there was a table for 2 available here, and we seemed to have gotten there right before a rush of people came in. I got a soy chai latte. It was okay - they make them unsweetened. It was $4.50. There was nothing wrong with this place, and the baristas were friendly, but just really nothing special for me. The place is quite barren and under-decorated in my opinion. I usually prefer cuter coffee shops if I'm going to be sitting there for a while with a friend. 

Side note: I wasn't there to do any work, but I overheard they only have one outlet available for customers, and they also do not have wifi... so probably not an ideal ""working"" coffee shop."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2018-01-04,4.0,"I stopped in here on a 20 degree day. It's a small simple cafe, no frills, nothing fancy. I had a good hot cider for $3.50, I could really taste the apples. I would have liked a little more cinnamon or spice in it though, and I didn't see any containers of them at the condiment station."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2018-12-15,4.0,Great coffee. I had the peppermint mocha with oat milk. Small coffee shop. Nice employees.
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2019-01-12,5.0,"This place has great coffee and they always play the best music. One time I heard Sufjan Stevens, another time I heard Mothers, and another time Hop Along. Lethal combo to get me hooked."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-02-05,4.0,"Cute little coffee shop in Nolita. We stopped in here amidst our (hour+) wait for Two Hands down the street after walking by and seeing the sign for the ""marshmallow latte."" We were already *grumpy* from our brunch wait, and you know what they say -- misery loves company. 

When we got there, there were a few seats left in the back, so we snagged a table. By the time we left, though, the line started growing and the place started to fill up, so seating is definitely NOT guaranteed. The latte itself was good, but I was a little disappointed that the barista only dropped 5-6 very small marshmallows in the cup after finishing it off with steamed milk. Perhaps one of the jumbo marshmallows (the regular store kind, not necessarily a gargantuan one like at City Bakery) would have made for a better presentation.

I would definitely come back if I were in the neighborhood, but would probably stick to a regular latte. I do recommend stopping in here to ease the agony of the Two Hands wait. At least the caffeine and the respite from the cold made me a little less grumpy."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2016-08-06,5.0,"Love it! Latest location for the Grumpy empire - now in Nolita!

Opened about a month ago. Good because it's not too busy (yet), unlike their other locations. Good coffee, nice decor, nice staff. 

No wifi yet, apparently the building only has a slow DSL connection. There are toilets at least though."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-01-31,5.0,"There is bebop playing. The cortado is lovely. The space is clean, bright, and warm. They're running that fancy brand new La Marzocco Strada. Exposed brick. 

Did I mention the great cortado?"
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2016-07-07,4.0,"Solid quasi-nondescript Cafe Grumpy that gave itself away with the sidewalk sign. No line and a very friendly staffer inside explaining that the cookies on the bottom are from The Good Batch, the pastries in the middle from Colson, and the gluten-free stuff on top from Sans. Sadly the salty chocolate fudge cookie from The Good Batch was a letdown, but my friend enjoyed the coffee.

Chocolate Chip Cookie
$3.00"
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2019-03-22,5.0,Cafe Grumpy is very comfortable and reminds me of home! The staff is also super nice and warm! One of my favorite coffee shops in NYC!
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-09-23,5.0,Had an excellent oat milk Matcha latte. Carrollann was very helfpul as I made my decision. May this be the first of many matchas. The cafe is a welcome relief from the tourist rush of Chinatown and little Italy.
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-08-17,3.0,I like that it's small and that it's quiet :) I had the matcha drink and it was alright. You get to add your own sweetener so that's a plus because you get to make sure that your drink is the way you want it. I'm giving it three stars because it has no wifi and I just wish that it had more options for drinks...
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-11-05,4.0,"Good coffee, great ambiance, convenient location! The only critical thing I have to say about it is that it lacks charm and uniqueness. Aside from the slightly creative and delicious menu items, it did not feel as though it exuded an individuality to make it anymore than a normal coffee house."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-06-09,5.0,"A bit small 
But very cosy
Nice and gentle music
Order a latte , it was good
Will come again !!!"
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2018-04-07,2.0,Lives up to its name. The barista was borderline rude. The coffee was less than good.
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-10-11,5.0,"Excellent coffee. I have tried the macchiato, latte, ice coffee before. Prices a bit higher than Starbucks but worth it when you want to treat yourself to some good coffee. Just a heads up, the macchiato comes in a tiny shot cup which I wasn't expecting but it was strong and delicious. They also have matcha drinks but I have not tried those."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-04-04,4.0,"I'm trying to minimize my caffeine intake, and as I never drank decaf before, I felt a place using a Swiss water process for their decaf beans would be best (vs chemical solvents). I've heard traumatizing stories and I didn't wanna pop my decaf cherry on a bad note. 

I decided on the pourover of their Hunapu Guatemalan roast (their special that day) and was told it'd be a 7 min wait. I'll admit, I'm a fan of stronger coffee and there was definitely a distinction between a reg cuppa joe and this. It was enjoyable enough though; no bitterness or acidity to be found and it went down really smooth. In terms of flavor profile, I did detect chocolate with an underlying honeydew note. Didn't really taste the orange zest though.

This cafe is decently sized with five 2 seated tables and 4 stools. Or if you don't mind holding your coffee, there's 2 benches along the wall. Doesn't seem to be a great place for work though since they didn't have wifi. Also, the barista seemed to carry a bit of attitude, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt that she's having an off day since rainy weather makes me grumpy (lol) too.

I'm giving this place 4 stars just cause I had their other regular coffees, which have been great. I guess decaf is just something I need to grow more accustomed to."
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2018-02-24,5.0,My favorite place to go if I want a soy milk latte! They always make it perfect when I go there.
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2016-10-01,4.0,Pretty and strong cappuccino. Super creamy with lots of coffee flavor. Regular coffee was also pretty strong. Too bad is wasn't hot enough.
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2017-08-04,1.0,Is it the whole cafe or just him? The barista was literally very grumpy to us. The way he talked to us wasn't welcoming. When we left we had to greet him bye & thank you before he does & he didn't even look at us when he said bye. Not a good experience. Not coming back
121,cafe-grumpy-new-york-10,2018-08-09,4.0,"Very good coffee, some of the best in the city. The Nolita staff is welcoming and professional. It's a great place to swing by and read or do some work while sipping on something. Unlike most of the other cafes in the neighborhood, the customers are respectful of noise. (From my experience). One thing that's a bummer is that there is no WiFi. I recommend stopping by Cafe Grumpy for excellent coffee!"
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2020-03-09,5.0,"This is the perfect place to pick up a drink before you rush into work or need a boost for the rest of your day! The staff is extremely efficient and the cafe has a fresh, clean ambience. I always order the Matcha Latte with oat milk and I enjoy how consistent the staff makes it here every time. They also have delicious sweets available and it's a comfortable place to have a casual rendezvous or to enjoy some solitude."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2020-01-24,5.0,Came here for the first time this morning before getting my hair done at Arrojo hair salon. Very clean and modern coffee place with extremely friendly employees. I ordered an iced matcha latte with whole milk no added sweetener and it was great! They make it with large iced cubes so the drink doesn't get watered down as quickly. Next time I'll definitely try iced matcha latte with oat milk.
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2018-12-30,5.0,"Interlude is a cool spot in Tribeca for your coffee, tea, and treat fix.  We went with a gal pal who highly recommended it.  I ordered my usual almond milk latte which paired well with the cream cheese funfetti cookie: a perfect combo for a coffee break.  
In addition to coffee (espresso, macchiato, cortado, cappuccino, mocha, Americano, Nitro cold brew), Interlude also offers matcha lattes, Masala chai lattes, and hot cocoa.  All pastries are made in-house.  If you're in the area, stop in if you need a little interlude of your own."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,Terrific matcha latte!!!!! I loved the atmosphere and the high ceilings. It was a great quick getaway on Friday after work. Would definitely come back for more matcha
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-09-21,5.0,"Big ice cubes....say no more. 

Tribeca vibes, iced Matcha Latte, chill music... perfect late afternoon."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2020-04-11,5.0,Amazing staff and atmosphere. The coffee is immaculate. There is a restroom and would recommend coming here for any occasion!
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-11-29,5.0,"Sometimes simplest is the bestest. Great cup of coffee. Clean, modern location. Not a place to hang half the day on your laptop, yet if it's a good cup of coffee that you want, this is the place"
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-10-26,5.0,"Interulde is a small coffee shop in the heart of Tribeca. This is my new go to spot for first dates and coffee. You really cannot go wrong with Interlude. Despite the size, I occasionally I work out of the coffee shop."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-11-16,5.0,"Went here for a coffee with my husband and loved this place! Looks like this place is still new. The coffee was great, the interior design looked pretty open and modern too!"
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-08-28,5.0,"I ordered an iced matcha latte with oat milk in a large with no sweetener and it was tasty. I like the overall aesthetic of Interlude and the baristas there are attentive and detail oriented. I would come back to either try their pastries and definitely a round 2 of their iced matcha latte with oat milk. The neighborhood is far, yet close to SoHo, so it's the perfect spot to go if you want to be close to the city, but also take a break from being surrounded by tourists."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-02-23,5.0,"First time here and loved it. Their malted chocolate chip cookie was delicious- soft, chewy, chocolatey. I also enjoyed a cup of hot latte. Service was great. I love the interior design, simple and modern. If you're nearby, definitely go check it out."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-10-02,5.0,"Not bad my friend, not bad. 

The only thing I love in this world is a good coffee and Rice Krispie treats."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-08-10,5.0,"Extremely clean coffee and tea place. Nice people, very friendly, much quieter cleaner and charming than Starbucks.  Artesanal Chinese teas and large clean bathroom. Kid friendly. Good place to read or study. Music calming subdued and relaxing atmosphere compared to the chains."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-04-22,5.0,"Interlude has been my go to coffee shop to start my morning or afternoon off! 

The coffee here is really delicious and most importantly, consistent. I find that some coffee shops and their coffee can be at times very inconsistent but here at Interlude, it's always been on point. 

Also, there in house baked pastries are a must try. I highly recommend the funfetti cookie and honey butter scone. Every time I stop by to pick up a coffee, I honestly can't resist picking up one of their baked goods.

The siblings that run this coffee shop are so cordial and so kind. You can definitely feel their love and commitment to the high quality of service, experience, and taste. I love that I could support local neighborhood shops like Interlude and knowing that these two really care for their customers.  

I recommend coming here for your next cup of coffee or just checking out this beautiful space."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-10-24,5.0,"Oh Interlude... I'm so thankful I followed my curiosity into this place. Ever since then, it's been my go-to coffee shop. I've brought all my friends and relatives here and every single one of them loveeeee it! All the staff is so friendly--it's like Trader Joe's but a coffee shop version. I love their coffee and how friendly they are with their customers. The decor is minimalistic and cool with a good use of space for people to sit. My favorites drinks are iced oat milk lattes, iced chai with oat milk, and iced lattes. They bake their treats in house--my favorites being the confetti cookie, malted chocolate chip cookie, and honey butter scone. Also the name is so fitting. The way I perceive it is: the definition of ""interlude"" is an intervening period of time; a pause between acts of a play. I look at the name pertaining to a play, our busy lives being the play, we go about our day and decide when we want to ""take our interlude."" Anyway, I just appreciate the thought behind the name. Take your ""interlude"" at Interlude"
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-09-17,4.0,"Was intrigued by the solid 5 star reviews. Good vibe & cute atmosphere-- very friendly service! Quality cups (like, literally the plastic cups are high-end). Even the ice cubes are aesthetic (big, actual cube shape). Quality, not bitter espresso & slightly sweet almond milk-- no sugar needed! Overall, a nice experience."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2020-02-07,5.0,Stopped in with some time to kill in TriBeCa. Tasty drip. Really friendly staff and service.

i was searching for a coffee shop with wifi around where i was for the day, and this was perfect. there's ample room for sitting and enjoying a latte. the interiors are clean minimalist and peaceful
the staff is super friendly and the coffee was delish :)
they also have outlets and a bathroom
would 10/10 recommend"
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-09-03,5.0,"I'm so glad my love for caffeine has led me to Interlude! This place is an absolute gem.

I usually order my go to which is an Iced Cortado with Oat Milk. Their ice cubes are fairly large which in my opinion makes up the perfect iced coffee without the overwhelming amounts of ice. The staff are SUPER friendly and always consistent every time i stop it (which is often). The baked goodies are homemade and equally delicious! Don't hesitate on stopping in, you wont regret it."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2020-02-18,5.0,Obviously it is in Thee top5 best international coffee shops worldwide thanks to @aaliyahapp
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-10-08,5.0,"Best coffee shop in NY.  They weigh the milk so every drink is perfect, every time.  This place runs like a Swiss watch, always precise and very clean.  The Cortado is my favorite.  Staff is THE BEST and will remember you after just a few visits."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-05-06,5.0,"The staff is so friendly! Usually I would never comment on that but they are just so friendly. The baked goods are so delicious. You must try the honey scone!! And the coffee is amazing. I highly recommend you going to this coffee shop. In a time when there are a million coffee shops on every corner, this one is something special."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-06-13,4.0,"The drip and latte were really good and the barista was nice, great atmosphere! The inside was pretty spacious for a place in NYC - I'm not personally a fan of patrons bringing their dogs inside but there were a few here so heads up."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-08-26,5.0,I love this place! My friend recommended it to me and I got a tea and a pastry.  THEY OFFER GLUTEN FREE !  Definitely check this place out if you're in the area.
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2018-08-21,5.0,"I was thrilled when I heard through the grapevine that this place had opened, because I literally work next door and generally have limited free time to grab a coffee or a bite to eat.  Much to my delight, I have found this place to be much more than a subjectively convenient location.  The owners/baristas are welcoming, friendly, and pleasant to talk to.  The coffee is excellent (I'm partial to the hot mocha but everything I've had here is legit, including the iced coffee.)  Their savory scones are, no joke, my new go-to's.  I tried their cheddar onion scone this morning and I swear I have finally found my spirit pastry.

So stop on by and give this place some love.  It's one of those rare NYC spots that's the whole package and I want it to stick around for awhile!"

122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-10-09,5.0,"My favorite coffee place in NY! Great selection, super clean, very efficient and well run. The baked goods are also amazing. Highly recommend!"
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-01-11,5.0,"One of my most favorite coffee shops in the city. A must visit for those traveling to the nearby neighborhoods. Their selection of teas is fantastic, and properly steeped(no soggy tea bags floating in your cup here), every espresso and coffee drink is made precisely, but the real star of the shop is the variety of baked goods made by the owners, fresh daily. There are savory scones, sweet scones, cookies, a muffin, a sweet bread. Not too many options, but everything made exceedingly well. The flavor combinations are also fantastic and special. It's not just a blueberry muffin, it's a blueberry MAPLE muffin, the savory scones are twists on a French onion soup flair profile, the Rice Krispie treats are toasted first, and the cookies are classic childhood favorites elevated to adult tastes( like malted chocolate chip cookies, and cream cheese funfetti). Expect to spend a little more than your average bake shop, but leave happy with your decision to do so."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-09-05,5.0,i love but also hate this place because I have eaten their confetti cookies for 3 days in a row now and am heavy breathing just thinking about them. coffee is a+ and oat milk matcha is the move. music is quirky and a cheery spot to study and dogwatch!
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-01-09,5.0,"Best spot in SoHo/Tribeca, hands down. If you're looking for real coffee and a place to relax/do work, this is it. Bright and spacious, rare find in NYC - cortado and espresso are stellar. Serves George Horwell"
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-01-29,4.0,"The perfect spot to make a quick stop for a hot mocha and a fresh slice of banana bread! Don't be surprised if you see a line, just know it's well worth it. It's quite small though, so when it gets busy, it won't be quiet. But the business seems to come in waves, so it's not packed and loud all the time."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2018-09-18,5.0,"This place is incredible!  Amazing service, amazing coffee and tea, and the snacks are fantastic, so glad to have them in the neighborhood, although more of a true destination coffee shop!"

The coffee is, even in a neighborhood with other good options, pretty remarkable. And the snacks are delicious and, if it matters to you, creative, too. Looking forward to returning!"
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2019-05-30,5.0,"The best coffee and baked treats, and the nicest owners (Melody and Josh), in Tribeca - by far."
122,interlude-coffee-and-tea-new-york,2018-08-10,5.0,Friendliest staff at a coffee shop that I've come across in a long time. Happy to have this spot open up across the street from my office. Feels primed to be the new go to. Cookies made in house look delicious! Great coffee and service.

I haven't tried their food.  Their attention to detail is amazing and refreshing in comparison to busy coffee shops.  I usually get their matcha tonic, which I haven't seen anywhere else.  A little pricey, but on par with other NYC coffee shops, and probably the same or better quality of product.  Definitely worth stopping by when in the TriBeCa area!"
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-09-13,5.0,"Some of my reviews are, how you say, ""not PC""
But I'm so f***ing glad that New York City's not DC
Cause here all the girls - and the boys - are easy
And here you can get dirt cheap egg rolls at GC!

WHAT!

It's time to stop, drop, and Egg Roll for GC Egg Rolls House, which is one of the most homogenous and unique spots in Chinatown. They really only sell one thing, and it's very cheap and interesting, like me!

This is a really adorable little Egg Roll House where they sell one thing and one thing only which are Little Egg Roll snacks (a form of wafery dessert), and they're tasty and unusual and well worth a try, and I would say they are four star products just for the taste and texture - but for the amazing prices (they're practically free, omg, how does this place stay open), and a great service and the uniqueness of this little place, not to mention it's family owned, I have no choice but to give out my glowing five star rating.

My notes said: really tasty and airy snacks, very lovely, watch out for hours

(I don't think it literally means you have to watch the store for hours on end, but that their hours aren't always consistent, but then neither is sex with your ex)"
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-05-26,4.0,"Freshly made HK style eggrolls.

Crispy, flaky, fluffy, and flavorful.

If you are indecisive in choosing which flavor to go for, order the mixed box and taste everything.

They had a grand opening special and got a box of mixed flavors for 6.75$.  a box comes with two sealed packages, each package has 10 rolls, so you get a total of 20 rolls.  

At first I thought it was kinda pricey for egg rolls compared to the regular ones in the tin can I buy in Asian grocery stores, but these were freshly made on the spot and you can taste the difference, no preservatives, so best to consume asap...not like I was saving it for anyone, I killed the box the same day I got them."
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-09-17,4.0,"I stumbled upon this place while scrolling through yelp so I wanted to give it a try. I was so curious about fresh egg rolls and how they tasted, especially when they have more variety of flavors compared to the traditional egg rolls you get from the box. 
I purchased the mix box which was $7.50 and it came with two boxes. Each box came with two trays. Each tray had one of each flavor. The mix box came with original, sesame, chocolate, pandan and coffee. I gave it a 4 star, but mainly for some of the flavors. The original tasted like most other egg rolls. The sesame one was quite different because it had a savory hint to it. It also had black sesame seeds versus white. It was something different with the added salt, but it may not be for everyone. Chocolate didn't wow me, but it had a mild cocoa taste, but too strong of a flavor. The pandan one was mild too, but i like the added coconut to it. I also don't get to see that flavor often, so I do really enjoy this one. The coffee one is very mild too, but it's detectable if you don't have the others with it. So if I have the chocolate one, I definitely find myself feeling that the coffee one tastes like chocolate too. But overall, they were all pretty good. They are light and slightly flaky and don't taste artificial. They are on the softer side compared to the ones you get in stores, so they have less crisp, but there is a nice airiness to them. They aren't too dense so they aren't too filling and are a nice snack with some tea or coffee. 
The flavors I would purchase again would be most likely be pandan and coffee. Maybe sesame too if I was craving something a little on the savory side, but thankfully none of them are too sweet. If you do find one that you like, you can also purchase one of the full size in just the flavor that you want. They also have two sizes to choose from. The lady was also really nice in telling me about how much you get and the sizes of the trays in the mixed boxes. The prices here are slightly more expensive then the boxes you get in stores, but I like that they are made with simple ingredients and no preservatives."
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-08-28,5.0,"Coconut pandan egg rolls
Delicate flaky texture that crumbles easily with every bite. Lightly pandan flavor with aromatic scent of coconut. Slightly sweet dessert that goes well with a cup of tea."
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-09-06,5.0,"I was visiting NYC and a friend wanted to try this place so we made a pit stop here the day before our flight back to LA. It was a Sunday early afternoon and the shop was empty, but smelled so good once we were inside. The lady was very nice to offer us samples. Since i didn't know which flavor to get, i decided to get the mixed box with all flavors - original, sesame, coffee, coconut pandan and chocolate. The lady said they are having a discount right now so the mixed box was only $6.75 for 20 eggrolls. I think if you get the box with all the same flavor it is slightly cheaper. Since it was cash only, sadly i could only afford one box because i only had $8 in my wallet lol. After i made my purchase, the lady told the man inside the kitchen to make some fresh eggrolls for us to try. I tried some piping hot coffee eggrolls and it was so delicious. Light and crispy! I wish there is a store like this in LA but i doubt it! Definitely will come back again next time i visit and tell my other friends about this place"
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2018-08-03,4.0,Great new snack spot! My boyfriend introduced me to these egg rolls and says they remind him of the ones he ate as a kid. All the flavors in the variety pack were great. Friendly staff as well.
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-10-27,3.0,Nothing special. Texture was usual and does not seem any different from the ones you buy at the supermarket. I had freshly made ones that are actually made in front of you. The texture can not be compared. $7 is not worth the price.
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-07-23,5.0,"If your visit always includes Marlborough/Toronto, Canada fresh egg rolls, come here to try it out.  Great gift ideas to your friends.  Come for the bubble/jelly teas, too!!!   There's some high chair limited seatings for a place to cool down at the tip of Manhattan Bridge."

123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-05-15,5.0,Handmade egg rolls from a mom and pop shop. Definitely recommend this as they make it hot and fresh. Owners are the nicest people on Earth. I recommend buying the entire box and bringing some home for friends and family
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2018-11-14,5.0,"Delish! Not as good as the ones I had in Toronto's Pacific Mall, but in NY, these are as good as it gets. I purchased 1 box with two flavors: the Pandan and coffee flavor. Couldn't really taste the Pandan flavor but the coffee, YUM!!!! VERY CRISP. Def good for souvenir-ing and/or enjoying with your cup with afternoon tea. It is a bit on the pricer side but I'm assuming this is really all handmade (as indicated on the box). Currently there's a promo going on, DEF suggest trying it out! :) I'll be back to try original and get more of the coffee egg rolls!"
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2018-10-07,5.0,"Spotted this gem while walking next to the manhattan bridge. I walked in and was immediately greeted by a friendly man behind the counter. He started telling me about their flavors: original, coffee, sesame, pandan coconut, and chocolate. I love egg rolls and definitely wanted to try them all. You can buy a tray or a box (2trays) of 1 flavor, or you can have 2 flavors in a box, or you can try the variety pack. I opted for the variety. They have a nice fluffy crunch to it, if that makes sense. It's goooood and fresh. I'll be coming back for more."
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2018-08-05,5.0,My father loves egg rolls and I buy him packs of the pandan flavoured ones. They're really tasty. GC serves good taro bubble tea too.
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2018-10-07,5.0,Omg so happy for NYC to have there first fresh egg roll store. I only heard of Canada having a really popular egg roll store. Now I finally get to try. As I was walking to the store I saw two older men with two bags of egg rolls in their hands. I was shocked at how much they purchased. When I saw that I was like the egg rolls must be really good. I went in and the cashier said hi. I ordered 1 box of mixed egg rolls. The cashier said I get 10% off due to grand opening promotion. I was so happy for that. 1 box of egg rolls comes with two packages of egg rolls. That's a total of 20 egg rolls. The egg roll store is small but there's tables and chairs for customers. The store is across the street from the entrance to manhattan bridge. When I went home to try the egg roll I was amazed at how fresh it was. The coconut pandan egg roll were my favorite and coffee were my least favorite. The egg roll were delicious and were handmade fresh every day. I brought a pack to let my aunt and cousins try it. All were delighted. I definitely will go back to buy more.
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2018-07-23,5.0,"Friendly staff, smells delicious, offered a free sample, taste great! Will be back soon! Grand opening not too long ago... I hope they made bigger egg rolls and in larger containers for egg roll lovers like me :)"

123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-04-24,5.0,A friend of mine surprised me some egg rolls from this place.  Love the crunchy texture and smell of fresh eggs.  No preservatives!  My favorite one is the sesame.  Highly recommended.
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2018-07-18,5.0,"I recently stumbled upon this gem in Chinatown after work with my friends. We wanted to try their egg rolls because it was something new and different in the neighborhood. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted with friendly staff. The girl at the cashier, Frances, was patient in letting us sample the different flavors. The owner also stepped out of the kitchen and gave us freshly handmade egg rolls to try, which were very good. My favorite flavor was coconut pandan, and coffee was a close second! The flavors are unique and have a crispy texture. I really struggled to decide which flavor to buy home for my family to try so I ended up getting the mixed box, which included all of the flavors. I also tried their passionfruit green tea which was excellent. I'll definitely be back for more!"

123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-01-27,5.0,I love this little shop. I was walking by the Manhattan bridge when I stumbled upon this place. The shop was filled with the aroma of fresh egg rolls.

123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2019-06-29,5.0,"place smells amazing and the friendliest staff. egg rolls arent that sweet and pretty light so you can eat a lot in one go. $7 for two trays, so these make good gifts too. G C stands for gary chow btw aka the owner"

123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2018-07-19,5.0,"My friends and I were struggling to find a good place for a snack when we stumbled upon this newly opened restaurant. We were blown away and I've been back 3 times since, each time more impressed than before. The atmosphere is friendly with cute designs. All of the staff are incredibly welcoming and patient, taking time to explain all of their flavors to my friends and I. I opted for the original egg rolls and the peach green tea. The egg rolls were perfectly crispy and flavored. The peach green tea was also amazing. The staff go so far as to bring out freshly made rolls for the customers to try. Everything here is also reasonably priced. The flavor and hospitality of this place is impeccable and I would highly recommend this place to others."

Great service, great food, and great staff! I highly recommend :)"
123,gc-egg-rolls-house-new-york,2018-08-17,5.0,Very fresh and good!  Gotta try the pandan and coconut flavor!  It's delicious!  Bought it today and tried it for the 1st time.  Great afternoon snack!
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2020-02-02,5.0,Such a lovely spot!! Delicious breakfast; warm environment and staff; great service. Definitely recommend! And they're open early on the weekends which is great.
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2019-12-01,4.0,"I wanted a light lunch. A simple soup. The soup was nothing special, in honestly it was kind of bland. Definitely something perfect for folks who don't want anything overseasoned or oversalted. It was a nice space. I went up to the register and paid. Then I sat at a small table and had the soup with a side of bread. I didn't stay long. I just needed a nice quiet space to decompress for a bit. It's family friendly and close to the seaport."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2019-06-18,5.0,"The food is always on point! Made Fresh Daily is really Made with Fresh ingredients. A must try would be their Turkey Meatloaf! Their chive butter is a perfect blend and reminds me Europe. 

Perfect way to start my morning is with their fresh cinnamon raisin bagel toasted with butter and with their coffee. I purchased their to go mug to pitch in to try to save the earth and a bit of my wallet is a plus. Friendly staff! They have board games in the front too!"

124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2019-03-25,5.0,"Staff is the best! The food is worth the wait. This isn't a quick meal kinda spot, this is a ""got an hour to kill"" kinda spot. The manager is the sweetest person you'll meet with such a bubbly personality. 

MADE FRESH is the best!"

124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2017-10-11,4.0,"Dear ""Made Fresh Daily""

Do you realize that the name of your establishment, and the way it's painted on the window, doesn't appear like, or seem like a proper name for a cafe, or coffee shop?  (A more extreme version of this might to name your cafe ""Open"".)

If you're going for the in cognito look, maybe even a sort of ""special spot"" kind of element, then you've definitely managed that.  

I actually kind of enjoyed not really knowing if I was going through the correct door, and the spaces kind of free flow feel that felt informal and different, with no obvious cashier space, feels more like a private meeting living room.  It works.

The coffee was very good and so was the chocolate chip cookie.   The cinnamon/sugar should be labeled, and a non sugar option should be offered for coffees. 

Thanks for creating such a non linear sort of coffee place.  I enjoyed it.  It made me feel special. 

Have an awesome day
Scott"
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2020-01-15,4.0,"Cute place right in the heart of Seaport. Lots of delicious healthy choices on the menu! Only turn off is the smell of whatever cleaning product they use. It's overwhelming and you can't smell the delicious food, baked goods, and coffee they are preparing. I do a to-go/pick up order most of the time."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2019-08-11,5.0,"This place is my new breakfast staple. It's one of the only places within the area that offers simple, straight to the point, and affordable breakfasts. Everyone I've encountered here is wonderfully friendly, and when I took my toddler in, they brought out a bunch of crayons and a large paper for her to entertain herself. It's little gestures like that that make me really feel comfortable at an establishment. This feels like one of the only eateries that doesn't charge a crazy ""Manhattan tax"" on everything."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-07-17,4.0,"Yummy food. I got the tuna and sparkling water. Friendly and fast service. And a cute place to meet a friend (there's a comfy looking couch with coffee tables up front) , or you can bring your laptop and people watch from the counter style seating behind the window."

124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-11-13,5.0,Cute little restaurant in New York! It is in a great location and the people are so nice in the shop. I want here with my friend for a quick lunch and all of the food is fresh and homemade. I definitely go back if I was stopping for a sandwich or something quick on the go. There's a nice little nook where you can sit or study. But there's also tables and chairs if you'd like to have a sit down breakfast or lunch
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-11-05,4.0,"TL;DR Cozy, southern-inspired coffee shop.

This slice of lower manhattan isn't exactly crawling with great weekend breakfast options, as most places are either national chains (read: dunkin) or cater to the Mon-Fri business crowds. However, made fresh daily was open (relatively) early and offered well executed basics. 

I ordered the greek omelette (spinach, feta, grape tomatoes with a side of home fries and toast) while my wife got the ham, egg, and cheese scramble on a biscut. Both were tasty and filling. 

For a small, neighborhood joint offering simple, tasty fare, Made Fresh Daily delivers on its promises!"
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-04-27,5.0,"Greeted with a warm welcome as I entered & the Moroccan Salad was fresh & absolutely delicious . Loved that the salad was also served with hummus & pita. 

Definitely worth the price & try!"
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-10-11,5.0,Counter service quick stop for homemade breakfast and lunch. Wonderful menu with southern- inspired dishes. I recommend ordering the biscuit! They will swap whatever grain comes with your dish for a biscuit if you ask nicely.
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-02-25,5.0,"The eggs were fresh and ingredients delicious.  Herb butter made the toast yummy.  Also nice to get a seat on Sunday without waiting, a function of the location.  Select the mocha coffee over the house, fuller bodied coffee.  Small cup of fruit was a nice touch.  Egg BLT on a croissant was delicious. The croissant was crisp, which always helps make the ingredients inside great."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2019-03-14,5.0,The food was amazing and great prices! The yogurt was filling and the biscuit was so good with the butter
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-09-22,5.0,"Perfect little cafe on atmospheric street. Simple fare, but fresh and good. Prices are reasonable and decent amount of seating. Great place to go for breakfast with girlfriends or a partner. Wish there were more places like this in Manhattan that had the perfect combo of seating, good food at decent prices, and casual, charming atmosphere. Homemade iced green tea with ginger and lime is delicious! Wish I lived closer to here, it would be a regular weekend breakfast place for me."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2019-10-03,5.0,"Confession: I held back from posting a review about this place because I did not want word getting out on how awesome this place. Yes, I was being selfish, I wanted this adorable little spot all to myself, because it's where I go when I need to step away from work and the craziness of the city, and just want to be comforted with delicious food that makes you feel warm and fuzzy, by staff that are so sweet and call you by your name and know exactly want you want to order. But, I had a moment of enlightenment and realized that things are best when shared. So, here I am letting you know that anything you order from here is going to be great. I always get their soft salmon scrambled eggs (breakfast for lunch? YES, PLEASE!) or their Farmers Breakfast, which is just as yummy (my mouth is watering right now as I type this). When I want to get actual lunch, I order the tuna curry sandwich or their BBQ chicken salad...SOOO GOOD! Anyway, my point is, this place is awesome. You should come, even if I don't want you to because I don't want to have to stand in line or not find a place to sit when I'm there, but c'est la vie en NYC. Sharing is caring, I guess."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2016-10-17,4.0,"I have had breakfast or lunch here numerous time now, and I am always really satisfied. This place is a happy mood spot with high quality snacks and food in the South Street Seaport district.

Sandwiches or soups comes with a side of salad or chips. I especially love the sandwiches on croissants. Recently, I had one with ham, cheese, arugula, apple and honey, warm. Such a delicious dreamy combination.

Their sweets treats, cookies or pie slices, are incredibly good, as well as coffee. Most of the menu change seasonally, and there are daily baking specials."

124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2017-10-15,5.0,"Made Fresh has been my favorite brunch place downtown for awhile. I come almost every week for their buttermilk biscuits with chive butter (amazing!) and Farmstand scramble. Also, their house blend iced coffee from Porto Rico Coffee Co is to die for! I've been trying to replicate it myself, but can never make it as good as Made Fresh. 

Today we are happy to see that they've renovated (new tables, art, etc) and also added some menu items like avocado toast, while keeping the classics! Dinner is also available now - can't wait to try it! So happy to see Made Fresh keeping it relevant and of course always fresh!!"

124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2019-10-13,1.0,"I normally don't write reviews like these, but was incredibly disappointed and frustrated by my visit here today. I have gotten breakfast to go at this spot several times before, food has always been decent. Decided to bring my friends for a quick / casual brunch near home and had a horrendous first sit-down experience. 

Place was decently busy but not filled to the brim. We ordered our food together and my friends received their food after ~25 min. The server told me that my food will be right out as well. Another 15 minutes go by and I do not receive anything. Server also never came to check up on it. I noticed another table that came way after us had already received the same dish that I had ordered. We flag down the server and ask where my food is, she seemed flustered but insisted that they were making it. We point out that someone else got the same order even though they came after and she then admits her coworker made a mistake and gave my plate to that table. Another 15 minutes go by and I am still waiting, without any apologies or gestures from the staff. We check in with her again and she is dismissive, saying she has to serve the other tables first and the kitchen is making our food. Clearly, the kitchen was not ""making our food"" this whole time as no chicken and waffle dish should take that long.

She then asked what I wanted to do. If I wanted to keep waiting or get a refund and go (without the food). No apologies ever, and no taking responsibilities, just blaming her coworker for screwing up. How does offering me a refund for wasting an hour of my time and not ever getting my food make up for anything?

Finally received my dish after another 10 minutes. Was not offered to get the dish comped. We asked for the manager because we wanted to provide feedback and was told there is no manager on premise.

Overall, the worst brunch experience I've ever had in the city. The bonus feature was that the table next to us, during this whole fiasco also got up and complained that they've been waiting for an hour and never received their food. They then got a refund and stormed out.

Irresponsible employees and lack of management. Food is just mediocre and definitely not worth risking wasting your Sunday here. Plenty of other options in the area. Suggest you check out Hole in the Wall or Le Parisienne for a real brunch establishment."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2019-04-02,3.0,The place is cute with board games to pass the time while you wait. We got chicken and waffles and steak and eggs. Everything was dry and did not taste that good.
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-04-19,5.0,"Food is good.  I had the rustic chicken soup for the second time.   Exactly what I want for a rainy gray day like today.  Warm, tasty and healthy.  A true blessing.  

I think they probably have kept the original structure of the premise.  The setting of the place is like a family house.  When you walk in, first you see an entrance area with sofa and chairs.  After that, the stairs take you to the counter and more seats.  Customers here are quiet and dressed casually.   All in all, this place has a relaxing vibe.  you can easily tell the difference between this one and other Fidi area cafes.  A nice break.  

Through my visits, I did not have to wait along."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2017-03-27,4.0,"Made Fresh Daily is a great place to get breakfast at in the South Street Seaport area and on weekends they open up at 8:00 AM while many other places don't have breakfast / brunch until 10:00 AM or 11:00 AM. I had their buttermilk biscut with scrambled eggs with ham and cheese. The Biscut it self was quite good, though not perfect. The eggs with ham and cheese were great and perfectly cooked. I would definitely come here again for breakfast if in the area."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2019-03-19,5.0,"Picture this: St. Patrick's Day, my saints day. I should be out and about, being raised above the crowd as a conquering hero but instead I have to work. During my lunch break, I wade through a sea of people dressed in green and enter this relatively quiet sandwich shop. Other than some guy working on his laptop with headphones on, I'm alone. Music from the radio plays heavy 80s and when I ask to change it, I'm told the owner only likes 80s... customer isn't always right I guess. A workman comes in and starts drilling. The sound merges with the horrible 80s track... I'm about to walk out without my food. But then it comes. A BBQ Chicken Sandwich fit for Zeus himself. That's why 5 stars. Cause the drilling was just a noise. The 80s music was just a noise. The party I couldn't join outside was just a noise. But this Sandwich was so freakin' good I didn't care. Next time I'm bringing headphones - but you know and I know there's gonna be a next time because for that Sandwich I'd give up St. Patrick's Day all over again."

From the fresh soups to the breakfast options all-day, it's all delicious, reasonably priced and a great atmosphere for a mid-week lunch."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-09-29,5.0,"Great food and service at this cozy little cafe. Great for breakfast and brunch (unfortunately no alcohol if you're in the mood for boozy brunch). 

All of their food is made in-house and you can tell it's made with quality ingredients and TLC! The owner/manager is a sweetheart and knows her customers well. I always feel welcome here."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-01-26,5.0,"I usually grab a nice refreshing raspberry rosehip hibiscus tea but this time I opted for the Vermont Ham Melt, and I. Fell. In. Love. The cheddar cheese was melted perfectly and the fig-chutney mustard gave it the savory kick that the sandwich needed.
10/10 would recommend!"
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-02-05,5.0,"This is my favorite breakfast, brunch and lunch spot in all Downtown. Food is always extremely fresh and super delicious.

My friend made us wander the entire neighborhood because she said she had amazing eggs in a restaurant nearby but couldn't remember the name. We finally gave up and walked in to this unassuming spot and she was so excited because it was what she was looking for!

I had the Farmstand Scrambled Eggs and they were amazing! Great spot for breakfast and the coffee is awesome too."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2017-09-04,5.0,"I never do reviews but felt the need to say how much I enjoyed the cozy and friendly setting MFD (for short) provides. There's a nice loungey area up front when entering for those that have some time to sit and/or gather themselves. The staff and owner I believe.. with a fancy name I forget but totally sweet and upbeat. 

I usually go with the cold brew which tickles me nicely but the OJ is pretty darn good as well and not talkin the football player! Gotta try the ""Cold Brew Ice Cream Float"".. not even sure if thats on the menu but a craving one day cured by with a smile and a couple scoops of ice cream. I've had a couple of their salads and sandwiches which were delicious.. and fresh, did I mention? The whole staff is friendly but gave more than ample space as privacy wasnt an issie. 

Its right by the south st seaport so you can order-to-go or dining in works as there's a good amount of seating. Desserts look good too but I'll come around to those in time. Its nice to have that go-to place for a beverage in the morning or when you want a fresh healthy snack during the day"
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2017-11-12,5.0,"Really love this cafe over in the south street seaport, perfectly priced fresh food & very chill atmosphere. Had the greek turkey sandwich and it was delicious! Tons of veggies & yummy whole grain bread."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2018-12-04,5.0,"Such a cute little neighborhood place in the Seaport.  Everything was so fresh.  Staff was very nice and knowledgeable.  My coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice were great.   I had the santorini omelette that was generously filled with feta cheese, spinach and tomatoes.  It was served with a delicious whole grain toast.  My husband had the homemade corned beef hash and eggs and said it was really good.  This is a great go to place if you live nearby and want a cute place to go for breakfast."
124,made-fresh-daily-new-york,2015-08-18,4.0,"I came here for Sunday brunch a couple of weeks ago. I saw the sign outside for banana & blueberry pancakes, so had to go in! 

It is a nice spacious cafe with magazines you can borrow to browse as you eat. My husband and I were going to split 1 order of eggs and the pancakes so we could try both. The scrambled eggs came with a biscuit but they were all out, I said I would take a bagel instead, but they only had a cinnamon bagel left. So we just stuck to the pancakes. I later heard someone else order a particular coffee, but they were they out of that too?! 

The pancakes were really nice and came with a side of fruit. The fruit was baked into the pancakes which is how I like them. 

I would definitely return here again and I hope to try the scrambled egg on biscuit. I will need to go early!"

125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-10,4.0,"I often stay at the tiny SoLita SoHo Hotel right across the street from this pocket-sized coffee stop. I guess everything is ""South-of"" something down here. Even though the hotel offers a discount coupon for the Starbucks around the corner, I still come here because I'm a maverick, a rebel who throws caution in the wind and laughs fear in the face. OK, I'm not but I do like the roasted Intelligencia beans they use here. There's only two seats in the place usually occupied by young smartphone-obsessed girls oblivious to their surroundings. I got my $3.25 Americano (photo: http://bit.ly/2tjrrtC). Life is good.

125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-18,1.0,"1. I recently switched from cows milk to a non-dairy.  I ordered an oat milk latte and OMG there's a $1.50 fee for oat milk.  Are you kidding me?  So a latte here will run you about $6.  That's cray cray crazy!  

2. I saw the owner's response to a racist yelp comment that apparently a barista made to a customer.  Right or wrong, the owner's response was sarcastic and unnecessary.  Get a clue.

3. They don't even sell the amazing cookies they used to sell.  

Why am I counting?  3 strikes and you're out."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-30,1.0,"Terrible customer services and RACIST manager, Neville Ross. We went in to get breakfast and coffee, but the staff was very rude and refused to toast the pastry. We wrote a negative review because of the bad service. The business manager wrote back a racist comment saying they remember us, we were upset about our Asian name being pronounced wrongly, and we should chill out because in the original review we misspelled ""customer"". Wow he must be very proud about his piece of work. Anyway, the mispronounced name thing didn't happen to us. Sounds like they are rude and racist to someone else, and confused us with that victim. Not surprised.

Overall, very NASTY owner. Don't go to this racist place."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-29,4.0,"Overpriced compared to other shops in the area. Service is slow during morning rushes because there's only one person making drinks. My chai latte always comes out good though, can't complain about the quality of the drinks.

If you want a shorter wait time, cheaper prices and the same stuff, go around the corner to Project Cozy."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-04-04,3.0,"Saturday afternoon, stopped by this coffee shop for a quick pick-me-up. Limited seating inside, however there is a small bench outside to sit down after ordering.

Not too many pastry options behind the glass, yet felt like getting something sweet to balance out the drink. Decided on the Iced Coffee ($3ish) and a Chocolate Chip Cookie ($3). Coffee has a strong bitter flavor, yet still was tired after an hour. Cookie is pretty good, balanced amount of chocolate chips and semi-soft. 

Not bad overall for a grab and go spot."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-07,5.0,"Definitely a nice little coffee shop where they can do your soy lattes right; their espresso is a little dark as they very reminiscent to stump town coffee and intelligentsia flavors. The baristas give off a very Portland demeanor, which is refreshing to see as it's not so common to find such warm and relaxed personalities in the area."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-05-20,4.0,"I stumbled across this cute little coffee shop to get my iced coffee fix ($4). The workers were friendly and I got my drink very quickly. It's a bit pricey for an iced coffee, but it was quite caffeinated compared to the iced coffee that I usually get from the Starbucks. 

To note  -  not that much room to sit, but a decent place to stop by for caffeine. 

Some other things to note: they have a coffee card that you can get stamped everytime you make a purchase! Also they have ""happy hour"" from 7ish am to 10am where their drinks are half off."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-14,4.0,"This cute corner soho-ish outpost makes good coffee with a slightly higher price tag.   

The baristas tend to be artsy scruffy and tend to be unusually present for New York - which means they smile, are generally friendly and will engage in a few aside comments.

The crowd here feels rich in cash, working or living nearby in a soho loft.

This place isn't typically hangoutable.  
There are exactly two barstools in front of a small counter and a single bench outside. 
I did take advantage of a barstool and I did actually get some work done, despite the fact that the barstool seat is a single uncomfortable piece of varnished wood.

Summary 
This coffee spot makes good brews at a slightly higher price and is really a to go place."

Tasty coffee and dessert
Simple menu
Nice inner brick interior and vintage chairs
Employees seem to get along with one another

Cons:
WAY too expensive for what you are getting
Employees are not particularly nice to customers
Small shop
No WiFi or power outlets"
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-02,2.0,"Ordered a large cappuccino for $5.25. Not insane in NYC. It was insanely milky and more like a latte. I asked the ""barista"" if he could adjust it by pouring half out and putting another shot In. I was told that the large cap is actually a latte and that I'd have to pay an additional 1.75 to have my beverage prepared to my liking. Pretty crappy attitude if you ask me. That brought my drink up to $7. 

I sat down to tap out an email while I drank my cappuccino only to hear that same barista tell another customer how gross he thinks almond milk is(yes it's what I had in my drink). He said it loud enough to be heard through my noise cancelling headphones. 

I usually don't write bad reviews but this is unacceptable in a city where there's exceptional coffee on every block."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-13,4.0,"This was one of the friendliest coffee spots I've tried here while I'm in NYC - even got some more nerd-inspired clothing recommendations from the barista for my family when I complimented the kick-ass Wonder Woman knit cap she was wearing. 
I'm not a gigantic fan of the Intelligentsia coffee- it's got one slight sour note to it that is a little off for my coffee palate - but it's a thousand times better than the Starbucks on the next block. Really good pastries as well - a great spot for my 3-4pm latte."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-10,5.0,"Tired from excessive walking, I dropped by for the $4.25 latte and sat at the window with bar stools facing the street - a perfect people-watching spot. The shop's menu is printed directly on the wall in elegant modern font, which adds a beautiful touch. The latte was fragrant, rich in flavor, and the perfect blend of sweet and bitter. Topped by beautiful latte art, it was definitely a delight to have."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-30,1.0,"The owner/ business manager Neville Ross is racist.

I had bad coffee, bad customer service, cold pastry, here two years ago. He says this experience is caused my being angry by the barista who can't pronounce and spell my name. I never even had this experience with the barista. He is making these racist assumptions because I have an asian name, and using this to cover up the fact that they provided a terrible experience to their customers. 

Your product and retail experience is bad. Stop blaming others and own up to it.

To;dr **** BAD CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE at physical location; BAD yelp experience by RACIST MANAGER."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-02,5.0,"I heart this place already and it was my first time here. The customer service was superb and the staff was so friendly, a sweet.

I got a hot chocolate with (Oat Milk) and it was delicious. Now the price was $5 for a large -- which most place would be considered a small. But the taste well worth the price. 

I'll be back here or to their NoHo location."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-26,5.0,Stopped in while in from out of town looking for something other than Starbucks and will definitely be returning. The coffee was amazing and the staff was very friendly.

125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-09,4.0,"Pretty good iced coffee, if not also a little pricey. Then again, you're in SoHo. Mainly a little corner place for you to grab and then go, with a couple barstools and outside benches if you wanna enjoy your treats. Also really appreciated how they had almond milk out on the counter - places usually limit it to half and half or only dairy products."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2017-07-10,5.0,"Staying at the Solita Soho across the street was made even better with this tiny coffee shop across the street. I only delighted myself in the iced coffee, however, my friends who had one of the confectionaries said they were delicious, but the must be eaten fresh.

Coffee was good and they do have skim, just ask for it and they'll supply it in a little cup. The baristas were all really nice, the place was clean and well-kept and that delicious smell of coffee permeates even the most hungover soul. It's city-priced coffee so just go in knowing about the sticker shock."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-11,5.0,"Great coffee featuring Intelligentsia coffee, which is one of best roasters in America. 
Fun and friendly staff.
Very small space and only 2 seats. If lucky enough to land a seat, it's great for people watching."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-17,1.0,"Young gentleman who is definitely WAY too cool to be making coffee was immediately rude when I walked through the door with my service animal. When I asked if he could put sweetener at the bottom of my coffee his eyes rolled so far back in his head I thought he would faint. When he asked if I wanted 1 or 2 packets and I said 3, it was the same nasty look. When I explained my temporary bank card can only be used as a debit card, they turned me away. I live in the neighborhood and can honestly say this hipster racist behavior is unfair and unnecessary. Do they want to sell coffee or not? No wonder it was empty, no one likes a 'tude."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2017-06-01,3.0,"Needed a coffee fix and got a latte at this little place.  Nice service with cute latte art, but burnt coffee. 

Sad, because I wanted to like my drink since they were so nice.  Also, odd choice for a coffee shop name, IMO, but I guess I did still end up coming in here despite what it was called."
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-18,5.0,"Love their iced latte! Though a bit pricey, this is the only coffee shop that has consistently good coffee And the only reason I look forward to getting out of bed every morning!"
125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-01-21,5.0,"Best coffee in NYC. I am so particular and will go out of my way for this place.

125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2017-04-12,4.0,"Really small shop that's connected to a WeWork entrance. There are only 2 bar seats inside but they have 2 red long benches outside the shop that are nice to sit at during the spring/summer

Iced latte = $4.71 which is avg. they also brew Intelligensia. Lowkey feel like I got ripped off a little because my cup wasn't all the way filled with coffee. But overall service was rly nice and energetic."

125,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york-2,2018-04-01,3.0,"I can't believe I have to write this review. I come here multiple times a week - it's actually my favorite coffee shop in the city. However, today I encountered the most rude barista, hollering at me ""hey lady on the phone, I'm ready for your order whenever you are,"" while I waited in line. I was 4th in line and did not expect to get served until I got closer to the front, otherwise I would not have been checking the weather. Perhaps she could have said something else like, ""can I help the next person in line?"" or ""hi, how are you? what I can get for you?"" I'm sorry if she was having a bad day, but I went elsewhere for my coffee. 

The rest of the staff is great, chai lattes are great, and it's usually very cheerful in there. I won't be back - there are too many other coffee shops to frequent instead."

Four Stars

This super small coffee place makes a delicious cup of joe.  The $4 Cappuccino was worth every cent. The coffee had a touch of acidity, a nice sweet aroma, a light body, and almost chocolate taste.  The Trinity of Espresso, Steamed Milk, and Foam were in perfect harmony.  I have no complaints but absolute praise for the cup.  The only problem with the place is that there are only two stools to sit on.  Therefore you cannot enjoy with leisure. It is more of a stop in, order, and get out sort of place."

Located on the quiet corner of Grand and Lafayette, you can pop in and grab a quick house drip coffee or stay a few minutes longer on a stool for a far superior espresso beverage. My favorite is a simple Americano with a little room for cream. Throw in a Stroopwafel and you'll be all set for either a good start to your day or a quick pick-me-up to keep it going. 

It's a favorite spot of mine in NoLIta/SoHo."

The ""stay"" part was a two-seat area with a piece of plywood against the glass window.. it felt a little awkward to sit next to a complete stranger and the sugar/creamer/trash and stare at people passing by... but I got over it via the comfort of having my little smartphone distracting me.

The pastry was flaky and lovely - the espresso was a bit bitter (I dont add anything to mine, but they did offer up a small carafe of water to mix with your espresso if you wanted it a bit more ""americano"" style).

I most likely will be visiting this place in the future, but will get grabbing things ""to go"" next time."

The worst part about the staff is that they ask for your name when there is literally no one else in the shop -- then they write your name on the cup, turn around, fill it up and hand it straight back to you. The whole interaction is really annoying and painfully awkward."

The workers are pretty nice but are understandably rushed trying to get to everyone in the line. The seating there is like 5 tall chairs along a bar table. It's easier to just get it to go. I like how the location is at the edge so I tend to grab a bagel, eat outside and relax by the water.

Everything bagel with lox spread: I really love how they don't hold back with the spread! Usually most places give you too little spread but I always find that Leo's gives a really great ratio between spread and bagel.

Plain bagel with bacon, egg and cheese: I absolutely love how the cheese is super gooey when I get it. It works really well with the saltiness   of the bacon and the fluffiness of the eggs. Definitely recommend!"
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2020-02-23,4.0,"Was surprised to see such a long line outside of this bagel shop today, but glad people are making it out to get their Sunday morning bagel fix-in. 

While many were frustrated that they ran out of eggs this morning, I got the wild sockeye salmon sandwich on an everything bagel, with alfalfa sprouts instead of onions, and tried the tofu cream cheese for a non-dairy alternative.

Overall satisfied my personal Sunday morning lox bagel craving, so pretty happy. Service was speedy despite how crowded it was."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2020-02-04,3.0,"The line maybe long, but it goes by fast. I decided to give the bagel a try today I always see how packed it is and it got me curious, LOL. 

Their bagels are good, a lot of places their bagels only have the seasoning on the top of their bagels but their seasoning is all around. Maybe because I only ordered a bagel with cream cheese. Next time I'll give another try and other a different sandwich because I'm not sure what me so hyped about this bagel spot. Majority of the time  I walk by their line is outside."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2020-02-19,4.0,"I went to Leo's Bagels while in NYC, because it was close to our hotel. It is a very small bagel shop! There were about 10 people inside and that made it so crowded it was barely walkable. Along the front window, there was a small bar with about 5 stools if you chose to stay and eat your bagel. The staff is very quick at taking orders and making the bagels. They also make their own coffee, it was good! 
The shop has so many different flavors of bagels and spreads. I ordered the everything bagel toasted with cream cheese. My husband ordered a plain toasted bagel with cream cheese and jam. Both were very good! The everything bagel was very savory and warm with lots of cream cheese. My husbands jam and cream cheese bagel was also very good! His was very sweet and almost like a dessert! The bagels were good but also a little dense."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-10-25,5.0,"A love letter to a bagel, and the weirdest Yelp review I've ever written--

Dear Everything-Bagel-with-Whitefish-Salad-Wild-Sockeye-Salmon-Lettuce-and-Tomato, 

I love you. 

I honestly didn't know what to expect. People rave about New York bagels: ""You have to get one!"" But which one and from where?!

Fortunately, you were waiting for me at Leo's Bagels, a bagel shop just conveniently close enough for me to walk to from my post-interview location. 

(I didn't even know Leo's Bagels was a happening kind of place until I saw the line out the door and a lady forcing her children to take a photo with the sign!)

You were listed on a special menu, written by hand, on a big butcher paper roll. I was tempted by everything you contained--I'm a glutton (it's probably why I always go for an ""Everything"" bagel).  

Then, everything happened so fast. I ordered you (along with a cinnamon-raisin bagel with strawberry cream cheese). The man worked quickly and efficiently. No time for niceties, but I didn't care. 
Finally, you and your sweet, sister-bagel were handed to me in a brown paper bag. I stepped outside, triumphantly, but also worried--where would I consume you? 


Just a block down and around the corner I found the spot. There were all the other people happily enjoying their special bagel orders. Love in the air. Crumbs on their coats. Cream cheese on their chins. It was ~magical. 
Unwrapping you was a delight. Seeing your exposed halves absolutely stuffed with layers of whitefish, salmon, tomato, and lettuce...it was inspiring. I held your toasty, seed crusted, bagel exterior with both hands, opened wide, and took a bite. 

And it was everything. There was nothing to complain about. There was just flavor and crunch and creaminess and goodness to experience. It didn't take long for me to finish. 

I can't wait to have you again. 

-Merly
---------------------
Thank you Leo's Bagels for making my first NYC bagel experience so awesome. Also, that cinnamon-raisin bagel with strawberry cream cheese was amazing. They're so generous with the cream cheese and the bagels are toasted beautifully. (I love that they're chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside.) 

The only thing I'm concerned about, is that if I ever move to NYC, Leo's Bagels is probably going to contribute to my needing to be air-lifted out of my house some day."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-10-19,4.0,"Half hour wait on a Saturday morning at 10am. Not horrible, but not something I'd be willing to do regularly.

The portions are large, and they're generous with the fillings (salmon, onions, tomatoes, and cream cheese). The bagel was a bit hard for my taste (I like them soft and chewy). Taste was pretty good.

If the wait was shorter, I'd probably go more."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-10-27,5.0,"Disregard the 3.5 stars this place gets on yelp! I was deciding between this place and Russ & Daughters...so glad I picked Leo's. Underrated. 

Norwegian smoked salmon with scallion cream cheese on  an everything - holy sheeeet. The salmon was the freshest I've ever had on a lox. Melts in your mouth. Not rubbery or chewy whatsoever. We added tomatoes as well & was delicious. 10000/10

Cream cheese with everything - delicious & generous amount of cream cheese 

Two eggs with cheese on everything - perfectly cooked and love how they wrap it up neatly. Stays warm. Eggs were fluffy."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2020-02-10,4.0,"We get these bagels in office every Friday at 9am. They are always fresh and soft. I always put the scallion cream cheese on mine. I should go visit and try something more some day. From this experience, I would recommend."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-10-08,5.0,"Alright yelp, a hyper touristy / instagram-popular spot, so I'll give the people what they want- short and simple:

- yes, it lives up to the hype. 5 stars.
- probably a little pricier, but the flavor and portion are there. I got a lox spread everything bagel at 8 and wasn't hungry until 2.
- super toasty but fluffy bagel
- lox spread was fire
- line was about 15 mins at 8 am on a Friday workday
- one of the best bagels in NYC for sure, can see why it gets hyped up.

Would go back!"
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-09-13,5.0,"I regularly visit this bagel shop when in the mood for a bagel with unique cream cheese. My favorite spreads are the olive and tomato garlic spreads with a savory bagel.  I've also had the wild sockeye salmon bagel which didn't come with as much cream cheese as the normal bagels, but had quality smoked fish. 
This place is pretty averaged priced for a bagel shop but the lines can be long in the weekday mornings. There's also little seating space so I often go to the park or Starbucks around the corner to eat my bagel with coffee."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2020-01-03,4.0,"We had Leo's bagels for breakfast. Lovely fillings. Good presentation. Good and tasty ingredients.The bread was nice but not as I expected; it was rather hard which I guess must be as the bread is toasted so it holds the filling and doesn't become soggy.
I usd a vegetarian one but sadly my partner forgot to ask for cream cheese filling... I guess I will have to return one more time .
My fiancée had the salmon one and said it was good, and enjoyed it.
The other people in our group had the pastrami and turkey bagels, they really enjoyed theirs.
Price was not bad considering the size of the bagel sandwiches. There is no space in the shop so eating in is out of the question!."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-11-28,3.0,"Bagels in New York all have a distinct flavorful taste. I've never had a toasted bagel in New York that I didn't like.

I appreciate that Leo's is open on Thanksgiving Day because it was a solid breakfast.

But, where Leo's falls short is the confusion on ordering for first timers. You need to state every topping you want added onto your bagel. For example, I said ""I want a toasted salmon lox with poppy seed bagel..."" and the guy made me a cream cheese bagel with smoked salmon. He didn't ask me if I wanted anything else. I've always known a salmon lox to have capers, onions, and tomatoes.

Their menu is awkwardly placed in the right corner behind the fridge, literally seconds before you order. In order to expedite the line and eliminate confusion, Leo's should really move the menu overhead with clear step by step instructions."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-12-09,4.0,"Leo's has very solid bagels and breakfast sandwiches. I've only had their sesame seed, but I really enjoyed it. The sausage, egg, and cheese is delicious and was made very promptly despite the long long line. 

I wish that the line was more organized, I feel like the place lacks efficiency at times making it a bit confusing to know where to go and in what order. Other than that, I think they make a solid NY style bagel in FiDi."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-12-28,5.0,"A tiny place with large, full of ingredients, delicious bagels.  I could eat them every day"
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-10-23,3.0,"Some great options, I enjoyed it. The bagel was a little hard and I had to chew a lot. There was great flavor though."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-04-05,4.0,"I ordered from here a couple times, but most recently I got a two egg sandwich... scooped everything bagel, egg whites, cheddar cheese, and avocado. Always ordered from seamless, so I can't speak to what it's like to eat there. Bagel was hot/warm, somewhere in between I guess. Flavor was good but the egg whites were a little wet so when I pressed the bagel to bite it it dropped a little and by the time I finished the second half it was a little soggy. Not a big deal to me, I was really hungry and it did taste good.

Second time I ordered just now was a scooped everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and lox. I placed the order at 2:20 and the estimated delivery time on seamless was between 3:40 and 3:50. This location is literally a block and a half away from me so it got here at 3. The bagel was really good and the iced chai is also really good (tastes similar if not better than starbucks). 

I definitely like this spot, as well as pick a bagel and Zucker's. This might be my new go-to though, especially during the day."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-09-27,5.0,"I am truly shocked by the kind of low rating, because I loved Leo's Bagels enough to eat it twice for breakfast during my 4.5 day stay in NY. Both times I opted for a ""salami omelette"" bagel, which amounted to salami and scrambled egg on a bagel (I chose pumpernickel), and then I also added the sundried tomato and roasted garlic cream cheese. It was so good! The bagel was nice and chewy but not too chewy, and they didn't skimp on anything in the bagel. The cream cheese was excellent and bursting with flavor. I got hot coffee and that was tasty as well. The line was out the door the first time I went on a Friday morning but it was worth the maybe 20 mins of waiting. This will still be my go to bagel place next time I'm in the FiDi area."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-04-06,5.0,"Stopped into Leo's Bagels on Wednesday morning. Fantastic bagels in a bustling operation.

Quality: A very high quality bagel, definitely worth the wait. Constantly fresh because of the high demand, it has wonderful skin and a soft interior. The Scallion Spread is as good as they come. The bagels here showcase why New York is iconic for the breakfast item.
Quantity: It is a large bagel with a ton of spread.
Value: $4.25 for an Everything Bagel and Scallion Spread.
Ambiance: In the mornings Leo's Bagels is easy to spot in the FiDi of Manhattan as it is the only place with a line outside. The inside area of the shop is very small and not meant for folks to eat-in. Grab your bagel or bagels and find another spot to enjoy. However, take in the fresh smells while inside.
Crowd: Always a line in the morning, does not matter the day of the week.
Service: No time for messing around. Order what you want and make your way down the line.
Parking: Don't expect to find easy parking."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-11-22,3.0,This bagel place wouldn't be my first option in the city. The cream cheese was really good but the bagel itself was really hard and chewy. It wasn't terrible but for the price I could get something way better. I got the sun-dried tomato Cream cheese with everything bagel and  cinnamon cream cheese with raisin bagel. The bagels overall were a little bit hard they weren't soft as usual in NYC.
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-11-19,3.0,"There are tons of better bagels in NYC. If you are restricted to finding a good bagel just in the FiDi, though then this is one of few options and it was not a bad bagel by any means but it was not great. I went in with a group of 6 and all of us agreed that we would not have waited on line for 25 minutes for this bagel if we had known it was only OK, not great. 
They say they have GF bagels but when I got to the counter to order I was made aware that they were out. Luckily for me GF is just a preference and not an allergy so I was able to get a regular cinnamon raisin bagel with butter. However, if you stood on line for half an hour to find that they are out of GF bagels and you actually have an allergy, that would be quite frustrating.
They got my friends order wrong twice, too. 

In short, I would come back here if the line was less than 5 minutes long and I was right near by but I would never go out of my way to come back here and would not recommend it to others."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-10-30,4.0,"I live in fidi, so I've been here a couple of times now. To be completely honest, I am not sure why this place only has 3.5 stars, as it is totally on par with some of the more famous bagel places in the city.

Every time I've been here, the bagels are fresh and of the correct consistency! The prices are not out of the ordinary and the cream cheese is delicious. 

Their norwegian smoked salmon sandwich with onions, capers, tomatos, and scallion cream cheese on an everything bagel is everything you neeed. So good and satisfying it's the perfect saturday morning/sunday brunch food. Honestly the sandwich is so huge, you could probably split it into two meals."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-10-25,2.0,"I'm not sure who told the line of tourists that form each day outside Leo's that these bagels are worth standing in that kind of line. It's your standard cream cheese; bacon, egg and cheese; lox; etc. bagel place. The store is quite small, so expect to eat on the go, at your eventual destination, or in slight discomfort. 

You can order delivery quite early in the morning, which is a rarity amongst downtown establishments. However, I'd say 1 in every 3 bagels I've purchased is absolutely horrendous (and I've probably purchased somewhere around 50). The bagel will be stale, tougher than beef jerky, and left out over night(s?) to age. It's hard to make a bagel inedible, but Leo's manages to pull it off a third of the time. 

If Leo's has decided to grace you with a fresh bagel, they're fluffy, tearable (whether toasted or not) and flavorful. I know whoever is serving the bagels must think ""yeah I know this is an old bagel but it should be fine."" That kind of thinking has to stop. Throw those bagels out, always serve fresh ones, and the star rating will improve. Until then, it looks like revenue will depend on apparently duped tourists rather than regulars."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-11-30,5.0,"Glad I found this spot.  Had the BEC on a sesame bagel.  No complaints.  I know no one puts salt or pepper, so was expecting to have to toss some on.  No biggie.  It's in a pretty busy area, so the line may be out the door, but it moves fast.  The whole staff seemed to be working well, and they were super polite.  Thanks for my breakfast guys!  I'll be back.

No public restroom."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2020-01-21,1.0,"The bagels are only ok, I guess if every other bagel place is closed then go here. 

Here's the other thing. I can handle rude and surly, I actually really like that most places. BUT, this place was not just rude, they were mean spirited. 

I asked for an everything bagel toasted with plain cream cheese, but the guy didn't hear my (because it was crowded) and didn't toast it. Easy to fix, just remake it dude, it's a bagel and it isn't coming out of your check. But nope, guy insisted he couldnt remake it. 

Guy behind me ordered a lox bagel and the same guy who made mine rolled his eyes for not wanting tomato on it, not in a fun way either."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-04-06,4.0,"Went here on a Saturday morning. We got there around 9:45 am and there was a 15-20 minute line. My friend lives right around the corner and swore this is the only good bagel place in the financial district. 
I got a scallion everything bagel and my boyfriend got The Leo which had lox, eggs, and onions. We both loved it. Coffee was just okay. 
Once we ordered we probably waited 5 minutes to receive our food.
I'm only giving the price 4 stars because of how expensive it is."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-02-17,4.0,"Had a belly lox on sesame bagel for brunch for $10.95 + tax. Yeah, it was good and filling. But it was so expensive for a bagel. $10.95 is actually the cheapest smoked salmon bagel on the menu. They have a larger variety of smoked salmon bagel here than Russ & Daughter's, which I think is impressive.

I pass by Leo's Bagel every morning and there's always a long line outside, rain or shine. The line goes fast though, my wait was less than 10 minutes. 

My bagel had nothing but smoked salmon in it. It doesn't even have crème fraîche. It was delicious but dry. I imagine adding some salmon roe to it. 

Overall, Leo's Bagel is probably one of the better bagel places in downtown Manhattan."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-07-25,1.0,"Mediocre. $7.62 for a mediocre, tasteless and bland BEC. Kind of surprised at all of the ""best bagel ever!"" reviews. I feel bad, because obviously a whole ton of people haven't had an actual amazing bagel.

Was googling for a decent BEC and came across this place. Got there around 10:45 am and the line was out the door. For that line, I was expecting a better bagel. I prefer a thinner, crunchier bagel. These are thick and doughy. Even after asking for it to be toasted, it was doughy and didn't have that crunch I love. Asked for my bacon to be well done, opened it up and the pieces were fatty and white. Had to microwave it for a full minute to get the crunchy crispy bacon I like. Also, not sure how it's possible for a BEC sandwich to be bland, especially on an everything bagel, but they succeeded. Not even in the top 5 places for best BEC. I guess the saying is right. There's nothing like a Queens bagel. 

Unrelated to my sandwich, the tuna and egg salads and cream cheeses were in a small, cramped and dark space under the counter. Nothing sitting there looked particularly appetizing. There were also dead black flies laying on the tops of the ""fresh"" juices in the front. Definitely not a place I'll be returning to."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-07-28,5.0,"Lazy Sunday morning in FiDi, and I'm finally hungry again after medical treatment. I nudge hubby out the door to go hunt and gather at Leo's on Hanover, where the line was probably growing quickly. He returned with bad news: toaster oven was out (grrrr...lots of grumpy people ahead for them, I imagine). Good news: still had fresh bagels. Phew. 
I got a whole wheat everything (untoasted ) with sundried tomato cream cheese--a scoop so big, it would cover three bagels. The bagel was thick and chewy and tasty and gorgeous. So glad I got a couple for home (a garlic and a pumpernickel). Next time, I'll get a hopefully-toasted everything (not whole wheat) with a little butter and a light spread of plain cream cheese. 
My husband said the muffins (2 cranberry nut) were just okay. I reminded him that it's ""Leo's Bagels, dude.""  Next time, he'll get an everything, too."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2020-03-04,5.0,"I found Leo's on Yelp and it's definitely my favorite bagel in not just fidi, but potentially the entire city. Expect long lines as it is a very small store front with only so much standing room. Weekends can get out of hand - lines down the block. But all worth it. Highly recommend."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,Stopped by for some breakfast bagel sandwiches. The line was out the door because the restaurant is mall but it was definitely worth the wait! They have all different kinds of bagels with different meats and condiments you can add. The bagels themselves were very soft and tasty. Definitely recommend if you're in the FiDi area.
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-11-18,4.0,"I've never actually waited in line for a bagel...I've been super lucky to have someone bring me one, so this is strictly about the sandwich they brought. One winner is everything bagel with chive cream cheese. The king of the castle goes to the lox and cream cheese everything bagel. It was sublime and worth whatever line exists outside."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-12-12,4.0,"Stopped by here after our hotel recommended them. When we got there, there was a decent line, but it moved quickly. Ordering process was simple, however, the two people in front of us were ordering about 12 different bagels for a large group of people so that was frustrating. Everyone was friendly (well as friendly as they can be while trying to get people out the door). My bagel was great, and I would recommend this to anyone else staying in the financial district."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-07-19,4.0,This place has their system down. My group of friends casually stumbled upon this place one morning while we were in search of a good NY bagel spot. The line was around the corner but moved quickly. We looked at the menu while we waited as there is little time to think once you get to the counter. They have a variety of bagels to pick from along with pretty much every topping combination you could think of (including a huge variety of Lox!) Be prepared with your order as soon as you get to the counter to expedite the process. My bagel was made perfectly despite how busy they were. I ordered a coffee as well which wasn't anything to brag about but did the trick. I was satisfied and happy after eating my bagel. My friends all enjoyed their food as well.
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2020-01-15,2.0,"The two-star is not based on the bagel. I actually liked the bagels here. 

The ding of three-stars is from poor service and connected to poor experience; I don't have the best eyesight in the world and was looking at the menu to choose what to get. There wasn't anybody waiting behind me because I let the others go and looking for what to have. The bagel-maker stares at me with impatience (there's nobody behind me and you can just wait for me)- come on, be a tad bit more patient. 

As I was rushed to read the menu and couldn't see what breakfast bagel sandwich options I had, I was so pissed of his stare and ordered a plain bagel with cream cheese. 

Relax- if there's no crowd behind me and I'm the only one in the store- what is there to rush?"
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2018-12-24,4.0,"I came here with my team to grab some bagels on a friday morning. The line was out the door to the corner but it moved relatively quickly, luckily it wasnt too cold outside. The place itself is pretty small inside with practically no seating so definitely take your bagel to go unless you can snag a stool by the window. 

I got an everything bagel with gravlax, scallion cream cheese, and tomato. It was very good and I loved the taste of the lox. They have a large variety of fish to put on your bagel and I'm looking forward to trying some other varieties when I'm back in the area."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-04-20,4.0,"""Get a NYC bagel!"" they said.
""The NYC bagel is a must have!"" they said.
So I procured myself one just before ubering back to Newark and going back to Cali (R.I.P. Notorious B.I.G.) 
Small space with long liiiiines, however, locals are so damn proficient at ordering and getting out of the way of one another, I just felt like a sluggish and inconvenient lump trying to figure out what I wanted to order. But the employees get everyone their breakfast items so quickly! The delivery people zip in and out for their orders so seamlessly too, sheesh!
But of course...it was a longer wait time for the breakfast bagel I finally decided on 
-ugh, why must I be so extra?! But worth it! It was a tasty, messy breakfast, difficult to eat while walking, passing up all the well dressed lawyers that work in FiDi as I stuffed my face with bagel and its fixings."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2018-10-15,3.0,"Not a bad little bagel spot somewhat close to my hotel (the Hilton Garden Inn). The shop was small so we opted to get our bagels and coffee to go. I may have enjoyed it a little more if I wasn't trying to balance myself on a subway while eating. 

One of my favorite things about Leo's was the variety of bagels and cream cheese flavors. I went with a classic sesame bagel but splurged on the low-fat sun-dried tomato and garlic cream cheese. 

The large coffee I ordered was just okay. Sometimes bagels shops are hidden gems of coffee spots, but sometimes they just aren't. No biggie. 

We were able to quickly get our bagel and hit the road"
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-04-04,3.0,"**update

I came to the wonderful Leo's to grab a tuna bagel and I was 100% dissatisfied with my meal. Which to be completely honest upsets me. I ordered a flatty for the first time so if I'm wrong feel free to correct me. My flatty was very tough to bite and parts were rock hard. I couldn't bite into the bagel easily. I literally was gnawing pieces off to chew. Is that how it's supposed to be? If so I'll pass on those. Also, the tuna was just ehh. Not good. Very messy. Most of it fell off while trying to bite a piece of my very tough bagel. So I pretty much just ate a tough, hard flatty that was coated in tuna. Not how I imagined my lunch to be. Maybe I'll just stick to the breakfast sandwiches."
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-05-18,5.0,"Yes, yes, yes!!! Hand rolled bagels with tons of sandwich options. They had omelet bagels and egg bagels.

I would come back in a heartbeat if we were in town longer!"
126,leos-bagels-new-york,2019-03-22,4.0,"This place was soo packed. We waited in line over 30 mins. When we placed our order for our bagel, they  said we will have to wait 20 mins for eggs for the bagel.  

We end up not ordering it. I ordered  the everything bagel with tomato cream cheese.  I also wanted the everything whole wheat bagel but they ran out. :( 

The bagel + tomato cream cheese  was da bomb! Love it ! The bagel was crispy on the outside n so fluffy in the inside!!! I never tasted bagel like this! Yums!!! I just wished they have things as they advertised. Beware: you may not be able to order  what  you want initially.  what you want on the menu might not be available."

Probably the best coffee I had in a long time. The barista was really friendly and would joke around with the customers. We got two coffee's and they were delicious. I lucked out cause I would imagine they generally have a line but somehow we missed it. Minimal waiting, and once I got inside it was really quick. I'm so happy I took the recommendation and I will be coming back!"
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-11-12,4.0,"Cute little coffee shop in a unique location nestled into the entrance of a residential building. There is no room whatsoever to stay in the store and enjoy your coffee, not due to some flaw in the business but by its very design. There are small snacks available (rugelach and macaroons (the coconut kind)) and a cup of black coffee is cheaper than other coffee spots (that aren't McDonald's) in the neighborhood (see Black Fox, Blue Bottle, Konditori). 

It seems there are loyalty cards/programs as I earned some ""points"" on square. The drip coffee is standard, maybe skewing towards burnt (or bold?) and I had no wait whatsoever. I'll definitely stop by on my way to work whenever I notice there is not a long line or wait."

127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-03-10,4.0,"6 months ago, I didn't even like coffee--like, at all. 
Then my lips collided with the thick, frothy macadamia milk cappuccino at Proof and my life was literally changed. I hadn't even heard of macadamia milk before this changed everything, and I mean it. If you haven't had a cappuccino with macadamia nut milk, I'd say this is the void in your life you've been looking to fill.

Proof looks like one of those hole-in-the-walls (and it kinda is), except it's fancy for a rougher-looking part of Downtown. The baristas here are amazing and really look out for you to make sure you walk out of that door satisfied. A small, 8-oz cup of coffee is a bit more expensive than the small-sized cup you'd get at many coffee shops, but you are also paying for the quality and location. They're coffee tastes freshly-brewed with no weird after-taste, and not like it's been sitting around for hours. It's a nice mid-day treat to get every once in awhile and to keep me sane for the rest of the day. Like most places in FiDi, this is a grab-and-go place with no seating."

This charming little hole-in-the-wall has the best coffee and service in FiDi. And trust me, I've tried just about every coffee place in the area. It's grab-and-go style, so there's no seating - but if you're looking for somewhere to sit, Zuccotti Park is right around the corner and always has tons of open benches. 

They have a wide selection of non-dairy milk options. My husband and I shared an almond flat white and it was perfection. Smooth, just the right amount of nutty tones. 

Shout-out to Ian who was everything you could ever hope a barista to be - friendly, exuberant, knowledgeable. Ian filled the place with good vibes that would put even the sourest of people in a good mood.

We'll definitely be back!"

The cafe itself is pretty small but there is a decent amount of seating. It's in the middle of a residential block so we were a bit confused looking for it, but we found it without too much trouble. It's nice because it's surrounded by trees, so it's a little oasis in the middle of Kip's Bay. 

Service was good, there was only one guy running the show but it wasn't that crowded so there were no issues.

Very minimal ham and no cheese implanted as it was a lot of breading.  The croissant was not well baked nor prepared.  Ham and cheese in a croissant... where?  I don't see it nor do I taste it.  Starbucks carries this pastry and it actually contains sufficient ham and cheese implanted inside the croissant."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-03-05,5.0,I lived in the area for two years and once Proof opened up I had no reason to go anywhere else for my coffee. Now that I no longer live in the area I have proof withdrawals and am awaiting the day until I return. This coffee is the best in NY. I wish there was one on every block.
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-03-30,5.0,"Proof is one of the only non-chain coffee shops open on Sunday mornings in FiDi. The actual shop is tiny (there's probably room for 3 customers to stand comfortably inside), but the barista was warm, friendly, and very polite. I ordered an oat milk latte which I thoroughly enjoyed."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-11-22,5.0,"Fantastic matcha latte! Highly recommend. Sarah, the Barista during the weekdays, is friendly and makes a great cup. A little expensive, but definitely worth it."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2017-09-29,5.0,"Update- 9/28/19- quickly becoming my favorite neighborhood (next to work) coffee shop, well spot. The baristas know what they are doing or they are working with a superior product. Or both. I get the large latte, sometimes with an extra shot of espresso, always extra hot. But more recently upon discovering they have caramel- sauce not syrup, so I've been asking for their caramel latte, extra lg extra hot. And it's the best one I've had!

Every single time I come in here I fight an internal war of not ordering the almond croissant. I must be a glutton for punishment as I've been in a dozen times now and ordered everything but the one thing that is so delicious that I have to divvy it up in portions before I suck the whole thing down in 5 minutes. Choc macaroon is good and not too sweet. Rugalach is good if u like a lot of dried rehydrated fruit and more of a denser rugalach n not the dry crispy kind. Chocolate croissant, they call it something else in francais~ interesting. Definitely more of a soft pop tart thickness with a light cheese layer. It's good but not flaky nor chocolate filled like the traditional one. Have not tried their cookies, donut, waffle, nor oatmeal- whose packaging is really calling my name. Oh how I miss you almond croissant- it's only been a week!



Update 9/19- so I found out through a very friendly and inviting, Jeff who told me where they get their almond croissant n pastries from. Entirely stoked. Adrian who made my flat white gave me the option of making it as hot as possible before burning it or just burn it (10 guesses). I attempted to use my groupon deal in which Adrian couldn't find the gift cards that jeff had in his possession and just couldnt hold their line up, asked me if I minded that this one's on the house and that I'd get my voucher at a different time. Hell yea I mind getting great service and an offer like that. I mind so much that I have to gripe about their inexcusable behavior at PRoof this am. Come see Jeff and Adrian guys, they are funny, fun, good guys that really enjoy the art of coffee n apparently sweets n if u r lucky, servicing really obnoxiously.

I'm solely writing this due to an unexpected, serendipitous, grateful rendezvous with a pastry this morning. 

I walked into Proof because I was at another coffeeteria yesterday, and passed by en route to work and there was a line. I had to know. 

Adorable 3x5, no bigger than the entirety of a large kitchen island in some big house, Proof is neat, efficient, and to the point. There is exactly enough room for 3 patrons to stand inside at a time. But there was ample space for a seasoned barista to service nicely. And he was great. 

Back to the Reason: the almond pastry. Almost religious. Hands down the best almond croissant, any croissant I've  had to date. Flakey, sweet, oozing of buttery creamy almond paste, crusty w an sweetened crust and powdered sugar- it was a mess to eat and I've gotten it all over my desk and my outfit.

I only allowed myself half so far (I'm sure I'll down the other half in the next 20 minutes)... and I'll say this is one dessert/ pastry I will run 3 miles for. To the exercise-prone, you know that's high praise."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-03-12,4.0,"Never heard of Proof until this morning as I was heading into PALS (pediatric advanced life support) class. Solid place for coffee, prices are slightly heavier than chains, but who cares when there's novelty? Not a lot of space to study or sit, but if you're heading to Maiden Lane, and in need of coffee, I would definitely stop by. They have oat milk, amongst other choices of non-diary milk. There are some pastries in the mix too, but the drip coffee is real tasty and smooth. Seems like they alternate beans from various countries - I had a Colombian blend that the barista didn't know too much about in terms of the flavor profiles, but NYC has spoiled me, and made me a coffee snob. So I gotta chill on my bougie coffee vibes. Definitely recommend if you're in need of a quick drip coffee, and both hot or cold lattes."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-10-11,5.0,Rachel is amazing. Best little spot to get coffee. The Nutella latte is a must!! So so so so good. Come here. You won't regret it.
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-02-03,5.0,"Hands down the best best coffee in New York. And I am serious about my coffee! The pour overs are the smoothest most delish. My husband and I jump out of bed on the weekend to get coffee :) also, try the macadamia nut milk - holy moly.

The vibe has a lot of doctors and med students since near the hospital so you can also meet really nice smart people.

Damian always makes our coffee special and knows our order. A true pleasure and you can taste his passion for the coffee."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-11-14,5.0,Such good coffee I had to come in a second time! Usually get a oat milk latte and it's a hit for me.. Rachel at this location was amazing and so welcoming as well... love the coffee and taste coming here forever!
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-05-24,5.0,"TLDR: Top 5 best NY coffee for sure!

My wife is the coffee drinker, not me... so this is her review. Always when reviewing coffee places, I have to mention her tastes, so you know where she's coming from. She loves dark strong coffee, she takes it with cream and no sugar. Her favorite coffee drink is Americano. Anything weak, she will call it ""coffee water"".

According to her, this coffee is just behind Blue Bottle in taste, which makes this the second best coffee she's had in New York. The best coffee in her mind, is still an Italian cafe in Seattle.  It's very strong, has a good aromatic coffee odor. As mentioned in other reviews, this place is super small. It's really an overglorified coffee stand, but that's fine. When we went there around 2p, there was no line."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-07-19,4.0,Hole in the wall spot featuring pretty solid hot coffee and cold brew. Service is usually pretty quick and the only guy I've ever seen working there is really nice. My go-to spot for coffee in the morning.
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-07-24,5.0,Love their coffee. And the awesome service provided by Carlos! Very personable. Definitely my go to spot for my morning Joe.
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-02-07,5.0,"This small storefront cranks out the best coffee and pastries in the area. If you're at all on the fence, consider the fact that sleepy-eyed regulars are willing to brave the elements, for the chance to squeeze inside, in pairs, just to get a taste.

If you're in need of further proof, swing by and visit Carlos. Not only will he provide you expert service, but, send you on your way with a smile on your face and a cup of liquid speed in hand.

Bonus: there's a good chance you'll get to see AT LEAST one doggo."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-04-25,5.0,"This has become my new go-to on work days: great coffee and pastries, and how fantastic is it to find a place where the barista remembers the orders of the regulars and has it ready to go when you hit the counter? To me that's worth so much."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2017-10-07,5.0,"Favorite coffee window in ALL of Manhattan and especially in FiDi. You know FiDi isn't the trendiest (although it has changed over the years), this place makes a mean espresso and an almond milk latte. You know some people can mess it up b/c it doesn't have the same thickness as regular milk.

And - I can grab my beloved almond flaky croissant. So all that butter, I don't care and so worth the morning workout to eat it. 

Awesome place, please don't ever close up shop or expand. Because I like it the way you are!"
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-07-19,5.0,Best staff and amazing coffee! Would def recommend coming here for your local coffee. Usually get cold brew or a quick espresso.
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-06-19,5.0,"I go to a lot of coffee shops around the city but this place gets 5 stars because Ian is the most friendly barista I've ever met. He made an otherwise boring morning super entertaining. Especially in NY, I've never had someone at a coffee shop or any store be so friendly and kind."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-01-29,1.0,"I'm sure that, per one of the reviews, they have a splendid matcha latte. Unfortunately, after asking for a matcha latte twice, I ended up with something with chocolate syrup in it. And definitely no matcha. This was on the 2nd try; after the first, the person behind the counter argued that matcha lattes have espresso in them when I questioned why they the drink was brown. No. She was clearly new on the job and trying her best. Come on!"
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-08-16,5.0,Great coffee and a heads up for my fellow celiacs that when I picked up my espresso today I saw they sell certified gluten free oatmeal.

127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-01-24,2.0,"rating because coffee ""shop"" advertises wifi but has no space to sit. It's more of a coffee stand, grab-and-go situation. If listing on Yelp as a ""coffee shop w / wifi"" one would assume you could fit more than 1 guest at a time at the stand or bar. I know space in NYC is tight, but this felt falsely advertised."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-10-17,5.0,Love this place. Their coffee is great and service is always friendly - will be my new go-to for pre-work caffeine!
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-02-06,5.0,"Great quick spot for your morning coffee. High quality brew, and very friendly baristas. Be sure to say hi Carlos, he makes the best latte in the city."
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-06-20,4.0,Very tiny. I mean like only two people can really fit inside. I came here last week and honestly that's all I have to say. It's not on my way to work so I'm not sure I'll be back soon for a second try. I think the coffee was good overall but really nothing memorable other than it being tiny. I remember they had some pastry options. Don't come here when there's bad weather. Ha.
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2017-06-01,4.0,"Proof is a small coffee bar, well I should say coffee window to be more precise, as the place was literally a hole in the wall and could fit at most three people inside. It carried decent coffee (Proof beans) though, and offered some sweet goodies to pair up with the espresso drinks.

One of the better coffee shops in FiDi. If you were about to miss it, just pay attention to the huge white board on the shelf and you will be spot on.

Wish that it could offer more specialty drinks!"
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-09-06,5.0,My absolute favorite guy. Thanks for paying attention and for great coffee and for making my mornings better!!
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-01-07,3.0,They let Amanda leave and what a HUGE mistake.  Place will never be the same - wait is getting worse the Starbucks.   Coffee is excellent but wait makes it not worth it.
127,proof-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-04-05,5.0,"Thank you Ritual! 

Ritual had been promoting Proof to me for a few days now and seeing that I only work 5 minutes away I decided to give this place a shot. The Chai Latte and Almond Cream Croissant here are amazing, by far the best I've had for both. 10/10 would recommend and would come back again!"
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2020-02-16,4.0,"Holy moly! Wanted to give 5 stars but it's expensive and the portions are small. However...

I'm obsessed with this cafe! I just engulfed their prosciutto sandwich and I'm left drooling. Superb composition of ingredients. I do a little switcharoo and replace the mozzarella with goat cheese. So nice that they allow us to make these substitutions! 

Sooo on a pressed French baguette, I order prosciutto, arugula, pesto, I add sliced cherry tomatoes and of course substitute the mozzarella with goat cheese. What a flavor bomb!

Delivery was lightning fast and my sandwich came so beautifully put together. Not just ingredients thrown onto bread. The cherry tomatoes were sliced perfectly and arranged on the bread in a way where every bite gets a piece (these things matter to me). 

The quality of the prosciutto is there, the arugula was crunchy and seasoned perfectly, pesto was fresh/packed a nice punch and the bread was of perfect density. Bravo guys!"
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2020-01-03,4.0,"I used to love coming here when I lived in the neighborhood a couple years back. The only downfall is the slow service and that it's cash only. Other than that, this place is the perfect, chill vibe one would look for to hang out in at a coffee shop in the east village area. They have everything from pastries, soup/salad/sandwiches, and most importantly coffee. Whenever I got the cappuccino to stay, it was in a large cup, which I really enjoyed. They have loyalty cards so if you visit 10x, you get a 10th soup or sandwich free- same goes for coffee. It's filled with local artists and students and has an outside bench where you can sit for a cigarette break. Super relaxed. It does close earlier than most shops depending on the day, so be sure to check that before you get there at 5pm and it's about to close for the day."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2019-04-12,5.0,"Coffee is great! I came here on a whim because of the great Yelp reviews and definitely don't regret it. I ordered a dirty chai and it was delicious! There is a possibility to substitute for your choice of milk. The indoor area is cozy and the staff lets you work and sit there for hours (I was there for 2 with my laptop!) Everyone is super friendly and it doesn't hurt that the coffee is yummy. 

Pro tip: I think this place is cash only - there was a sign by the register. So remember to bring bills!"
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2019-08-07,5.0,"The best cafe in the neighborhood. I go there for breakfast and to work every morning. The coffee is great and breakfast is good cafe fare with an Israeli twist. The staff is professional, courteous and eager to help with anything, including printer jams. Huge, sunny windows up front. There're tables to eat and work at, though I prefer the comfy sofa and chairs. WiFi of course, but also the aforementioned printer, a key exchange box for arbnb users, and you can order your food on their app for easy pickup. No one talks to anyone else, which I notice millennials like, but as an older guy, I can still say hello, how are you to people and they generally return the greeting. Bear in mind, they're cash only. There's an ATM with $2.50 fee there. The one in the smoke shop down the block is $1.75."

They have tables reserved for non-laptop using diners/patrons which is really nice! The menu is extensive and there is something for everyone. The windows are great for people watching--there's a lot that goes on on the corner of streets. 

Pastries are all handmade by the owner/barista and they're very popular! Highly recommend."

A nice little neighborhood spot with a cozy feel.
Servers are friendly and accommodating. Just keep in mind that if you are coming to do work, come early as it will get crowded. 

Ordered the dirty chai latte, so yummy and the perfect amount of sweet. I would have taken. Photo of the sandwich (prosciutto, mozzarella, tomato, arugula, avocado and pesto on French baguette and pressed un a panini press) if I hadn't scarfed it down so quickly. A great spot!"
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2019-11-10,2.0,"Someone needs to tell this place it's almost 2020 so there's no excuse for being ""cash only"" with companies like Square. 

More importantly, $4 for a medium sized iced coffee that wasn't even good? The layout in here is weird. Yes there's seating, but it's overly crowded, especially when there's a line at the ATM (yes, there's an ATM inside this small coffee shop). Someone should alert the IRS of this place because something doesn't add up here."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2019-07-07,5.0,My absolute favorite cafe. All the employees are so nice. The lattes are amazing. The menu is huge so you can basically get something great for breakfast and lunch. I just discovered this place and ended up going 3 days in a row. I definitely recommend and iced latte with almond milk!
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2020-02-28,4.0,Coffee and the general feel is pretty good! A little cramped but i def didn't mind. I didnt get to try the food but hopefully on my next visit I'll be able too cause it looked so good.
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2019-02-03,4.0,"Really great place to hang out or get work done! Variety of seating options (tables, couches, benches), lots of outlets, good coffee at decent price (great latte for $4). Excellent music (groovy classic rock). 4 stars because it's pretty smokey; after working there for a few hours I really started to crave fresh air and probably wouldn't recommend working there too regularly for your lungs sake."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2019-01-15,4.0,The specials are delicious. The shakshuka I ordered was presented in a charming steel pan and came with half a beautifully crusty baguette that sopped up all the saucy eggs perfectly and had me wanting more. Their OJ is also fresh squeezed and refreshing and the lattes around me seemed great. Wish the seating in the back was a bit more comfortable and better suited for eating ie. Coffee table height vs bench height. We ended up there because we had a larger group of 4 and most of the tables had filled up on a busy Saturday afternoon.
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-03-23,4.0,"Cute little cafe - corner of East 13 st. Down in Lower East Village - funky vibe and felt like a local. Free WiFi, open 7 Days a week 730 am to 7 pm. Cafe with local baked goods and staff recommended Peppermint Latte in which I did not refuse - had it with almond milk. Quick and friendly service. Space to sit in front of cafe - bar like are with couches and then working space with tables.  Since the place was full, we opted for ""to- go"" cups and walked around the village and towards the waterfront. Latte stayed hot and yummy. Will go back and try the sandwiches and other baked goods. Love supporting local !"
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-10-21,4.0,Found this little gem in our hood and it was everything I wanted in an east village coffee shop that wasn't a major chain. The breakfast sandwich and chair I had were as good as I could have hoped. Grab a stool in the large front window to watch the neighborhood action!
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-04-12,5.0,"I don't remember the name of the sandwich I had, but it had egg and arugula inside a croissant and was delicious. The mocha was yummy as well. My boyfriend got a different egg sandwich on a ciabatta and liked that. This would be a cute cafe to spend an afternoon reading (they have couches in the back) or working (although some desks say no laptops, I'm not sure if you could work here)."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-12-09,5.0,"Friend flew in from CA and her cousin suggested this location for coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker, but I hear it was good. The breakfast sandwiches were amazing! Staff was polite! Location is fairly small. We sat in the very back on benches for about 3 hours and not once was anyone rude about us leaving and they weren't pushy about our orders. 
Highly recommend specifically for their breakfast sandwiches."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2017-02-21,4.0,"The B Cup Cafe is a great spot to grab coffee, breakfast, or lunch. They have good wifi and plenty of outlets, definitely a great place to work or study. 

Most recently I got a the mozzarella sandwich that comes with pesto, sundried tomatoes, and basil, and I also added chicken. You also have your choice of bread, so I chose the delicious  rosemary ciabatta. The meal also comes with a small side salad.

While I was at the cafe a few people ordered smoothies that also looked delicious. Next time I return I would love to try the banana date smoothie.

Overall, I like the homey feel of B Cup Cafe and their variety of food and drink. It's a cozy place that is perfect for hanging out or working in. 

Tips: B Cup Cafe is cash only 
Seating can fill up, so I suggest arriving early to grab your spot."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2019-08-04,1.0,"Had to leave after 3 minutes because it was so cold. They have the AC blasting at 50 degrees and it's like an ice box. Picture: it's hot outside so you're in t-shirt, shorts and flip flops, and you walk into a coffee shop that's cooled into the 50's. Would you stay? It's freezing and unpleasant. Why would you want to subject your customers to such an unpleasant environment? I felt like if I stayed in there any longer I would get sick. Like a lot of places these days, it's chilled to a temperature that makes sense if you're wearing a sweater and/or working in a warm kitchen area, NOT if you're sat having a restful coffee in summer clothing. It's almost like they're trying to make sure nobody overstays their welcome. Apart from anything it's a huge waste of energy and very environmentally unfriendly. I thought these cool Village places were supposed to be ""progressive."" People go absolutely nuts with AC in this country and it has to stop. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE THAT COLD, AND IF THIS WERE THE SAME TEMP IN WINTER YOU'D BE TURNING THE HEATING ON! Stop the madness, please."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2019-11-28,5.0,Best Cafe in the Lower East Side hands down!  Why is everyone complaining about cash only so what carry around atleast 10-20 bucks even if you have a card. Who ever is paying with card is probably getting one drink and that's why they are upset lmao . Stop complaining and go grab some tea at B Cup

Walked in for a cup of mint lemonade. It was scorching hot outside and I needed something cold and refreshing, quick. This place definitely did the job. I came in around noon on a Friday and it was pretty packed with customers eating lunch, some with salads and others with cups of cappuccinos. Their salads caught my eye and I think I'll check them out again next time I'm around the area."

These are amongst the most pleasant people I've found in NYC...it's quite refreshing."

They have a great selection of light/healthy meals. I love the avocado sandwich that I usually top with a hard boiled egg. They also have delicious iced coffee that's served in little milk bottle carafes... Which for me is reason enough to order it.

I also love the seating. There are couches in the back, tables, and an antique couch/chair seating area by the big windows in front. They've also got free wifi, and it seems like a great place to relax, get comfortable, and write a novel."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2019-02-12,3.0,"I really like this place. Cool ambiance, good place to study or hang with friends. But I'm giving three stars because this place is so overpriced. I ordered the tuna avocado wrap, which was quite small, and it came with a ""side salad"" that included maybe seven pieces of lettuce and some shredded carrots. Don't get me wrong, the wrap was good, but I ended up paying $17 for this wrap and a chai latte. I wouldn't be complaining if the portion was a little bit more generous. Overall, good place to study and get a coffee, but I would recommend eating beforehand."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-02-25,4.0,"The food is good. Staff is friendly. There is a lot of seating and it's a good place to work but...

Hang on cuz this review is about to get real bougie... 

Their mistake is in regards to the matcha latte. For the plebes out there-Matcha is green tea powder; it has 10x the caffeine as ordinary green tea but because it contains the amino acid L-theanine it has a different affect on the central nervous system than coffee. It's calming. Zen. 

Anyway I've order the matcha there a couple times. The first time I sent it back because it was clumpy. The second time was today. It tasted awful and I only had two sips because soon after I was nauseated. The employees do not know how to prepare matcha. 

Allow me to enlighten you, B-Cup and yelp philistines not refined in the art of matcha. 1) don't use culinary grade matcha; 2) use a teaspoon of powder at most unless you really know how to balance the flavor; and 3) for the love of buddha sift the cot damn matcha before you whisk it! 

B-Cup I really appreciate the time you've taken to read this absurdly long yelp review and lesson in matcha preparation. I look forward to getting a good matcha drink there soon. 

P.S. Cash only is lame."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2019-08-20,5.0,I just moved here from Boston and was looking for a local coffee shop to get some work done regularly and I finally found it. I got an iced americano and a seasonal Sweet Brie sandwich and I cannot wait to go back. Americano was so good and strong and was served in a cute mason jar mug and the sandwich was so sticky and delicious and I'm gonna be super sad when it's not in season anymore. They have a printer on location and seats up front and behind the counter in the back on the shop. Highly HIGHLY recommend.
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-12-30,5.0,"The feel was very college coffee shopy here. I sat at a table that didn't allow computer or tablet usage, something rare these days. Food was good. Needed some sauce"
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2017-07-22,5.0,"I have visited B cup several times since my last review. I hoped that the environment and service would improve. It certainly has! The vibe is once again welcoming and relaxed; the food (as always) is fantastic. 

Over my visits I've taken many iced beverages to go, eaten in two breakfasts and one lunch, and enjoyed great service and food each time. 

Thank you, owners of B cup for working hard to revive and maintain the peaceful, local, ""alphabet"" vibe I experienced when you initially opened!"
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2016-10-22,5.0,"Thank you thank you thank you yelp for bringing me here! I've been an East Villager on Ave B for over a year now and have yet to check this place out. In fact, I've never walked by it as it is never on my daily trajectory for work. However, in an effort to stray from my usual EV coffee spots, I stumbled upon B Cup. 

This place must always be filled on a Saturday morning because the hum of Saturday morning brunchers and hustle and bustle of the staff seemed natural in the colorful space. While the menu is VAST and has a variety of sandwiches, salads, and pastries - I opted for a soy latte and vegan molasses cookie ($8 for both - $4.50 for the latte because I added soy, $4 regularly). The cookie didn't taste vegan (whatever that tastes like) and the latte was creamy and had the perfect espresso silkiness. Only bummer was how hard it was to find a seat, but that's no fault of the place. 

Next time I'm going to try one of the yummy sandwiches. I'll be back for sure!!"
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2017-01-29,3.0,"We've lived in the East Village for almost two years and ventured here for the first time the other day. Was pleasantly surprised by the quaintness, definitely a comfy feel. 

Overall it was pretty good. My husband ordered the breakfast wrap, eggs, goat cheese, kalamata olives, tomato, which he said was ""Fine, not bad,"" and I ordered the tuna salad sandwich and a latte; both our entrees came with a mesclun salad with balsamic dressing. The tuna salad was peppery and tasted fresh and the latte was smooth and yummy.

I'd certainly go back, more so for the coffee/pastries (which I have yet to try) and cozy atmosphere than the food. Definitely a good neighborhood cafe to stop in with your partner or a friend!"
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2016-08-13,5.0,"If you are looking for some wonderland sort of coffee shops, B cup should be your destination! The second I stepped in, I almost felt like being inside an imaginary castle. It was trendy, yet not overwhelming; that I could sit down and enjoy my favorite matcha latte under the sun.

Aside from the matcha drinks, B cup also serves Israeli breakfast (with scrambled egg, salad and olives), as well as Shakshuka (remember Jack's wife Freda? Ok you hear me). They have quite an extensive menu so make sure you have something in mind before ordering lol. 

Cash only place, but they do have an ATM machine inside the shop."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2017-01-25,3.0,"The place is nice and confortable with free wifi and possible to charge phone or computer but the ""barman"" is not really smiling. 
Chocolate with chantilly around 5$ normal, not really tasty."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2017-09-25,3.0,"Very cute place! It's best for a nice coffee shop to hang out with your friends. The staff is very friendly and accommodating! 

It's not great for studying. The tables are a bit wobbly and the wifi isn't very fast."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-11-07,4.0,Super cute and comfy little café.  I've been here a handful of times and have always had a good experience.  I sometimes get the breakfast wrap in the mornings.  The coffee is pretty good and the service is usually friendly and prompt.  Check this cute cafe out.
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2017-07-22,5.0,"I just moved to the neighborhood just 2 weeks ago and have been here at least 7 times already. The vibes are always chill and calm and I love meeting my girlfriends here for a quick ice coffee before I head to work. 

The menu is also so amazing and full of options. I love love the Prosciutto sandwich with mozzarella, pesto and arugula... honest everything on the menu is amazing They also have so many health options for shakes and smoothies. Definitely my new go to coffee shop."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-11-13,1.0,"B Cup has become a dirty, overpriced cafe in which the staff has become so rude and condescending it is hard to describe in words. What once was a great little place has transformed into all of the worst things about Alphabet City. They charge 16 dollars for a wee bit of hummus and briney olives, their coffee is old snd often burnt you grow to expect it. I have spent thousands of dollars here over the last decade and when I asked today for a cuppa on credit and was brusquely refused  it was the last nail in the coffin. Ive also tipped very well, and feel a cup of coffee should have been no problem for them. Suffice it to say, Ill not be coming back. Too many better options nearby."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-01-18,5.0,I would say that my first experience here was great! I started a nice day with a wonderful breakfast of hot chocolate and egg croissant! The cafe was artsy with all wall paintings and artworks inside. Liked it
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-03-01,5.0,"I hadn't been here in years, but holy hell this place is still delicious!! I had the prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich that came with a tasty side salad. I mean, soooooo good! And B Cup is totally cute to sit down and read or do some work on your laptop."
128,b-cup-café-new-york-5,2018-10-07,5.0,Such a cute atmosphere and their coffee is delicious... but i will say $7 for a latte with almond milk is a bit expensive. If you're willing to treat yourself i highly highly recommend!!
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2020-01-12,5.0,"If you are thirsty and need somethi bgg to quench your thirst, this is the right thing kace to come! This specific bubble tea place is great. Workers are friendly and puts customer service as their top priority. Servings were great and pricing was great as well. On top of all, this is a place to add to date night!"
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2020-05-14,4.0,"I think KFT is one of the better bubble tea shops in NYC compared to many other ones. Their bubbles are always made perfectly (chewy and not undercooked/overcooked) and they've got a lot of good drink options. The only downside is that they have $5 card minimum.

I used to come here so often in college and the taste of their drinks was always consistent. My go-to is jasmine honey green milk tea with boba and it's soo yummy. If you are looking for a good bubble tea shop, this will not disappoint you!"

And your partner won't give you a screw
I know something better

Get Lemon Black Tea from Kung Fu!

What to get: Lemon Black Tea With Tapioca!
Or: All the fruit teas are pretty good, especially if you go off menu and get black tea!
Or: Go crazy and order your fruit teas with the very strong Oolong!
Or in winter: Any of the hot milk teas!
Which milk teas are best: Honey Oolong! Oolong! Maybe Taro or Almond!

The Kung Fu Fighters are one of my favourite bands. Their biggest hit was ""Learn To Fu"" but I also really love ""Ever-oolong.""

This is an excellent little Kung Fu tea and the main problem is that it's just down the street from Boba Guys so they don't get as much business as they used to.

But it's a nice place to come to switch it up, it has actual seating, no bathroom but it has friendly people, and because Boba Guys is quite annovative and somewhat Californian, whereas this is more traditional Taiwanese - especially for the fruit teas which are by far the standouts here.

If they will make the lemon black tea which is now an off-menu drink that is the way to go. It's amazing. With tapioca.

And with that, let's rap.

I tasted it and screamed so loud that I collapsed a LUNG FU
I carried on screaming and sounded like Angus YOUNG FU
They played Sting on the radio, but I'm already STUNG FU
By the wondrous Lemon Black Tea they serve at KUNG FU

I went to the toilet, opened Snapchat, then I SUNG FU
Came back, took my pants off, and the girls yelled ""HUNG FU!""
In walked Barbie and immediately I'm SPRUNG FU
And you should come and get a Lemon Black Tea from KUNG FU!

WHAT"
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2020-04-20,4.0,The inside is a very small and during rush hour they are very pack and crowded but definitely recommend the mobile ordering option during busy hour. Love this place though definitely recommend. The staff are very friendly and helpful.
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-06-23,5.0,"One of the bubble tea places nearby bobst library, perfect for your afternoon study break for a small boost of caffeine and sugar.
Prices are not affordable but pretty standard for the area."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-11,5.0,I absolutely love this place! The tea is always excellent and the service is always fast
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-10-20,4.0,"There are two boba stores on this one street: Kung Fu Tea, and Boba Guys, each with their own notoriety.  I have tried Boba Guys, and recently I had the chance to try Kung Fu Tea, and after much thought, I prefer Kung Fu Tea.

The location is very small, somehow even smaller than Boba Guys, but the actual shop is not where this place wins. 

At Boba Guys, I ordered a large drink for around 6 dollars. At KF Tea, it was only 4. In my opinion, the drinks are KF Tea are just right. I don't really like the especially sweet drinks, and this place delivers. At regular sugar levels, I could get some sweetness, while still having the tea flavor I've become addicted to. The bubbles were chewy and sweet, a perfect complement to the tea.

This is the spot my dudes."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-06,5.0,This place is the best bubble tea place in the area! I always come here after a long day in school. Mango slush with jelly is my go to drink! Customer service is great too! ‍
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-04,5.0,"Good tea but you have to bring cash!! It's close to NYU Washington square campus 
Try honey green tea."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-06,4.0,Definitely a gem spot to visit. There's so many option to select from of hot and cold drinks. I recommend this nice cozy spot to everyone...and NYU students gets a discount. My fave is the Mango Snow Slush. What are you waiting for... come inside and have a drink
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-04,5.0,"Their pearl taste is very good and the elastic milk tea is very good.

129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-10-21,5.0,"Always a delicious time at kung fu tea.! For beginners I'd suggest that you try the ""milk tea""."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2018-09-08,1.0,"Excessive heat and humidity summons bubble tea for a cool down.  This boba tea business is a microscopic indoor booth and no standing room as it is designed for takeout only and sits in the vicinity of NYU campus.  I agree with the poor customer service.  Upon checking-in with Yelp mobile application a check-in offer for one free topping appeared and I shown my phone to the female cashier who did not know what to do and passed me to her colleague as I was like unwanted animate object.  The brash young naïve male server spent fifteen minutes attempting to decipher the Yelp check-in offer as he explained and instructed that I have to download their application and accumulate points to earn a free drink.  Dude, my check-in offer is for one free topping with a purchase of a drink as I was NOT requesting for one free drink!  The brash young naïve dude then blurted out ""oh, I can't see!"" which he was wearing glasses or perhaps very limited in the English language especially written, a L.E.P. person, as a cover-up excuse and incompetent to take orders.  Whoa, this naïve male server held the line which further spewed outside the door for a longer wait as all I desired was one measly fruit tea drink $4.75 with a coupon for one free topping and lots of ice.  Is this a very difficult drink order to take and fulfill?  My experience and transaction was abject pain.  Their toppings are very limited and awful as their nata mango jelly is hard, stale and very chewy sticky substance.  I like grass jelly 涼粉 (loeng4 fan2, liang2 fen3) as a topping option, but Kung Fu does not offer.  This bubble tea business is chain operated but obviously does not conduct corporate training nor hire staff that is proficient in the English language.  Orders are fulfilled by calling out order numbers as written on sales receipt.

Yes, direct competition is within one block away with a long queue that wraps around as I can imagine orders are taken and fulfilled accurately without any issues.  Their staff is ready, able and competent in the English language unlike Kung Fu Tea."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-05,5.0,"This is the closest thing to Bay Area boba I can find around NYU. I love you guys. Delicious boba, especially the Passionfruit Tea."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-10,5.0,Staff were super helpful in helping me decide a flavor because I was looking for something with light sweetness. Quick service. Quality tea. Perfect boba!
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-06,5.0,"Great place, love it! Customer service is great and friendly. I always order the mango green tea and it's so good"
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-15,5.0,The menu selection is great and the service is decently fast for a busy night. It's also very cozy and close to NYU.
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-04,4.0,"A good place for a quick boba fix if you're a student living in the dorms nearby. Kung fu tea is cheaper than nearby competition and usually has fast service. My biggest complaint is they are often out of my favorite drink- the orange green tea (1/3 times available). It's a bit cramped waiting inside sometimes, but I recommend trying it if you're in the area."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-04-24,5.0,"I like the address of this Kung Fu tea very much. It's very convenient. I buy a drink every day and then go to class. Although a lot of people queue up, but order speed is fast, recommend here!"
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-10,5.0,Amazing... this location is always busy because it's that good... Lycee and Taro are my absolute faves...always friendly and delicious...
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2017-12-20,4.0,"Man did I try to avoid this place because it's a chain and I thought it was mainstream. Now I know why people come here. 

Bubble tea is good I have to say. I tried almond milk tea from here and the famous cookies and cream milk tea from another location. Oh my do they have so many locations here! It is insane! 

I like how you can customize how much ice and sweetness. I actually have been coming across to that more lately. Back at home, we have some bubble tea places and I noticed these customized things. I also noticed hot and cold bubble tea to be very common in New York at least. I'm used to cold bubble tea. 

This place is legit from what I get back at home. I really liked this place. 

But I don't like their tapioca. Well they're okay. They flavored it weird. Different honey? But it was cooked nicely. Just flavored weird."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-12-06,5.0,Cery good service. Small and cozy. Not a long wait. Recommend. Definitely suitable and convenient. However no space to sit and work
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2020-02-22,5.0,Lots of options and great tasting bubble tea! I go there a lot with my friends. My favorite is the taro milk tea. The staff is nice. The location is perfect.
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-10-31,5.0,"First time trying Kung Fu Tea! I got milk tea with boba, less sweet and less ice, which was perfect for me. The boba was chewy but didn't stick to one another. I could kind of taste the tea in the drink, which I like. Thank you HKSA for bringing KFT to their event!"
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-10-30,5.0,"The flavor is so good and bubbles are so soft!! I go to kung fu tea every day... it's my
go to! Would recommend to everyone."

129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-10-30,5.0,Saw Kung Fu Tea at NYU HKSA halloween collab and loved it!! Sweetness is just right and the tea is great.
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-10-30,5.0,Thus is the best boba place. I got KFT from the NYU hksa event. I especially like the workers.
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2017-07-13,5.0,"I don't know why but the bubble tea here is in general cheaper than Seattle while everything else is more expensive haha. 

I had a not so great experience at kong fu tea in Seattle but the ones here are great! I guess the location matters. 

They give you choice for sweetness and how much ice. The medium size here is also just about right instead of those standard huge sizes which I can barely finish. They give you both black and white bubbles which is kind of cute. Really chewy and not overly sweet bubbles. Love it!"
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-09-10,5.0,"Kung Fu Tea has always been one of my favorite chains since living in nyc. And this one has amazing location, very close to NYU and Washington Square Park.
Very patient and friendly staff who greets and answers all my questions, and even do all the adjustments they can for me.
Best bubbles in the city in my opinion! My personal favorite: Lychee Punch, Passionfruit Green Tea and Winter Melon Milk Green Tea."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2019-06-28,3.0,"The drink is pretty good, but the store is too hot when it get crowded is even hotter. I was waiting for my drink for like 5min and I was sweating, that is how hot the store is."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2017-03-29,5.0,"They have good drinks and I prefer this place over other bubble tea places in this area. 

My first visit wasn't pleasant but my second visit was good. Staffs were friendly this time and trying to answer my questions and help me to pick up my drink. I also saw a girl who was ordering a really sweet drink and the staff was checking if she knew and tried the drink before. 

I got matcha latte with bubbles. It had a pleasant matcha flavor and the bubbles were cooked well. I also liked the oolong milk tea I got last time. 

They have a variety of menu and their prices are slightly cheaper than other bubble tea places which is a plus! 

If you don't like too much sugar, you should ask for no sugar. Their drinks are already sweet even if you order no sugar. 

I will come back here when I am in this area. It would be great to grab some drinks here and go to Washington square park."
129,kung-fu-tea-new-york-10,2017-07-30,4.0,"Omg the only boba place I found while we were in NYC! We had to give it a try. We found it while we were walking near Washington Square Park. The place is pretty small but it was clean. I got their regular milk tea 'cause I wanted to see if it tasted any different from the boba places in the Bay Area. My bf got the Oreo Milk Tea and he didn't like it at all haha. The Oreo wasn't mixed and it was just crumbs on top of the actual drink. I like how both our drinks actually tasted like tea instead of just all sugar and boba. Maybe that's also because I got 50% sugar. Their milk tea definitely tasted different but it was a good different. They also give you both black and white boba but they taste the same to me. It was more hard than chewy though. We both got regular and we drank it fast! Should have gotten large instead. 

Definitely will stop by again!"
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,"What a great find.  You descend stairs into a cozy tea parlor.  I love the scent jars where you can experience the tea before purchasing.  We all went with the matcha latte.  How boring but I started the trend so I guess I was the setter. 

I was not disappointed.  The clerk brewed it fresh and sweetened it with honey.  I also purchased some earl grey loose tea."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2020-02-14,4.0,"So glad I was recommended to this wonderful little Tea shop. A small cozy spot with a downstairs entrance. Petya was a wonderful charming greeter and Tea assistant. I was told that the owner iLana has been there for 8 years or more. There is no public bathroom here, so be aware how much tea you drink.
 Choosing a tea to order, sit and sip there was not a simple choice as there are so many to pick from. There were such a variety of Teas, types and canisters on the wall. I went to the holiday special board and ordered the Chocolate Rose tea. 
  I sat at the seat closest to the counter. Petya brought a tea pot with tea in a strainer and a unique sand fill timer for it to steep for up to 5 minutes along with a colorful teacup. I ordered the delicious Scottish Toffee shortbread. It was so good. When I had a bit of tea left, I asked for a cup and cover. I found it just too good to leave. I had her tape the small opening on the plastic cap so in my travels it would not spill. 
  One young man sitting with his friend noted that he had chosen a cinnamon tea. As I was leaving I noted two lovebirds smiling and cuddling in the corner near the tree mural. The place and atmosphere were just delightful."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2020-01-29,3.0,"This is not a place to read or study, since they have no public restroom or a lot of outlets. So, it may be unwise to get an entire pot of tea. However, this is a nice place to share a cup of tea with a friend and explore some different teas. It's also a nice place to introduce someone to tea. They have a large variety so there is something for everyone. 

One of the more eccentric things they sell is a kava chocolate bar. I recommend getting the dark chocolate one with nuts. It works well."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-03-14,4.0,"So 80s, since both Olivia Newton John's Physical, and Graffitea in general, were 80s things. I miss the 80s. When things were pretty dangerous and pretty awesome.

This is a super cute little tea shop right on St Mark's in the heart of the lovely East Village which adds to the spectacular charm of this area in a very profound and adorable way. 

Definitely well worth your time, look out for it, it's down the steps - it's little Subterranean below street level, a little cubicle if you will, packed with all kinds of teadeliciousness for pretty decent prices considering the neighbourhood."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-06-15,5.0,"I agree with all other fellow yelpers, this is a ""hidden gem"" tea place! It's a small and relaxing area to have some various type of tea. There are so many types of tea to choose from so I asked the staff workers for some preference tips. I forgot one of staff member name but he is super friendly to help every customers out. Great place to chill, relax, read a book, or casual chit chat with friend; with a touch of cookies and tea (British Afternoon tea style like). lols Cute yet colorful small pots and cups.  

-Cons: there's no bathroom. no WiFi. 
- Only 3-4 tables inside."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2018-10-09,5.0,"AMAZING hidden gem in the East Village. No trip to NYC is complete without a visit to Physical Graffitea. Don't be fooled by the tiny size of this below street level shop. While there may only be about 4 tables for customers to sit, they more than make up for the lack of space with an incredibly extensive and robust variety of teas. You can purchase the tea to prepare yourself at home, or order it hot or iced, or in a latte.

The Blood Orange Creamsicle iced tea is my favorite. It tastes exactly like how it sounds, with bright citrus notes balancing a creamy vanilla undertone. My boyfriend loves the Vanilla Black tea, which features fresh vanilla bean that really shows up when the tea is brewed. They also have a small selection of petit four sized cookies and biscotti to enjoy with your tea.

Service has been a mixed bag in the times we have gone. The first time, we had a young man who told us the shop was closing earlier that night than the hours listed and seemed pretty disinterested and out of it. However, on a recent visit, we were delighted to have a different barista who was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. She recommended different teas to us based on what kinds of flavors we were in the mood for, and her cheerful personality added to the positive experience we had the last time we were here.

Bottom line - this is a must visit for anyone (like me) who is obsessed with tea!"
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-08-24,2.0,"I came here with a few friends after going inside Tea Drunk and realizing that it was a lot more formal and pricey than we expected and we were looking for a casual place to have a pot of tea. We chose the decaf sencha and were originally going to get the large pot, but the man working there said that the medium would probably be enough for us. The tea was unfortunately not very good and tasted very bitter. There also did not seem to be enough room in the brewing basket for the tea leaves to expand. There is also no bathroom here which I don't understand! The man working there was very nice though, and my boyfriend enjoyed his blueberry kombucha."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2018-07-30,5.0,"So small, 4 small tables inside, but the amount of room inside does not compare to the HUGE variety of teas they offer.  Seriously a tea paradise, so much selection I can get lost just looking at the menu.  Thank goodness, for the very sweet and patient lady serving the teas who did not run out of patience answering the many questions I threw at her. 

Highly recommend this spot for tea lovers or sick people needing an amazing cup of powerful and flavorful liquid elixir."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2020-01-25,5.0,"This place was really great! They have an amazing tea selection and the owner is super passionate, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about the different teas. A great and positive experience with tasty tea and more. Will definitely be back :)"
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-09-04,5.0,"This is a GEM in East Village! I come here often to read and enjoy a hot pot of tea. The staff is very knowledgeable and lets you smell all the teas before finally deciding which one you'd like. You can also get tea to go and they have a selection of little pastries to go alongside your tea. I love that they are open relatively late so I can have my own version of a ""party night out"" with a good book and a cup of tea in hand. Just writing this review makes me want to come back tomorrow."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-07-22,5.0,"Physical GraffiTea is a true gem. I was strolling through the East Village with a massive stomach ache and desperate to feel better thought that a cup of tea could be the perfect remedy, and I was exactly right! After having one cup I knew I needed to buy more which is why I have replaced my morning coffee ritual now with ""Scottish Toffee Pu-Erh"" and could not feel better.

I consider myself someone who can appreciate the intricacies of tea, and I mean it when I say that it does not get better than this place. I have recently started ordering directly from their website, which I highly recommend as well."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2018-12-16,5.0,Lovely tea and atmosphere. They have so many types of tea and it is very relaxing to get a little teapot and sit in the cafe.
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-12-17,3.0,"I like this place and would give 4 stars however, several friends were to meet here at 9pm on a rainy Monday.  It clearly show that their hours are ""12:00 pm - 10:00 pm"".  We all turned up at 9pm to be told, ""sorry we close at 9pm"".  The person didn't really care about this.  Check in with them regarding hours.  FAKE HOURS POSTED."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2020-01-06,3.0,"The selection of tea is not too bad, but they are severely lacking in a selection of raw pu-erh. The biggest detriments to GraffiTea are that they have no wifi or bathrooms on site. This makes the space inferior to others if you'd like to get work done or binge tea. I would only visit if you are really want to try Ayurvedic/medicinal style teas in person ASAP."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2020-02-07,5.0,"This place is a jam; all organic tea house with so many varieties.  They have a rare find; Kiku cha (or Sannen bancha), a 3-yr fermented green tea (thus no caffeine), and its green organic Kiku cha is hard to find. Most of them are roasted."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2018-10-22,5.0,"A hidden gem for real tea lovers.
Located in the basement in east village, it has only 4-5 small tables. It is not somewhere that you can expect to take pretty afternoon tea girls' pictures. It is even hard to work on the laptop.
HOWEVER, the tea selection is amazing!
There is a wall of different tea from black tea, green tea to white tea, Oolong and you can sample any of them. 
I picked a black tea with lavender blend. Strong and aromatic.
It also sells little tea cookies. I did not buy one but they all seemed to be perfect accompaniment with tea.
What I really like are the cute little stuff such as the hourglass, metal plate to sit the tea bag. They are not just photo worthy but more importantly work together to help make a perfect cup of tea.
PS: no bathroom here!!!"
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2017-11-20,5.0,"Cute tea shop on St. Mark's Place towards Tompkins Square Park. The walls are lined with hundreds of canisters of tea, many of which you can pick up and smell. There are also a few sweets on offer. The woman, who I think was the owner, was friendly and had cinnamon tea out to sample, which was delicious and naturally sweet.

I went for the Scottish Toffee pu-erh, which had some brown-sugar and caramel notes to balance the earthy nature of the tea. It came out quickly and with a timer so I could properly steep it. Pots of tea are $4.50 pre-tax and -tip.

The ambiance was comforting. It was super warm (she had to crack open the door at one point). There were some people studying, but it was more suited for cozy catch ups. I like noise in the background, so I had a nice time eavesdropping while burning through some weekend work.

Only downside is no bathroom, so I can't recommend this as an all-day hang in good conscience; they also have a notice on limiting laptop time to 45 minutes during busy hours. However, this will work perfectly for meeting a friend or reading for a short period of time."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2017-12-13,3.0,"I really want to like this place. Don't get me wrong; it's a great tea place. They have a large and varied selection of tea and they only sell loose tea which I love. I also liked their idea of the cabinet where there are many tea samples for you to smell before you try them. Nice people working there.

There are two things that will prevent me from going again. First, limited seats means I have a very high chance of not able to have a seat whenever I go. We were lucky that the corner table was leaving when the 3 of us arrived so we can share the bench. The second thing is how does a tea place not have a bathroom?? I don't understand. 

You can buy tea leaves there as well and their menu is extensive. I recommend it if you love tea and want to try new teas, or if you have access to a bathroom nearby. otherwise, it's a hit or miss for seats and you may have to hold it in for a while :)"
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-04-04,5.0,Great spot and super friendly and helpful. I came here to get some matcha green tea powder that was equivalent to the tea we had in Japan. The store attendant was extremely helpful and got me exactly what I wanted. Would definitely come here again for the matcha and other tea requirements.
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-11-07,5.0,"One of the best tea shop experiences of my life--- actually----the best, the Scottish tea/coffee and shortbread were delightful, as was the music and vibe, but not as delightful as the woman who made them"
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-03-13,5.0,"Small tea shop tucked in the middle of the block-You have to walk down several steps. 

Really quiet in there if you want to be alone with some quality tea and a good read.

There is an extensive tea menu, including medicinal teas for allergy, arthritis, pregnancy, and more. They even have CBD infused teas now. 

Worth checking out if you're around area, want some quality time alone, with a friend that doesn't talk too loud, or if you just want.. tea!"
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2018-04-08,4.0,"I think I had 6 cups of tea and each more magical than the next!  The tearrista ( just made that up I think!) was a serious tea pro - She knew her tea!  Like a sommelier, she probed and suggested great teas, mixing and concocting a one of kind cup of tea based on the request.  It was pretty cool and of course the teas were great!  The owner even ventured in and made us a special cup while she chatted...It was a mix of 5 different teas for a flavor profile that I am confident I will not be able to experience anywhere else.  What a treat!  

This is a tiny sub-street tea house so be ready to take your tea and dash :)

Thank you for a great experience!"
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2018-10-23,5.0,I tried the Versailles Lavender earl grey and it was a lovely flavor. There are so many options to choose from so I definitely appreciated how helpful the staff was. They let me get a scent of different flavors and made recommendations. The price point is very good for the city. I'd say between $4-6 which is more than fair for the city. I would come back to try other options out in the future.
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2017-12-13,5.0,"If you like tea, Physical GraffiTea is heaven on Earth. This small diamond on St.Marks has some of the best tea selections I have seen in New York City thus far and has the ambiance of what a tea shop should look and feel like. I have never seen this place crowded and there is always someone behind the counter waiting to assist you. You can buy loose leaf tea to go, or get some tea to sip on right here in the shop. 

There menu is extensive. There are: Greens, Whites, Oolongs, Blacks, Pu-Erhs, Mates, Rooibos, Tisanes, Medicinal Blends and Herbs. Choose a few that sound good to you and ask to smell them. They come in big jars that can be opened and you can choose the one you like based on the smell and a helpful description from the person who works there. I like the Rooibos personally. 

You can get a tea for one or a couple. They have sand timers that are color coordinated based on the tea so you get the ideal steeping time. Then you sit back and enjoy your tea in this super calm cafe. This is the perfect place for meeting with someone or reading but I would not bring a computer here. This is not that type of place."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2018-10-30,5.0,Loved loved loved this tea shop in the LES. My husband drug me here because of the Led Zeppelin connection but we are both tea fans and it absolutely did not disappoint there. The woman working the counter was super helpful in selecting teas and also gave us complimentary cookies to have with our pots. I had the ginger and peaches tea and my husband had the Russian Earl Grey. Both were delicious! Would heartily recommend this place and plan to come back again and again!
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2017-09-28,5.0,"A little hidden gem in East Village for those who enjoy a nice cup of tea with personable service. I frequent here often since my boyfriend lives quite close. The first time I came here I was trying to get over a cold, I was in desperate need of a tea to help clear the sinus and make me feel whole again. The guy recommended the tumeric and ginger tea at first, but since I am not a huge fan of ginger, I passed on that. So he recommended the purity tea which I was a huge fan of, the tea was quite earthy but pleasant. The second time I decided to come here I ordered the berry berry tea, the ones that are pre made in the tap jar and it is so refreshing. Also, their matcha lattes are strong and so so so good. Forget the Starbucks nonsense, once you try this place out, you'll never go back! Overall, highly recommend tea lovers to check this lovely place out.

* Do yourself a favor and try those jam cookies (apricot and raspberry)! It's buttery and absolutely delicious."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2017-07-07,5.0,"Mind blown! Thats all I have to say. The service here is superb with very personable customer service. If you're going to have a matcha latte anywhere in NYC I would recommend getting it here. They add slight honey, matcha power, and a lot of other goodness.

As you pick your tea they let you smell it and they will make recommendations based on smells + teas you normally like. Great location in East Village and a lot of good dinner places around!"
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2018-03-21,1.0,"After making plans to catch up w my friend, she suggested we meet at a tea shop near her apartment. I'm ALWAYS up for a new tea place and made my way over.  All my friends know about my tea obsession, with dozens of teas in my cabinet, and one of my favorite travel memories is having a formal tea ceremony in Shanghai.

I walked in and was immediately transported to​ tea heaven. R hadn't arrived so I studied the menu while waiting for the people in line to finish their purchases. I settled on a Thai roobois to drink and a few others to purchase for home. I told her my order and explained that I'd also be purchasing loose teas and would hold on to the menu. I sat down at the small table and R walked in a few minutes later. She approached the woman behind the counter with money visibly in her hand and ordered her tea. The woman didn't take her money so R assumed payment was made after finishing, the same assumption I'd made. 

After about 45 minutes, two men walked in, ordered, and said ( to each other ) that they'd wanted to sit but it didn't look like there were any tables. The woman behind the counter overheard them and leaned over to us and loudly asked "" Are you two almost finished?​ "" I was astonished. Why had she asked us instead of anyone else in the place, and why so rudely? I took a breath and evenly and calmly said:​ "" No, we're not finished "". We continued talking but I was so livid that I couldn't concentrate. Was it because I'm African-American and R is Indian? 

While paying I asked her, in a respectful tone that she hadn't given us, why she'd talked to us like that. Her answer"" Oh well you two said you were getting tea to go​ and those tables are for guests drinking here."" I hadn't noticed until then that our tea was in to go cups and everyone else in the shop had actual​ cups. But neither of us had been to the shop and although she then claimed to have asked us, she did not. I most definitely would have told her that we intended to sit.

Also, it makes no logical sense why, if she'd had that imaginary conversation where we told her our tea was to go, she hadn't then taken our payment. Also, I'd told her that I intended to purchase loose tea after drinking my roobois. Did she think I was going to drink it on the sidewalk in the cold, then walk back inside to buy the tea?

So I'm obviously not returning but more than anything I'm bummed that I don't get to try all those teas and that incidents like this still happen. Maybe some of you will have a wonderful, great experience at this tea place. That wasn't the case for me."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2017-04-09,3.0,"We were killing time before meeting our bus, and we'd just finished a really great lunch at Hi-Collar not to far. I'm a tea fanatic, so we walked a couple blocks over and stopped by. The walls behind the counter are floor to ceiling in types of tea, for drinking there or to go. I had the rooibos chai and my husband the houjicha. I was hoping my chai would be slightly more intense tasting, but since rooibos is my favorite tea anyway, it still tasted good. I ended up not buying any to bring back home with me, because the ones they were recommended were ones that I had similar versions of in my cabinet back home.

The only downside was that I didn't see a bathroom, and after all that tea, you really gotta go."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-03-05,5.0,"Very nice little space with inexpensive loose leaf tea pots. We got the kettle for 2 and it was enough for 3-4 cups each. The owner was there and she is very knowledgeable about the tea origins. Tea for 2, plus 2 delicious cookies for around $8 total. Very nice hidden gem with great prices."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2019-01-17,5.0,The cutest tea shop ever.  They have a huge selection and the staff is super kind and knowledgeable. I will definitely go back to try a new flavor.

Not super big but perfect for a mid-day break or a cozy catch up. Very intimate yet casual. 

Vast amounts of teas lined against the walls. Homemade goodies with purchasable tea pots. This place is perfect! Ilana was helpful and so kind. She had a fresh pot of tea which was simply delicious, required no sugar and perfectly brewed. 

I will be back over and over now I have been here. Oh! The beautiful artwork all around the shop, Priceless!"
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2018-04-29,5.0,Cozy & small tea house. A vast selection of teas! Overall great vibes! I had the Golden Milk Latte & it was absolutely delicious! I also had the Green Tea Matcha Tea & it was the ABSOLUTE BEST MATCHA I have ever had!

130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2017-11-28,5.0,"My home away from home.

My best friend and I have a monthly tea meeting, and this is our go-to place. You could spend 20 minutes to a half hour alone just smelling different teas and trying to figure out which one you want to drink. Everyone who works there is very nice, even encouraging, so it doesn't feel awkward to spend so much time deciding.

It is a small place and keep in mind that there's no bathroom, so prepare ahead of time. We like to go in the evenings where there's fewer people around."
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2018-08-21,5.0,Amazing tea house. They have a great selection and wide variety of tea. The place is small but worth a visit!
130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2017-09-30,5.0,"Awesome selection of tea. The people who work here are great and knowledgeable about all aspects of tea.  Definitely worth the trip to get a variety of tea that you cannot find elsewhere. 

Love the chamomile blends.  There is also a tea for sleep that is excellent."

The tea selection here is intense but you really can't go wrong whatever you choose.
I ordered a hot cinnamon spice tea (but got it iced) and WOW. Probably the best tea I've ever had, not recently, but ever. 

If you're in the area, (tea lover or not) definitely give this place a visit."

130,physical-graffitea-new-york,2016-06-30,4.0,"A small quiet quaint place if you're seeking sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of NYC. They have a huge variety of tea in addition to service a limited menu of coffee. Music is calming and noise level is to a minimum. Very limited seating but myself and a friend were the only inhabitants. Definitely will come back again to try variety of their tea. 

They have premade iced tea that you can try before ordering. 

The only downside to this place is that they do not allowed outside food and there is no restroom. That's a huge downside given were drinking fluids that tends to increase our urinary frequency."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2020-05-27,5.0,"About Coffee is a great option in SoHo if you are looking for a fast and delicious coffee. They are open despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and they have their service procedure perfected. Their barista was knowledgable and incredibly friendly. In this difficult time, if you find yourself needing a coffee, About Coffee will not disappoint! 

Almond Milk Cappucino (5/5): This almond milk cappuccino was thick with plenty of foam. I was impressed because almond milk is often too watery to render a good layer of cappuccino foam. If you are interested in dairy alternatives, this is a great option!

Iced Oat Latte (5/5): Their iced oat latte was also delicious. It was thick and creamy just as you would expect."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-05,4.0,"Upon walking in to About Coffee you'll notice 2 things.

1. It's very small and there's limited seating available.
2. The hipsters behind the counter are too cool to smile.

As I said, the place is small and with that, you probably won't have the luxury of a chair that completely caters for your behind. That being said, we found a seat (albeit a seat that my behind is catered for partially) and managed to escape the blistering cold of NYC and have our coffee to stay.

After a very short wait, the coffee came to us and I was overall happy with my purchase. I ordered a standard latte (they didn't offer any flavoured lattes, unfortunately).

The flavour of the coffee was deep but I felt that the texture of the latte was a little off."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-14,4.0,"About Coffee is always my spot near the office for quality coffee that feels local and like I'm supporting the right businesses. 

Solid, solid coffee and also featuring a bevy of pastries for that quick bite with your better than usual coffee. Whenever I tire of office coffee, a nice stroll, and a visit to About is always in order."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-18,4.0,"Great little coffee shop in Soho. The only reason for a non-5-star review is due to the size and inability to sit and enjoy coffee if there are more than 2 people sitting prior to your entry of the building.

I got an iced coffee with soy milk which was amazing. One caveat, if you do not like that taste of heavy cream, you will not enjoy their soy milk. I personally loved the thickness of the soy and believe it to have made the drink better. 

This coffee shop has some small eats like pastries however no soups and sandwiches."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2019-03-07,4.0,"I visited on a day when the espresso machine was down. I was bummed, as I was really wanting a latte, but I decided to try a pour-over coffee instead. They didn't charge me for the almond milk I added, which was quite kind of them. The coffee was delicious- really flavorful and strong. It was just what I needed after traveling all morning. I also tried a blueberry crumble donut, which was delicious and really packed with flavor. I would def. come back!

This is a short walk from Hotel Hugo, for anyone who is staying there!"
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-01,5.0,Cute cafe! It was right next to my SoHo office and I love going there for a quick break! Staffs are friendly and the chai latte is on point! Will definitely revisit!
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-15,4.0,"A quaint little coffee shop that doesn't try to be too many things in the Soho district of Manhattan.  Seating for about six is available inside and about four around a tree outside. Most come in to get their coffee to go but if you stay, you'll enjoy a cappuccino in a real ceramic mug. My daughter grabbed an ice mocha that she called yummy. Based on everyone else's ratings, I think you'll also find something yummy here as well."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-05,4.0,"I am visiting from SF. This place has better drip coffee than La Colombe (I tried La Colombe at two different locations as well as back in Philadelphia).

The drip coffee had a slightly sour flavor which I like. I also ordered a latte with oat milk - it was delicious and creamy. The milk did not overpower the coffee flavor. 

Their banana bread was flavorful but pumpkin bread did not have much taste."

If in the area I would give this gem of a coffee shop a try. They also have delish banana bread, pastries and donuts. Yes i tried several, but was with other people and we shared! Not sure what the deal is with there not being much seating in NYC coffee shops. That was the only downfall. I highly recommend this stop!"

They always have a great assortment of baked goods from local bakeries. Better get there early to get your pick of the litter with regards to the baked goodies. I had the blueberry donut and it was decadent!"

The staff was so friendly and very helpful. Not only were they friendly when we placed or order but we had a few laughs while we enjoyed our coffee as well. The coffee itself was very good. From the drip coffee to an almond milk latte, we left well caffeinated. Definitely recommend this spot, because like their motto says, it is always about the coffee. So stop going to chain coffee shops and drink local coffee."

131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2017-07-20,5.0,"Don't like writing this review since it's hard to find coffee spots without a line in the morning. That being said, Thursday morning and this cute spot had only one person ahead of me to order.

Settled on a large Cold Brew ($4.50) and a Lemon Scone ($3.50). Added some simple syrup and whole milk from the mixing station and was out the door in four minutes. Wish I had time to stay inside, since the furniture looked inviting (albeit a little cramped). Coffee is strong without having any sour after-taste. Scone has a strong lemon flavor and very buttery on the inside. 

Workers here are a delight. Smiles on their faces that matched the welcoming decor. Hope they do well and will definitely visit again."

131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-10,4.0,I was searching for a place to sit down and warm myself up when Google told me that this was the nearest coffee shop. I went past by it since it was a small shop. It may be a small coffee shop but they definitely serve good tasty lattes. They only have one big table and the rest of the tables they have only allow for exactly 1-2 coffee to fit in it. I didn't have anywhere to place my things.

131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2017-03-03,5.0,"I had an event in Soho after work and had some time to kill. I came to About Coffee for the first time because it was open later than most cafes in the area, which is a big plus for me and my nighttime coffee habits. 

Upon entering, I noticed the cute and small atmosphere. There were a few small, high tables with flowers on them and one communal looking table. The barista was quite nice and was happy to answer my questions about some of the specialty drinks. 

I wasn't feeling too adventurous and ordered a latte. It had the standard latte art and the coffee flavor was great. Smooth, not too strong, and quite enjoyable.

As I said, I had time to kill and I never felt rushed. I slowly drank and browsed the web for almost an hour before heading to my event. I had an enjoyable and relaxed time at About Coffee and I look forward to returning and trying their Caffe Cardomo, described to me as a cardamom mocha."

131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2017-12-12,3.0,"Hate to give this cozy, unassuming coffee shop a mediocre review- but folks should know that this isn't the place to visit for pastries/food. While the coffee is decent and the service is good, the pastries are some of the most disappointing I've experienced. The chocolate croissant, for example, had zero fluffiness- tasted like a bland, day old stale croissant even though it was only 8:30AM. The same was true for their ham and cheese croissant. This was especially disappointing because both looked so good and were semi-egregiously priced between $3.50 and $4.50. 

That said, the coffee is decent and this is a more low-key cafe alternative to Dominique Ansel around the corner."

We stayed at the Hampton Inn in Soho and this was right across the street, it was on our way to breakfast and Im so glad we stopped in.

Clearly they have great wifi! And a table that seats 4, a couple teeny two person tables, and a few seats to sit and drink coffee. Definitely a little cozy spot. The atmosphere is very chill and bright. 

The lemon bundt cake that I ordered was super delicious, as was the Cortado! The girl who made the coffee was super friendly and sweet and made everything very fast. 

Definitely a great little spot to get some work done!"
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2016-04-08,5.0,"About Coffee is a great coffee shop in a somewhat low-key area of SoHo but that shouldn't stop you from going there and trying them out. The coffee is excellent.

The baristas can really make a difference when it comes to a café and pair that with great beans from Gimme!, you have the formula for a winning coffee shop in About Coffee. I ordered a cappuccino with a an artichoke and goat cheese danish. The cappuccino had velvety smoothness thanks to the barista who took wonderful care in the preparation. The danish was nice little treat with the cappuccino. 

It is a small space and no WiFI as of yet but they have a selection of pastries from One Girl and Bien Cuit if you want something to nosh on with your drinks. With so much competition around the area, if you're a coffee fanatic, you should check out About Coffee. 

Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!"

With slick creative and a cool looking logo, you'll see their sign outside and immediately be intrigued. Their coffee isn't groundbreaking - they use beans roasted by Gimme Coffee - but it does the trick. They also feature a small array of pastries if you're looking for a quick bite. 

All in all, a solid and visually appealing spot for a cup of hot or cold caffeine."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2016-11-19,3.0,"I was always looking for a coffee place at Tribeca. I tried several other places but all seem fancy but with pretty average coffee quality.

Location: Right at SULLIVAN street. This place is small. Inside, they do offer spots to sit-in. I was there on a heavily rainy day so there were only 1, or 2 people there. 

Food: they have bakeries from Bien Cuit which is good. They seem to roast their own coffee beans. 
I think the quality is okay. A lot of went for latte but I ordered my usual Americano. Like I always felt, the coffee is not that strong. But it does not mean it's not good quality. 

Overall: 3.5 stars."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2017-02-27,4.0,"Very cute space. Typical size + seating number for the neighborhood. One table for four, three smaller pieces of wood sticking out of the walls + wooden stools looking like their made as dining tables for tiny house living.

Clean and inviting with distressed wooden floods and a white + black motif going on. Poster art of a woman in aviators smoking a cigarette and holding a can of redbull endearingly close to her face could have easily been a replica of a photo taken of me in my early 20s.

Old rock strip-club tunes playing on my recent visit on a windy Monday afternoon (think: Pour Some Sugar On Me and Crazy Train. A steady stream of people coming and going with their coffees; never overly busy but never completely dead either. 

A small case of pastries are available: ham & Brie croissant; apple cinnamon danish; whoopee pie; a few different cookies; chocolate croissant; regular croissant. I think I saw one vegan option in the form of a banana chocolate chip muffin.

I had my go-to drink: latté with almond milk, while bae had a hot cocoa. We both enjoyed them -- he loved the whipped cream on his and I adored the taste of mine. It's difficult, in my experience, to get an almond milk coffee drink that doesn't taste totally off from its cow milk counterparts. My only gripe is that I wish my latté came out hotter. I had to finish it quickly because it was already just warm when I got it and it started to get cold really fast. Nothing I hate more than drinking a cold beverage that was once hot. #firstworldprobs, I know, but when I'm paying upwards of $6 for a latté with tip, I want to savor it and take my time -- and have it still be at least slightly warm on the last sip.

I tried to connect to the Wifi, but it needed a password. I was just about to head out anyway so I didn't ask if there was a password available for guests.

We were told of this place by a friend and glad we stopped by for a midday coffee date. Great location but tucked away enough to make it feel like it's your own little secret hideaway. Will be back again for sure!"
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-05,5.0,"A quiet, understated gem.  Delicious coffee.   Quality baked goods.  You can tell a lot about a place by the quality of its chocolate croissant and About Coffee delivers.   Excellent service as well."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2016-08-26,5.0,"Small cute gem secretly tucked inside Sullivan street that carried both gimme! coffee beans and bakeries from Bien Cuit, good taste! 

Actually their flavor was sightly lighter than the original Gimme! Coffee that is literally just blocks away. Both were decent, just depending on your taste. Their dairy was also freshly sourced, which made my cappuccino even more smooth and well balanced."

The Cardamo is pretty good stuff. 
Staff is always polite."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2016-12-23,5.0,"Stopped by for a coffee chat with a friend. It's a tiny store with limited seating but it's really cute. I got a Chai Latte and a tart. I know, I know I went to a coffee shop and didn't get coffee but hear me out! The chai was delicious! Spiced and milky, but not overpowering at all. The tart was alright. It had a lot of different nuts in it and was pretty crunchy.  
I would definitely go back for a Chai again."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2017-10-22,5.0,This was my first time at about coffee and I was very impressed! I wish I lived in the area to visit more often. The cold brew was nice and strong. Well crafted selection of baked goods including donuts from doughnut plant  The staff were also very friendly. They explained the speciality drinks available and even let me sample one of the brewed iced teas.
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2016-05-10,5.0,"This spot just opened up next door to my school! It is a bit off the beaten path in SoHo, but I wouldn't let that keep you from checking out this new local spot.

The owners are the sweetest, their coffee is brewed by the award winning Gimme Coffee, their milk is freshly delivered from Buttermilk Valley Creamery, and their pastries are delivered fresh daily from Bien Cuit in Brooklyn. 

About Coffee accepts Apple Pay and have  punch cards, for every ten coffees you purchase you receive one free!"
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2016-11-04,4.0,"Nice little shop in an area that really doesn't need anymore, especially with the standard edible offerings*...but very friendly staff.

*Unclear if they're unpopular, folks just don't know about this place yet, or they really stock up...but the case was pretty full midday on a weekday. Given how few reviews they've gotten in 6ish months in business, perhaps it's the former."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2017-08-22,5.0,"I came here early this morning and the latte was perfection! I am quite particular about my coffee and really enjoyed the coffee, as well as the chill/happy vibes."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2017-05-04,4.0,"Excellent, high quality coffee here! The cappuccino was excellent. The place was cute but there's really only space for one group of 4 and one of 2. They have these tables that are the tiniest I've ever seen and tiny stools to match. It was tight trying to squeeze my cappuccino aand my tres leches doughnut on the table (which I found hilarious)."
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-06,5.0,Dropped by for a coffee fix because Starbucks was too out of my way. Ordered an iced mocha coffee and it was honestly the best mocha coffee I have ever had. Will return again! Great customer service and very quick with my drink.

131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2016-05-23,5.0,"Finally! A true neighborhood coffee shop. 

Friendly little space with a great assortment of pastries. Outdoor seating on a quiet street so a great place to come during the day and get some work done.

They're still not showing up under Yelp's Coffee & Tea section so hopefully a few more reviews will do the trick :)"
131,about-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-30,4.0,"It's a nice shop. I had their tea. I wasn't a huge fan of the vibe, which is really important to me, but overall is was okay."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,"Excellent smoothie and friendly staff. My smoothie was literally ready in under a minute or so. Cash only, but they have an ATM inside with a very reasonable fee of $1.50. I plan to come back and try other kinds of smoothies."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2019-11-28,3.0,"Normally, I would go for a cold drink but seeing this weather I went for a favorite, bubble tea, in a hot temperature drink.  It was served a bit above warm temperature.

The tea was flavorful but nothing you can't make at home. But being out and about and needing something warm & hot Hawa served the need.

The Boba themselves were very good. Some places serves them too mushy but Hawa does them right. The Boba is soft on the outside and still chewy with a light denseness on the inside. They are mid-sized, smaller than Kung-Fu's and if you had Tiger Sugar, it is in between in terms of size from the small and larger Boba Tiger Sugar serves. On a few of the chews I could taste the sugar in the Boba.

The drinks are certainly good but not exceptionally great."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2019-07-20,4.0,"Went here with a friend to grab an acai bowl on a Friday morning. The place is very small, but there wasn't too much of a crowd there.

It took about 10 minutes to receive my order and we were able to eat inside the store. Overall, the flavor and size of the bowl were good and it was reasonably priced for the area. Not a bad spot to get a quick smoothie or acai bowl in the area."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2019-10-19,5.0,"EVERYONE PLEASE GO AND CHECK THEM OUT!!! I was on a hunt for the best açaí bowl outside of Oahu, Hawaii & I found it! Amazing açaí bowls with the freshest fruit and they have such fast service and friendly crew! I drive every Friday for work and it's become my tradition to stop by for an almond butter açaí bowl. Last Friday, I parked my car and one of the crew members saw me rushing in to avoid a ticket and he told me to go back to my car and he will bring my order over. How sweet and considerate is that?!? Their bowls remind me so much of the ones I enjoyed in Hawaii. Reasonable prices too! GO GO GO CHECK THEM OUT!"
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2019-10-26,4.0,"I really really liked my açai bowl here! I got the peanut butter bowl and it was covered in lots of good fruits like banana, blueberries, and mango, which I find is uncommon on açai bowls. The peanut butter in it made it really tasty, the base was good, and the portion was really great and large for the $10 price. It's a very small place but the line moved quickly. Only complaint is it's cash only and doesn't accept cards, so you can only really go if you have cash on you/feel like using an ATM."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2017-12-20,4.0,"Stepping into Hawa is a little overwhelming. Top 40 is blasting, the walls are papered with specials (not to mention the very large regular menu), and the decor is all over the place.

I went for a protein acai bowl, which was $9 on the menu but $10 at the counter (tax?). It's cash only. The bowl came out fast, within a few minutes, and I took it to go.

There was a lot of fruit on the bowl, and it was good quality. The acai had a weird tang from the protein, but it was firm and cold. Overall, the bowl was pretty filling even though I didn't add any nut butters.

Prices are lower than average for NYC for juices and smoothies, so I would try this place out again for that."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2017-10-29,3.0,"3.5/5

The smoothies are great, but the bubble tea I tried is sh*t. 

Avocado Smoothie- Its made from scratch, but I'm not sure if they removed the avocado skin but the overall taste was pretty good. 

Thai Bubble Tea- literally made from Powder. Ridiculously sweet. The tapioca was soggy. Saddest drink I've ever tasted. 

The interior is very uh cagey so you might want to enjoy your drink outside. 

Get SMOOTHIES and nothing else.

Cash only."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2019-01-07,5.0,"I don't even like juices/smoothies, etc. But I their juices, which you ca customize as you see fit are really good. I get the Power Green, but I tell them to add a mango and ice, and it make it the perfect drink for me!

When I'm sick this is definitely where I go for drinks and ginger shots to help my body fight off colds etc. The acai bowls are delicious.

And of course the staff is super chill and friendly. I like the decor inside and the music, a lot of character."

All fresh fruit   Haven't had anything that wasn't great but Also the service is awesome best in New York City!! Just a side note:  even when there was construction blocking their store front  they ran to the curb and brought your order with a big smile on their face."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2019-08-30,5.0,Best smoothie place in New York. Better than Starbucks... New replacement! With never ending options too. Will be coming back!
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2018-05-02,4.0,Pretty good peanut butter açaí bowl. They pile it with so much fruit! (It's actually kind of hard to eat the first few bites and reach the açaí without spilling fruit.) I especially liked how much mango there was. This place is cash only.
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2019-10-03,2.0,"I'm surprised by the high reviews. This place was very underwhelming for their bubble tea. Perhaps they have better smoothies, but their bubble tea was very watered down. Way too much ice and nearly half the glass was filled with boba instead of any actual tea. The space is extremely tiny, basically standing room only except for a tiny counter at the window with 3 stools."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2019-03-17,5.0,"Best fruit smoothies with great prices! I used to live close by and went all the time, definitely miss it."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2016-11-26,4.0,"Convenient local spot next to Stuytown for juices, smoothies, bubble tea, and açaí bowls! They have a wide variety of flavors for everything. The shop itself is a bit on the small side, with only about three seats, so most people grab and go. The staff is always extremely friendly and helpful with your order. Keep in mind, this place is cash only!


I really like their Rio Açaí Bowl, which comes topped with banana, granola, blueberries, and strawberries with a sprinkle of chia seeds. They give a nice helping of fruit on top, which I really appreciate. They also make everything fresh when you order - you can see them preparing the bowls and drinks. I would always get a bowl post-workout.


Their bubble teas are also quite tasty. They also let you substitute regular milk for almond milk!"
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2019-11-08,5.0,"Hell yeah! Great taste and the price is right, what a way to greet the bright morning! Fresh, clean and delicious! I'm very proud of the work! Keep it up!"

The store smells AMAZING and the staff is super helpful. I love the coconut acai bowl and the watermelon/passion fruit/mango smoothie. So good! 

Only bummer is that Hawa is cash-only."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2016-01-13,5.0,"This smoothie place got me like Whoa! Came here during my lunch break...can not believe I didn't try this place sooner!

I am so impressed with the selections that I will have to come back for more when I am lazy to do it myself at home. It did honestly take me 10 min to figure out what I wanted since there was so many types of drinks you can order. 

WARNING: Cash only!
Medium: $5 (2016)
-Price is a steal compared to the over priced liquiteria (don't get me wrong, that place is bomb, just expensive)

1) Sweet spin
-Mango, kale, spinach, pineapple, lychee
-This was delicious! It was so fresh and you can really taste the lychee.
-I didn't know how I would feel with the lychee, but it definitely adds flavor. I usually make this combo at home and its always on the sour side, but the lychee gave it a sweet taste.
-Definitely going to add lychee to my smoothie recipe after trying this here.

ON THE TO DO LIST: 
-I need to come back to try their boba/bubble tea/tapioca (how ever you all like to call it, boba and tapioca is the west coast term)  

Oh...and they have this ""no picture taking"" sign....maybe you can get away with taking one when they aren't looking =)."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2017-07-15,5.0,"For $6 I made a Custom smoothie with Mango, Pineapple, Kale, Spinach, Banana & Protein smoothie! Let me just it was the most satisying smoothie I've had in a while. That's my go to smoothie usually. For the price and the quality of what I had, you can't beat it. I'll be back again without a doubt. 


Only con on the drink above was it was a tad bit sweet, a tad!! It could be just the mango being a little too ripe, can't blame them for that haha. 


Happy juice day!"
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2015-11-17,5.0,"I can't believe I have lived around the corner from this place for 1 year and am just discovering it! When walking by, it's easy to ignore this storefront since it is so tiny, only has generic juice photos advertised and sits right in between a tiny dry cleaner and a church. If it weren't for yelp, I would have probably never walked into this gem.

If anyone reading this review has ever bought a pressed juice or walked into Liqueteria, you know $10 is about average for a drink. Here, the size large for any smoothie is $6! Already amazing. 

This was only my first visit, so I opted for the signature Hawa Smoothie. It had avocado, cucumber, banana, milk of your choice, and I am forgetting the rest. It was delish! The best part is, they only add what's listed so you know you're not getting added sugars and unnecessary additives.

Pro tip- if your a student, you get 50cents off!"
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2017-01-26,4.0,"I have been to the Hawa in the East Village and the one in the Lower East Side. Both places have a great acai bowl. They are hole in the wall type spots. There are a few seats but orders are mainly taken to go. I ordered the ""Acai bowl"", which includes the banana, pineapple, strawberry, seeds, and granola. I like my acai very cold and the temperature is perfect at Hawa. A bowl costs $8 but you can upgrade to a large bowl. I always upgrade. It is the only acai bowl in New York that I feel completely stuffed afterwards. Hawa dumps a massive amount of fruits on the large bowl. Just as important, the fruit is very fresh. The presentation could be a little better but I have no complaints about the substance. As their name discloses, they also serve smoothies and bubble tea. I have not tried them yet but they also look great.

Please note that Hawa is cash only.

All the drinks I have tried are pretty good. The smoothies are perfect for the summer. My sister is a fan of the Pina Colada, though I don't like pineapple so I guess it depends on your taste. Over the last two years I have gone at times and get the same welcoming feel. The people are great, still remember my friends and I, though we don't come as often.  
The price is affordable and there is a student discount as well."

They have many options and different types of juice selections here, ranging from smoothies to bubble tea to cold pressed juices to acai bowls. They sell many different healthy things such as chia seeds, protein shake powders, etc. I ordered a weight loss juice today mainly for the sweetened flavor. It had lemon, grapefruit and orange. The smaller cup costs $5, larger $6. It was pretty good. Last time I ordered a mango passionfruit smoothie and that was delicious.

Only downside is that it's cash only, but because everywhere else rips off, it's worth having some cash around when you're looking for fresh food. 
It doesn't get any better than this price + taste. There's never a line + workers have the recipes down so it's fast.
One of those NYC hole in the walls that I'm proud to have heard through my friends. All of us attest to its goodness."

For people who spend most of their time in the west village and Chelsea, we seldom have the ability of intention to go to the east village for some good smoothie. But luckily, I am glad that I did. The store is full of healthy ingredients including veggies, fruits, and some GNC components. Basically, you probably will end up with a healthy and powerful smoothie if you go there. 

Smoothie: I had kale monster since I realized that I consumed too much donuts aka carbs and sugar that day, so some veggie hopefully can balance out those bad sugar. And it was really fulfilling. I had medium size but as I finished half of it, I felt full. 

Price: very cheap and now they have 50% off if you had a student id and want to purchase bubble tea. 

Overall: It is a good healthy spot in the east village area."

As i always do at bubble tea shops, i asked them if they can make me a taro milk tea slush even though it's not on the menu & they were nice enough to accommodate!
--- taro slush: the ice was blended finely just as I like but it had a bit of a powdery texture
---milk tea: not a fan of these, I've tried black milk tea and almond milk tea
---jasmine green tea: not bad, you can customize the sweetness level

only one counter for seating inside!!

132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2018-06-05,5.0,Love this place! All the ingredients are nature and not watery like a lot of juices shops. Also they have many options. Definitely the best place for juices and smoothies!
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2017-02-06,3.0,This place is a bit earthy-crunchy for a boba place - it offers a lot of weird juices and the like - but the bubble tea is pretty good.  I found it tasty but a bit over-sweet and the boba a bit chewy.  I suspect this place may be a lot better for their other smoothies!
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2015-01-12,4.0,"I don't know where my cravings for bubble tea come from, but whenever the desire for tapioca drinks takes over my soul, Hawa is there. Quick, easy, delicious, and plenty of flavors to keep you on your toes. From avocado to almond to mango, there's a taste for all flavor profiles.

If you're less of a bubble tea person, pop in for one of their acai bowls. It's one of the best I've had in New York and they're apparently quite healthy."

Their low sugar option is the Pome Queen smoothie and costs 6.50 for a 24oz drink. Refreshing and tasty blend of strawberries, avacado, flax and pomegranate. This place is great for a pick me up if you're in the hood."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2016-08-06,3.0,"So this is a weird complaint but I went there for the first time yesterday and ordered a kale monster. The counter employees are very friendly and service was fast. The first thing I noticed about the drink is that it tastes as good as an icecream smoothie then it hit me on how pretty damn sweet for a fruit/veggie smoothie it was. Made me wonder if some of the ingredients arent so natural or they put some extra sugars in it.

 The drink got me full for the night so I skipped dinner and went to bed. Now I'm awake after having a nightmare! I also felt groggy. I'm likely gonna either try something different next time but I hope it doesnt make me feel crappy the next day."

A large ($6) kept me full till lunch time and I felt great about eating right. The guys that run this place always seem to be high on life and it's very contagious. I feel great walking in and when I leave."

Since then I've checked out Hawa a few times and must agree -- it's excellent! You can smell the fresh vegetables and fruit before you even enter the store. 

The prices are reasonable and they don't skimp on ingredients. I really liked the taro and passion fruit bubble teas. My only qualm is that I think they put too much boba in the drinks (usually I have the exact opposite problem).

I certainly intend on trying more of the options from Hawa. Great find thus far."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2014-04-18,4.0,"I'm a big smoothie/juicing fan so it was nice to find a shop like Hawa.  They offer some really tasty and unique smoothies, fruit and veggie juices and bubble teas.  You can find ingredients here like acai and avocado to lychees and passion fruit. They have wheatgrass too, if that's your thing.

I was in the mood for some Asian flavor so I went with a red bean smoothie.  They used actual sweetened red beans vs the powder that you find in some bubble tea spots.  The regular size was gigantic, big enough to share, so for $4.99 it was a good deal.

I also recommend the watermelon lychee smoothie.  On a hot summer day, it is truly the perfect refreshing drink."
132,hawa-smoothies-and-bubble-tea-new-york,2015-04-20,5.0,"I come here ALL the time with my dog and baby. I have only tried the bubble milk tea, passion fruit bubble tea and avocado smoothie, and they are all deliciously made! And they give a very generous portion of tapioca pearls!

You can get a great cup of coffee here, or coffee in cans if that's what you're looking for.

The barista was super nice and even though it's a small shop there are some good seats along the front windows for working or reading or just chilling."
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2020-05-02,5.0,"Really good Nitro brew. Cheaper than Starbucks and lots of flavor options. Stop by there on a hot or cold day. Good coffee, hard to miss in the Lower East Side. Stop by here!"

The woman working at RISE was an angel on earth. It's not an exaggeration to say that she turned out whole day around. Thank you!! 

P.S. in addition to the wonderful staff, I can also recommend the coffee. It was delicious!"
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2019-08-12,5.0,Best cup of Nitro Cold Brew Coffee in the World!!!
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2019-08-06,5.0,"RISE is known for their nitro cold brew - here, they serve it on tap and in cans. My personal fave is the Oat Milk Nitro Cold Brew - the best in the market. I think what surprised me the most is that they also serve hot beverages by heating up the nitro
cold brew. It actually results in a less acidic beverage than other hot coffees. A cool spot to hang out w friends as there is some seating inside and tables outside. Awesome cafe."
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2019-03-13,1.0,"Four dollars for this incredibly weak cup of coffee 
The most over-prices and underperforming caffeine experience ."
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2018-12-15,5.0,"Cool little coffee spot. Too small to sit, but no biggie. Their niche is draft coffees of all varieties, no espresso drinks here. A unique touch is that you can get the draft coffee hot or cold. The current signature is a ginger spiced oat latte, which tastes super fresh. They use actual fresh spices rather than syrup, and it makes all the difference. Tasty spot."
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2019-01-12,5.0,"If you're ever in need of a pick me up and in this neighborhood- GO HERE. I'm not really sure how they do it but RISE is the smoothest and somehow creamiest nitro I've ever had. 

I'm also a huge fan of their oat latte that they just rolled out- it's not too sweet like some of the other ones out there, and it's a great alternative for those who are dairy free.

I'm partial to the nitro pick me up when the afternoon slump hits but whenever you're in need of delicious caffeine you should stop by this joint!"
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2019-04-08,5.0,"Best cold brew in NYC.
Haley and the staff are impeccable and SUPERARE!
Their establishment is very of its element and 
I love the Feng Shuai in the place.  

A strong...Should not miss!!

EAA"
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2018-11-07,5.0,"RISE Brewing Co's nitro cold brew on tap is a creamy dream -- it pours out looking like there must be milk in there, but there is no milk, sugar or calories in their Original Black flavor.

Lately, they've come out with some new lattes -- two of them are made with oat milk, which is my favorite non-dairy alternative. One is a straight Oat Milk Latte, and the other is a Mocha (which is like a caffeinated chocolate milk). They also have a Classic Latte, for the dairy-inclined.

These sound crazy, but my personal favorites are their citrus flavors -- the Blood Orange, and particularly the Lemonade. It tastes like an Arnold Palmer, but with more caffeine. It's 50% organic lemonade, so I really like it best ice cold, or over ice, and I don't add anything to it. 

This new cafe also has a few seats, so it's a great spot to cozy up with a coffee and knock out a short bit of work, or read while hiding from a summer (or autumn!) rainstorm. 

Love the vibes, keep it up!"

I Highly recommend RISE Brewing Co to anyone looking for a delicious cold brew served by a friendly staff - TIP: Try the Original Black or my personal favorite, the Mocha Latte"
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2019-03-29,5.0,"Literally obsessed with this spot.
Nitro nitro and more nitro, yes please.
And coffee drinks using nitro--even more yeses.
The only suggested tweak is to offer flavored nitro that is part of the brew (as opposed to a flavor add in).
Keep the creations coming, Rise. You rock!"

First off, been here a bunch, have always had pleasant interactions with the staff, and consistently excellent coffee: honestly the best nitro I've tasted in NYC. Today stands out because the woman working, b/t 2-3p 9/14, made my day. May have been out of the Black & Tan, but a little life affirmation in lieu of, more than made up."
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2019-01-11,5.0,I start every morning with the RISE nitro cold brew original black. 200mg in one serving saves me so much time as I don't have to prep coffee in the morning and drink multiple cups throughout the day. One can of RISE and I'm good to go. Also the no sugar no calories is welcoming to my diet. One stop shop for your coffee needs with great people throughout.
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2019-08-01,5.0,Love the outdoor tables when the weather is nice for my afternoon pick me up! Staff is always friendly and the Nitro is the creamiest and smoothest in the city.
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2019-01-23,5.0,"I don't usually even like coffee, but I can honestly say that I LOVE Rise. The oat milk latte may be the best tasting caffeinated beverage I've ever had. And the caffeine high that it gives you is so focused / not jittery / perfect in every way. Thank you Rise!!!"
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2019-01-23,5.0,"I can't say I've ever had a cold brew that hasn't tasted bitter, until I met Rise. Staff was absolutely amazing and very accommodating.

Definitely try the Oat Milk Latte or the regular black. Wish I lived closer so I could drop by every morning!"
133,rise-cafe-delancey-new-york,2018-11-19,5.0,"The best nitro I've found. Black, lattes, all good. Nice people. Everything was organic and very clean. Nice smell inside and it was warm on a cold day."

134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2020-03-15,5.0,Rare to see a store with vantage atmosphere near down town Manhattan.  Warm and cozy to stay there all day. Have a cup of coffee and watch people come and go. Relax heart and mind
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2020-03-07,5.0,"This was place was great! Customer service was so friendly and helpful. I had their brown sugar bubble
milk tea and it was creamy and delicious!!! Hits the the spot. Glad I came here for my afternoon sugar fix. I would love to come back and try all the other drink specials. The snack selections looked good too, though I didn't have a chance to try it this time. I will be back to try the pastries."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-11-30,4.0,"Everytime I'm in the city I make several trips just to get the sakura rose latte or whatever variation of sakura rose drink is in season from this specific caffe bene location. It's pretty much a tradition for me now and I'm not sure what I would do if they took it off the menu. I have also tried the apple chicken grilled cheese sandwich and thought it was pretty good for a chain cafe.

However recently I got some macarons there because macaron cafe was closed, those macarons were the hardest and driest macarons I've ever had. I had to toss the whole box out because I couldn't even bite down on them. I've gotten macaron cafe macarons and I know they stay soft for over a week in the fridge (yea I know you're supposed to eat them within days), which means these macarons were probably sitting there for over a week. 

Still will always be back for that sakura rose latte, and will definitely like to try more freshly made food, but I would suggest passing on the macarons."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-11-11,4.0,"Great location but also gets a LOT of tourists just looking to use the free bathroom. Friendly staff who do not discourage bathroom-goers. This is not definitely not a place to sit with your laptop and get anywhere work done especially if you are sitting by the tables near the counter. 

I like their misugaru latte(protein latte)."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-08-22,4.0,"I was left standing at the cash register for awhile, which was worse because I was on crutches...the staff was certainly not attentive, but the spaghetti was pretty good and the right amount of garlic. Don't get the mushrooms though- they weren't very tasty. The space was nice if a bit dim, and had outlets and tables for a good studying vibe. Overall nice!"
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-08-10,4.0,"Real decent coffee/dessert shop. My bf and I stopped by here while window shopping in the area. Tried their strawberry gelato and it was delicious with small bits of strawberry. 

Love how the inside is very clean. It's not too crowded so you can enjoy your food in your own space. We are our gelato and people watched by the window. Very relaxing place to grab something small to eat."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2020-01-11,5.0,"Always go there after work. It's a good place, everyone nice to me. Delicious food and good coffee. Especially during Christmas, the store decoration is very warm. The price also reasonable."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-08-26,2.0,"ordered gelato on waffle (coffee flavor), about 9 bucks.

coffee gelato taste good, hardly go wrong, above average sweet.

disappointing waffle , not crunchy (or crispy).

**
I have high hope because my very first first green tea ice-cream on waffle was at Caffe Bene in Seoul.
This is far below the standard.

two stars for failing the high expectation on a crispy waffle."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-07-23,3.0,"Waited here for my ride back to New Jersey, so the location was very convenient. I ordered a sweet corn and mayo honey bread and it tasted very good, but for $8 you'd expect more than just a soft slice of bread toasted with canned corn and this sweet mayo on it. They also took a while to make it. I had the wipe the table down myself because it had crumbs all over it.  The plastic utensils were supposed to be separated (forks and knives) but they were kinda mixed together. So I'm not sure how many hands have touched each one. Didn't feel that clean. However, the sweet corn honey bread was just my taste."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2020-01-19,5.0,"I love this little place.  Cozy and comforting atmosphere.  Great coffee, tea selections and the honey bread is a great find!  I stopped in every single day during my four day vacation."

134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-10-27,1.0,"Don't know even where to begin with this place:

1. If took the cashier a few minutes to take my order of a simple egg white and cheese on a bagel lightly toasted with butter. Which cost $5.25 (not including taxes)

2. Took 10 minutes to make. Which is completely insane specially in New York City.  (There were only two customers a man who had placed an order after me and myself.)

3. I finally received a fake looking bagel,  about the size of the palm of my hand (super small). I could not stop laughing when I saw what I payed for.) 

4. The eggs were scrambled and certainly not egg whites! Which means the egg fell out as you grabbed the chubby-baby bagel. They ever so lightly sprinkled  shredded cheddar cheese on the egg and to top it off  they added something sweet! Very puzzling and ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! 

How can a business in Tribeca mess up a regular NYC egg and cheese on a bagel! I'm sure that they were trying to be original creating their fake version of an egg and cheese on a bagel but they failed miserably!"
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2018-11-04,5.0,"This is a great study spot. Not only do they have great tasting coffee, but they have a great selection of delicious desserts. So if the caffeine in your drink can't get you motivated to study, at least the sugar rush definitely will.

There are four bar-style seating, 8 two-person tables, and one four person table in this cafe. Although not too much seating, the space is pretty large and airy, so you don't feel claustrophobic. There are also outlets and the WiFi password is available on the receipt after you purchase something (so don't throw away the receipt unless you want to awkwardly ask the cashier). 

The music is pretty much your standard top 50 songs but played pretty softly so it makes for good background noise. I'll definitely try to come here more often to get work done rather than go to Starbucks."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-08-05,2.0,"The response from the management was swift and greatly appreciated!
I am glad they addressed the employee directly the issue. Their 'excuse' for no gloves because of the difficulty in pulling apart the white cheese for grilled cheese sandwiches is absurd particularly when I watched the employee stick his bare hand in a contusion shredded cheese and manipulate the white bread all without benefit of using a glove. At least it's not a process issue but rather a training issue - don't do what's easiest do what's right and on compliance with the Dept of Health. I'll go back just to poke my head in the kitchen to check!"
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-12-06,5.0,Nice little cafe to have a cup of coffee and maybe get some work done in. Has a relatively big menu Incase you're not in the mood for just coffee. I went in and didn't know what to order but the cashier was very helpful in helping me decide on what I wanted.
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-03-29,4.0,"We were meeting a friend for a leisurely conversation and we wanted to find a place in lower Manhattan convenient for her & us, where there was plenty of seating *and* where we weren't blasted into the stratosphere by the music.  I read reviews of many coffeehouses and finally found this place.  We went there this afternoon and were thrilled that there was no music whatsoever (quite a rarity!), plus we were easily able to find a table.  The space isn't as large as it seemed from the descriptions and photos, but it certainly sufficed.  The young woman behind the counter was pleasant and the price of (regular) coffee was reasonable.  Also; the restroom was very clean, although the hand dryer didn't work.  The reason why I'm not giving five stars is because the coffee was really bland and weak.  However, we and our friend intend to meet there periodically because of the positive aspects."

134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2018-11-26,3.0,"My sister and I were stopping for a quick breakfast, but it was the opposite. I ordered 1 drink and 3 sandwiches. I was hoping for bubble tea, but at 8:15 AM in the morning maybe I was expecting too much. There was poor communication between the waitress and the one other guy working. We waited for 11 minutes with 3 other customers (2 ordered coffee). My chai tea did not come out until the two people who ordered after me got their coffee. 
The bagels were pretty horrible. Tough to bite into and did not seem fresh. 
Maybe we ordered something they don't usually do, but overall not too happy."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2020-01-06,2.0,This place just gives you frozen food and eggs from a carton. It's really not worth the prices and it's really just not good. Would not come here again.

134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-02-02,3.0,"I was staying at the Sheraton Tribeca right next-door, and it was below freezing that night. I was starving but didn't have the audacity to travel more than a few yards outside of my hotel. I had seen Caffe' Bene a few times and recognized the name as well. I looked up the menu online and thought I could find something healthy and delicious there. It was a Friday night and I got there around 7:30 PM. I met Kevin W, the owner who told me his backstory. He said after moving to America all he wanted to do is open a café and now he's living his dream. That made me feel happy to support the restaurant even more. I got a turkey Panini and asked for avocado on the side as well as a side salad. I grabbed a water bottle and a lemon ginger tea and everything in total came to about $15. Very affordable, especially for New York prices. I got my food to-go and was pleased with how big my salad was. They press their Paninis in their waffle maker so it kind of looks like you're eating a waffle with your sandwich inside, but really it's just regular bread. I thought that was creative and definitely an A+ for looks. Overall, the sandwich itself was far too bready for me. I couldn't really taste what was in the middle, but tea and the salad were amazing and the avocado was nice and fresh and the portion was generous. I stay at this hotel often, so I will be returning to try out the breakfast as breakfast is my favorite meal."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2018-08-31,3.0,"Well organized, good food but they need to watch for some bad food. I picked a pastry over the counter and it was moldy. I have to return to the store and get a refund."

134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-04-06,1.0,"I went to this cafe on a whim and sadly I regret it. I was expecting something great since the rating was so high. I ordered a latte and an open faced sandwich with avocado, scrambled egg and salmon. The coffee was just ok, but I was completely disgusted by what they presented to me for the sandwich. It was small for the price and tasted fake. The eggs tasted like they were made from powder, the avocado was so blended and thinned out it was more like a spread or dip. And I could taste all the additives in that 'avocado' . Probably the only thing real was the salmon and bread, cause how can you fake that. 
Needless to say I will not be going back here ever, and if you want real food don't bother to visit this place."

Nifty little spot for a coffee drink, snack, and free strong WiFi in relaxed surroundings.

Cozy seating, spiffy woodsy looking decor, soft music, and a clean bathroom.

Not that many outlets though so make sure you're charged up beforehand. Only a few located by some tables near the back. Friendly staff working the counter. One unisex bathroom that a key code is needed to enter, and you receive that along with the wifi code on your receipt from your purchase.

The iced coffee is tasty as are the eats here. Many desserts to nosh on. Decently priced. Bright and airy space with tables and window counter seating. Was nice and empty on a late Friday afternoon other than a few having coffee and surfing the web.

Nice alternative to other chain coffee spots, and definitely a more civilized place to get some work done and suck up some free WiFi."

134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2017-08-28,4.0,"When I found out there was a Caffe Bene on the borders of TriBeCa and Chinatown, I was excited because I adore blogging and working from coffee shops and cafes (but they have to be good ones). It's located on a busy block of Caffe Bene with multiple retail, tourist trap shops, Planet Fitness, The Sheraton hotel, and much more. It's also accessible by the Canal Street station in Chinatown serviced by: 6, J, Q, R, N, W and Z. Another Canal Street station is close by and serviced by: A, C and E. 

This Caffe Bene is not as big as the one I normally go to in Bensonhurst (my hood), but at least it's got cozy seating, wood-like decor, soft music, and a clean bathroom. WiFi is strong and working at this location. The staff here are very friendly and nice. I've been here once and twice and at times there are people like me that enjoy writing or working out of a coffee shop, tourists, and people that work around the neighborhood. There's a decent amount of outlets available for your electronic charging needs.

I definitely feel that the iced coffee here is slightly better than the Bensonhurst location. Two things I liked about this Caffe Bene during my first visit is that they have salads (not much, but still good). I feel a lot of people that work or live around TriBeCa seek salads and there aren't many salad spots in that part of TriBeCa and in Chinatown. I also saw they had a menu available for visitors to look at which I thought was great and a nice touch! 

Overall, I've had some positive experiences working and writing my blogs in this Caffe Bene. I'm glad they've opened up another one in Lower Manhattan. I'm a huge Starbucks fan, but Caffe Bene is definitely a good alternative from Starbucks at times and Dunkin Donuts."
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2019-05-14,5.0,The pancake tastes amazing! I love their latte and special seasonal drink menu. Quick tips: Wifi password and bathroom code are printed on your receipt. U're welcome!
134,caffe-bene-new-york-34,2017-07-01,4.0,"The calm before the storm.  Breakfast in a phlegmatic state before the beginning of the business day at the peripheral areas of Chinatown, NYC.  Cozy atmosphere of a old world charming library with custom wood built wall book case complete with actual books and rolling ladder, picture frames, some lamps and wooden tables.  Soft background music is playing in the background.  I agree with Phil H. as there are insufficient electrical outlets available, thus be sure to leave your home with a full battery.  Caffe Bene's signature continuous design video is playing above the order counter of the conception of artisanal light bulbs in industrial pendants.  My favorites are their croissant sandwiches, Belgian waffles and macaroon cookies.  A whole croissant is given which is quite large.  I chosen the classic ham and cheese croissant $4.25 and hot Jasmine tea.  Hot teas are offered by Kusmi Tea.  Amazingly what began as a leading coffee franchise in South Korea is now global and I can access Caffe Bene in NYC!  A quaint cafe.  Caffe Bene has bubble tea, but unfortunately not available in the morning.

I got hot milk bubble tea, and the size and texture of the bubbles were perfect (they were large, and not too hard or soft). The flavor of the tea is also very good as the sweetness is not too overpowering. I was also pleasantly surprised with the taste of the fruit cup because they seemed relatively fresh for fall. Although some of the items are pricey, I stayed for a few hours to do homework so it felt worth it. I would like to come back to try more of the drinks."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,"Amazing coffee, one of the best I've had, no cream no sugar needed! Ambiance is great, put your phone down and enjoy the coffee and amazing service"
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2020-05-31,4.0,"Kobrick has renovated and it looks great - way more spacious and very bright and airy. Of course you can't sit inside right now, but hopefully soon. 

On my recent visit, I had a cold brew and cracked crescent (croissant) sandwich - both great. Also tried some mini pastries which were only okay. Definitely stick to the hot food here. 

Glad Kobrick is back open!"
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2020-03-05,3.0,"I love Kobrick for their ambience but I have to give them 3 stars... their employees are consistently rude and incompetent. They give me the wrong pastry more frequently than they give me the right one. I do love all of their pastries, which helps the case here. I was given a croissant today when I didn't order one but I still ate it because it was really good. Apparently someone must have ""stolen"" my coffee, though, because mine never came out and they remade it before I made my way out. This is not the first time that this has happened and the staff gave me some eye rolls when I explained that I never got my drink, so I don't think I'll feel super compelled to come back soon. I think Kobrick could be 5 stars if their staff got an attitude check and maybe a little more training. 

Nonetheless, I love their food/drink... If you happen to come by, my recommendations would be the spicy avo (avocado toast), their almond croissants, almond milk lattes, oat milk matcha lattes, and their city breakfast (steamed eggs w/grated cheese on a croissant)."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2020-02-04,1.0,"I came in with a friend for a drink for her and tea for me. While the drinks all looked awesome, service was atrocious. It took forever for us to get a menu, even longer to order, and about 15 minutes from ordering to receiving our drinks despite being seated at the bar and not ordering anything complicated.

Finally, when we were ready to pay, no one took our cards for over 10 minutes even though they were on the counter, waiting to be run. I eventually caved and flagged a bartender down, and he acted like I was being unreasonable for wanting to pay and get going. Not the vibe I'm looking for; and there were enough bartenders to expect a reasonable turnaround on payment (I understand if you're slammed and there isn't enough staff to turn everything around quickly, but that wasn't the case when we were in)."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2020-06-08,1.0,"Non of the staff wore any face covering ... not the front counter barista or the woman in the kitchen...
The store should provide PPE for staff and serving staff should be wearing them ! 

Will not return again."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-11-14,5.0,"I just want to move in here. I feel as if I'm in a dream where I've concocted my own magical cafe that has plucked out my favorite things in the world--quality coffee, alcohol, cheese and small plates--and packed them into an inventive menu in a charming, cozy cafe. 

Kobrick's has always been one of my favorite roasters. Their coffee is not as easy to find in NY these days as it once was, as far as I know, so just having their excellent coffee is a treat in and of itself. 

Then you throw in a full bar with an impressive array of cocktails, many of them seasonal and...wait for it...incorporating Kobrick's coffee.  This is the upscale, actually tasty version of energy cocktails I've been waiting for, you Vodka & Red Bull swilling childred.  So boozy, yet so delicious--what a rare treat.  Standard, non-coffee cocktails and wine are solid as well.

So you can get high quality caffeine or high quality alcohol--that in and of itself should suffice, no?  Well, the food is off the charts as well.  The ricotta tartine, with a drizzle of honey and some microgreens, was incredibly tasty, and they offer an impressive cheese board.  Interesting salads on the menu as well.  You can even go dessert--the fresh berries with golden schlag (a thick, tasty, espresso-drizzled whipped cream) were exceptional, and you can even kind of lie to yourself and tell yourself it's a slightly healthier dessert.

Top it all off with a back seating area as charming and decadant as all of the food and beverage you are consuming--as if you stepped into a French Renaissance waiting room or something--and I'm simply unwilling to move until my stomach can't fit any more and/or guilt and a waiting queue makes me reluctantly surrender my table."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-11-14,4.0,"Kobrick has two different entrances- the right door which is essentially take out/coffee only and the left which is more of a cafe/serves cocktails. 

I walked into Kobrick before going to see an exhibit on a Tuesday evening and while it looked like there were tables open, we were still waiting a bit to be seated. The space itself is not big but as we saw open tables, we eventually just waited for someone to leave a bar spot so we could snag a drink quicker. 

The space itself looks like a trendy Brooklyn coffee shop. Once we sat at the bar, we ordered the Voodoo Guy and The Retox. Neither drinks were overly sweet and both had a smokiness. The first drink took upwards of 15 minutes to make even though we were seated at the bar. As soon as we got that one, we ordered the prosciutto truffle tartine and two more cocktails in anticipation of a wait - Matcha Made in Heaven and Sage it Ain't So. Both drinks came out within 5 minutes this time. The Matcha Made in Heaven was my favorite drink that we got - the egg whites perfectly balanced the drink. The truffle oil on the prosciutto tartine was even better than we expected as well. 

If you're in the area and looking for a casual and/or quick place to grab a coffee or drink, Kobrick is the spot for you. The food menu is mostly finger foods so don't come starving."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-11-18,4.0,"Such a cute spot that I fell in love with! Cute decor, good coffee to warm me up and theee best, and also filling spicy avocado toast I've had in a restaurant. The avocado toast is sprinkled with crushed peppers and can be ordered with or without the egg. I personally do not care for sunny-side up eggs, so when I asked for the egg well done, they complied with no problems! I ordered the vanilla latte with almond milk and although it was a little stronger than I prefer, it kept me warm. 

As far as seating goes, please note that there is a large dining area but it was super packed and then they have small cafe tables, a couch and bar seating which is all first come first serve. Thankfully, a couple was just finishing as we finished ordering so we were able to snag a table."

135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-09-01,5.0,"Every time I find myself down to the Whitney, it's good to know I can go to Kobrick Coffee and  always get an excellent cup of coffee. The staff is always super friendly, with a warm greeting when you walk in, and although I usually take my coffee to go, this time we decided to stay in order in.

Sitting at Kobrick is very limited, but fortunately we were able to get a table right away. Our waitress was very friendly and brought over waters right away since it was a hot day. I ended up ordering a hot latte because it seemed appropriate for some reason and it was delicious. Creamy milk steamed to the perfect temperature and bold but not overpowering espresso flavor that bad felt very well balanced.

I look forward to my next visit!"
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-08-18,4.0,"Kobrick is a small batch coffee roaster in Manhattan with two locations. The roaster has been around for 100 years! This location is small with a bar area and a tiny dining room in the book. Outside are two small patio tables and a bench. 

My latte was high class and perfect. If you are into coffee, you'll find this place GREAT!"

Coffee shop by day, cocktail bar by night. For the cocktail bar: the vibe is low key, trendy and intimate, which is a rare find in Meatpacking. Lots of seating and on a Saturday night at 9 pm, no wait. Specialize in coffee cocktails and all of them were delicious."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-08-05,4.0,"Was pleasantly surprised by the place and their quality! The drinks are unique, never saw those combinations before. The atmosphere is nice, very relaxing. The only thing I would change is to upgrade those dusty couches , cause they look filthy. 
We tried a couple of cocktails which were absolutely delicious! We got salmon tartar and cheese plate, we're ok for the place."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,"This is a place with character. The tiles and brakes look decades old at least, and the chairs are plush and cushy. Coffee and pastries as required. Great ambience."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-10-23,5.0,"I ended up trying both sides of this coffee shop on the same day, for lunch and dinner. Had the spicy avocado toast + cortado for lunch, in the extension side on a Saturday morning. Delish and such a nice view! 

After shopping in the area, I ended up on the original side of this shop and was seated towards the back for lunch. Ordered a French toast with blood orange juice. The French toast was white bread toasted in press panini press, but with delish butter, syrup, and berries. Topped it off with the fresh orange juice and great service overall."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-11-05,5.0,"This chic liquor/coffee bar definitely contributes to the reputation that this neighborhood has for great food and nightlife establishments! If you're wondering the vibe, think Death & Co/Speak Easy. There is staff at the door and seating space is limited so be aware of that on the weekends. The cocktails are great, and it's nice to follow with a cappuccino and one of their artsy desserts. I'll definitely be back!"
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-10-05,3.0,"I was looking for a place to do some work on my computer so stumbled upon this coffee place.

The seating area is small so it can be hard to find a table. 

I got the San Marco from their brunch menu and the Jersey Lightning cocktail. Both were good but nothing extra ordinary. The San Marco toast comes with prosciutto on the top, which gave it a lot more flavor. 

Their cocktail menu, which is available after 6pm looked very interesting. I would like to go back for drinks but don't think it's the best place to get work done.

Btw I loved their music playlist!"
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-09-29,4.0,"I walked here from the PATH train on a Sunday afternoon.  It wasn't busy.  I ordered a coffee with almond milk and the Ricotta toast.  They have table service.  The Ricotta toast was sweet.  Coffee was good.  It's a little pricey but standard for NYC.

I worked in here for about 2.5 hours.  Good place to get work done.  Free WiFi.  Relatively quiet.  There's not a lot of space so I wouldn't recommend for groups.  

Place was a little messy.  Tables were dirty.  Service was attentive.  There were a few flies.

Furniture is upscale.  Looks fancy inside.  Menu has a nice selection of foods, although portions are a little big.  Don't expect healthy food coming here. 

But there are plenty of options to choose from, including bar snacks and a carchuterie board if you're with a group.

It's not far from the PATH and a good place."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-08-14,4.0,"Had the chance to visit Kobrick coffee when I was on the hunt for a casual and visually appealing coffee spot somewhere in the meatpacking area. I had never heard of Kobrick coffee before but I decided to give it a shot and I'm happy I did. This cafe is the perfect place for a causal brunch or just for a sit down with a friend over casual drinks.

I found myself here on a Saturday with my friend around 10 AM. When I arrived I was happy to see that they had a small outdoor section, especially since it was a nice day outside. However we opted for a table inside. The space is nicely decorated with marble top tables and plush seats, as well as an actual bar for additional seating.

When it came time to order we both opted for their ice coffee which ran around $4. Overall good quality and not overtly bitter. The staff here was also on point! They gave us time to overlook the menu, answered our questions, and brought out our drinks to us fast. 

This is definitely the ideal spot to get coffee in the neighborhood. If you're looking for something more intimate, cozy, and tasteful, this should be your go to."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-08-11,5.0,"This cute cafe/bar feels like going back to the speakeasies of New York in the Roaring 20s or some fancy hangout for turn-of-the-century Parisian literary mavens. While undoubtedly small, it offers a more cozy-than-cramped feel. 

They have quite a selection of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic​ drinks, as well as some sandwiches and snacks. The coffee -- both your average cappuccinos and lattes, as well as the specialties​ like the Cafe Rozy -- are absolutely to die for! 

You have a better bet coming here to this nook than nearby Starbucks Roastery or any of the overhyped coffee shops in Chelsea Market."

If they have one foot long roach they have many. My daughter had to leave her cheese cake she was enjoying. He should have taken something off the bill. The salmon toast and everything was really good but Yuck!
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2020-02-05,4.0,Great vibes and great coffee! I ordered the honey lavender latte and it was a great choice! Only thing is that the drink was a tad bit too sweet for my taste.
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2020-01-11,4.0,"Worth noting that the coffee shop is completely separated from the bar with two separate entrances. One of the best aspects of this place is they are open quite late as most cafes close early.

Lovely refreshing space with a fair amount of room. Not necessarily a ton of seating but doesn't feel cramped when you're settled. There's a couch, a swinging chair for two, and tables. 

Good typical cafe fare of food and drink. Wish there were loose leaf tea choices but there a good number of tea bag options."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2020-01-31,3.0,"The ambience and drink I ordered were spectacular! 
They lost 2 stars because of this:
1) The waiter asked me once what I'd like to order and when I asked for a couple of minutes to decide, he never came back. 
2) I got his attention finally and ordered a drink which never came. After 45 minutes, I walked up to the bar to check and the bartender hadn't received the order at all. The bartender was apologetic and made it right away. 
3) During the 45 minute wait, the waiter never came by even once to check on us. 
4) Here's the highlight- I left a $2 tip for my one very late drink and was charged $3!"
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2020-01-12,5.0,"We absolutely loved this place! The vibe was great, it's like a really chill bar. Our drinks took a little while to get there but the waitress gave us some muffins for our wait. Even when we told her we had a Broadway show she was still very nice about it, and made sure we got our drinks at a timely manner. Even after all of this she took 10% off from the check because we waited a while for our drinks. Honestly that's super rare to find in the city especially her quality of service. The drinks were great! I got the strong island iced tea and let me tell you... it's one of the best Long Islands I've had!!
Highly recommend this place and will most definitely be coming back! We are super happy we found this place!"
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-11-14,4.0,"3.5 stars for this place. From first appearance, this spot looks like a bougie coffee shop. The great thing about this place is that in addition to coffee, they offer specialty cocktails and small appetizers. My friend and I came here to grab a couple of drinks. For a Tuesday night, it was fairly crowded and there was a constant flow of people coming in and out. We waited for a couple of minutes for a table and found it odd that the tables to our right (which could fit 6 people) was given to just a party of two with their laptops and personal items scattered. Instead of getting a table, we saw that two seats opened up by the bar so we chose that instead. For the first round of drinks, we ordered the fallen Fitzgerald and the voodoo guy. It did take longer than usual for the bartender to make our drinks. Wasn't sure if it was because we were seated behind the espresso machine and he might have forgotten about our orders. We also ordered the prosciutto truffle tartine - this is the perfect sharing dish as everything is divvied up already. For the second round, we ordered the Sage it Ain't so and the matcha made in heaven. Overall the drinks were not overly sweet although, pretty pricey at $17 a pop - welcome to NY!"
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-05-03,5.0,"Great place to get a coffee cocktail! I got the spiced latte and it was super delicious! They check your id when you go in when it's late at night. The bartender/barista was very friendly. We sat at the bar, so I'm not sure how big it is inside."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-03-31,4.0,"My friend and I stopped by Kobrick coffee for a light lunch and for a drink on Saturday.  I ordered the exotic mushroom tartine, but the waiter put in an order for the truffle prosciutto tartine instead.  When the wrong dish arrived I informed the waiter and he apologized, put in an order for the correct dish and let us keep the incorrect dish free of charge.  I'm kind of happy the mistake was made since I liked the truffle tartine.  Mozzarella was fresh, light and soft.  Prosciutto was thin cut, tender and packed with flavor.  Basil on top was fragrant and contrasted well with the other two components.  I didn't really taste any of the truffle, but enjoyed the other components, so I didn't mind.  The exotic mushroom toast was piled high with grilled mushrooms that were seasoned perfectly with thyme really standing out.  It would be enjoyed by any mushroom fanatic.  I had the Mexican Jumping Bean as my drink.  It was quite intense with coffee flavor with a mild sweetness and had just a touch of viscousness, but went down smoothly.  The check came at the end of the meal with both tartines on it and no discount for the drink I redeemed with the Hooch subscription.  I brought this to the waiter's attention.  He apologized and corrected it.    Overall a good experience, but a bit upsetting with the mistakes on the check.

On another occasion I had the Mackin Scotch which had a perfect balance of scotch and apple cider making it a hearty drink in the fall."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2018-08-15,4.0,"I really dug this place. Great service, the atmosphere has an old school vibe that resonates with me, our bartender did not oversell how smooth their espresso was and the cocktails we had (Kyoto Negroni and Stay At Home Dad) were nice and strong.

I will look forward to returning here on future trips to the city.

P.S. I had a little taste of their coffee Gelato and it was inedible. Tasted freezer burned, I would recommend steering clear of that here. All else was great."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-02-21,4.0,"I went with a group of 5 to Kobrick Coffee on a Sunday afternoon. Some people in our group wanted to cocktails and some wanted to do coffee or tea so Kobrick seemed like the perfect spot for us. The location is small. There is a long entry with a counter, stools, and a coffee/food bar where you can order items to go if you want. The back room has about 6 cozy seating areas with small round tables and booth/chair/armchair seating. 

When we arrive, there was a 20 minute wait for a table in the bag so we waited in the front area. The staff was very helpful and accommodating in trying to fit our party in. When the table that would hold 5 people became available, our server moved things around a little to make sure we had space. We got the corner booth and the five of us squeezed in. It was a tight fit but it wasn't uncomfortable.

Our group tried so many things. I went with non alcoholic options and got a chai and a chocolate milk. Both were great. The chocolate milk was delicious and was presented in a cute little milk bottle with a metal straw. The rest of my party tried the coffee cocktails and classic cocktails with positive feedback. Overall, our experience was fun and Kobrick fit exactly what we were looking for."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-08-19,5.0,"This is my go to spot for coffeehouse meetings. As well as providing late winter night's with warm digestif's to keep the chill at bay.

135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2018-05-22,4.0,"We came late on a Thursday night and the place was basically empty. It was extremely chill and easy to hear one another. Music was some sort of funk jazz. 

Place seems to be more of a coffee bar, but the cocktail selection is exceptional. 

I had the matcha made in heaven, which consists of gin, matcha syrup, lime, lillet blanc, and egg white. A very smooth tasting drink and especially frothy from the egg white. They also have some coffee cocktails here that may be quite good considering it's also a coffee shop. 

Servers were laid back and didn't pressure us at all. Lighting here is extremely dim, so could be a good date spot."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2018-03-25,4.0,"Charming coffee place near Chelsea Market. Also appears to be a brunch destination judging by the amount of people in the small-sit down area. For coffee-drinkers, there are stools at the bar and at a wall-bar.

I got a cortado that ended up being $5 or $6 after tax and tip (yeesh). I asked for water when I ordered and didn't get it (had to ask again after ten minutes). I ordered my drink but she didn't ring it up and take my card for a few minutes. The girl didn't slide my ticket over to the barista for like ten minutes... I saw it happen. They were busy but not overwhelmed, were working on restocking glasses and such. So I waited fifteen minutes for a coffee for no reason. I wasn't in a rush so ultimately fine, but it bothered me that there was no apology or acknowledgment.

The cortado itself was lovely. Great quality coffee, correct ratio of steamed milk, nice art on the top. Added a touch of simple syrup to make for perfect drink.

Good ambiance to linger in; read for a while. Dim lighting. Nice music. Bathrooms are beautiful."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2019-01-15,1.0,"Cool, but terribly cramped coffee shop with tables with unconventionally large bases that require sitting sideways or straddling. Our host was pompous and a little much with the sass. He carried himself as if seating and taking orders was above him. It was just so out of place. We ordered our drinks, drank, and quickly got out of that hole."
135,kobrick-coffee-new-york,2018-11-27,5.0,"This is one of my favorite cocktail spots in Manhattan, and as the self-proclaimed (and realistically most likely undeserving) queen of cocktails, this means something. 

You might be a little confused because this is a ""coffee spot"" not a ""cocktail bar"" but don't let the name fool you: this place turns into a full-on cocktail bar after hours.

They have an extensive menu of regular and coffee-based cocktails. Even though a coffee cocktail wouldn't be my normal choice, it's kind of their thing so I think you should venture outside your comfort zone and try one. Ever since I went to Italy 6 months ago, I have had approximately 73 negronis which includes Kobrick's Three Hour Kyoto Negroni. I was skeptical at first but it definitely works! The rest of the cocktails are a rotating menu based on the season. I've never done it myself but they have these pretty neat punches as well which look pretty awesome from afar. 

I have been here during the day as well and think the coffee rocks and while the menu is a little limited food-wise, I do enjoy their tasty toasts!"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2020-03-12,5.0,"At first I was meh about the shrimp rice roll, but I didn't realize you had to put soy sauce and hot sauce. Totally changed the flavor! I even got a scallion one after. $2 each and so good!!! Scallion was my favorite"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2019-07-02,4.0,"Ladies and gents, frankly it doesn't get much better than $2 for a fresh, steamy shrimp rice roll.  That's exactly what I got, exactly what I paid, and a 10 minute walk later back to the hotel and it was still steaming.

The shrimp isn't to die for, but you can tell that the rice roll was made by someone who makes hundreds of rice rolls a day and knows that they deliver consistent results.  Consistent enough to keep locals happy and coming back and attract the unsuspecting Cantonese looking for a slice of home in the streets."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2018-12-19,5.0,"Delicious indeed! Bustling in the AM with locals grabbing a quick breakfast bite (this is how you know it's authentic), it has a bakery counter with baked good in the front, fresh soy milk for breakfast, and freshly streamed rice crepe from 6am to 7pm! (That is wonderfully early) I was a bit surprised this place wasn't on yelp, but given both owners and patrons this morning don't speak much English - this is definitely an authentic find.

I am hesitant to trek into a bakery (GF...), but upon reading the sign for the rice noodle crepe (with my stomach growling and nothing else GF and open in sight), I ventured in and asked about the use of flour (none) in the crepe mix, and then read up in Mandarin ingredients typically used online (rice based), and given the steamer is in its separate area and can only be used for rice noodles - I decided to give it a shot, sans any sauces (and avoided things like pork ribs that has sauce pre-added)

The shrimp and lettuce one was devoured very quickly, and I bought two more to go, shrimp and shrimp and chicken. I will definitely bring my own tamari next time - but happy to find a cheap delicious meal in Chinatown since I craaaaaaaaave Chinese food so much after having to become gluten free! $2 for any flavor, $.75 for each additional topping (topping is added very sparingly so I recommended adding a second, or third).

Service is quick and efficient - NY no-nonsense AM style. And you will literally wait under 5 min for freshly steamed-to-order rice noodle crepe, barring anyone ahead of you in line."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2018-10-28,5.0,"They have the best taro puff in Chinatown!!! Highly recommend!

My go-to order is spare ribs with cilantro and the dried shrimp. They're a little skimpy with the spare ribs but I get it. they're trying to keep the prices low for everyone. 
They have many kinds of buns too. But I only come here for the rice roll crepes!!!"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2019-04-30,5.0,"Mmm the first time I came here, I was with my partner and we were heading to the station in the winter. It was sooo goshdarn cold that when I saw their rice roll sign I immediately wanted to go in for some warm food. I went there again with my partner and we spent about 15 minutes just walking through Chinatown just to find it lol. 

Their steamed rice rolls are made fresh and piping hot, served in a metal tin for only $2 each. It's nothing fancy and the filling can be pretty skimpy, but the price is unbeatable and perfect for anyone like me that just craves a fresh steamed rice roll. If you want a place with better fillings and more/tastier sauces, Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls at Canal might be your kind of thing. But if you just want a solid, simple rice roll for a great price then this is perfect. (This time, we got a beef rice roll, gobbled it up, and then bought and ate the shrimp one!)"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2019-08-29,5.0,"Just got introduced to Kenny, he told me to try the moon cakes, but only to take one bite. I tried the Pork Rice Crepes, and the owner's father gave me some of his clams. 10/10 experience. Cheap/filling/delicious!!!!"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2019-07-20,4.0,"Got the #8 shrimp rice roll here! It was so cheap, literally $2 for all of that. After ordering, the rice roll was ready in no more than 5 minutes. My only qualm is that I wish there was more flavor, but there were a soy sauce and hot sauce condiments on the table!"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2018-07-22,3.0,"The rice rolls are cheap, but pretty plain. I ordered a rice roll with dried shrimp, and it seemed like no amount of soy sauce could make them delectable and truly satisfying. The rice rolls were made fresh to order, but just lacking in flavor. The rice rolls are better than those at Go Believe Bakery (generally awful) but not as good as those at Kam Hing Coffee Shop. 

My boyfriend bought a coconut tart (yezita) and enjoyed that much more than his rice roll. There are only three or four tables in a tight space, so it's not a place to linger."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2019-05-04,4.0,Pidan & pork congee came piping hot. A little light on the pidan but hey it's only $2. Also satisfied my craving for mantou. The last youtiao was snatched up by an old lady before I could. :( Cash only neighborhood joint. Ladies at the counter are nice.
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2018-09-30,4.0,"I was trying to practice my Chinese and wanted to order a cup of hot honey lemon tea.  Instead I got iced lemon water.  The lady was very apologetic and offered me to fix the right order but I told her it's ok.  Next day, I ordered a pork bun and she gave me a barbecue pork bun.  Well, it was very delicious.  I would comeback and get some more pork buns.  Oh this place is cash only."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2018-02-03,5.0,"I was in the area and was craving some rice crepes and came across this little bakery on hester street. They make their rice crepe on the spot there and it was delicious. Its a small little bakery in chinatown but the rice crepe was hot, steamy and flavorful! I had the shrimp rice crepe and the egg rice crepe. I put some soy sauce and hot sauce on it it was great! Definitely gotta come back to try the other ones and will need to try their buns. They have homemade pork cabbage buns in a package you can buy to take home to make yourself."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2018-04-17,5.0,"Everything here is so worthy! Passed every time but never go in, until one day my colleague gave me a big moji and recommended this place to me. Mark the 肠粉 & 鱼片粥 to try next time."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2017-10-10,4.0,Love this place for chinese steamed rice crepes (cheong fun). They make it freshly as you order. Too bad is not whole day. I think they are better than go believe bakery even though they may be the same owner.
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2017-06-07,5.0,"I stumbled upon this place when I was in Chinatown, craving fish balls with rice noodles but not wanting to wait in line for Wah fung or go to canal to the carts. The sign outside for their rice crepes drew me in. $2 for any rice rolls, plus the options for an extra egg or meat for $.75??? They got me. I ordered the pork rice crepe, and it was still steaming hot by the time I got to work. I'm def coming back soon!"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2016-05-03,4.0,"This is a basic Chinese bakery that isn't try to keep up with all the modern pastries, so know what you're getting into. Don't expect all the fancy new buns you see in Fay Da or Taipan in here. Prices here have remained low compared to other bakeries in Chinatown, so that's always a plus.

I love love love the black sesame steamed buns from here. I don't think they are available for individual sale. I always get them in the boxes of 6. Comes out to less than $1 per bun. The sesame bun comes with a sesame paste that isn't too sweet or oily. It's amazing, in my opinion, because I'm just a huge sesame fanatic. They also have a sesame flaky type biscuit here (the boxes are at the windows), but I'm not too big a fan of this. The sesame filling in this is very dry compared to the buns.

The sliced bread from here is pretty good too. It's very different from the sliced bread you buy from a grocery store. It's much more dense and has a hint of buttery sweetness. Good alone or with some jam."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2016-09-01,3.0,"A short and sweet review to match my short and sweet 30 second visit. 

Simply put: $0.90 BBQ pork buns fresh out of the steamers. Deals don't get much better than this. The filling here is sweet and succulent in a fluffy bun. My only real issue here is the buns feel a touch on the doughy side and could be filled more. Then again, for $0.90, maybe next time I'll just get 3 more and load up the filling."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2017-04-11,4.0,"In addition to the bakery you can get rice rolls in a wide variety of flavours here for $2. We tried pork, shrimp, and spare rib. All were made fresh to order. There was a ton of rice roll and not enough meat, but for 2 bucks it's hard to complain. There did seem to be an option to get extra meat though, which I would definitely do next time."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2014-01-17,3.0,"Meh. I mean, they're kind of like a so-so, wannabe Golden Steamer. 

In a stunning turn of events, Golden Steamer was CLOSED! This was outrageous, as they're usually open until 8pm. As a result, we were left to go on a bun quest elsewhere. 

I wanted a pumpkin bun. Delicious Bakery had them--but the only hot ones were whole wheat...so we got those. Verdict? Eh, okay. Filling was a little too sweet and the whole wheat flour texture was kind of weird. I wish they had the normal ones! But, on the plus side, I didn't get yelled at for not being Asian, which always happens at Golden Steamer. I kind of love the yelling part, though.

ANYWAYS, decent buns. 3 stars. GO TO GOLDEN STEAMER."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2017-08-30,3.0,Came here for the steamed rice noodle crepes. They are dirt cheap at $2 a crepe so there's not much to complain about but there are way better rice noodle roll spots in the area.  I recommend the spare rib or shrimp rice crepe. My next try is going to be the buns which are almost all under $1
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2013-10-13,4.0,"I am on a bun quest lately so when I saw their big sign on their door for different steamed buns, I stopped by. I was intrigued by ""Sesame bun"" but only to find out they only sell them in bulk. 

Therefore, I got their red bean bun and it is smaller compared to the ones from Steamer King on Elizabeth St. The bun costs 80 cents itself. I personally think the bun is very good. The bread is chewy, sweet and solid. They give you decent portion of stuffing too and the red bean paste is smooth and fine. 

The service here is rather slow and their Chinese is poor so I cannot imagine they speak good English either. Just be aware."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2016-05-18,4.0,"Vegetable and vermicelli buns are practically all vegetable and that's ugh for me-like too much cabbage but, I love the fact that they have big bao in packages to go.  Must try more when I get a chance!"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2016-04-15,4.0,"Hey, it's 90 cents for a savory roast bun. An inexpensive quick snack! (Milk Bar sells a fancy version for $8.)

I've been coming to Delicious Bakery for over a year now and have formed an opinion (like all Yelpers) that this one of the few bakeries that serves one of the city's best steamed and roasted pork buns. (Their steamed vegetable-pork buns are good too!) The bakery do sell out by the late end of the day (around 6pm.)

The fresh pork buns straight from the oven here are filled with the classic char-siu pork and not overly done with the fat bits, whereas some bakeries overuse it as filler.

The meat is moist and seasoned well with a bit of sugar. The bun is at the right softness and not too thick. (Some places make it too thick, resulting in a doughy snack.)

While the fillings may be a wee bit too sweet for my preference, it does goes well with a cold drink of milk tea (lightly or un-sweetened).

As for service, it is hit or miss. It hasn't been bad enough that it has stopped me from returning. I have had mostly decent to pleasant service (almost always by the older women) to brash and impatience (mostly by the younger folks)."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2017-06-02,5.0,"A friend recommended me here. Really tasty buns! And their price is reasonable, so that is a plus. Recommend!"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2017-01-12,3.0,"not exactly the best bakery, but they have cheap prices for buns and rice noodles which is a plus. The milk teas and other drinks are just OK, nothing special."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2017-05-31,5.0,I have never seen a place that has so many buns. I wish I could eat all of them! This place reminds me of my hometown. The food is so tasty and the price is reasonable. Highly recommend.
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2017-05-09,5.0,"I love this bakery because they have rice roll and various kinds of steamed buns! I love rice roll and steamed buns when I was in China, so it's surprising that I can find a shop here providing different steamed buns and they all taste good! Love here!"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2013-02-21,4.0,"Delicious Bakery lives up to its name! I was on the hunt for pre-packed, yet still homemade Dai Bao. A bao is a bun, filled with tasty things and could be seen as the Chinese version of a hot pocket. I wanted the mantou kind, or the steamed white wheat flour buns, rather than the baked ones. They're fluffy and white and a little sweet. Dai bao, in particular, are about the size of a burger (dai meaning big!) and are filled with pork, a quail egg, and sausage (lap cheung). 

I sampled the:
Dai bao - $1.25
Choy yook bao (cabbage) $0.80
Sang yook bao (pork carrot wood ear fungus) $0.80
Gai bao (chicken and mushroom)

The bao are very fluffy and a good sized portion. It is just the right saltiness and the fillings have a good ratio of meat to vegetable. I like that the dai bao has jicama or something, that gives you a fresh crunch and extra flavor points from bamboo shoots, mushroom, carrot, wood ear fungus, and love!

Next time I need to try their pastries or drinks. I've had the milk tea here and its okay (but I'd still rather go to Teado around the corner). For now, I'm happy stocking up on the prepared bao in the back and enjoying a solid breakfast every morning."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2011-11-10,4.0,"So I always pass this spot when when I'm in Manhattan about to head over the Manhattan Bridge to Brooklyn. I was starving and the bright red sign entitled ""Delicious Bakery"" could not be ignored... 

It's a small spot. Grab and Go. Is it safe to assume they do all their baking onsite? Cause you can kina peek in the back and see people baking stuff... 

Two fresh, hot Pork Buns and a Meat & Vegetable Bun. 
One prepackaged Pork Bun. 

The lady pulls the buns from this big metal fridge looking hot box and hands you a hot steamy Pork Bun. It's fluffy, chewy, starchy goodness  with sweet pork in middle. 

The fresh Pork Buns are awesomely awesome! I got so wrapped up in my first two bites of the first bun I ended up eating the non-stick white paper stuck to the bottom and it still tasted great. Yeah, so definitely don't forget to peel the paper of the bottom of the hot buns ... 

The Meat & Vegetable Bun was okay. Paled in comparison to the Pork Bun. The meat & vegetable just didn't seem to match up with the bun. I  guess I'm not the only one that feels that way cause I bought the last two hot Pork one's which is what led to my purchase of the prepackaged one.

Six hours later as I'm riding the train home I confidently pull the pork bun out of my jacket pocket. Take a bite. YeS! Soft. Chewy. Sweet Flavor. I glance around the half full cart to see the other riders eyes dart in the opposite direction to avoid eye contact. It was too late though. I caught all of 'em looking. Tryna pretend as if they weren't just lusting over my pork bun...   

Clueless why this place only has one review prior to this one. With the Bun's only costing 80 cent and everything else in the bakery more than reasonably priced, I'd expect people to be flocking here. I'll be back again fa sure to clean house. 

P.S. - The Kung-Fu Tea spot on the corner is a great compliment to the baked goods. Pork Buns and Kung-Fu Tea. It's a Win Win."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2016-12-23,5.0,A gem for steamed buns. Always fresh and delicious. Recommend the pork steamed buns and can't wait to try the others! Bring cash.
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2013-06-09,2.0,"This review is strictly for its customer service. My family stopped by chinatown to pick up some Viet take out from across the street. I was on a hunt for a quick iced coffee (kung fu bubble had a long line) and my brother was parked on a no standing zone. 

As I wait on line, the person in front was done ordering and just had to wait for the bakery girl to pack up her order. This girl made such a big fuss on changing out the smaller bag, so she can fit two cups in a bigger bag instead of stacking one on top of the other. Ok, fine. 5 mins goes by... 

Bakery girl: what would you like?
Me: one coffee and one iced coffee with extra milk please
BG: ok *continue slowly packing the 1st customer's order*
Another 5 mins goes by... 
BG: one ice tea right? 
Me: (peeved) No, I ordered a coffee and an iced coffee with extra milk. 
BG: oh, ok. you'll have to wait a lil bit, we're getting more ice. *makes my coffee and placed on the counter then takes other customer's order*
Two minutes goes by.... ice arrives
BG: *picks up a cup and pack it with ice* iced ovatine right? 
Me: NO! (Controlling my emotions) iced c..o..f...f..e..e with e..x.t..r..a.. m..i..l..k. 

Ugh..... first you make me wait 15 mins, then you can't even remember my order, twice. The other bakery lady next to her even said she wasn't paying attention. And I thought I have a  bad memory, she's even worse than me! Sigh, patience is a virtue. I don't know if she was new or not but at least the iced coffee was good. I didn't get a chance to taste their buns which they are known for. I'll try to come back next time to try... I'll have to up my tolerance level another notch and prep myself."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2015-12-03,4.0,"Cheap,easy to find and yummy buns. Went there today too bad they were out of dumplings"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2015-06-03,3.0,"Delicious Bakery is one of the cheapest Chinese bakeries in the area. I have tried a different variety of steamed and baked buns. They were all right; bread is a little hard and filling is on the meager side. But the coffee is good. One lady working there is always sweet. Plus, it is the closest bakery to the coach bus stops on Christie; if I see myself catching long-distance buses, this is an okay spot."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2014-06-20,4.0,"You should always know what you're going into an Asian bakery / restaurant for. Paris Baguette, for example, might sound like it has good baguettes and halfway decent coffee since everything else is good, but no! Both suck. Ten Ren's Tea is an excellent place for bubble tea and regular tea, but terrible for coffee. 

Point being? Most Asian joints have TERRIBLE coffee service...so it's on you, like that other reviewer, if you decide to get just that and base your experience off of it rather than going to a Starbucks like a normal person.

What this place does live up to its name for however, and what you should be getting, is their CHEAP pork buns. Like less than a dollar cheap!

If Flushing had a place like this, I'd be getting rounder than those buns. 

It might be a good thing it doesn't, but I seriously envy people in Chinatown."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2012-06-04,3.0,"I randomly walked by Delicious Bakery.. I like checking out small places like this with fresh baked goods... Just recently bought a steamer and I was craving for ""red bean bao""... 6 red bean buns.. only 3.75!!! Yeah!!! Cheap... I have good breakfast now..

The red bean tasted pretty good.. but it's too little in it... the skin is too thick.. i have to eat a few bites to taste the red bean.. :( but it's fresh.. 

Perhaps I have to return here to get other good stuff to update my review.. :D"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2011-10-17,4.0,"My new favorite place for rice noodles!  I use to go to the rice noodle cart in front of HK Supermarket but it's way too oily. However, they make it fresh. 

This place makes it early in the morning and leave it in heated racks. The chicken and mushroom rice noodles with sweet soy sauce is my absolute favorite! I've also had the pork but the chicken is still the best. It's also cheap, for a $1.50 you get a good portion.

I also really like their pan fried dumplings here.  $1 for 4.  There's a hint of sweetness to them."
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2011-12-27,4.0,"Delicious Bakery is your standard small Chinatown bakery with decent baked goods, okay coffee and good prices. The ladies working behind the counter are very friendly and although the place is small with very limited seating, the bakery is quite clean. Due to its size, the number of items to choose from is limited.

The one disappointment were the dumplings which had obviously been sitting around in the warmer and tasted soggy. Perhaps in fairness I need to try this bakery first thing in the morning but on the other hand when you go into a bakery shouldn't everything taste fresh regardless of the time?

Update: May 2016: Second best baked pork buns in Chinatown. The bun tastes like challah!"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2012-06-22,5.0,"there are a handful of bakerys on every street corner in chinatown, but thr are only a few tht stand out frm the rest.  Delicious Bakery is one of them.  

altho they have your standard fare, everything is straight out of the oven SUPER FRESH which makes everything SUPER TASTY.  my favorites include the ""dai bao"" - a soft and fluffy bun stuffed with super juicy meat, quail egg and chinese sausage.  also the ""hom swui gorks"" - deep fried chinese sticky dough stuffed with tasty minced meat.  also their steamed dumplings and rice noodles - everything tastes straight out of the oven, unlike other generic bakeries tht taste as if sitting around for a few days...

another yelper mentioned their limited selection, but who wouldnt prefer a small variety of awesomeness, over an abundance of mediocrity?  ;)"

I ordered a steam chicken bun and they gave me baked, when i asked for a return the incompetent lady did not give me my money back and said she can't open register. So i had to eat that terrible nasty tasting chicken bread bun... The place is really dirty too... Only advice~ DO NOT COME HERE!!!"
136,delicious-bakery-new-york,2013-06-10,2.0,"I thought the cake slice (one of those triangular cake slices wrapped in plastic) tasted funky but I chalked it up to a different recipe. Little did I know, the next day, when my mom took it out to eat more of it, she discovered some mold at the corner. I should have just stuck with the buns since that's all that everyone raved about, but even so, I was expecting the food to be a bit more hygienic. I don't think I'll be back."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2020-03-11,5.0,"Delicioso! Visiting from miami and stopped by to have an authentic, DELICIOUS brigadeiro. The latte was also great! They had a promo get a free brigadeiro with any coffee... promo worked bc then I bought 3 more to go LOL. No frills place great for a 5 min stop. Congrats on being around for 5+ yrs!!"
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2020-01-29,4.0,"Brigadeiros are small, ball-shaped Brazilian desserts that come in mini-cupcake liners. They're super, super dense and, depending on the ingredients, super fudgey. They're a relatively recent invention, having been named in the 1940s after a presidential candidate.

Here, there are about a dozen flavors on display at any given time. They look deceivingly tiny, but they pack quite a punch. The ""two lovers,"" pistachio, and dulce de leche were good examples of this. Pricing isn't cheap - a box of 3 costs $5.50, while 12 cost $21 - but they're worth it for a unique, shareable treat.

The space has seating for about 4-6 people, so it's not really a sit-down café where you can linger all day, but you can enjoy a treat or two over a cup of coffee before heading on to the rest of your day. Bonus: you can currently get one free brigadeiro with your Yelp check-in!"
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-10-24,4.0,"We ordered some brigadeiros for a gathering with friends last weekend. We got a variety of flavors: traditional, coconut, rainbow, pistachio, coffee and pecan pie (seasonal). My husband also brought home a couple of the guava and cheese (also seasonal) so we could try. 
The brigadeiros were a success overall among ourselves and our guests. The favorites were coconut, pistachio and rainbow!
My husband was very happy with the service when he stopped by to pick up our treats."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2020-02-17,5.0,This place is a true gem! Their cakes selection is heavenly. If you're into delicious Brazilian authentic flavour this place is for you. Place is small but cosy. They also specialise in occasion cakes so give them a try. Marianna the owner is the sweetest person just like her yummy cakes!
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-09-15,3.0,"I wanted to try out this place because it is so unique in NYC - or at least I haven't found anything like it. They had a few options of brigadeiros. I went with the classic chocolate, pistachio and nutella. My favorite was the classic chocolate. They are very rich and filling honestly. It would be good to have one or two with a cup of coffee. Not my go to dessert though."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-06-27,4.0,"I stopped here to pick up a box of pretty desserts not knowing what a brigadeiro even was. These Brazilian truffles are super decadent without being too rich. I ended up getting a box of 12 which survived the 90 degree heat and 6 hour plane ride back home to my parents. 

Every flavor was great but I especially enjoyed the pistachio, nutella, dulce de leche, and strawberries and cream. These truffles are somewhere between $2-3 a piece but much more unique than a box of chocolates or macaroons. Highly recommend this place if you're looking to impress with a box of unique sweets!

Extra shout for this place because it's a female founded business :)"
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-08-08,4.0,"I came here on a Wednesday after work to pick up dessert for dinner at a friend's house.  I had heard they opened a Brazilian bakery that sold brigadeiro (Brazilian chocolate truffles) so thought I would check it out.  Brigadeiros are made of condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and usually covered in sprinkles.  I ordered 3 brigadeiros for $5.50 (passion fruit, pistachio, two lovers), honey cake (spice cake with dulce de leche coated in chocolate), and I got one free churro brigadeiro thanks to Yelp.  I really liked the honey cake, the spice cake was tasty and not too sweet.  The brigadeiros were a bit too sweet for me except for the passion fruit one.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  I think I would come back to try their cakes, the carrot cake looked good.  FYI - you get one free brigadeiro with Yelp check in."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2020-02-17,5.0,Best pao de quejio and brigadeiros! You get a free brigadeiro with your coffee! It's the best. The people are so nice. Great Brazilian spot.
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-07-26,4.0,"These are pretty good!! I have dying to try this place after my Brazilian friend introduced me to Brigadeiros and I had one in Lisbon. I came on a Thursday afternoon and the place had a good amount of traffic inside. I was surprised only because it was during the work day! I got a whole bunch of flavors to try but The chocolate and dark chocolate were my absolute favorites. They have many flavors, so you will absolutely be able to find something you will enjoy. With every ice coffee you get a free Brigadeiro! It's worth coming here. They weren't as good as my friend's or the one from Lisbon but they are pretty darn good!"
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-04-15,5.0,"This is the best and worst thing that's ever happened to me. My coworker took us here one day and I literally can't stop coming.

I almost always get a coffee with the free brigadeiro but today I went a little (way) off my usual and got a chai latte with a slice of the passion fruit cake.

The Chai was just a mix so nothing to talk about; my sister worked at a Border's Cafe back in the day so I felt nostalgic if anything... But the cake...

Back at the office I kept telling my coworker I was going to eat it slowly so I could savor it all afternoon. I ate it in less than ten minutes and then moped around wishing there was more. 

I get that the brigadeiro is what everyone comes for but if you can... The 6 bucks for the slice of cake is so worth it."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-02-02,4.0,"This spot is hidden in the ""corners"" of NYC.  I would have never known there is such an awesome place if not for my Brazilian friend.  She said you have to try this place, it's really good and authentic Brazilian chocolate.  She went over this complicated process, they do not use sugar, they use a can of condensed milk to make this yummy item.  They have a lot of sizes of Brigadeiro, from golf ball size to bigger versions of this dessert, and lots of flavors to choose from.  

There are not many tables for you to sit, but a park is nearby so you can enjoy this Brazilian dessert.  It's a hole in the wall kind of place."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-07-29,3.0,"I'm not sure what a brigadeiro is supposed to taste like - but as someone who enjoys desserts from Lady M, Dominique Ansel, and assorted Asian bakeries (mostly Korean and Japanese), I wasn't really feeling the brigadeiro.

I got the cake ($6 for a huge slice) and tried a couple of the brigadeiros (3 for $6). The pistachio was bomb and almost tasted like mochi. But everything else was incredibly sweet and a bit too close to the consistency of carrot cake almost? It wasn't the like other cake that are moist or creamy (or both!). The culprit is probably the condensed milk for both the sweet and the consistency.

The staff is awesome and definitely worth a try! I wasn't a huge fan though."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2017-06-09,3.0,"It is owned by BRAZILIAN, meaning they made some authentic bakeries like brigadeiro

Still have not figured out why I did not like it...

137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-10-13,5.0,"OMG I don't know why it took me so long to write a review to this magical place! I've seen buying from this place since my engagement party back in 2011, I'm now married with 4 year old twins! Now every time I buy I have to share with the kids because of course THEY LOVE IT. My husband buys it for me for birthday, Mother's Day, anniversary or any time really. We live in Long Island now, but every time we have a chance we buy it! As a Brazilian I'm always excited when I can find some of my culture here, and they REPRESENT! I hate when they sell Brazilian stuff and ""Americanize"" the heck out of it just to be accepted, it's not the case here. You can shop online, or you can come to their shop, their shop is CUUUUUUTEEEEEEEE, they sell coffee, cakes, pão de queijo, and ICE CREAM! The lady behind the counter is super sweet, if I didn't have  to run back to the car I would grab a cup of coffee sit there and try every single thing they sell while chatting with the lady. This shop rocks! I can see them growing and expanding, everything they sell is DELICIOUS, their customer service is impeccable, little orders, big orders, they will handle flawlessly! If you never had a brigadeiro in your life.... RUN TO THIS SHOP! It's chocolate nirvana!"
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-09-11,5.0,"I was hoping to stop by this other place down the street but they weren't open until much later. Having been here before, I knew how yummy their brigadeiros are. For the unaware, brigadeiros are a sort of Brazilian truffle made with sweetened condensed milk. The salted caramel was my favorite, covered with crispy pearls. The key lime was definitely interesting but if I had to pick again, the salted caramel would be it. They were rich and crunchy and creamy and decadent all in one bite. There were several other flavors including some gluten free too. Highly recommend coming by to grab some treats, they even have ice cream too."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2017-11-04,4.0,"I do not have a photo for the Brigadeiro which is just so chocolate-y and fudgy! Mmmmm.

I had their cheese bun as appetizers. I could eat 10 of them no problem! I also ordered grilled chicken as main entree, the fried bananas are a gem. It's lightly battered, crispy on the outside and banana-y on the inside. WOW! 
My favorite Brazilian spot is in Manhattan, and I was surprised to find a decent spot in Santa Barbara, especially shocked about how good their cheese buns are. Though the beans aren't the best I have had 

I have ordered their açaí bowl and cappuccino on separate occasions and they all are very well made!"
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2017-01-11,4.0,"I was looking for a good bakery/dessert place in West Village to pick up some sweets to bring home for last weekend and this place popped up. This was a really cute little bakery and it was my first time trying out this Brazilian dessert. Each one has a sweet and creamy center and all topped with different toppings from pistachio crumbs to rainbow sprinkles. 

They suggest if you're not going to eat it all right away to put it in the refrigerator and take out to eat when ready. I think they taste even better nice and cold! With a Yelp check in you also get one for free!"
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-11-09,5.0,Brigadeiros are amazing!  This is a very small bakery and has one table for seating.  They are truffles made from condensed milk and they have many flavors available.
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-08-18,4.0,"Brazilian dessert.   It's different but like most country specific foods, this should be on your short list.    They don't sell individual pieces and there are only 2 tables but I'd get a box of 3 and just try it out.   You won't be disappointed."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2017-10-15,4.0,"Cute little shop. The brigadeiros are tasty and they give you one free brigadeiro with a check in! I bought 12 brigadeiros for $21 and the carrot brigadeiro cake for $6. Everything was delicious. The only downside is that the brigadeiros are rather small, especially compared to the ones you get in Brazil/Astoria."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-05-05,5.0,The desert here is phenomenal! The waitress was so insightful in answering my question. The cake here was so moist and was the highlight of my day. I also got to try the Guarana Brazilian soda. I would describe the taste as it being cherry like. I will definitely be back.
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-09-07,3.0,"Yelp keeps suggesting this place to me so  I broke my promise  of not having desserts and gave it a try. Probably my expectation was too high for this place. Brigaderio they have was not overly sweet, which is good, but it's too dense. I agree with one of the review saying that it's almost like tasting condensed milk. Maybe thats the reason why its so tiny. It's probably smaller than a chocolate truffle. I did like it when I first bite it, but when I took my second bite I felt overwhelmed. Also for the size it's really pricy. After tax it's $6 for 3 pieces. Since it's dessert from a different culture, I would use the check-in bonus they have to have a try, but I don't think I'll come back."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-04-29,5.0,"I think I found the best chocolate cake in NYC. It's the kind dreams and movies are made of: dark, thick, moist, chocolate-y, not too sweet, just a hint of frosting. And it's brigadeiro chocolate frosting so not the usual sugary crap. Also very cute that every drink comes with your choice of brigadeiro (Brazilian truffle dessert). I'm gonna get so fat eating this cake now that I know where it's at."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-04-09,5.0,The best brigadero I've had!  My niece is Brazilian and first time I tasted I was in Brazil.  This place is so authentic!
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2017-10-15,3.0,Would recommend anyone who is wanting to try any brigadeiro or brigadeiro cake to come here. There are a lot of options but pricey.
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-08-10,5.0,So delicious! I highly recommend trying this place. Their desserts are very unique compared to anything else I've ever tried
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-12-07,4.0,"Even in New York, it isn't every day that you stumble upon a Brazilian bakery. A group of friends and I went out of our way to find Brigadeiro to take a friend who grew up in Brazil who wanted some flavors of home. Not only did I love everything I tasted, but she said that all of the flavors were very authentic. To me, the highlights were the two lovers briga and the carrot cake. Both will have me back!! My friend left with a bag full of sweets to tide her over until she goes home for Christmas, so you know this place is legit. My only gripe is the lack of seating space. We ended up buying food in another cafe around the corner just to have a place to sit because the two tables in Brigadeiro had already been claimed."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2017-03-25,4.0,"I love Brazilian dessert, food, and coffee. Love love love. So when I was in the area and saw the word Brigadeiro, I had to pop in.

They have this sweet deal where you get a free brigadeiro when you buy a coffee. Also, when you check in on yelp, you get a free brigadeiro. So my husband and I got 2 coffees (with 2 free brigadeiros), another free brigadeiro (yay yelp), and 1 pão de queijo. 

To be honest, the brigadeiros were a little too soft from what I'm used to having. It melts in your mouth, which is good if you like that texture, but personally, I'm used to having the more dense and sticky type. The pão de queijo was a bit flaky and not chewy enough. I tend to gravitate towards that wonderful rubbery texture and this was not it. At least it was big and very cheesy. I feet like the food itself was 3/5, but the whole shop is soo cute and the service was super friendly and the coffee was quite rich, so I'm bumping my whole experience to a 4/5."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-11-30,5.0,"This place is an amazing Brazilian shop. Their brigadeiros are super authentic and delicious! They also have cakes, coffee, etc. I'm a loyal customer and absolutely recommend it!"
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-08-24,5.0,A little piece if Brazil in the heart of Sohoo. Everything is absolutely delicious! My favorites are the traditional brigadeiro and cake in a jar!
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-02-18,4.0,"It's a nice little Brazilian Brigadeiro confectionery store. The desserts taste delicious and freshly made. I found them a bit too sweet for my taste buds. So tried them with unsweetened ginger tea and viola! We got pistachio, dulce de leche & walnut, two lovers, crunchy (milk) chocolate, coconut & dark chocolate flavors. Along with my coffee, chose coffee & praline flavor. Personally, liked dark chocolate and coffee & praline flavors the best. Asked for a simple packing and staff got busy in gift box packing. :) Also, got a decaffeinated mocha which tasted absolutely delicious. Although later, felt the strong caffeine effects so wondered if it was actually decaffeinated... Overall though, it was a good place to try brigadeiros."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-04-22,4.0,"Little taste of Brazil in soho. Pretty and yummy pastries! Such an beautiful art!!
I like coming here to get sweets for friends as gifts or dessert to bring to a house party :)"

You'll get one free Brigadeiro when you order coffee."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2017-12-15,4.0,"The name of this place doesn't help. I saw the word bakery from a distance and popped in looking for bread. From the outside it's fairly pedestrian but the small sweet treats were not at all boring!! I was curious what it was as it looked like a chocolate truffle i was offered a sample which i thought was kind. Never knew what a brigadeiro was before - it's a difficult name doesn't help the business in my opinion. What they should call it is Awesome Gooey Sweet Treats! Wow what a dense rich milky chocolatey treat. I ended up buying two small boxes. 
Would be great if they explained what they were somewhere to lure folks in or had more curb appeal for their window as so many people are missing out on this amazing sweet milk & chocolate treat!"
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-01-16,4.0,"Delicious brigadiero treats! The last time I tried these were a long time ago in Brazil where people sell them on the beach. We got a standard chocolate sprinkle, coconut, and dulce de leche. All were soft and delicious! I do wish you can buy them individually. A lovely little shop with a nice variety."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-02-17,5.0,cute little shop serving cute little Brazilian desert made with condensed milk. Delicious!
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2019-07-13,2.0,"Love this place and usually everything is amazing, but ordered two slices of the chocolate cake on Postmates and instead they sent me the cake in the jar (without warning me) and the brigadeiro was already crystallized. Not a great experience this time..."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2018-12-06,5.0,These brigadeiros are so delicious and there are so many varieties! A nice cup of coffee with the brigadeiros hits the spot!
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2017-11-18,5.0,"I came here because a friend said her favorite cake is from this bakery. Once entering, you'll find it's a nice, small, cozy place with 2 tables by the entrance and little bar counter style table on the side. I got the thing that was recommended, which is the chocolate cake. So what I found out is that if you do come later in the day, there's a chance the cake gets sold out. It must be pretty good if it sells it right? You bet it is! Upon the the first bite, my mouth was in euphoria from the rich chocolate flavor. The fudge was great! What was another great thing about this was that the cake was also great without the fudge. Some bakeries, their cake are so-so without the fudge but not this one! They also serve coffee, hot chocolate as well as some pastries, cupcakes and little cake in jars. If it's your first visit her, definitely try a slice of cake if it's available. You won't regret it."
137,brigadeiro-bakery-new-york-3,2017-11-06,4.0,"Lovely coffee shop that sells Brazilian desserts and cheesebreads (even frozen ones that you can get to go!) Service was very friendly, there's seating (wasn't too crowded when we came), and with every coffee, you get a free brigadeiro! I chose the coconut flavored one, though there were many other tempting choices, and it tasted like a chewy but not too sweet piece of fudge. Yum!!"
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2020-03-12,5.0,"Excellent coffee shop way downtown near seaport in the financial district area. Great service. Great options. Great taste. Great coffee shop vibe. 

I'm a big cold brew fan. Borderline aficionado haha. Their New Orleans is a mix of cold brew, sugar, milk, and chicory. I was worried it might taste like a sugary iced coffee. Fortunately I was way wrong. The chicory really comes through. It's delicious. 

Tip: payment is through cash and card only at this time."
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-07-08,5.0,"Great, sweet iced mocha, dairy free and vegan YUM.

138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-11-01,2.0,"Actually, I do like the coffee here. What irks me about this place is that the opening and closing times are not what is listed on Yelp or Google or their baristas choose to close shop early or open late which is kind of unacceptable for a business that wants to thrive in Manhattan. I've come on several occasions on weekend mornings or weekday evenings before a shift and to my disappointment, they are closed. Maybe list your store hours where customers can see them on your door so I won't make the mistake of coming here when you're closed again."
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-03-16,4.0,"Ugh cute little cafe that is never too busy to grab a coffee quickly! Every time I've been the baristas have been quick and pleasant! My go to is the New Orleans and it gives me the quick caffeine boast that I need! 

Although a bit pricey in compared to your starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts that Fidi has an ample number of -- this place definitely serves quality and good customer service! 

I think this is the perfect coffee shop for winter afternoons just gives you cozy vibes"
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-10-05,5.0,They have every non dairy milk you can imagine from oat to macadamia. Amazing cup of coffee. Quiet inside and not too crowded on a Saturday morning. Lovely staff.
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2020-02-17,2.0,"My Experience on Sunday was a little unsettling. I walked in an asked for a bacon egg an cheese on a bagel . The cashier then replied that all the sandwiches were pre-made. So I thought , okay that's fine . However, he then goes on to tell me "" You can go to any of the delis down the street and they can do it for you "" and turns around and goes to the coffee machine . So I eventually just get a plain bagel with cream cheese ... which turned out to be really stale. Overall not impressed - sorry ."
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2018-12-07,4.0,"A cute coffee shop that hones quality fresh pastries and good organic tea selection in the Financial District.  In the City That Never Sleeps it is time for R & R for a phlegmatic disposition.  There is minimal seating but R & R Coffee enable a moment of stillness and inner calm.  The atmosphere is very conservative and background music is not boisterously blaring loud.  I am enamored with the long marble and wood panel counter and their dark wood wall partition.  My server Alex appeared melancholy as it did not smile nor greeted me in a sprightly lively matter for the morning.  Nevertheless, Alex did served me.  Mornings can make or break one's day as well as a quality cup of joe or a cup of tea in conjunction with one's disposition towards a customer.  This coffee shop offers replica splash sticks similar to Starbucks for cups when travelling to one's destination to prevent spillage.  I would return again for the same exact items again as it is my usual default items from coffee shops or bakeries.  Sometimes life calls for R & R.

Almond croissant $3.50
Topped with confectioner's sugar for a large quality fresh pastry as it ate my fill for the morning.  The almond paste is flavorable.  It held together and was very flaky.  Priced very reasonable under $5.00.

Jasmine Green Tea $2.76
Organic tea that awaken my spirits.  All tea cup sizes are priced the same."

The espresso was so smooth and the whole thing was just creamy and delicious and spot on! Highly recommend! 
A bit pricey for a college student, but it is to be expected in NYC!"
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-10-29,5.0,"R&R Coffee is my go-to in that area! They have EVERY non-dairy milk (including a few different brands for each) and the baristas are very knowledgable as far as which non-dairy milk pairs best with each beverage. They even have grab and go breakfast items, which I appreciate on busy mornings. Last time I went, we got a hot matcha latte with almond milk, an iced matcha with macadamia nut milk, chia seed pudding and overnight oats. The cashier also told me the hummus was made in house, so I picked some up for a snack later. The oats are to die for!"
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-06-27,5.0,"The vegan tofu (scramble) wrap is so good. so. good.

And even though it's under the lunch menu, you can order it in the morning. It's made to order and has never taken longer than like 7 minutes. New fave breakfast spot!"
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-04-23,4.0,I can't believe how long I worked in the area and have not been here until now! I tried the advertised on the sidewalk honey vanilla latte with soy milk and the vegan salted chocolate chip cookie. Both were delicious! The staff was very helpful too. Want to come back to try the savory options. Prices were a little steep though. My small latte and cookie cost over $9!
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-02-24,4.0,Cute little place and atmosphere. Employees are very friendly. The coffee was cute they drew a little panda on it but the taste was pretty average. They also have wraps and stuff you can choose from !
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2020-02-17,5.0,Was looking for an authentic cup of coffee in NYC..It is actually difficult to find a private Lyons coffee store. Delicious cappuccino and a chai tea on this Monday afternoon.
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2018-11-13,5.0,This little coffee shop is by my office and I love stopping in for a midday pickup. It's fairly small in the space but there are a couple tables for two set up as well as by the window if you want to park for a while to read or get some work done. The employees are all kind and personable which always makes or breaks a coffee shop atmosphere. I love their iced coffee but they also make a mean soy latte.

138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-05-15,4.0,Not an ideal study spot & not the greatest pastry selection BUT pretty much the best cold brew I've had in the city so that earns it a solid 4 stars

138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2017-11-19,2.0,"Maybe it's because I live here now, but I am shocked that I once gave this place 4 stars. The coffee is overpriced and not especially good, and the hot food options are horrendous. I ordered a sausage egg and cheese biscuit for myself and my boyfriend this morning and it took an extremely long time for the tasteless mess to come out. My boyfriend took two bites and couldn't eat any more - the biscuit was bone dry and an ashy color, and the egg and sausage were completely overpowered by the doughy taste. The lattes I order here are also always too sweet, but at least somewhat fit for consumption.

I'm also confused as to why they have a bagel with egg inside on display, but they are only able to make BEC or sausage egg and cheese on a biscuit - they explained that it was because the bagels with the egg inside came prepackaged, but it seems like they could just slice their bagels open and put the rest inside, but what do I know. I've ordered their egg white wrap in the past which has also tasted like cardboard. And I agree with many of these reviewers as well in that the decor and attentiveness of the staff leave a lot to be desired. I'm really hoping better breakfast options open in Fidi soon - don't be fooled by the rating, it's simply a product of the extremely limited options we have in the immediate area."

Four Stars

Located on the crowded intersection of Gold and Fulton, R&R coffee is surprisingly relaxing. The front corner of the shop has an L shape high top granite counter, where you can sit and look out the window seat and absorb some natural light.  There are four small tables as well.  The white walls and wood floor give it nice feel. I had a cappuccino (10oz) to stay ($3.97). It came in a 11.5oz Bright White Low Cup with a Rosetta foam design. The drink was more wet than my usual taste but still enjoyable. The espresso reminded me of milk chocolate. The perceived caffeine level was low."
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2018-02-16,5.0,"One of the best coffee spots in the city. They serve up multiple great Roasters, when I visited they had Intelligentsia (meh), Ceremony (yes!), and Forty Weight (woohoo).

Friendly and knowledgeable staff served me quickly and pulled a solid espresso on the GB5.

Good pastry selection and ample seating make it a solid all around choice.

I'll be back!"
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2015-06-03,3.0,"They play good music here! 

The food: I ordered an egg-white breakfast wrap. I did not like it. My friend ordered a bagel. She seemed to like it.

The service: The cashier and baristas seemed to know people who came in, which was a good sign.

The facility: It was oblong. I sat at one of the window high-seats with my friend. There are a few regular tables in the back near the restroom.

Payment: I paid with cash. Can't speak to if they take American Express or not.

Overall: I don't personally recommend the egg white breakfast wrap, but maybe other items are good."
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-05-27,3.0,"They are cheap, they are quick, and they have good coffee.  But their wrap left a lot to desire.  The bread was overly thick compared to the rest of the component inside.  It felt like I was eating a plain bread with sprinkles of cheese, could barely taste the turkey."
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2019-06-15,5.0,Best hidden coffee spot in financial district. Great prices and the greatest dirty chai latte! Plus the staff is always so nice
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2016-08-29,3.0,"A bit hidden away in an area that is pretty deserted on weekends we found this coffee place when in need of some better quality coffee. They offered Toby's Estate as the coffee for espresso based beverages as well as filter from Parlor Coffee. The coffee beans are of good quality and I think they are definitely skilled at making coffee and while it is not world class it is still good coffee in an area that does not offer much else on weekends at least.

I would however not really say the place has a lot of charm, the space is clean but design-wise it does not really do it for me but very good for a coffee to take out. Service was a bit uninspired when I visited and the wait was a bit too long (as I was the only customer and it still took around 10 minutes for a filter coffee and a latte)."
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2018-11-11,5.0,Perfect coffee place. Everything looked simple but it was delicious. I ordered a bacon egg biscuit and a salted caramel latte. Perfect! It was my last day in New York so I would go again if I go back.

My friend got a coffee and declared it one of the best he's had in lower Manhattan, I was thrilled to find both chai and matcha lattes on offer. The matcha latte was strong and herbal. We also grabbed almond croissants, which were great - flavorful, rich, and not too crunchy. Apparently this place tends to turn you into a regular customer - I know I'll be back!"
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2017-10-30,3.0,"Cute coffee shop to enjoy a coffee break. Small inside, but there are a few window seats and then seating along the sides. Coffee is strong and robust. Nice to have some independent coffee shop options in contrast to Starbucks. The pastries are ok, but the ample coffee choices are really what you come here for. Friendly baristas to boot."
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2017-05-24,4.0,"Good cold brew, but pretty expensive at $5 for 20 oz."
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2016-02-29,4.0,"Very laid back spot. There isn't a lot of seating but I'm glad I got a table since I didn't want something to go... I was hoping for more bagel options. They only have either butter or plain cream cheese, but the bagel was good anyway. I ordered a chai latte and it has a different, and in my opinion better, than Starbucks. It has a little bit more of a kick and isn't as bland. A customer was playing a guitar and nobody was bothered by it. It actually kind of gave it more of an authentic vibe if anything. The only reason I wasn't extremely happy is because I really wanted a bagel with lots of toppings and unfortunately it isn't a good place for that. I would come back if I pass it again for the chai though."
138,r-and-r-coffee-new-york,2017-08-31,4.0,"They told me they have the best cold brew in New York. They also said it had mescaline in it, so perhaps they are prone to exaggeration. The cold brew is good, but it tastes fairly unremarkable as far as cold brews go. The espresso is better, and the real star of the visit was the delicious and fresh canela we tried. Yum. The place is fun, fast, and welcoming, so I would come back if I lived or worked nearby."

Ordered a lox bagel with the works (lox, onion, tomato, capers) and subbed in jalapeno asiago cream cheese for the plain. Ordered the sandwich on a whole wheat everything. 

The restaurant is very effecient with their system of order first, pickup and pay later. While we waited for the bagel we enjoyed a fresh squeezed OJ -- do not miss this. We made the mistake of ordering the small, and easily could have drank twice the amount. The bagel was HUGE and well worth the $10+ we spent on it: generous locks, perfect balance of toppings, and the flavored cream cheese took it to another level. We split the bagel between two people, and it was plenty of food. Definitely will return to Brooklyn Bagel -- more efficient than Tompkins Sq and other competitors, and certainly more bang for your buck."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-03-06,4.0,"Went here to grab a bagel during my last week in NYC. The place was pretty packed, but the line moves pretty efficiently.

I got an egg bagel with raisin and cinnamon cream cheese--it was decent, not the best one in the city, but tasty nonetheless."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-02-27,5.0,"This is my absolute favorite bagel place in the city. As a student in the area, it's perfectly located near campus. Their bagels are big and inexpensive, in addition to being of very high quality. I appreciate the variety of both bagel flavors and cream cheese flavors. They have classics and innovative flavors and sandwiches alike. If you're near any of their locations, I urge you to try one. You won't regret it! 

P.S.: They NEVER skimp on the cream cheese. EVER."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-02-24,5.0,"I'm not from NYC, so any chance to grab a bagel from New York is a good day for me! Found this place on Yelp and it was close to the hotel we were staying and we were able to beat the rush right when we came (~1pm). I will say even with the rush they get people in & out of the store very efficiently. 

I ordered the smoked salmon bagel on the everything bagel & it was toasted to perfection! Honestly these NYC bagels are on some other level of taste bud satisfaction. The only downside is that the bagels are legit $15 for one which I think is a little ridiculous. I couldn't finish the entire thing in one sitting so I ended up taking some of it to go and it tasted juuust as good after ;)"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-04-14,5.0,"Definitely the New York vibe: Fast! YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT! There is a long enough time for you to make a decision -- but the line goes fast. They aren't strangers to giving you a sample if you want to try how a bagel tastes -- but understand, you have to ask for it. I can't stress enough how you need to know what you want when you get to the counter to order and to the register (two different points of the line you'll be in during rush hour time). Whatever you get, include lox! You won't be sorry! Fresh bagels and very good."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-12-06,4.0,"Man, so glad we found this place! My vision of a perfect bagel: crunchy exterior, soft interior. They also wrap the bagels in paper, not foil, so the integrity of the bagel is maintained. Staff are friendly and service is quick. Wish I could get a bagel like this back in Cali.

Cheers!
RS"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-12-28,5.0,"I love the different flavors of cream cheese that they have and how creative the flavors are. Every flavor is really good and they let you sample some flavors when you're ordering. 

I ordered the chicken salad on an everything while grain bagel. The chicken salad is really good! Definitely one of the better chicken salads that I've had at any store. 

We came back and ordered the pumpernickel bagel with cannoli cream and the Bialy bagel with blueberry cream cheese. The cannoli cream cheese is really good with the pumpernickel. The blueberry cream cheese could have a stronger blueberry flavor, but it was a poor match with the Bialy bagel because the bialy is more savoury. 

Overall, I highly recommend coming to check Brooklyn bagel out!"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-01-23,3.0,"To preface, this A-OK review is more for the service than for the actual bagel. The bagel I ordered (plain bagel, toasted, with lox spread) was really good. It was soft, toasty, and smeared with SO MUCH cream cheese. 

When I walked in and went to place my order, the person behind the counter was very rude and impatient. She basically started talking to me as if I was stupid when I gave her my order. 

Staff behind the payment counter were much nicer, but I was still thrown off by how rude the previous interaction was."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-01-19,5.0,"First off let me say that I'm not from New York, so this isn't a ""this is the best bagel I in NY"" review. However, I love bagels so much that a weekly conversation of mine is usually about opening my own bagel shop. 

These bagels blew my mind. The first issue I usually hAve with places that sell bagels, is that no one gives the correct amount of cream cheese. Granted the cream cheese was $2.90, so they better pile it on, but it's so worth it. They have my multiple locations so easy to get to one of them at some point. The line was smooth moving through even though at first it seemed like the line would take a while. 

Anyways, as I'm writing this I'm getting ready to go back again."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-01-07,5.0,"Oh my god. My new go-to bagel place in New York City! This location had the most impressive selection of spreads I've ever seen! Examples include red velvet, scallion and lox, veggie, bacon sriracha! They had samples out of gingerbread bagels - to die for! I ordered the Cooper sandwich on an everything bagel. Pro tip: it does not include cream cheese so I added that on the side. The bagel was perfect! It was not dry nor hard. The sandwich had structural integrity and did not fall apart. I went around noon on a Sunday and did not have to wait. I am literally already plotting for when I can go back! Do yourself a favor and grab these five star bagels!"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-05-17,5.0,"Best spot in the neighborhood for bagels! Bagels are huge & filled with cream cheese - they don't skimp on it! I ordered a toasted everything bagel with scallion bacon cream cheese & it was a game changer! The ""everything"" topping was on both sides of the bagel so there was no bottom aka lesser side to the bagel which I loved. Good value for everything as well. 

This is my new ""go to"" spot for bagels! So happy I found it"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-06-21,5.0,"You can't come to NY and not get bagels! A friend took me here since it's conveniently near NYU!
they had SO many spread options! I got the scallion cream cheese on an everything bagel w other toppings which was so yummy 

+ lots of variety from everything bagels to all kinds of schemers 
+ quick service
+ filling quality bagels

We came for a late lunch so wasn't even busy! Would recommend"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-12-03,5.0,One of the best bagel places in NY! Bagels and cream cheese are fresh and there are so many flavors to pick from. The bagels have such a nice crunchy crust with a fluffy soft inside. My blueberry bagel had the toasty aroma of a million baked blueberries on a cozy Christmas day. I'm a sweet savory type of person so I ended up getting my bagel with lox and scallion cream cheese. The combination was phenomenal. The cream cheese was rich and filled with large chunks of lox and scallion. Another perk about this place is the relative abundance of bar seats and tables unlike many other bagel places. Highly recommend if you're looking for a good NY bagel!
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-12-06,5.0,"Being a native of Virginia, I'm no expert on the classic NY bagel but the bagels here were definitely delicious! 

Service is super quick, they have two counters - one to order and one to pay. I ended up getting an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese. The bagel was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The cream cheese was loaded with scallions and the perfect compliment. Would love to come back and try the lox!"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-02-19,5.0,"Perfect. I always come and visit this place when I'm in the city. I came around 2 pm and it luckily was almost empty. I got to sit down and enjoy my blueberry bagel with tofu cream cheese, which was slightly overdone but I didn't mind. This place has the best, fluffiest bagels and they're ready for you if you order in advance. Also great location that I love coming back to. Can't beat it."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-12-14,4.0,"They offer gluten free bagels but only mini sized ones. The gf bagels themselves are not the best, a bit to dense, but it's a good place to come if you want to get bagels with friends. Also they have so many combinations, both sweet and savory. 

I found the iced coffee to be weak."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-03-09,5.0,Yum. Just what I needed on my quick stop off in NYC. There really isn't anything like this in Los Angeles... perfect.
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-10-18,5.0,"I was on a hunt for the best new york bagel and I found it at Brooklyn Bagel & Company. I tried their seasonal pumpkin bagel, onion bagel, and everything bagel and everything was delicious! I wish we had this joint in san francisco -- i know i know. 

The experience here is fantastic and you can't go wrong with anything. I tried their tofu strawberry cream cheese (because I'm allergic to dairy) and it was delicious! I can't wait to come back next time I'm in town."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-06-08,4.0,"Was on the yelp hunt for the best NY bagel places and decided to try this place out the morning of my flight back home.

I'm a lox lover so I always go for the lox bagel sandwich. Kinda pricey here at $12.95 and weirdly it doesn't come with cream cheese so that was an extra $1. Slightly irritating but it came with avocado so I guess that compensates for that.

The whole wheat everything was soo yummy and fresh. They put a thick layer of cream cheese which I like. I picked the low fat option cuz I usually can't tell the difference anyways. The combination of lox, tomato, capers, onions, and avocado is perfect and I'm definitely going to start having to do that at home with my own bagels.

Bottom line if you're not a cheepskate like me then by all means the actual sandwich was sooooo satisfying in every way. Definitely should try it once while you're in town."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-10-21,5.0,"PSA: they have gluten free bagels!! And they're delicious! I've never understood why people would put salmon in their bagels until I had the Cooper here, and I now can't believe it took me so long to try it! The most delicious bagel I've ever had. My friend had their non GF plain bagel with cream cheese and also thought it was delicious (more so than Best Bagel & Coffee)

They also offer mini bagels for those who are looking to indulge but don't want to commit to a full size. Or for those who can't decide which one to get, you can get 2 minis instead of 1 full size of one ;-)"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-03-22,5.0,"Newer and less busy location compared to the original. Order a bagel at the front and pay at the back. 

I personally love the consistency of the bagels here. It's firm yet airy. 

I ordered the lox bagel and it was great. It's about $12-13, which is inline with other popular places. The salmon was good, but I think next time I want to try their egg bagels."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-10-20,4.0,"Brooklyn bagel & coffee is one of our favorite spots to get breakfast. They make fresh bagels daily and you can see them bake it in the back. 

There's a large selection of cream cheese, my favorite being the Asiago jalapeño cream cheese. There are funkier ones too - ranging very sweet to savory. 

I'd seek Brooklyn bagel & coffee out. The line moves quickly and the bagels won't disappoint you."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-09-04,5.0,"A fine establishment. I think I could eat here everyday. They offer a damn good vegan cream cheese. And by jov those lox are good. Three different styles. Not to mention the fixings, all different types of veggies and salsas. We had to go twice during our brief stay in NYC. Very well done. I had an everything bagel with vegan scallion cream cheese, tomato and onion salsa, and smoked pepper lox. Need I say more!? Cheers."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-01-19,4.0,"One of the best bagel places by NYU by far! I ordered the mini cinnamon raisin bagel with butter, toasted. The bagel was deliciously chewy with plenty of raisins (my favorite), as well as surprisingly big despite being labeled as mini. 

My only gripe was that they put way too much butter on the bagel, so much that it soaked through the wax paper completely and soaked my hands in butter when I opened the package. It also made the bagel soggier and too butter soaked, which overpowered the flavor. However, next time, I'll be sure to tell them to put less butter!"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-10-04,4.0,"Amazing experience trying out Brooklyn Bagel for the first time today! I almost cried when I saw that they offered a vegan tofu strawberry cream cheese! Strawberry was always my favorite cream cheese growing up and I haven't ever been able to find since going vegan! 

Got a plain bagel w/ the tofu strawberry cream cheese. It was a little pricey ~$6 but not bad and it was delicious. 

Almost all of their bagels are vegan and they also had a plain and veggie tofu cream cheese.

Only disappointment is that they won't allow you to use your own Tupperware instead of the paper they use to wrap the bagel - wish they would so that those who wanted to could help reduce waste 

Overall amazing though and I'll definitely be back!"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-02-02,4.0,"Pretty pricey dishes, however rock solid meal and it is worth the price. The space is small and cozy, the Lox dishes are a good go to, you cant go wrong with a bagel and a smear. Definitely would come back to it again the next time I'm in the area. Jalapeno spread on an everything bagel so far has been my favorite."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-09-29,5.0,Wow I didn't want to believe the hype at first but this place really has amazing bagels. I tried a breakfast bagel with egg cheese and bacon yesterday and it was about one of the best bagel I've ever had in the city. The line was long but moved along quickly on a Saturday around lunch time. Highly recommend. I'll def be back to try other signatures bagels. They also have so many cream cheese even the sweet ones like cannoli and chocolate chips!
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-07-14,5.0,"Ummmmm yes! I'm not typically a bagel person, but when I am in New York, I've heard it is a must try. I can truly say that  my love for lox and bagels is only here in NYC. I got the Everything bagel which had a nice savory crunch and the bagel bread was soft and chewy. I got the bagel as a lox sandwich and it was very delicious. I'll be back to try more bagels!"
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-02-24,5.0,"This could possibly be the best bagel in New York! I had countless bagels during my visit and this one was the perfect blend of crunchy, chewy and soft. Plus, the bacon was cooked perfectly. I've been searching for anything that can compare back home in Kentucky and I truly don't think I'll find anything that comes close. I know exactly where I'll be getting my morning bagels on my next trip to NYC."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-01-20,5.0,"A lovely bagel spot in East Village. There's typically less of a wait time here than at Tompkins, and the bagels are just as good. I ordered a whole wheat bagel with blueberry cream cheese. When I picked it up, it felt heavy and full. The amount of cream cheese is slightly too much for my liking, and the blueberry cream cheese was quite tasty. The bagel itself was chewy and thick. The woman at the counter was very friendly and helpful, which I appreciated. I love the white tiles of the interior, especially how the menu is directly written on them. I'd love to come back here and try all the cream cheese flavors (there are so many), like strawberry or tofu."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-02-07,3.0,"To start with the good, the bagel was excellent. Just the right texture and plenty of ""everything""  seasoning on both sides.

But the coffee... given that ""Coffee"" is in this place's name, it should have decent coffee, right? As it turns out, this was one of the worst drip coffees I've ever paid for. It was so sour and watery that it was undrinkable, even with milk. And I'm no snob; I can recognize good coffee, but I'll usually drink a mediocre cup anyway. In this case it was so bad that I dumped it out and got a replacement from Dunkin Donuts."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-09-29,3.0,"Sad because I came to try their pumpkin bagel but they ran out by noon. 
Instead I got an egg sandwich on an everything bagel. The bagel was way too salty for me. 
I would pass on their iced coffee. I would rather get a $2 one with oat milk from Matto down the block."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2020-04-10,5.0,"Soooooo good!  Crusty, chewy, perfection!  I had the breakfast bagel and it was everything I remembered and loved about NY bagels.  I think it's the best, better than Ess-a-bagel, and without the insane tourist waits"

I got an everything bagel with egg, pepper jack cheese, onion, tomato, and avocado. Would definitely recommend and would definitely come back if I was in the area."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-06-18,4.0,"I love this place!! What can I say, a great New York bagel cannot be beaten. Everything bagels are my go-to although sometimes I get an onion bagel. Vegetable or scallion cream cheese is my standard spreads and this place never disappoints on quality. The bagels are exactly what you want in a bagel chewy and soft on the inside but nice and crusty on the outside. 

Their spreads are loaded with fillings. I hate when flavored cream cheese spreads are basically only cream cheese and two tiny bites of an old carrot or one sliver of a piece of salmon. You won't have that problem here.

While they do have other locations I prefer this one because it is in lower Manhattan and less crowded than the Chelsea location but both have great bagels. You can't lose either way."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2018-11-08,4.0,"Satisfying breakfast bagel sandwich!

i ordered the everything bagel toasted with sausage, egg and cheddar.  the order took about 5 mins.  I immediately noticed the great flavor of the everything seasoning on this bagel.  I first noticed how the salt brought out the flavors.  The bagel overall was warm and large. It was fairly fluffy towards the center while the edges got more chew to it.  The sausage was juicy but wasn't strong on the fennel(hint: i love fennel) The cheddar was fairly mild. At first, I was wondering if there was even cheese in it.  The egg itself was right light in color. I almost thought I had egg whites, but there were some swirls of yolk.

Overall, it was a very satisfying large bagel sandwich. I just wish the fillings tasted better. It wasn't bad, but if you're paying close to $8 for an egg sandwich, that better be some good sausage and cheese."

139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2019-08-05,4.0,"Oh man, I came to NY on a bagel mission and this place did not disappoint. 

We arrived here around 9am on a Sunday and surprisingly enough, there was no wait! I ordered egg, sausage, and avocado on a wheat bagel, the hubs got a chicken salad on an everything wheat bagel, and my friends ordered everything bagels with cream cheese. The look on everyone's faces when we saw the size of the bagels was priceless- they were literally half the size of my face! 

Man, I love NY.

But anyway, back to the bagels. My breakfast bagel was pretty perfect- the bread itself was super light and fluffy, which is exactly how a bagel should be. Totally opposite from some of the rock-hard, rubbery bagels I've had in Boston. I loved it so much that I ordered other kinds, such as the cinnamon raisin and blueberry. 

So this is where I dock off a star. The wheat and the everything wheat bagels were A+, but the cinnamon raisin tasted pretty blah. There weren't a whole lot of raisins in it, and it had very little cinnamon taste, so those aspects definitely needed to be amped up. Same thing with the blueberry bagels. 

I can't comment on the cream cheeses, but they had a TON of variety available. My friends seemed to be pretty content with their bagels as they polished them off relatively quick.

Overall, this is a pretty solid joint for bagels, especially if you don't want to wait at some of the more popular places. I'll definitely be back for more of these babies."
139,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8,2018-11-18,3.0,"Decent bagels & coffee. I've tried the BEC on an everything and the whitefish salad and both were pretty average. The bacon was a little hard and greasy, and the whitefish salad is just so salty. The actual bagel itself is fine but with so many fantastic East Village rivals I'm in no rush to return. 

Prices are standard and the restaurant is set up where you order first and then pay at a separate counter where they call out numbers."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-02,5.0,"Searching for a coffee shop in New York isn't hard, but we're lucky we stumbled into Prodigy. A shop that beautiful interior, had an equally beautiful cup of coffee to match. I ordered a black coffee and almond croissant. 

The coffee was delicious with citrusy notes and no bitterness at all - it was perfectly brewed and was a generous serving. The almond croissant matched every almond croissant I've eaten before (nothing special), but was equally good. Would definitely recommend this place... Be aware if you're looking for wi-fi though, this spot doesn't have any!"

140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-18,3.0,"Decent coffee shop in West Village. It's not a very large space and the layout is a bit awkward for seating, with a few 2-seater tables and some benches that face the center of the shop. The coffee prices are decent, and my friend and I each got a Kenya pour-over which was nice and light. We also got the lemon pound cake, which was OK and the chocolate chip cookie which was quite dry. It was fine to catch up with a friend but wasn't really anything to write home about. Would definitely not come with more than one or two other people if you're expecting to sit down for a bit ."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-25,5.0,"I recently discovered the magic of OAT MILK (goodbye regular dairy milk!!) and was on the hunt to find a coffee shop nearby that would satisfy that craving. I came here on a weekday morning and there were only a few people sitting at the tables so no line (thank goodness). I asked the barista girl if they had oat milk (looked it up on yelp and saw a previous review mention that they did) and sure enough, they do! So I got an oat milk latte, which was an additional .50 for that. I also asked for it as decaf and they were able to accommodate that request as well. It was so yummy and yes, I know the cost adds up esp for a small cup of coffee. But I think it was certainly worth it and the service was great. As others have said, it's a small no frills coffee shop and there are a few small tables to sit at, but I wouldn't recommend big groups expecting couches and chairs to lounge on all day."

140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-04,2.0,"I've been here twice and I'll give a review on both times, second being the reason why it's getting 2 stars:

1. Came here two months ago and got a yummy mocha, good service.

2. Came here a few days ago after discovering the bagel place a block away is closed for renovation, and was hoping to get a mocha to fill that emptiness. It was a bit dark inside and I was like darn, it's closed! But my bf thought it was dim lighting and pulled the door open. We stepped inside and suddenly we here a voice yell, we aren't open! And I apologized for it, and she gruffly muttered, the bench is still inside. (There is a bench that they have to drag in and out daily to put outside the shop.) As we walk back out the door, I see that they open at 8, and it was 8:16. So she's late in opening and instead of being welcoming, and saying like oh don't worry, give me a moment to be with you or give me a few minutes, she made us feel like it was our fault that we even thought she was open and how dare us step into her shop that was unlocked and stated as open. We just ended up leaving Bc obviously she didn't care about our business.

The drink was good here, but not good enough to risk being treated poorly again if I come back."

It's a small, but cute coffee shop - perfect for stopping in and getting something to go, but maybe not for staying and sitting especially if you have a group.

I always get a small (12oz) iced coffee black, which comes out to $3.50, and honestly, that's pretty affordable for the area, and most areas in NYC for that matter. If you want milk and all of the other additives, you have to ask because it's not left out on their counter, but it's usually fine. The coffee is tasty, with a rich, robust flavor, but not too bitter nor does it taste as though they put sweetener in it like Starbucks. The couple of baristas that have served me when I've come in are always friendly and quick.

There are a some tables near the front that people are usually sitting in, but I've never gone in and felt overwhelmed by the sheer craziness that some coffee shops have. With a nice flow of people and calm ambience, especially on a Sunday morning, Prodigy Coffee is a fantastic way to start my day. I look forward to returning."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-05,5.0,Lovely cafe with nice air conditioning and friendly staff who make a gorgeous macchiato!
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2017-04-03,3.0,"Cute little coffee shop with basic options any coffee lover would like: pour over, lattes, baked snacks, etc.
They have limited seating and no bathroom so I don't recommend getting too comfortable.
Staff is helpful and pleasant."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-01,1.0,"I went here and the staff was exceedingly rude. I was with friends and so we tried to move two tables together. After moving the (heavy marble tables), one of the girls behind the counter yelled ""you can't move the tables."" A weird way to address a customer but maybe it was just us being far away. We ordered coffee/ tea both of which were subpar. The barista balked when my girlfriend asked for milk in her tea. At 6 (apparently they close at 6 on sunday's not 7 as facebook, yelp, google, etc. - or the staff just wanted to close early), the girl yelled out ""were closed now."" Did not feel welcome at all and will not return which is unfortunate considering that it is near my apartment."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-10,1.0,"Coffee was bitter, possibly because it wasn't fresh. In addition, the woman (I believe the owner) at the counter wasn't too friendly. There was no greeting, no ""thank you"", or basic manner. It really seemed like she didn't care that I was a customer in the cafe. I definitely should of just went to Bluestone Lane, which is across the street."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-19,3.0,"Been to Prodigy Coffee in the Greenwich Village twice now, once in the summer and now in the impending winter season. It's a nice little cafe with seating with tables and chairs for about 7 parties and a bench outside. The prices are comparable to those most non-commercial coffee shops. 

Located near the West 4th Street B,D,A,C station which is convenient. The ventilation is a bit of a crap shoot, issues with AC in the summer. And the actual coffee isn't the greatest. The drip coffee leaves your mouth with a bit of a sour taste which these days is really off putting for me. They do play decent tunes which is a plus. 

Place to go in a pinch but nothing special."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2018-02-20,5.0,"Great place to have coffee and very helpful staff. I had initially wanted another coffee and asked them with some space for milk. The guy suggested , the coffee is very light and if you had milk to it , you will not enjoy it. He suggested another coffee , which I loved. For my friend he liked the Turmeric Latte !! 
Will be back!!"
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2018-08-26,2.0,"We chose Prodigy over Bluestone Lane, which turned out to be a mistake. While the decor and vibe are reminiscent of your run of the mill nice coffee shop, the drinks left MUCH more to be desired.

I ordered an iced mocha, which was decent, save a few sugary chunks. My girlfriend ordered an iced dirty chai, which is what prompted me to write this review. The drink had a sour taste akin to curdled milk, unlike any other dirty chai I've tasted before. To quote my girlfriend, ""I have no idea how they could serve this.""  

But despite the grimy chai, the ambiance of the shop gives me the impression that we may have ordered incorrectly, and we'd be willing (albeit reluctant) to try Prodigy again."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2017-05-31,4.0,"Happened upon this shop walking down carmine from the train station. Early Wednesday morning and not much of a line for the morning coffee rush.

Menu is small, but they have options for sizes. Ordered a large iced red eye ($5) - a super strong drink with overwhelming bitterness (needed for a long day). No milk at the condiment station, so they provide that for you. Also, they don't have simple syrup nor honey for the iced drink. A little annoying since adding grain sugar into an iced drink makes for uneven sweetness. Didn't have the pastries but they look delicious (seem to be the exact items you'd get at a Joe's).

Limited seating here, though no crowd. Coffee is strong, so will come back for a fix."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-21,5.0,"Cute space in the village, cute vibe. Good coffee, and I like that they have Japanese tea options as well. The location is in a really great spot in the village - right by a vintage record store, and across from an old bookstore. Nice place to people-watch."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2017-05-02,4.0,"Stopped in pretty quickly for a shot of espresso ($3.25). I was surprisingly sweet and easy to drink during this quick pit stop.

Generally, the space is small, and the tables were filled mostly of friends catching up (vs. people working). During my brief time here, though, I witnessed more people taking something to go, perhaps influenced by the lack of seating in the space."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2016-05-13,4.0,"Location: you cannot image how many great places are locating on Carmine street. Prodigy is one of them.  The store is average size. You can take a few minute here to enjoy cup of joe or bakeries. However, there's no wifi inside the store. 

Coffee: I had their americano and ice coffee. I love their ice coffee for sure. Huge portion and great balance. 

Price: very cheap if you are looking for a good quality of coffee


Service: hipster people work here. Lol. 

Overall: do deserve come here regularly for ice coffee."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-19,4.0,Cute little coffee shop right by Washington Square Park. I had an oat milk latte which was pretty good. Everyone was very friendly. Very small selection of pastries.
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2017-04-18,5.0,"This place is so unique and cute!!! A lot of space to talk here, and cool options for coffee. I tried the house drip/estate pour over (Ethiopia Guji) and it's really great! The kind barista told me it has a citrus flavor, but it just tasted like a normal drip coffee to me. The Guji is apparently best in black according to the barista and I would have to agree- I think adding in milk will destroy the coffee taste. There are also a lot of pastries options here. I also found it cute that the place has a special board of pictures of dogs/puppies sitting in front of the shop. Highly recommend!"
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2015-12-19,3.0,"White painted brick wall, gold chandeliers, bags of coffee beans hung on a rack... What's there not to love?... The counter girls attitude. After I put in our order, the girl asks me what size. I tell her we're staying in and she just gives us a cup. I guess there's only one size if dining in? After we get our coffees, we stand there waiting for our dessert. She replies ""oh, did I forget your dessert?"" Yes but you didn't forget to charge us. I guess the piece was too big in her opinion because she decided to cut it in half. 

After my husband tries his Ethiopian pour over, he notices a citrus slightly sour taste. That's not Ethiopian but Guatemalan. Ssssiisshhh. Not a great impression. At least my mocha was good."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2017-03-23,4.0,"I've been here twice. The first time was few years ago and it didn't leave a good impression due to bad customer service. This past weekend while we in the area, we decided to grab some coffee here. I was a bit hesitant but good thing we have this place another chance. 
My friends and I were all in agreement now smoothe the coffee and Chai were. I got the cortado and yumm. I don't like acidic coffee and this one definitely was not. 
Customer service was way better this time."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-21,5.0,great cup of coffee and everyone is super nice!!! very cute board of pictures of dogs. would recommend!!
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2017-12-18,5.0,"Loved this cute little coffee shop! Definitely try the Turmeric Latte -- it was amazing!!! I got the cardamom pistachio bread which went excellent with it, as both were such soothing and delicious flavors. The chocolate babka looked amazing as well!"

NY Manhattan West Village
1:30pm Thursday 6th August 2015
Five Stars

It's a pretty quiet shop with four different people having setup shop here: laptops, plugins, bags, four cups of coffee. The music is barely audible. There are 6 two-tables and a little bench counter for two. The big front window, glass door, white brick walls and the two vintage chandeliers give place a lot of light. 

What caught my eye was their signature drink ""Frost Bite"" which their cold brew poured over Shaved Ice $6. I am not sure why someone would pay an extra $2 for shaved ice other than for its novelty but hey why not. (Update: it lasts forever)

Coffee: Strong, Tangy, and Tannic Cold Brew
Caffeine: Very High (update: I am super wired)
Ice: Shaved 
Cup: Classic Clear Plastic

They do sell branded mugs, Harney and Son Tea,  a small selection of pastries and bread loaves which look pretty delicious. 

They have two other interesting drinks ($4 Each)

1. Undertow: Shooter of simple syrup, cold milk, and espresso (available only in the store)

2. SnakeBite: melted dark chocolate with espresso shot."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2017-12-19,3.0,"The employees are very nice. I've never had an issue with anyone working there. They always smile and greet you. It's very clean too. The pastries are good too.

I am giving it 3 stars only because I ordered a large black coffee. No milk or sugar. Just plain. Why is the world is that $4.08??? Did you all pick the coffee beans yourself?  I find that to be insanely over priced for a large black coffee.  I probably won't go back for a black coffee but I can go back for a muffin or pastry."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-05,1.0,The hours say they are open till 7.  Don't go there after 630 wanting anything but old drip coffee or tea.  They shut down the espresso machine at ??? not sure when.   I totally get it needs cleaned.  Then change your hours.
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2017-09-17,3.0,"The smell of coffee drew me into the store but my eyes went straight to the little display they had of sweets from local bakeries. Knowing well I had dinner plans later, I restrained myself and glanced over their drink menu. It was a bit chilly out so I went with an Almond Chai.
     My Indian roots couldn't help but get something that was chai with a small hint of almond. It was something hot with a nice fragrant, spicy hint in the milk tea.  I wish they had a few more items on their drinks menu. They make up for it with their revolving specials menu so there's always something new to try. If you're lucky, you might be able to get street parking however the subway might be the way to go. Confused about the Cafe Au Lait or the macchiato? Ask the employee behind the counter! They're a fellow coffee lover and super friendly. After a few hours of doing some work and sipping on hot chai, I made my way to a local bookstore they had around the corner. I can't wait to come back to try their baked goods next time...ideally they'll have donuts by then!"
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-04,5.0,Simply terrific coffee.  Carefully sourced and blended. The coffee arrives ready to drink; no need to wait for it to cool down. The pastries look terrific.
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2017-11-02,5.0,"Amazing Coffee! 

We tried their cinnamon babka, pumpkin bread & banana bread - all were excellent! Also their cappuccino & iced tea are both great! Will return!!!"
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2016-06-12,4.0,"Prodigy features frames, yep there are at least five different frames hanging in different parts of the room, each showing its signature drinks or coffee beans. On the other hand, the room was set up in a way that still exhibits a hint of modern. The combination really fascinated me!

One complain (sorry): make sure be extra careful when putting the lid on top of the cup - their paper cup could be very easily broken and your coffee spilled all over..."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2017-05-05,4.0,"Cute place in a great location. Decent amount of seating and good lighting by the window. 

Nice selection of pastries-- cookies, loaf bread, muffins, scones. Cappuccino was well done, and had latte art."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-15,3.0,"Prices are reasonable ($3 for my small Cafe Au Lait). The place would otherwise be the perfect place to study/work, but it loses a star for no WiFi and another for no bathroom."
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-05,5.0,I was looking for something quick and casual for after lunch kick. Ran into prodify cafe. low key coffee stop with awesome quality cappacino.
140,prodigy-coffee-new-york-2,2016-07-31,2.0,"***For cold brew***

Honestly, I had a disappointing cup of cold brew - it tasted a bit watered down.  (And I drink my coffee black, nothing in it!)  I thought I'd try something new, but next time I'll stick with my favorite in the neighborhood (La Colombe)."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-12-13,5.0,"Really cute shop! I went in for pastries for the holidays and I was surprised by how cute the yule log cake was. 

I purchased a chocolate chip cookie, the tiny chocolate mousse cake, and the tiny modern yule log. The chocolate chip cookie is hard on the edges but soft towards the center. It can be a tad sweet, but I can see how people would like to order coffee or tea with it. The mousse cake is the perfect flavor of chocolate. It's not too sweet or too bitter and it's a strong chocolate flavor. The modern yule log is made from pistachios, chocolate, and I think cherry? It's cute because it has two tiny mushroom-shaped meringues on it which makes it look more ""log-like"". There were macaroon shells on the end of the logs and they were surprisingly really good. I would definitely go back for more cakes or macaroons."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2020-05-06,5.0,"Came for dessert with my friends after being in the downtown Manhattan area. First off, the customer service was incredible. The workers were so sweet and helpful and honestly made my day. The inside of the cafe was also extremely cute. When I went, I was one of the only people there even though the place was huge. This was probably because I went at an awkward time (around 4pm). I got the blueberry cheese cake tart and I highly recommend it. The prices were reasonable as well."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-11-27,4.0,"This might be the best croissant I've ever had in NYC. If there is a breakfast spread I will literally pick anything else just to avoid them- why? Because what can be delicious about a flakey plain boring pastry? BUT that has all changed now- the chocolate croissant has literally changed my croissant outlook on life. Well done, Financier Patisserie."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-10-02,4.0,"I had their truffle chicken salad sandwich and it was delightful! I'm not a big pastry guy, but the offerings looked amazing and inviting. Nice decor and worth checking out if that is your ""thing"" and in the area."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-03-22,5.0,"My cousin says this is a chain, but who cares...that croissant was the crunchiest flakiest slightly sweet from the cheese filling...oh heaven croissant I've ever had here. Really delightful and perfect with my afternoon tea (green tea and almond milk-thank you) I mean everything looked amazing in their counter. The people before us in line actually let us go first because they just couldn't decide! And were still scanning while we were ordering. A very nice treat and not too heavy for a snack, perfect spot to rest our feet from walking too. The server was friendly and they had a decent bathroom always a plus. Would definitely pop back in if I'm back in these parts again. Might be dreaming of that croissant ....mmmmmmmm."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-05-02,4.0,"The Food is pricey. Coffee too. Service snarky... the cashier gave attitude when we asked to have the table cleaned do we can patron inside. It isn't caused style,  they bring your meal to the table, nice..   the desserts are unique,  small, but...sometimes dry causing you to purchase a drink."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-04-25,3.0,"Had coffee and treats from Financier Patisserie on Sunday morning. Pricey and slow, but hard to find fault in the delicious food they serve.

Quality: After my initial breakfast plans fell apart, ended up at Financier Patisserie. Ordered a Medium Iced Latte, which was just okay, and two pastries, an Almond Croissant and Fruit Diplomat. The Almond Croissant was incredible, soft, sweet, and flaky. Everything you hope for. The Fruit Diplomat was a dense cake topped with seasonal fruit and sugar. It was quite heavy, but very good. I really just wish it was served warm. 
Quantity: Large pastries that are easy to share.
Value: $5.00 for a Medium Iced Latte. $4.00 for an Almond Croissant. $5.00 for a Fruit Diplomat.
Ambiance: Financier Patisserie has a few locations across Manhattan, but I visited the one in the FiDi. The store is quite large with a long hallway across the building. They also had some tables and chairs arranged outside. The most impressive element is the long counter displaying a ton of delicious-looking treats.
Crowd: Only a small crowd on the weekend.
Service: They were unbelievably slow. Even with just a few people in line, it took forever to get my items.
Parking: Difficult to find street parking nearby."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2020-02-17,5.0,"We ordered Almond croissant, hazelnut and pistachio macaroons along with hot chocolate. The almond croissant was one of the best we ever had. The hazelnut croissant had just the right amount of creaminess. The pistachio macaroon was a bit chewy though."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2020-02-03,1.0,"Just...don't do it. It's just gross. Was recently at the FiDi location and ordered an egg, cheese and tomato breakfast sandwich. It's as if they just couldn't care less about their customers. The brioche was cut poorly so that the bottom half was so thick it didn't even toast (the middle of the bread was cold and flavorless), and the tomato had the fibrous middle stem bit still in it which I had to eat around and the tomato was cold and flavorless. If you are serving tomatoes in January, it makes sense they need to be fried a bit to give them a better texture. What a waste of calories."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2018-06-24,4.0,"After my trip to France, I became more particular about finding the croissants in NYC that mirror the same texture & taste as the croissants I ate in France. I came close to finding that special croissant at Financier. 

Fluffy on the inside and flaky with enough crunch on the outside. I like their plain, almond and ham and cheese croissants. It's not too buttery, salty or overloaded with sugar (the sweet croissants)."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2018-11-08,2.0,"This place just isn't for me, I've came to this location a few times. Yes they have a good amount of pastries & prices are alright. Shop is def cute, not sure if all locations are spacious like this location but it's a decent size. All I've tried from here are the pastries, but I have heard that the sandwiches are delicious & the coffee smells so good. For me the pastries are either too sweet or real bland there's no in between. I recently tried an almond breading pudding & it was gross. Not worth the money & it was very tasteless, no taste to the almonds or raisins."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-12-24,5.0,Came here on a whim and had the salmon croissant. So delicious and one of the best croissants I have ever had. Yum! And very cute interior!

a 30 seconds to set up your computer, someone will comes over and VERY LOUDLY and aggressively ask you to buy something. It's very rude and not worth the good coffee. Many other coffee shops around the corner (also with good coffee, but also with nice people)."

I always bring 6 home every other week for the fam lol! I also have my department hooked on ordering cakes for co-workers birthdays .  But now, luckily there's a branch in grand central for times I commute to work in the city once in awhile. I can bring some to go."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2018-07-26,5.0,"Woooooooooow, so thankful my coworker told me about this place! He made it sound super bougie like, ""it's pricey, but they have great croissants and pastries."" I never went because I assume it would be obnoxious NYC prices for a regular croissant. 

This week, my friend from ATL is in town, and she wanted croissants and pastries for breakfast, so I suggested this place since I low-key wanted to try it as well. We went in around 10, and luckily there was no line. Conveniently placed on the door was a sign that said ""Won NYC's best croissants"" (forgot by who), but we were instantly impressed. It's such a cute little pastry shop, and everything looked delectable. My friend got the chocolate croissant, and I got the egg sandwich (on the croissant of course). Let me tell you, this egg sandwich was so simple yet so satisfying, I was genuinely impressed. You know how the cheap croissants are ""soft"" and for some reason ""chewy"" and pulling them apart is like watching gum thin out? Well, this croissant was perfectly crispy and flakey and buttery and soft on the inside - as they should be. It honestly is comparable to the croissants I've had at popular Parisian cafes in France! My friend had the chocolate croissant warmed up and inhaled it in 2 seconds, and she was sad she didn't order a second. 

Side note, it wasn't even that outrageously expensive! It was $2.75 for a regular croissant, and $3.50 for chocolate. My sandwich was $7 I think."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-03-10,5.0,"First the service, it was impeccable, super friendly and efficient. The bakery was well lit and inviting. 

Now for the macarons.  OMG!! We went specifically to have a tasting so we could make a large order for my niece to take home to Arizona. First I tried the coconut which had a tangy flavor that hit the back of your palate three or four chews in. We also tried a coffee one which was surely made with real coffee not just flavoring. Lastly, we had a chocolate which was hands down our favorite. Not only were the macarons huge, they were the best I've ever had. They were the perfect amount of sweet, had a crunchy outside, perfect rims and chewy inside. The filling was orgasmic, not too much not too little. Again, the best we ever had. We each had a cup of nice, hot cup of camomile tea to cleanse our palates between macarons. Just a perfect snack or dessert. I'm addicted and will definitely return for more. 

They were a touch pricey at $3.50 each but believe when I tell you it was well worth the price, I mean it was well worth the prices. 

Run don't walk to try these gems."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-10-18,1.0,"I liked this place and since i work near by almost everyday I would stop by at 62 Stone Street location to buy coffee and pastries. last Friday I stopped by to buy some pasties. The sail person who lately identified herself as a manger Sarah gave me prepacked  pastries in a paper bag. I asked politely that I need it in a boxes since I'm traveling. She refused to do it, saying that it already prepacked. I asked her to give me one from display and she refused to do it again. I couldn't believe and I asked for a manager and she told me that she is a manager.  Finally he angrily pulled out from paper back and dropped in a boxes. I didn't go to the store for a week till today I decided second location which is at 35 Cedar street to avoid Sarah! To my surprised she was there. She clearly recognized me and tried to avoid not to serve me. The sale person at the registry asked me  what I need and I needed the same pastries in the box. He asked Sarah to give it to me and of course she pulled pre-packaged . I told that I need it in the box, she didn't argued and I didn't see what she did until I came to work and opened it.  She purposely crashed pasties by closing box on them. I'm so disgust with the customer service not only I have no idea what she done to the pastries before it was put in a paper bag. Did she used gloves???? Secondly, people like her should be be in customer service especially if she is a manager!
I would never step my foot in any locations and I make sure all my friends know not to buy from Financier until customer service will be improved."

Definitely my go to coffee spot. I've been to quite a few coffee places in the area and nothing compares. Check it out if you're in the area! They also give a little biscuit with your order. So cute. Love this place.
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2017-07-20,3.0,"You mean Financial Patisserie.

The pastries here are fine albeit pricey. I wouldn't go out of my way to get the stuff from here but for the area it's fine. My main complaint as some have noted is that they are inconsistent. On some days the macarons are quite good though on others the texture is way off. The financiers are usually good though. I believe I had a tart once which was pricey but fine. I guess it goes with their name.

I swear I wrote a review ages ago but I must have forgotten. I also checked their other location but nothing was there either.

3.3.

I'd copy this review and post it on their other page but one is enough."

The first time I went with my coworker and he sent amount $50 and the manger was just down right not friendly and the second time my coworker had to walk out that's how rude the manager was toward him. Don't recommend has far has customer service is concerned.
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2017-06-16,5.0,"Order: The tiramisu cake was delicate, creamy, and thick. It was nicely designed and presented as well. For the drink, I ordered the seasonal summer berry cold brew ice tea ($3.50) and it was very light and refreshing. 

Service: The cashiers were very friendly and even allowed me to taste samples of their new smoothie drinks! The interior design is cute and there are many open seats available as well. 

Atmosphere: Overall, it's a very nice small coffee meeting place, filled with active chatter and sweet scents in the air."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2018-07-18,3.0,"We ordered the opera, the raspberry mouse and lemon meringue tart and macarons. We liked the tart but weren't impressed by the other desserts or the macarons. We did a taste test next to the Ladurée macarons and the Ladurée definitely won in flavor. Wouldn't go out do my way to get desserts here and wouldn't go back either."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2018-09-20,5.0,"I can literally say I have been coming here since I was three. It became a staple of tradition in my life to have a sit down breakfast or brunch there at least once a week. 

I love the big macarons (favorite flavors being chocolate and cassis), and the flans are also amazing. But my favorite thing will always be the Le Financier sandwich. The panini with grilled chicken, goat cheese, artichoke, and the best tomatoes ever- it is my ultimate comfort food. 

However, a few years ago they switched management and my childhood favorites disappeared. I was devastated and immediately stopped going. 

After that, I would go every once in a while for macarons. One of those days I saw some of the old cakes were out- immediately I went to check for my sandwich, which had also returned. I honestly can't be happier that it's back. Now my family still goes around once a week, keeping our tradition.

I hope the location remains open a long for a long time and that others can create their own memories there as well. 

Just please don't make me get there and my sandwich is sold out... ;)"
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-09-08,3.0,Everything's so sweet and has been out for days. Does not taste fresh. Although the macaroons were great everything else super sweet. Would come again for macaroons but that's it. Go elsewhere
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2017-07-30,3.0,"I tried the chocolate ganache mousse, the tiramisu, and some blueberry rhubarb tart with apricots. All the pastries fell short in taste. They were good, but definitely not worth the cost when you could get something 3x better in New York. 

(I liked chocolate ganache mousse the best.)"
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-08-23,5.0,I love this place. Every time I'm around I can't resist to buy coffee and a pastry. Everything they have is delicious.
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2018-09-05,5.0,"Cozy place for everyday short break visits or a long chat with your friend, coworker or your mom. 
You can have a warm fresh tomato and goat cheese quiche for a lunch served with salad; decent price and a portion.
Service and employees make you welcome and come back again and again... no matter if it's a hot and sunny or rainy and unpleasant outside.
This place is popular for their coffee and pantries: personal cakes, biscotti, macarons, muffinsans cookies.
I am not a coffee person but I love their Vanilla tea and ones in a while I will indulge myself with capuchino and mint hot cocoa.
That's why I love my job even more because I have Financier on 62 Stone St in a walking distance."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2017-02-15,5.0,"I'm a big fan of this chain, and this is probably one of its best locations in Manhattan. The store goes all the way through the block from Stone St to Pearl St and has lots of seating -- probably 15-20 tables. My most recent visit was on a Friday late afternoon, after the end of work rush, so it was pretty quiet. Store was very clean despite it being the end of the day.

In terms of food/drink offerings, Financier is super consistent across locations. I especially love their chocolatey desserts and macarons. Compared to other French bakeries in the city, Financier's prices are on par or even a bit lower than average, I'd say. If you're a consistent customer, use the LevelUp app to get discounts."
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-08-25,4.0,Nice little dessert place that has the Miquelon and delicious desserts and coffee. A nice way to cap off dinner.
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2019-02-03,1.0,Don't waste your time. Coffee is terrible and the staff is beyond stupid. That's probably because the manager is extremely rude. Go to Periscope in Hanover Sq. Small coffee truck but the guys are super friendly and coffee is awesome.
141,financier-patisserie-new-york-34,2017-04-24,5.0,"I love this place it's close to work and has an excellent collection of pastries.

Service : the service is excellent her. The staff is very friendly as is the manager. They're good at getting rush orders done for you.

Food : I don't think I've disliked anything I've tried at this place. My favorite is the macaroon.

Ambience : the place is cozy and usually not too crowded although it can get that way during lunch hours"

Perfect for tourists needing a quick bite before heading out to see sights, and a selfie of the street ! minutes from downtown hotels ."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-09-27,4.0,"Blue Spoon serves STEAMING hot drip coffee. Their house blend, the Intelligentsia, is pretty good. A small is 12oz and $3. 

Their gluten free cookies are the super soft and chewy kind, where breaking off a piece is more like pulling it apart. I prefer crunchier. Of the two flavors I've seen there, Peanut Butter Chocolate Drop trumps Pumpkin Chocolate Chip. These cookies are kept nicely in their own jars to prevent contamination. Blue Spoon also sells vegan treats.

Overall this location is moderately busy on weekday mornings. It's just a small place that can look crowded, but two cashiers keep the line moving quickly. No bathroom for customers."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-09-27,4.0,I came for coffee and dessert and was happy I did. The place has tables to sit but its very limited. The coffee was very good good the prices were as expected. I decided to get cookies for dessert they have one of the best cookies here very delicious. This place is good for breakfast and a quick lunch. The staff was very friendly. I don't live/ work near the area but whenever I'm around I definitely come here for my coffee & cookies
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-02-20,4.0,"Really good coffee and breakfast items but incredibly overpriced, especially when there's a smoothie and bagel cart parked right outside. I suppose in the colder months it's good to have as a stand-by especially if you're like me and absolutely loathe eating or drinking anything while walking around outside. 

The drinks particularly seem marked-up: almost all of the coffees and teas here run over $3. I also overheard someone paying $7.50 for some oatmeal, which is honestly the cheapest food ever. Blue Spoon's premium oatmeal comes with bananas, apples, walnuts, raisins, brown sugar, cinnamon, angel tears, but unless I was really craving oatmeal that day, the price doesn't seem worth it to me. 

I love their sandwiches, though. Back when I used to work in the area, my go-to options were the smashed avocado sandwich (with cheddar) or the roasted chicken with avocado if I wanted a little more protein that day. Good size for the price, and never left me with that bloated, sickly feeling. Only tried one of their paninis - the goat cheese with peppers and onions. It was absolutely delicious but your breath will stink to high heaven afterwards. 

I always make it a point to swing by whenever I'm in this neighborhood, mostly because of the sentimentality I attach to the sandwiches."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-06-29,4.0,"I always get a Toasted Cinnamon Raisin bagel with Jam whenever I come here, and it tastes incredible! This is a really cute place if you're looking to get some work done or catch up with a friend. It's super tiny, but in my experience, there is always space to sit."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-06-27,1.0,"Called about placing a catering order of sandwiches and salads and asked if they could be presented nicely on a tray and delivered. Person who answered the phone seemed very confused, wouldn't find out the answer and said he was too busy to deal with this right now and hung up.

Maybe the food is good, but the service definitely isn't."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2018-11-07,4.0,"Panic!! That's how I felt when I was called into a meeting 30 minutes early. But I had to grab something to eat or I would literally faint. Not a ton of options on Chambers for a vegan. Hmmmm. What's this little place? They have oat milk in the case. First good sign. Vegan cookies. Second good sign. AVOCADO TOAST!!! I'm in love. Wish I was in a soup mood. They had 2-3 of those I could eat. 
So next time I'm in the City Hall area, this will be my destination again. Wanna try one of those lovely salads!"
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2018-10-23,5.0,Friendly staff and quick service. I cant wait to come back and try the food. The prices seem good. I got the honey lavender latte with almond milk and it was awesome. I've gotten same thing different places but this one stands out as yummy
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-03-20,4.0,I used come here to get coffee all the time when I worked nearby. I'm a coffee connoisseur and I love the taste of coffee. I'm not a Starbucks coffee fan because the taste is not something I like. But blue spoon coffee tastes like coffee to me. The store is small and cozy. The employees are friendly and the coffee is delicious. I dont work nearby anymore so I only go here when I'm in the neighborhood.
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2018-05-17,3.0,"There's a surprising lack of boutique coffee places in the area, between the financial district, where it's also lacking, and Tribeca. This is a good option, but sort of annoyingly disorganized and not fast in any respect. Ordering took a while, paying took a while, and getting my beverage took even longer. I decided to try the honey lavender latte on my first visit since it seemed to be a signature of theirs. I usually would get a flat white. I would have given four stars for the coffee and the availability in the area, but the wait and he staff's decidedly unenthused attitude was annoying. It's also not a great space for waiting for beverages, and a lot of people are waiting because of the lack of speed. 

This place has a ton of food options, too, for breakfast and lunch, including three soups of the day that ran the gamut when I was in and would probably satisfy most palates."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2018-10-01,1.0,"We came down from Brooklyn bridge to find a coffee place nearby. The Yelp reviews of this place was good so we came to try it out. I ordered iced white mocha and my friend ordered Matcha lemonade. Both drinks were horrible for such a price(even more expensive than Starbucks). My white mocha was watered down. Had no white chocolate taste to it and definitely not enough espresso in there. It felt like you mixed brewed coffee with milk, added bunch of ice to water it down, and added one pump of whatever syrup there was. My friend's Matcha lemonade tasted like a weird lemonade with no Matcha flavor whatsoever. Waste of money couldn't even finish those.
Although,muffins do look great. But again didn't try it so my review is based on drinks only"
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-10-16,4.0,"I ordered a oat cappuccino which cost $5.50. Nearly died. It was fine but no better than the other places I get my order from that are also cheaper! I'd prefer to pay less than $5 for a small 8oz Capp. 
I gave 4 stars as the coffee was good and I'd come back if all my other favorite coffee shops in the area were closed."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2018-08-02,4.0,"Awesome spot for a quick bite to eat or to just grab some coffee. There isn't a whole lot of seating if you plan to stick around. The service was decent but nothing special. I will say that I was pretty impressed with their cold brew though.

TIP: If you have a soy or dairy allergy try the iced honey lavender latte with almond milk. This is one of the only drinks (with almond milk) that my wife has actually enjoyed."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2018-05-08,3.0,"My coworker loves this place, so I swung by with a friend. Note that there is a $5 minimum for credit cards, so you'll need to bring cash if you just want a coffee. 

I got a chai latte and a raisin nut scone. The chai latte had an okay flavor but was served lukewarm. They weren't busy yet this morning, so the temperature seemed more like a lack of care than a need for speed. The scone itself was dry and I couldn't detect any hint of nut. I think this must be the kind of place where you just go for coffee (or maybe a sandwich) - so bring cash if you go!"
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-10-30,5.0,"I love Blue Spoon! I work fairly close, so I come in often for morning/lunch coffees and food. I'm originally from Seattle, so I've had my fair share of good coffee and this place pleasantly surprised me! The paninis are delicious and the staff is always super nice. I like my coffee with stronger flavor than usual and the baristas always make sure to do that for me which is so nice!"
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-09-06,3.0,If I'm paying 5 bucks for a coffee the least you can do is be nice to your customers. Just something to consider.
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-04-13,5.0,Delicious begals and famous cappuccino! Cute spot a short walk from Pace University and the Financial district
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2017-10-02,5.0,Quick stop for lunch for whatever you might want! Their soup is great (selections change daily) and they have combo deals if you're really hungry. Try the raspberry mocha coffee hot or iced; it's really good!
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2019-06-15,5.0,"5 stars for the surprisingly good medium roast coffee (normally prefer light roast with citrus flavors) as this was terrific.  Also had a great panini w smoked Turkey, briefly, and pesto.  Window seat capped off a great visit."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2018-10-10,4.0,Damn! Got the honey lavender almond milk based on popular reviews. Definitely a powerful flavor sensation going on right now in my mouth.
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2014-07-22,4.0,"Small, but quaint coffee shop right by the subway. Super convenient.

Besides coffee, they have an assortment of bagels and pastries (from Ceci Cela and Balthazar-2 of the best!).

Got an actual large iced coffee for $3.50. Great price and the coffee hit the spot."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2016-09-09,4.0,"Got a panini with mozzarella cheese and tomato.  Also had a latte.  Both were really good.  Solid place, though it's a small."

Four Stars

This coffee shop is fairly small seating 12 people comfortably.  The blue and white interior gave a nice upscale look to the place. I had a cappuccino ($4) to stay, which is the nice way of saying for here. The Coffee was the Black Cat Espresso from Intelligencia.  The roast had a dark nutty flavor.  The Foam was thick and creamy and sat nicely atop of the brew.  There was plenty of steamed milk, which gave an overall mellow flavor.

As I sat read my book, I heard the employees talking/yelling/arguing.   Apparently somebody's significant other was slightly intoxicated one evening and may or may not have slapped another employee for no reason. It was slightly awkward experience that made the two ladies next to me leave.  However they were still very courteous to the customers."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2016-05-17,4.0,"Needing a caffeine jolt for lunch while I was in the area for a 9-5 meeting, I knew I was going to pay Blue Spoon a visit as they serve one of my favorite coffee blends in Intelligentsia.

First thing I noticed was Blue Spoon is small with at most 4-5 tables as the kitchen area dominates most of the floor space.


My coffee was served very quickly which was appreciated as the place filled up very fast with other customers who primarily ordered lunch items or fancier coffees.


The coffee was spot on fresh, perfect in temperature, and a smooth mild blend....perfect for me.

It was also nice to see a self service station for the coffee additions (cream, sugar, etc.) as everybody has their individual preferences.


Only drawback was the above mentioned small space as due to the combination of size and the number of customers there was inevitable invasions of personal space and awkward contortions to reach the door without spilling any of the precious coffee."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2017-06-29,3.0,"Got a Maryland Crab Soup here for $10+ for 16 ounces.  The soup was decent but not a lot of crabs, just a lot of vegetables.  I think the clam chowder or seafood bisque at TriBeCa Kitchen is a much better deal-- lots of chucks of clams and shrimp."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2015-06-25,4.0,"What to get: 
- Vanilla, raspberry Italian soda
- honey lavender latte
- iced chai

What was ok: 
- lavender Italian soda (really strong flavor) 
- very small space, no place to sit and relax"
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2017-11-19,5.0,Its an understatement if i say Hot Chocolate is Mind blowing! Well at least for me lol. Staffs were great and the ambience so good.
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2015-04-22,3.0,"A small coffee hipster cropping on Chambers Street, Downtown Civic Center that can be very easily overlooked when walking.  It also offer sandwiches and Panini starting at $8.25, salads at $8.50.  Extremely overpriced.  They offer my favorite-chocolate chip at $1.00 each.  A loyalty card is available.  Intelligentsia is available."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2015-04-29,3.0,"HIpster coffee shop--but the prices are not AS bad... At $2 and change, a basic 12oz coffee is about a dollar less than some of the other trendy coffee places around the area. That said, i think I still prefer some of those other places. Perhaps I will change my mind if I ever go back for the sandwiches. 

As some have mentioned, the place is hard to find--it's next to Tasti D Lite in that weird part between TriBeCa and FiDi, and is small and cute. There are various sizes of mirrors hanging on the walls, giving it a vintage thrift shop air. The server was prompt, and there was no line at around 4 in the afternoon. 

My iced latte was strong--the ice did not water it down, which is a common problem I have found with iced coffees, regardless of how high-end the beans are. I thought the contrast between the hip decor and the casual, not-at-all-affected feel of the place would make it somewhere I'd enjoy going if it was closer to my office."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2018-01-19,5.0,"This place is amazing. You have to try their runny egg sandwich, and boy do I love my eggs runny. So runny it'll dribble down your chin. I walk in and Joey always greets me, he says hey Chris! The usual? He always gets it wrong but he's got a nice smile. I always give him a tap on the bum, he's a good kid. And they're not lying when they say best coffee in town, it'll put some hair on your chest. When you stop by tell them Chris sent you, he'll shave a little off the tab. Don't forget to leave a tip for Joey!"
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2017-08-10,4.0,They serve Intelligentsia here. Reliable place for a coffee. The people are generally friendly and the service is quick.
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2016-07-16,4.0,"I love Blue Spoon because sometimes you're in a ""behemoth coffee shop be damned"" mood. And BSC makes a great iced latte, and they get it done pretty fast.

But the space is thsmall. 

Had a chicken pesto panini, which was fine, but this is definitely a spot that's more about the caffeine. Don't forget to get your card stamped."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2018-10-26,5.0,"The staff is super kind, and the service is impeccable. Not to mention, the Intelligentsia coffee served here is delicious. I might even like it more than La Colombe. Stop in here on a cold day for warm vibes and hot coffee."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2017-07-07,5.0,"I first visited this shop in FiDi when I was in town for work and fell in love with this place. When I came back to the city, I was staying in TriBeCa and came to this location! The matcha lattes are AMAZING. They whisk the matcha fresh for each customer and mix in a little honey. The best part is they mix it so well there's no additional residue or clumps. It's a nice refreshing and flavorful drink all year round. I will definitely be back when I visit the city."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2017-12-07,1.0,To be honest I don't know why but ever since the moment I stepped in I felt this uncomfortable awkward vibe..the kind where you don't feel welcomed. I didn't get a hello or any smile. The latte I had ordered was sour tasting and lukewarm..regret spending money for such a gross coffee and receiving attitude in the morning
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2018-01-30,5.0,"A quality coffee and breakfast destination tucked away in Tribeca, promptly brewing Intelligentsia, the west's coasts finest, and offering a wide array of bagels, parfaits, and other quick, commute-friendly eats. An ideal place to stop and fuel up on the way to work or on a coffee break, yet still spacious enough to have a seat inside and get a little work done while people watching through the large street-facing front windows. Friendly service too. Don't forget to grab a punch card! (Also check out the William st location in FiDi--I prefer that branch.)"
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2017-12-01,5.0,"Cute little place. Had flat white and muffin there, totally worth to visit. There are not too many places downtown, so it makes it even more special.  Service is great, staff is very friendly."

144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2015-12-16,3.0,"Stumbled upon this place on the way, so because of Yelp decided to try it. I got the honey lavender latte. Latte art was cute, but latte itself was OK. Tasted subtle hints on lavender and honey. The milk was freshly steamed. But to me coffee is all about flavor, and this was kind of bland, like a regular latte. 

They gave us a free croissant since we walked in about 10 mins before closing."
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2016-06-20,4.0,"This place is great if you work nearby, definitely not a hang out spot: it gets very crowded and is very small, not your tranquil coffee shop escape.

The drinks are good, the sizes are small, but that's just the ""hipster"" side of it.

The staff is nice when they're not busy, if they are, you can see the stress on their faces and they transmit it through their service - also more likely to get your other wrong. 

Tip: grab a rewards card, if you work/live close by, the coffee add up quick and you get free drinks!"
144,blue-spoon-coffee-new-york,2017-10-19,3.0,"Ok. Coffee ok

Prices a little steep

However, I tried it again and got the honeycomb ice cream and I'm OBSESSED. It's definitely a little expensive as far as ice cream goes at around $7 for 2 scoops but its totally something I'd splurge on. The chocolate was also really food- SO decadent."

If you've never been to Van Leeuwen, expect pastel colored decor with a cute retro vibe and of course delicious ice cream. The packaging is also super adorable-love the pink takeout bags."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-10-15,4.0,"I was expecting more flavors in store since there was a lot listed on the website but I guess that's only to buy as a pint? 

Nonetheless, the available flavors were pretty good and unique. They had pumpkin cheesecake as a limited flavor when we visited. And normally I would go for limited flavors but the Brooklyn Brown Sugar Chunk got my attention that night. There's a lot going on in a scoop and I'm pretty sure I had bites of brownie and cookie dough. 

I got to try the Honeycomb as well but I thought it was too sweet for my liking."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2020-01-04,4.0,"I got the chocolate fudge brownie ice cream as I came in with a large party of about 14 of us during a holiday party night. There was only one staff in the store and he was helpful. The ice cream was very tasty and rich, and I would come back to try other flavors and locations."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-05-21,4.0,"Van Leeuwen shops are popping up all over the city, which is good news for ice cream lovers. They have both vegan and regular options, and they offer seasonal flavors as well. Over the weekend I tried the strawberry rhubarb which I loved - it had big chunks of pie crust in it, and it was really creamy. The honeycomb is also a tried and true flavor here. 

The interior of the seaport location has a few tables and some benches outside. We went in the evening so the line was out the door. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is it's really expensive: 3 scoops of ice cream is $10."

145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-12-18,5.0,"Truly the first place that I've ever had GREAT vegan ice cream. We got the cookies and cream caramel and ice cream for breakfast flavors and wow. Both were so creamy, sweet without being cloying and a fun crunch. The spot itself is very low key, so don't go expecting a ton of space or bathrooms. Great ice cream for the walk around the Seaport."

This location was a convenient stop after walking across the Brooklyn bridge back to the city. I love that they always have so many vegan options and new seasonal flavors to try. I got the vegan chocolate chip cookie dough and mint chip!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-12-30,5.0,"Delicious ice cream, great service, spacious location. 

I don't often have servers at ice cream shops offer me more samples than I ask for, so that was a lovely surprise (shoutout to everyone who feels awkward when asking for multiple samples)! Since we were here at the end of December on a relatively cold day, there was no one else in the shop. There were only half a dozen seats in this spacious space, but that's standard for most ice cream shops now. I had the honeycomb (classic flavour) and peppermint stick (seasonal flavour). I loved that the honeycomb flavour had a lovely caramel flavour without being too sweet, and that the peppermint stick had everything I love about mint chip without the chocolate chips (which in my opinion, clashes with the texture of smooth ice cream). The texture is what you'd want in ice cream, thick and creamy with no icy chunks. 

I also saw there was a bottle of... olive oil (??) on the counter, which I had heard is good with ice cream but I'd never seen any ice cream place actually offer it as a topping. 

I'm only disappointed I didn't try their hot chocolate float (hot chocolate with ice cream)!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-06-13,5.0,"The ice cream is AMAZING!!!! My friends and I tried an bunch of different samples and it was so hard to pick one flavor. I ended up getting the earl gray tea flavor and I was very satisfied with my choice. The flavors are interesting, some unexpected, and rich in flavor. If you're near one of their locations, I would highly recommend trying this place out! It really hits the spot and will leave you wanting more."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-07-14,4.0,"Very friendly staff. The venue gets packed fast and there is not much seating inside (8 spots or so).

- Pistacio - really milky and not enough nutty taste for me.
- Honeycomb - really sweet and filled with honey. Not for me, but definitely liked by others.

This place was not my cup of tea for ice cream, but my group enjoyed it thoroughly. Would visit again, but I would not order anything."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-09-25,5.0,"Of all the ice cream shops in the city, this specific place is my favorite.  It is walking distance from work, and sooo tempting to grab a sweet treat when out during lunch or after work. 

Did visit this shop several times during the summer season, took colleagues, friends and went by myself.  Got to try a few of their seasonal vegan and non-vegan ice creams.  

The staff is always friendly, and happy to provide you with samples until you are ready to decide on your flavor of the day.

The great feature they have is cashless, so you don't have to worry about pulling out cash to pay. 

They have enough tables and stools to fit more than 10 people and they provide water and a roomy bathroom too.

Can't wait to go back to try something different."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-11-12,5.0,"I came here with my friend around 8:30pm and no one else was there (granted it was 40 degrees outside), but the employees were so nice and let us try some flavors. They're pretty big spoons if I say so myself. We had one scoop each of the mint chocolate chip and peanut butter marshmallow, and both were so creamy and had the perfect balance of flavors. Both were not too sweet either, and the cone was also great.

It's 5.50 for a scoop, and I can see myself coming here again and again. I can also bring my parents who can have the vegan ice cream - and there were many many options for anyone along with the toppings!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-04-08,4.0,"Really good ice cream! I got the special Brooklyn Brown Sugar Chunk flavor - it was creamy and the chunks added some nice texture. My boyfriend got the PB Marshmallow Crunch in a homemade cone which was also really good. Nice location in the Seaport, we will definitely be back!!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-09-10,4.0,"My friend and I visited this hyped-up ice cream chain at the South Street Seaport location at 2pm on a Sunday.  This is a spacious location with enough room for 4-5 small parties to be comfortably seated.  The shop had a slow but consistent flow of customers, but this might have been due to the rainy and windy weather.  

We got three scoops - pistachio, earl grey, and the kalamansi and mellon sorbet (special) for around $10.  VL knows how to do flavors.  The pistachio was so rich and nutty without tasting artificial.  I liked that the earl grey flavor was present but not overpowering because I'm not the biggest fan of strong teas.  Those who are looking for that powerful punch may find the flavor lacking.  The sorbet was so refreshing while still packed with a nice citrus flavor.  The consistency of the two ice cream flavors were so close to my ideal ice cream consistency.  While creamy, it scoops as more solid than fluffy.  The sorbet consistency was actually fluffier, which is not what I usually encounter when eating sorbets.        

Since ice cream makes me happy, I appreciate it when employees at the shops are cheerful.  The employee that helped us was very blase and indifferent.  The scoops are also on the smaller side, which makes $10 a teeny bit overpriced.  I'm so glad that VL lived up to the hype and delighted me with the flavors of their ice creams.  If I'm ever on a treat-yo-self mission, I would stop by VL again!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-07-28,4.0,"So delicious! And super convenient location if you're a tourist (or native!) who's exploring the slowly improving South Street Seaport area. It's not cheap, but the quality is very good and I can see why they're so famous.

They have vegan versions of your more traditional flavors of ice cream and some unique ones. It's a small shop, bright and open, and customer service was welcoming and nice. I recommend trying it out!!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-10-16,4.0,So so so *expensive* but pretty worth to try! I really liked every kind of vegan ice cream - way better than Ben&Jerry's
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-09-11,5.0,"I have a soft spot in my heart for this unique ice cream chain. As someone who can't have a ton of dairy, but loves ice cream, Van Leeuwen's is a must go. They have plenty of coconut milk, oat milk and other non-dairy options. Some flavors are sweeter and not my favorite, but I always end up trying a few until I land on one (or two) and the service has always been nice and patient. I haven't been to this chain when it's crowded, but there aren't a ton of seats so I can see how it may not be the best to sit down and hang. That being said, the environment is clean and open and it gives you a great excuse to peruse what else South Street Seaport has to offer."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-01-01,4.0,"Walking around Seaport calls for ice cream. I was blown away by the variety of flavors here. I eat vegan as much as possible so when I saw a half dozen vegan options in addition to traditional ice cream, I had to make a stop. 

We tried the Dark Matter ice cream which is made with charcoal. Yes, charcoal, how weird! But it was good! No grittiness, just lightly sweet. I'd recommended dark matter for people who don't like rich or overly sweet. 

We also tried the vegan cookie dough, which I've never seen - this is the reason for knocking off a star- it was delicious but they did not succeed in masking the nut flavor. When I eat vegan ice cream I want it to taste like the cow's milk version without the guilt of animal cruelty. They did succeed in making it super creamy so if you like nut flavors or nutty cookie dough then you will love this. The other issue with cookie dough and it's my issue with most ice cream parlors not just this one is that there is always a shortage of actual cookie dough, so this place is like every where else. 

Nothing special about the ambiance. It's an order and go type of place. I'd come back here for sure."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-05-25,5.0,"Sunny late afternoon in FiDi. Short stroll through the seaport. What is it we have a hankering for? ICE CREAM. Yasssssssss. We pop into Van Leeuwen along with every other strolling group looking for a tasty treat. But the line moved quickly enough, and gave us some time to absorb the offerings. Oh. So. Many. Tasty. Flavors. Did I want vegan? Not? Strawberry rhubarb? Salted caramel? Scoop? Sundae? 
We chose two scoops each, in cups. My husband got two scoops of Salted Caramel. I went with a stroke of genius: a scoop of Honeycomb and a scoop of Earl Gray. Mmmmmm. Mmmm.
The Honeycomb was sweet, as one would expect, with a gooey streak of what I assume is honey-flavored goodness through it. The Earl Grey tasted just like the tea, which cut the Honeycomb's sweetness perfectly. Earl Grey is good enough to stand alone, mind you, but the pairing with the Honeycomb was perfection.
My husband loved his Salted Caramel because, ya know, salted caramel.
We sat at a little table inside, as it was cool and windy outside, and enjoyed our sweet afternoon treat. Next time, I am totally trying that Strawberry Rhubarb.

Oh, one thing I also appreciated? The solid little spoons they give you to eat from your cups. No flimsy, greasy cheap plastic here. I know, I know. Who cares about the spoon? Well, it's a little thing but I enjoyed eating my ice cream without worrying the spoon would splinter. I love the little things."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-07-12,3.0,"Those in our party who were able to enjoy the unique flavors did. Unfortunately - anyone who is looking for a vegan AND nut free option only had one choice available - oat milk chocolate. I liked it but was bummed that was the only choice for me. All the other ice creams use nuts in the ingredients. Order at the counter, and grab and go type atmosphere. Short walk from the Seaport shopping area."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-10-17,5.0,This place is amazing it was my first time coming here and i truly love their ice cream and the customer service was great. The inside is cute and super clean love that the environment is very calm. Love the location as well seaport is a great place to go.
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-06-16,5.0,"So delish!!! I'm kind of sad they don't have anything like this in the Maryland area. So refreshing!! 

We went to NY with no agenda and ready to roam around and find some new gems on our day date. The ice cream was so good!! And Vegan! Thank goodness for vegan ice cream¡! They also have regular ice cream so for those that can still tolerate dairy, stop in. Life after 30.......something.....our bodies aren't built the same. 

I had the salted caramel in a cone. Delish! Hubby had the peanut butter chocolate chip, just as good! A handful of flavors to choose from so take your pick! Walk around or sit right out front and chow down."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-06-12,5.0,"What an awesome place to be in! 

I was craving for some nice ice cream and found this place when searching for where to go to. And you know what? I'm so glad I did! They had a bunch of flavors to choose from I couldn't set my mind on which one to pick.

I finally chose the Brooklyn Brown Sugar Chunk option and it was out of this world! 

The interior design is also very nice and comfortable to be in. All around I had a very nice experience being here.

10/10 recommended!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-10-15,4.0,"Review #2000

Van Leeuwen's track record is unblemished; they're two for two when it comes to flavors that make my taste buds happy. This location near South Street Seaport & Fulton Street Market is the second one I've visited this year. I sampled Ginger before deciding on Honeycomb. The person scooping was heavy handed with the portion size, even though I'd only ordered a Small. An extra 200 calories of sugar & dairy -- don't mind if I do. Honeycomb has crisp, sticky pieces throughout & like other flavor I've tried before, has a velvety texture that coats your mouth. Hella neighborhoods are graced with a Van Leeuwen so you won't have to search far & wide for unique flavors, both in dairy & vegan varieties."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-12-22,4.0,I returned here and no ice cream was dropped this time... hooray! But I was very satisfied with my ice cream and the staff on my most recent visit. Van Leeuwen really knows what's up
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-01-10,3.0,"Hmm what can I say, lets start off with the good. I love the shop, theres a notebook where you can leave notes or doodles. Its really bright & perfect for pictures. The ice cream was pretty good. Nothing crazy, ive had both better and worse. They have vegan options & are known for it so thats a plus, i had the regular pistachio and enjoyed it. For the bad, the person serving us seemed kind of uptight & borderline rude. Kinda put a damper on the experience. Personally I probably won't come back since the ice cream was just ok and the service was bad. This place may be a little over hyped.

145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-07-06,4.0,"Do I like eating ice cream? Yes. Do I like spending $6.26 for one scoop of ice cream? Not so much. Despite its rather pricey menu, Van Leeuwen is popular for a reason: its ice cream is delicious! Not a super wide selection of flavors like most ice cream places, but I immediately knew I wanted the earl grey tea flavor after sampling it. Sample as much as you can if you think that'll help you get your money's worth! The earl grey flavor was incredibly sharp and fragrant, and it was a nice treat after seeing the Fourth of July fireworks."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2017-09-09,5.0,"Great, big new location of one of the best ice cream chains in the country is now in an area that really needed a good scoop shop.

Right near the South Street Seaport, you should come here for dessert any time you're nearby. Get any of the flavors, especially the always amazing rotating specials. The vegan flavors are incredible too.

There is still a long line right now for their grand opening, where they're offering $1 scoops."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-07-28,5.0,"Nothing breaks up a work day better than sneaking out for some deliciously creamy ice cream on a super hot day! My boyfriend and I meandered to this ice cream shop to share some scoops and enjoy on the pier. 

VL has a clean and simple atmosphere, and was rather quiet during the weekday. They serve both vegan and regular ice creams, so you can please everyone here! 

He insisted on the honeycomb ice cream, and I chose pistachio to complete the duo. Both flavors were perfectly creamy and smooth, without being crumbly or gritty. The honeycomb was out of this world - not overly sweet, and with tiny hard chunks to give it some texture. Unlike any flavor I've had before. We also agreed the pistachio was the best pistachio we ever had! It had the perfect nuttiness and sweetness combo. 

This ice cream is no joke - get your butt here to cool off in this heat! The flavors are amazing and the shop is adorable!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-08-24,5.0,We had the vegan oat ice cream. It was amazing!!!! I only eat vegan ice creams lately but this was a really good one. Highly recommended
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-09-23,5.0,"I've had pretty much every vegan ice cream there is. ((I'm a lactose intolerant ice cream addiction))... 
this is easily the best I've ever had!!
So many vegan options!!!! 
Very generous scoops. 
They can't split a scoop into 2 flavors =/

I will say tho.. I don't think this is Pressed Juicery freeze healthy. It's very very sweet and u can feel it lol. But it's a great treat!!

Chocolate, pb, mint choc and cookies and cream with caramel swirl are all 10/10!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-08-02,5.0,"This is by far one of the best places to get some great ice cream in nyc, if not all of america!  LOVE IT SO MUCH! The staff was amazing.  Ice cream, incredible. Went with the family so we got to sample a bunch of it.   We ended up getting the honeycomb, and peppermint stick and the standard which is two flavors the size of a single scoop of Coffee with Cream and Sugar. The Coffee was a creamy coffee flavor that isn't too strong and wasn't too sweet but amazing .  Lavender has a great floral flavor that's topped with some berries. All three of these flavors are great! I recommend anyone to pass by and enter this ice cream shop. Seriously, you won't regret it at all!!!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-07-13,3.0,"Came here before but at a different location . The location was really dope and I tried something different I tried ""The Vegan"" I tried it with the caramel swirl vegan ice cream and the cookie dough ice cream all vegan . It came with cacao nibs walnuts and whip cream. Honestly it was alright . I feel like it was a lot of chocolate . It came with chocolate sauce . It was good but I felt like I would have been happier with just a cone with two scoops really lol . The staff was a bit on the dry side so I didn't care for that . But everything was okay . I think what I loved most was the seating outside ‍ probably won't be back to this particular location though ."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-06-16,4.0,"Who woulda thunk it. Vegan ice cream made from nut products that was actually creamy and very good.

We tried the dark matter, which was honey comb and charcoal activated. It was good but had a funky after taste. Not for me. So instead, we got a scoop of chocolate chip cookie dough. This was excellent. The cookie dough chunks were huge and awesome, as all cookie dough should be, and the vanilla ice cream was, again, creamy with the spots from a vanilla bean, so you know it was real vanilla. It was sweet, but not overly so. 

One complaint would be that they didn't fully cover the nutty taste from the nuts used to make the ice cream. Therefore, the ice cream had a nutty aftertaste. It didn't ruin it by any stretch, but it was the one drawback. 

Regardless, if you're lactose intolerant, vegan, or just trying to cut back on dairy because dairy gives you gas something terrible, then this is an excellent substitute."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-09-06,2.0,"Too Sweet for me. I mean, if you crave for something fresher, you probably won't be here."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-08-06,5.0,"This is one of the rare times when a place that is seriously hyped up on social media actually meets your heightened expectations and looks and tastes even better than instagram makes it seem.

The ice cream here is as delicious as I always dreamed it would be. I tried the Honeycomb and Cookies and Cream flavors today and both were really good. I will absolutely be coming back to try some more."
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2019-05-04,5.0,"this is the cutest place ever, and i am so glad i found a location near my job! the earl grey tea ice cream is hands down my favorite. Its crazy that it tastes like fruit loops at first, but then you get the earl grey after taste. Its super light, not too sweet, and doesn't sit so heavy like other ice creams do. I look forward to trying all the other flavors!"
145,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-7,2018-07-21,3.0,"For all the hype I was surprised at the small number of flavor choices and the leakiness of their waffle cones. They were out of 4-5 flavors, so there was a bit more of a limited selection. Was really looking forward to trying the Royal Wedding Cake flavor (great marketing name!) but alas. Tried the chocolate charcoal (nope) and gave up and went with honeycomb. Actually quite a good flavor, but more cream ice cream with honey swirled in. Nothing too special.

As for the waffle cone - They are freshly made, so I was really excited about that. It tasted good, but wasn't made well. There were all sorts of little holes in the cone, so when the ice cream started melting it got everywhere. And finally, the ice cream consistency - it was good but a bit too softened. As soon as it was scooped it started melting much quicker than other nice ice cream parlors. That's probably more of a personal preference, but thought it may help some."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2020-02-11,5.0,"It's exactly what it looks like, only better. Try their fresh carrot juice. Everytime I order something a little customized here, they always listen to me and it's exactly what I wanted. The main waitress I guess functions as a hostess- shes always calling everyone ""My friend."" I'd almost venture that she low key means that.
The bathroom is WILD."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-02-10,4.0,"I love this place.  It is a throwback to when there were luncheonettes for breakfast, not brunch places.  The food is fresh, basic and fairly priced.  Where else can you get a delicious pastrami and egg sandwich for $4.95?!  You can get anything that's on the menu for breakfast and vice versa.  I once got fish snd chips for for breakfast and it was pretty decent."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-02-16,3.0,"I was Chinatown with family to do some pre-Chinese New Year's shopping and for a quick lunch bite we stopped by Landmark.


I ordered a triple-decker sandwich of corn beef with American cheese and mustard on white bread which was also served with French fries.

The sandwich was okay, as the corn beef had some nice briny flavor that was enhanced with the tangy mustard. American cheese was okay too, with a pleasant slightly melted texture.

I enjoyed the French fries as they were rather thick, slightly crisp, and not greasy. Tossing on a dash of salt in conjunction with ketchup really amped up the taste.


My sister had a grilled Cheddar cheese sandwich with bacon and tomato on rye bread which was a solid version of this diner classic.

The bacon was crisp, the cheese was grilled to a nice melting point, and the bread buttery and crisp.

As with my platter, the fries were very good.


Solid, no fuss diner fare, with good service is what you expect at Landmark which summarizes my lunch experience."

Shop is only open from 6am to 6pm. We just missed the breakfast specials which ends at 11am. It has the typical menu found in most diners where you can get omelettes, pancakes, eggs and sausages, waffles along with burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.

We got Western omelette and eggs with ham on a roll which were pretty good. Service was quick. Place filled up as we were getting ready to leave."

146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-12-09,1.0,"Breakfast in the peripheral limits of Chinatown summon eggs, toast with butter, tea at a table.  I desired an all inclusive meal which Landmark offers breakfast specials until 11 am.  The female Chinese server was abrasive, callous, curt, stolid, pushy, insolent, and aggressive attitude to sell more food than I requested: ""You want orange juice, it is $3? Very fresh, you want?"" The menu stated ""coffee or tea"" in the breakfast specials but does not specify what genre of tea is available or offered so I asked and received a very broad, vague stolid response: ""only Tetley tea is included."" What kind of tea is Tetley? English breakfast, Earl Grey, green tea, chamomile, peppermint herb, etc.? ""TETLEY TEA ONLY!! We do have those teas as we have everything!"" Bellicose female server with extreme antagonistic approach towards me.  Fine, I'll take the Tetley tea.

No. 1  $5.95
Two country fresh eggs served your favorite way with home fries, toast and Tetley black tea
With this aggressive, harsh, callous attitude the previous reviews are on point about the poor food quality and excessive poor customer service of horrible communication skills.  The eggs lack fluffiness in my choice of scrambled, the toast were the end pieces in the bread loaf bag with very minimal butter spread.  The toast were very burnt as the cook was not paying attention to the toaster which the bread shrank and no consideration that no one desires the end pieces in the bread loaf bag.  The home fries were average and the black tea was meh.  Price is the only good thing about Landmark as this diner is surely NO landmark endorsed.  I was never offered water as a basic amenity.  Servers are women who do not emit any warm welcoming sotto voce for a subtle segue entering morning to start the day.  Rushed and haphazard to serve customers without the genuine warmth of attentive service and sincere interest.  GIGO"
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-08-29,5.0,"The food was delicious. Thank you. I had a Greek salad with grilled chicken, chicken was cooked perfectly."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-11-05,1.0,"In short, today I was charged $6.95 per meal (13.90) plus $1.50 per coffee ($3), then the meal ended up costing $18.40 in total. YET, because I arrived before 11am, it should have been $5.95 per meal with coffee being included ($0), thus $11.90, round it up to $13 when you factor in tax. 
Being that I was overcharged $6.40 for the mediocore breakfast and very slow service, and I brought this to the attention of the waitress - who just stared blankly at me - I did not feel bad whatsoever walking away without leaving a tip.

This is the 2nd time that I have come here in the past year and this is the 2nd time I have been disappointed and have left upset. The 1st time I didn't have a good experience but I didn't want to leave a bad review for this place because I thought it was a cute little business in the area. However, I decided to give it a second chance today and for the 2nd time I was not happy. 
The 1st time I had an issue with the bill because I had ordered the pancake number 2 special which is supposed to come with coffee in addition to free refills. But when I got my bill I saw that I had been charged for blueberry pancakes, which are more expensive, and had been charged for 3 individual coffees. The waitress didn't want to correct the issue and I left angrily. This morning I got there before 11:00 a.m. and I was standing at the front waiting to be seated as a table finally became available. The pancakes I ordered were not good quality and the 2 on the bottom were actually a bit burnt. My partner had ordered his breakfast and even though he asked for whole wheat toast and the waitress repeated it he still got white toast. 
Then when we got the bill I noticed there was an issue again which I brought up to the waitress. I told her that we were charged for our coffees when they were supposed to come included with our breakfast. She said that we came in after 11 and that the coffees were not free even though I told her I would have ordered right away standing up by the front door had I known that she was going to charge extra. I even told her that when I asked for the breakfast special and pointed to the number 2 and the number 1 she claims that she said it was past 11 and I corrected her and told her that she never said anything of the sort. 
So considering that both times I have been here my order has been wrong or there has been a problem with over billing by 2 different waitresses have never tried to be helpful, I will never be returning here because the food is low quality even though it is cheap and you always have to look out for them over charging you on the bill."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-06-12,1.0,"This review is based off the service and attitude received from just inquiring for a 1st Grader's End-Of-The-School-Year's Breakfast party. 

Considering this place being around for a long time, I'd expect it had become many individual's go-to breakfast spot. I'm not trying to change minds or Sunday morning routines here. I walked in and waited at the register for the waitress who was, at the time, attending to several customers simultaneously. As soon as I got her attention, I asked how they would charge for two takeout sized containers of bacon or scrambled eggs. After some dialogue exchanges, she quoted me for the bacon but I still needed to find out their charge for scrambled eggs. She was the only waitress at the time so she had to leave at various points of the inquiry - which I understood, so I was patient about it. Unfortunately, that wasn't reciprocated. At a certain point, she continued to ramble on about how she needed to know how many strips of bacon I'd need, neglecting to hear my request for the eggs. My patience lasted me until then, ultimately, I walked out.

I believe inquiries are a good sign that your business is proven to be trustworthy and your food, lip-smackingly-good...enough. Unfortunately, your business can only get as good as your ability to keep your customers. I know I'm only speaking as one and it may seem insignificant, but I hope this serves as a reminder that every person that walks in is a potential customer."

146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-02-12,4.0,"Was there around Monday afternoon. It was very busy and due to some reason they only got one chef there so the wait is like 20 min, I was ok with it. I saw some recent negative reviews here about the Chinese waitress. What I wanna say about this is, I don't know her, but I think she was just doing her job and I think her English is limited so she wanted to use the minimum English to communicate with her customers and she is busy so u can't expect she spend lot of time to explain everything on a menu like high end place, come on this is a price friendly diner, why u guys expect $$$$ level of service while u are only paying $"
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-08-11,1.0,"Seriously, forget this place. The food is gross. The menu says 6.95 and then somehow we got a $36 bill? It's definitely not charming enough for that."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-05-19,4.0,"It's a very simple diner, your friendly neighborhood quick stop. Not many options to order from as compared to your normal diner but it's still good. As soon as I came in for lunch with a colleague, we were welcomed right away and we were told to sit wherever we wanted.
My colleague and I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with avocados and fries. It's literary two toast with lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, grilled chicken, and an avocado. It's simple, light, and quick. 

It's a taste of home to me since I'm from the Bronx. I work in Chinatown and the options are usually a variety of Asian food but all I really want is a simple sandwich and fries. This is the place is two minutes from Canal: you come in, relax, and see a diverse community."

146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-09-03,4.0,"This looks like a nice neighborhood spot. A few seats at the counter and a few tables.

They have Italian and Italian-American menu items.  I wanted a chicken parmigiana sandwich but they were out of sub rolls. I was told they could put it on pita but that is not right. I ordered a grilled Chicken Caesar salad.

While waiting for my food I had an interesting discussion with an older guy who recognized me as being from NYC from my accent  We were discussing how the area is now vs how it was in the 80's and earlier which just reminded of the event I just left trying to get people to return to Chinatown to live, work and raise families.

When my food was ready the kind lady at the counter let me know. I asked how much and was told $9. Not bad for Manhattan.

I initially thought there were no croutons but they all seemed to be under the romaine dressed already with Caesar dressing. The amount of dressing seemed a bit much and I don't recall seeing cheese in my salad as per menu description but I might be mistaken. The chicken was boneless and skinless breast cooked on the flattop. It was moist and tender."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-08-14,1.0,Ewww! Ordered Mexi omelet that was supposed to have cheddar cheese in it. They used American cheese slices. There was water in the Tapatio to thin it out & save a few pennies. The toast was stale and the avo in my omelet was super old and brown. The hash browns tasted like freezer burn. The rye bread was more like wonder bread. The fresh squeezed oj was watered down. With all of the awesome food in NYC I can't believe that people eat here or that it is still in business.
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-10-06,5.0,Absolutely one of the gems of Manhattan. The service is always on point - just know you'll get great food at a fair price.
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-08-28,1.0,"Shit hole, their food made me so sick, stay away. Rude service. I regret going to this place, they have no napkins. Food taste like garbage"
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-01-15,1.0,"Want garbage? Want hair with that too? 

I called and ordered ahead for lunch today just before 12:30pm but got there before they made my California wrap. I requested to have my wrap with mayo instead of honey mustard and took it back to the office. Took 3 bites of the wrap and found a piece of packaging from their turkey and then, a piece of hair. ENOUGH SAID, RIGHT?!"
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-03-10,4.0,"Great simple old diner food. Staff always welcoming & friendly. But the fun part is if you sit at the small counter you'll be treated to the best short order duo in the city. Nothing is written down just called out by the wait staff & they never miss a
beat. Can you make an omelette in about a minute and a half?"
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-03-22,4.0,"Honestly people like to think that they're above this place but where else are you going to find a fresh, warm, sit-down breakfast in the city for $6-8?

The ladies that work here are very no frills and can seem rushed, but given the prices here, I can understand why they want to keep the business going at a fast pace.

Breakfast ends at 11am, but even afterwards the prices aren't too bad. I like this place because it stays true to what it is and you know exactly what to expect when you enter."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-03-26,5.0,Heard stories of rich in NY on a Sat and this place lived up to the hype cooks cooking on small range wait staff yelling out orders and food is delicious.
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-11-11,4.0,"Pretty good food for a decent price. It's also the only dinner that you would find nearby in chinatown. Service is extra extra friendly. I pass by this place before work every morning and i have always been greeted with a smile. It's actually so infectious it makes your crummy days better. They have eggs, burgers, chicken, gyro, anything u can find in a diner."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2014-12-22,4.0,"This diner gives you exactly what you want and nothing more: great straightforward meals at decent prices, refills on coffee, chairs upholstered in plastic, and pictures of the food on the menu. Don't bother venturing too far beyond your two egg breakfast, pancakes, or BLT... you're here for the classics. 

Even though it's pretty dead during the week, you can expect to wait a bit for a chair on weekend mornings as it's one of the only diners like this in the area. Luckily the lady running the show is always on top of her shizz and will get people in and out with a quickness. 

Long live the greasy spoon!"
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-09-15,5.0,"Absolutely love this place ! I'm a regular here I always to eat in the mornings during my lunch break love it's always busy in the mornings it slows down in the afternoon. If you are looking looking forward to pay less this is the right place for you ! Prices are decent my favorite dish of them all is the double cheeseburger burger deluxe ! Which it has lettuce ,tomato lots of cheese ! And delicious French fries with a side of a pickle . This place been here for almost more then 15 years ! Do yourself a favor and come here with a smile on your face haha ."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-12-10,4.0,"Very old school diner. Been here forever. Lots of options on the menu and the service is fast. Everything tastes pretty fresh and the prices are great. There's enough seating and a counter as well. Lots of the locals as well as near city hall probably come here as well. Definitely give this place a go, the next time you're in the area."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-02-03,4.0,"For quick service, solidly good food and great (the best, actually) prices in SoHo/NoLIta...look no further than Landmark. 

This is your classic diner in New York City...but without any touristy flair. It's right out of the 70's/80's and hopefully will stay that way for many years to come. 

I can't recommend the French Toast enough (with 2 eggs over easy, bacon and coffee)! It'll get your day going just right...or provide a welcome rest from any shopping or neighborhood errands that need to be run. 

Check out their odd hours before hitting them up. I've been by often and found them closed."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-10-16,2.0,"The Greek salad is excellent. Do not order the eggs sunny side up if you value your intestines. An adequate place. Carry on with your bad self, Landmark."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-02-19,4.0,"Wanted to go to the brunch places around the area, but the waits were ridiculous. So my friends and I decided to go to this little old fashion diner. 

The service was quick and the food was solid! 
You can't go wrong with their omelettes and pancakes. Portions were perfect! 

OH! They have freshly squeezed OJ."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-09-17,1.0,"I ordered blueberry pancakes and got regular pancakes with a big pile of some excuse of blueberry filling ON THE SIDE. When you question them they act like you're crazy. Don't call yourself a pancake house. Long story short, Save your money. Go somewhere else."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-11-17,5.0,"Warm and welcoming. I have been going there in the mornings while out on a trip.   Was struck by the sense of community there.  Today a gentleman came in just to say good bye to the owners as he was moving to England. 

Amazing that they have that much impact on their customers. 

And they serve a great breakfast too!"
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-10-27,2.0,"They pre-added a 20% tip to our meal and did not label it on the bill. Only told me when I asked. They specifically wrote ""tax"" next to the tax and nothing next to the tip. The food is good and the service is fast. Too bad they don't run an honest business. If you are going to do that you have to label it."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-07-18,4.0,"Landmark is awesome. The menu has everything you'd want from a diner, prices are Chinatown low despite being on the border of SoHo, and the staff is very, very friendly (and fast). Landmark is a special little diner, don't miss out on it.

Full review at http://www.gothamdeluxe.com/diners/landmark/"
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-09-17,1.0,Gave it one star because service is pathetic. It says very clearly that they close at 6pm. I arrive at 4:15pm and they are closed !!!! Makes no sense !!!!
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-05-18,5.0,"Ok, so it's not classy nor sophisticated, but as a former native NY'er transplanted to Wisconsin, it immediately reminded me of one of our small town diners in my adopted state. No big deal. If you want classy (and expensive), there are other places in Soho you can go to. 

This place was across the street from my hotel (Solita) and the staff (long dark-haired ethnic waitress) was superb; so friendly and attentive. I dined there twice; that's how good the breakfast was. Most pretentious Soho'ers will not appreciate this joint, but if you are open-minded, you will."
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-08-31,5.0,I've been coming here since I was a little kid. I love the place and I'm glad that this place is still open. Food here is great and the pace of the food being made is fast.
146,landmark-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-03-04,1.0,"I just ate there today ($5 Grilled Cheese, $8.50 and OJ $3.50 the bill came to $44).  Doesn't add up.  Payer BEWARE!  The waitress there is dishonest and you should double check and question the tab.  NO GOOD!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-03-09,5.0,"Okay. So as I've mentioned in the past, I love iced lattes, and hanging at local coffee houses. Just last week I happened to come across this gem of a coffee house, with truly, what I feel is the best iced latte in NYC yet! I just had to come again to see if it was a one off kind of taste, but alas, it was just as good today as it was last week!!

Smooth, subtle and just the right amount of coffee flavoring! Let's not forget to mention the owner (Roberto) and his staff are very friendly, polite and professional; taking the time to engage with their customers individually! I'll be bringing the fam here next time in the area!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-02-28,2.0,"My reviews may come out a bit harsh but It's because I try to judge based on the food. This place earned one star because it was absolutely beautiful. From the interior to the (limited) seating to the large mirror on the wall, the ambiance is great. The barista was also sweet, pair this with the fact that they use wooden spoons and have liquid sugar for the coffee, its basically a recipe for success right?
Wrong.
Despite checking all the boxes about looking good this place lacked the most crucial aspect of a food serving establishment, taste. And I mean yes the coffee did look beautiful, the color of the blue coffee drink was fantastic, but the flavor of it was horrible. If I'm being honest It made me crave Starbucks. 
I'd love to go back but of the three drinks we ordered I couldn't stomach any of them, I can't with good conscience recommend this place, unless your thing is to take pictures and not actually enjoy the food."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-09-28,5.0,"Very nice barista!
I was wandering their signature drink, and he recommend few drinks, and answer my question very patiently.
I decide to get Mexican vanilla latte. 
It tasted so delicious!!  very smooth texture and hit sweet of vanilla flavor. Balance perfectly
Definitely going back to try other flavor!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-09-15,4.0,"Such a delightful lazy sunday morning treat! I really think this place is 5 star quality: service, atmosphere, quality, location, unique, simple, and honest. I'm giving 4.5 stars for the food offering: I'd like to have a few more snack options. So, there is room to grow and I look forward to coming back again & again. 

But! It's important to note that there drink colors are natural, not dyes (green tea leaves, turmeric, beet, butterfly pea tea...) and that this place really strives to offer accessible & inclusive options. For $20 we had two unique lattes that tasted healthy and two tamales--expensive, yes. But like... Pretty par for the course in NYC when you consider the soft benefits of having really enjoyable customer service, a beautiful & bright cafe ambiance, an accessible location/sitting, and a memorable meal. 

There are many milky creamy drink options, including almond & oat milks. The tamales go above & beyond with gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian options. And the drink colors are really this vibrant! They are fun and delicious; especially for people who like more bitter hot drinks!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-01-01,4.0,"Went here in the late afternoon to kill some time, and it was the perfect little spot for a cozy drink on a rainy day. The barista/owner was super nice and explained the menu..I got the horchata latte and my gf got the blue matcha latte with macadamia milk (no caffeine). Total was about $10, which is normal for the area. My only complaint was that my latte had a somewhat sour aftertaste. I wasn't sure if it was because of the rice milk, but it made the drink taste slightly weird. I'd recommend swapping out for regular milk for the horchata latte. Still giving the place 4 stars because service was excellent, my gf's drink was delicious, and we easily spent 1.5 hours here just hanging out as the cafe was otherwise empty."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-03-17,5.0,Lovely place and the deep blue latte is delicious. I came another time and tried the tamales and those were excellent as well.
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,"I usually go to Ninth Street Espresso since it's so close to my apt, but I decided to take a stroll on Sunday to Future You Café and I am so glad I did! I ordered a latte and one sip blew me away. The espresso they use is delicious and it tastes strong - who doesn't like their espresso strong?! 

The barista and the counter person were really nice, and I thought the café was super cute! Definitely coming back."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-01-31,5.0,"I had a double DULCE DE LECHE and a vegan pumpkin bread. I really loved the unique options at this place. My wife recommended it to me, and we went together to check it out. I'll be coming back to try their other signature drinks, for which they're building a reputation. Great barista and efficient service!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-09-07,5.0,"If you're in the area, I definitely recommend checking out this shop out. The staff is insanely kind and friendly and had all the patience in the world. 

My friend tried the Mayan hot chocolate and I got the pumpkin spice horchata latte and we both loved it!

The chocolate chip scone was absolutely delicious."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-03-11,4.0,"Friendly staff and interesting menu .
Tried the Heart Latte (beetroot) it's new it's weird in a good way it's different, will def come back to explore other colored latte.!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-02-29,5.0,"Munching on tasty tamales and some very unique Mexican coffee drinks that I haven't found anywhere else in NY. Love the space and chill atmosphere! Lovely decor, friendly staff, will definitely come back!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-08-17,3.0,"The service here is wonderful, but the drink I got was probably one of the worst drinks I've had. 

I got their Pink Horchata Latte, and it tasted like mouthwash. It has a minty taste that is too overwhelming. I took one sip and couldn't finish my drink. 

Hoping that the other drinks are better; their classics are probably not bad, but stay away from the pink horchata latte."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-06-02,4.0,"I've had my eye on this café for awhile and finally got the chance to pop by this Saturday afternoon.
I think business is rather slow cause there were two workers, relaxed behind the counter, and only one customer in the store. The café is decently sized so that it can sit about 15 people max with tables/counters and chairs on the sides of the store. I really like the decor especially that neon sign and overall look of the café is comforting. Would be a good place to chill with a friend or when one needs that quiet time (I think there was soft jazz music playing in the background).

The menu is rather extensive, but I didn't quite make up my mind on what I wanted so I just ordered the deep blue latte on the whim. I got it cold and with soy milk. The taste was not that sweet and just rather milky. I think the main attraction of the drink was the aesthetic blue color. 
However, I would like to give another shot to their signature drinks they have on the menu because they sound great and unique!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-03-11,5.0,"Really delicious and interesting drinks like Horchata, plus they do a good flat white and chai. All can be hot or cold. The owner, Roberto, is very friendly.
Delicious food too like Mexican tamales, Balthazar pastries and black seed bagels.
Free WiFi for an hour at a time (which is fair in my opinion). Comfortable seating for individuals and pairs."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,"Warm friendly vibe, clean and thoughtful space. This cafe is well run and charming! Come through and support them"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-03-23,5.0,"My boyfriend and I were walking around east village and we stumbled across this cute cafe and decided to go in for a drink. The interior is super cute, and the staffs were also very friendly. We ordered a blue matcha latte and it was amazing! Would highly recommend this drink and I would definitely come back to try their other drinks, they all sound super good!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-09-30,5.0,"The only place where (well so far) that I can get a blue colored latte, without having almond milk in it. I have gone to a few places where blue colored lattes are pre-made with almond milk (which sucks because I am allergic to almonds). I ordered the Blue Matcha Latte (latte with Butterfly Pea blossom tea with Macademia Nut milk... how much more exotic can it be?). It tasted very similar to vanilla, a light note of nuttyness from the milk. My only question is how is it a matcha latte, if the description on the site doesn't mention matcha? Anyways, I would say this place is pretty small and seats do sort of fill up, but with where it is located, I can see why there are limited seats. Definitely would come back again and maybe try the heart latte."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-01-07,4.0,"Cute, clean coffee shop with really friendly staff! The design on their cups is also really cute!
I got a cappuccino, which had excellent foam on top! Also love how many drink toppings they have, and that they use wooden utensils. Will definitely go back next time Im near Tompkins Square Park!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-01-21,5.0,"Nice little new café on E 17th St. Its bright, clean, and quiet. I got the wellness blue matcha latte which is made with butterfly pea blossom tea and milk. It is caffeine free. The only small problem is that there weren't homemade pastries. There are some snacks but seems like are orde"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-02-28,5.0,"Wonderful little coffee shop, the staff is so friendly and the ambiance is perfect. Love sitting in the window to people watch."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-01-19,4.0,Stopped by here on a Sunday morning for a oat milk latte and almond croissant. Lots of people working on laptops in the seating area. The latte was what one would expect! The almond croissant was not the best I've had but overall not bad. I would swing by here again if in the area.
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-06-17,5.0,The owners and staff are so nice. Explained all of the drinks for me. I ordered the horchata latte and loved it! It's made with rice milk not condensed milk thank goodness. Awesome coffee shop in the neighborhood! And lovely pastries
147,future-you-café-new-york,2020-01-25,5.0,"I came here on Friday, and there was bit of a line. I ordered the Mexican Vanilla Latte which was recommended by the very friendly barista, and it was really amazing. The vibe is pretty chill, and I would definitely go back again!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-07-31,5.0,"Great vibe, cozy, comfy, great selection of Mexican-themed coffees, plus chai, macha etc. Found this place by luck when our original choice had insufficient A/C for a hot summer day, and we'll be back."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-04-28,4.0,"Such a cute little cafe! This was located right by our airbnb so we were able to come here every morning before our days full of sightseeing. The owner is so nice and you can tell he really enjoys what he's doing and has such pride what he offers. Their coffee is consistently delicious and their horchata latte is even better. I also sampled their tri-colour shortbread cookie and it went perfectly with my latte. I'm going to be sad that tomorrow will be my last visit with them... until next time, that is."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-04-20,5.0,"I literally never write reviews but Roberto and Ellie literally made my day by letting me try macadamia milk for the first time!!! I got the turmeric latte and was mind blown again!! SO. GOOD. And caffeine free!! They were so kind and patient with me, I had such a great experience herr!!! Wish I could move to NYC for this cafe!!!!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-09-07,5.0,Delicious Mayan hot chocolate! Lovely atmosphere and really nice staff. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a chill place to hang out and grab a snack.
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-03-21,5.0,"Cute little coffeeshop. The iced pink horchata latte tastes pretty good and has a fun tint to it. Also, tried the Nido, a Mexican pastry which was delicious. The outside is a crust, but the inside is what really takes the cake for me - moist, fluffy and sweet. 

Overall, I feel like the variety of pastries and signature drinks here seem unique and I want to come back and try some more. The manager is super helpful and friendly, loving the hospitality!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-11-15,4.0,"Excellent cappuccino.  Enough space that you're not sitting on top of your neighbors. Nice, quiet music in the background (this is MUCH appreciated!) Very good service."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-11-10,5.0,"I'm in the area visiting friends and this was by far the best place to meet and catch up with them. Cozy atmosphere, great coffee, fantastic service. Would definitely recommend it!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-07-23,5.0,Super-cute little coffee shop.  Plenty of seating and my latte was delicious.  They have some pastries and I tried something called Nido.  It was really lovely and unique.  Crunchy on the outside and soft and yummy inside.  There was plenty of room to sit and I will certainly be back soon.
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-11-03,5.0,"The staff is sooooo friendly, and the atmosphere of the cafe is so cute. We came here for some quick bagels with cream cheese and we loved every minute of it. From the food to the service, all around a wonderful time!!"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-08-02,5.0,Great place to get together over coffee or to get some work done. Cute and spacious interior with plenty of seating. The decor of the Café with the neon sign and overlook was comforting. The Place got pretty busy in the morning but it still didn't get to crowded which was great. They had a great selection of coffee and pastries. I tried the Latte and chocolate croissant which were both delicious! Service was very friendly and my order didn't take too long to come out which was nice.
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-02-16,5.0,"Very nice owner and delicious coffee. He was very nice and cordial because the latte was taking a little longer than usual. 

Could tell he had a lot of respect for his craft and customers."
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-10-13,5.0,I came here on a Sunday Morning around 10 and the staff was very kind. They just got a latte art machine! They are running a promo to get custom art added to a latte at no additional cost. I got the Mexican vanilla latte.. the machine was cool but probably works better on a normal latte. The latte tastes great too! Excited to find this spot.
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-03-02,5.0,"Such a cute little spot with unique coffees that you won't find anywhere else! I had the Mayan Mocha and would highly recommend it. They also have every type of milk so if you have any dairy restrictions, you're safe here. 

WiFi available 
Delicious coffee 
Natural light 
Cute and cozy"

I order a latte matcha it was perfection"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-07-02,5.0,"Great spot! Nice owner and staff, good coffee. No loud music playing so you can actually relax or focus on work. Will look forward to future visits"
147,future-you-café-new-york,2019-07-26,5.0,"Decided to try this place after seeing it a couple of times and it's really good! The inside is bright, clean, and quiet. The owner/manager was very helpful in helping me choose a drink that suits my tastes. He also was very accommodating and made sure everything was to my liking. They have a variety of milk alternatives and their menu is unique. I tried the Mayan Mocha iced and it was the very creamy and chocolatey with a hint of spice. So good. Definitely plan on coming here again!"

148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2020-03-10,4.0,"Are you staying (visiting or living) on the lower east side? If so, the Essex Marketplace is a must see, and more importantly, a great bagel from Davidovich should be on your list. They also have some great sandwich options for lunch time and a handful of sweets. 

However, my top reason for visiting Davidovich is definite for a morning bagel.  A friend, who is a local, says they pricing is just bit high, but I actually thought it was very reasonable for the area.  Go ahead an pay with a card, and you are automatically connected to their rewards program. I got a $2 off coupon for the second visit I ever made there.  

I prefer an everything bagel, and theirs did not disappoint.  The staff was friendly, responsive, and the food was good. How can you go wrong with that."

Cute place in Essex Market that serves bagels, muffins, cookies, etc.  Only like 6 stools to sit and eat so it's mostly take with you.  We just had the bagels and they were really good NY bagels.  Essex Market seems like a cool place to check out and grab breakfast/lunch."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2019-06-18,3.0,"Davidovich is the bagel + schmear joint in Essex Market. it's on the Essex / Broome side. 

the space is fairly big. huge display of bagels,  baked goods (cakes, muffins, and more), and more. there are some stools and ledge tables. it's fairly clean area despite high-foot traffic. 

got the rugelach (3 for $2.75). apricot, raspberry, and chocolate are the flavor choices. the rugelach was fairly average. the chocolate and apricot barely had any flavor and the raspberry had a little bit more flavor than the other two. overall, if you want a treat i'd get something else. 

the service is fast and friendly. 

overall, Davidovich is a decent option but there's so much good food in Essex Market to explore. still it's a solid option but that's about it.

148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2019-06-16,5.0,"I crave good bagels and will travel miles to get one.
Having lived in New York for many years I know a good bagel when I find one, similar to truly good pizza.

While visiting the Tenement Museum across the street I saw this place out of the corner of my eye. The window with bagels made me clamor for one and run through traffic to get it.

We bought a couple of everything bagels. Since we were getting them to have later we did want a schmear, and they were so accommodating to give us a small container just for the two bagels.  We were thankful not to have to buy a large container.

Well we toasted the bagels later, applied the schmear and it was EXCEPTIONAL!  A real New York bagel.  The texture and taste was perfect. It is obvious that the way they are specially prepared makes all the difference.

If in New York go out of your way to get a truly great bagel."

148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2020-03-09,4.0,"A NYC institution: if you're craving delicious bagels then come to their flagship store inside Essex Street Market. The market in and of itself is worth a visit. The market completed a massive renovation in May 2019 and has provided the lower east side with affordable high quality produce and goods since 1888 (it was originally an outdoor pushcart market). You could easily spend an hour or two browsing vendors that range from butcheries, Peruvian food to ice cream. I'm pretty certain you'll find a vendor to satisfy your craving(s). Don't forget to check out the vendors located downstairs. Davidovich offers $2 off any order on your birthday valid for several months, you just need to subscribe to their mailing list."

I noticed there were quite a few customers and they all seemed like regulars. I'm thinking the food here has got to be pretty tasty. Tried the spinach feta pastry and some of their croissants. Gotta say, it was all pretty good! The prices are a bit on the higher end but you're paying for quality and taste. I think I may just end up being a regular."

Second time(9/7) I came in ordered an ice tea and was charged $2.72(paid with debit card). The third time which is today, I went in and ordered an ice tea, expecting to pay the same as before and was told it's $3 cash and was told the credit card machine does not work. I kept on asking her for a receipt, she didn't write one until another customer said something. 

I don't know if it's me or something is fishy here.

Note the 1st and 3rd visit was a lady cashier. The 2nd visit was a male cashier."

148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2019-08-31,1.0,"Pastries, although priced as if they were from a gourmet bakery, are basically the level of those you'd find on a Residence Inn free breakfast buffet. Just go get a Twinkie and save yourself the trouble (and the $4)."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2019-07-31,1.0,"I've been going to this bakery for the past 3 years and always had a good experience. However since they moved to the new Essex Market  I've witness and experienced terrible customer service. The owner should really take time to observe their workers interaction with the customers, it's disgusting. Half the time the girls working there are in a terrible mood, and project that attitude towards the customer. I recently stopped going and recommend you take a walk a little further to Heaven's Hot Bagels."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2019-05-19,1.0,"Orders here take far too long.

You'll die of starvation--or, more likely--move on to another place--long before you get your sandwich.

Not worth the wait."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2018-03-18,4.0,"Davidovich Bakery is a small bakery located on the heart of Chelsea Market, standing out on its own as the only place running the bagels. While the service was nothing breath-taking or spectacular, but rather odd and disorganized, it all felt a little too light on the customer service efforts of all three of its crew.

However, who I can only consider was Mr Davidovich himself, recommended I get the everything bagel shortly after asking him to ""give me something good."" The everything bagel, ""which has everything on it,"" as I was reassured, was served with cream cheese on it, after a light but perfect toasting.

Short to say, the bagel was gratifying. Whatever this bakery lacks in customer attention, it surely makes up in its evocative bagel. A tender and notable outer crunch with a soft and slightly tender interior, all wrapped up and displayed with a perfect cream cheese that automatically makes you crave the next bite. It was inevitable that every single person who passed me by had two different but connected thoughts:
1) he is really enjoying that, and
2) I want some as well."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2019-05-24,5.0,"We wanted lox bagels and cream cheese from Russ and Daughters, but it was PACKED, so we went to Davidovich. Then we realized that both companies source their Lox from the same place (Acme Smoked Fish in Brooklyn) and that the Davidovich bagels look better AND that the price is lower.

We think we won on every front. no lines. lower prices. same fish. Better bagels. 

five stars."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2019-08-10,1.0,"Really good food but the rudeness of the employees was off the charts (and I grew up in Brooklyn). Charged $2.95 extra for a paltry amount of tofu cream cheese. I'm a woman of a certain age and for probably only the third time in my life, I didn't add a tip. Next time I'll go to Kossar's."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2016-04-07,3.0,"Aw hate to say this, but I was disappointed! For the same price, I could get the same thing in Ventura except with way more smoked salmon and capers. I literally had at most 5 capers in my bagelwich. Hate to break the recent hype of this place but this is my opinion :(

Bagel itself tasted same as California. Our layover in New York on our way to Puerto Rico had some better bagels in the airport. The bagel wasn't as toasted as I'd liked, and she asked if I wanted it toasted! 

I feel capers add so much flavor to the bagel and I love them so I was so sad to find so little capers in my bagelwich! 

She was VERY generous on cream cheese, which, eh. Cream cheese is cream cheese. I'd rather have way more of the capers or smoked salmon, as that's definitely more bang for your buck!

I was able to get free coffee with check in. There are I think three tables right in front for seating. But this place is located inside the Essex market! It's on a corner. I love markets so it's always fun to walk around and see the variety of things you can find. 

But in conclusion, paying $8.60 for a Lox bagel was not worth it here. Now I'm more than happy to pay the same for that place back at home!"
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2018-06-09,5.0,"Love this place!! A staple of the Essex street market, but I hadn't had the chance to visit it yet, as I usually go to Ni instead. River was super friendly and gave great service. Bagels are HUGE, as well as super fresh, and I love that they carry tofu cream cheese. Delicious, a great pick me up, and a must visit for anyone stopping by the Lower East Side early in the morning!"
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2018-12-18,3.0,"This bakery is located in the Essex street market in the back corner. We order their bagels with plain cream cheese. I'm no bagel expert but I felt it tasted like any other deli bagel. Didn't get a chance to try the pastries which maybe better.They serve eggs now but the only breakfast sandwich you can get is bagel with egg and cheese. The worker can only do one order at a time so I don't recommend going in a larger group with everyone wanting toasty bagels. I didn't really feel the cashier was very kind considering how slow it was. There were also some specialty bagels worth trying however, I don't see myself going out of my way to get their bagels still a good eat."

Their bagels are an example of the New York bagel that you want! 

I haven't tried any of their speciality sandwiches other than their Lox with Cream Cheese but if the bagel is good, I don't need much more than that and maybe some cream cheese!

Tip: There's a reward card... after every 7th bagel or coffee you get a free one!"

it took me a few minutes to finally find this place

CRONUT
I had no idea what it was but the friendly server said just try it
it was pure decadence in a handheld treat
round like a donut
flaky like a croissant 
covered with maple frosting and custard filling
oh yummy day"
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2016-04-24,5.0,"I ordered a L.E.S., which has lox, cream cheese, capers, and onions on an onion bagel. It was delicious and a great start for the morning. If you check-in with the app it will include a FREE cup of coffee. Yeah, FREE!! It's located inside Essex Market. I adore the variety of bagels shown on the window side of the shop, the selections of carbohydrates are too good to pass up."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2014-07-11,3.0,"Clearly I'm in the minority here but I wasn't impressed by Davidovich.

I got the Essex Sandwich (tuna, red peppers, shallots, dill, lemon and olive oil) on an everything bagel. There was way too much dill which overpowered the flavor of the tuna. The bagel was nothing special either. It cost about $8 which is expected for a specialty bagel sandwich."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2016-04-04,4.0,This was the first stop of our food tour and I really enjoyed the bagel here. We ordered a cream cheese with lox on an everything bagel. Check-in with Yelp and they throw in a free cup of coffee too. It's located inside Essex Market (which I would have never known until someone brought me here). Cute place all the way to the left inside the market.
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2014-10-20,4.0,"Do you know how hard it can be to find a freshly made bagel on a Sunday after 2pm?  Many of my local bakeries are out of them by that time, but Davidovich didn't let me down.  They were out of coffee and about half of the flavors they normally have in stock, but they still had Egg, Onion, Cinnamon Raisin, Plain, Whole Wheat, and a couple other bagels and we were still hungry for a good smear and toasted bagel.  I also appreciated the tables and seats inside the Essex Market on a really cold day.

I went with the Onion Bagel since they were out of Everything at the time.  The bagel is the really dense and doughy kind- not full of air pockets.  They seem to put the cream cheese on one side and then sandwich it together, but they put a generous enough portion that if you like to eat your bagel by the quarter or half, there's still plenty of cream cheese to go around.  The veggie cream cheese had some nice sized chunks of carrot, scallion, and peppers.  The cream cheese itself is smooth and slightly more spreadable than it is stiff- light in density and not too sour or sweet.

Today I went back and tried the Cinnamon Raisin bagel with their special honey walnut cinnamon cream cheese- a sweet pairing and this time the cream cheese was a bit more dense and much more sweet (but that was due to the honey, I'm sure.)

For around $5 I had a breakfast of iced coffee and bagel w/ special cream cheese- a great deal considering nearby places may charge $4 just for iced coffee alone.

The yelp reviews for Davidovich actually led me to exploring the entire Essex Market, which I hadn't done before- so kudos for great reviews!"
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2017-09-03,1.0,Got an LES on everything flat... This is an embarrassment to any establishment selling bagels. They should stick to their baked goods and nothing else. There was not even a quarter pound of lox on this bagel. I may as well have asked for a bagel with lettuce and a side of lox. Not worth anyone's money or time. Also they forgot to put red onion.
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2015-12-25,4.0,"A LES on a wheat everything bagel is the perfect cure for a rainy, gloomy day in NYC. After seeing the longest line EVER in front of Russ + Daughters, my friend and I decided to check out Davidovich Bakery since it also got rave reviews on Yelp. Can't say that I didn't miss that caviar cream cheese a la Russ + Daughters, but that LES definitely helped satisfy my bagel craving. The bagel was toasty and the portion of lox was more than generous. I only wish that there had been slightly more cream cheese. The capers also didn't seem to be the freshest. Aside from those two things, however, the LES was delicious and I gobbled up every bite."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2016-02-20,4.0,"An awesome bagel shop, operator by 2 people. Well that little stall is only big enough to fit 2 thus making service a tad slow but it was worth the wait.

Try the LES! Any choice of bagel with the fresh made cream cheese with assorted toppings and also the yummy salmon.

The portion is big but with the prices you get what you paid for."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2016-04-03,3.0,"I'm a bagel snob and a patriotic American. It pains me to say that I love Canadian bagels better lol. 

This place was first on my Lower East Side food tour since it was breakfast. I haven't been to this specific section of LES so it was a nice surprise to stumble upon the market...most vendors weren't open yet since it was early. 

I reviewed the menu and was excited to try some famous nyc bagels. For some reason, i think i ordered the LES but what i was the East Village lol. My bagel = everything, hummus, sprouts, tomato, onion. Whatever that sandwich is, that's what i got. 

I thought the bagel wasn't fresh. It was toasted, but it was dense..kinda like it was a day old or so. It made it difficult to bite into. The hummus was ok, a bit tangy for my taste but the overall ingredient would work well on regular sandwich bread. The everything bagel wasn't the best i've had. I wish it was loaded up on a lot more spices. 

If i'm in the area, i'll stop by to try it once more. But this time, i'll keep it simple and order just a bagel. I'll be sure to ask when it was baked too."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2016-08-04,5.0,"Really nice breakfast spot inside Essex street market which focuses on bagels and a few sweet treats.

The bakery has a great variety of bagels for such a small shop with eggs or cheeses as options. 

I ordered the veggie omelette with a toasted whole wheat everything bagel. A few minutes later (under five), the bagel was ready.

Steamy hot, with melting cheese inside. The eggs where mixed with a good amount of veggies and did not loose any fluffiness. The portion was really well sized as well.

The bagel was one of the best I've had around. Good skin from being toasted, heavy yet soft bread underneath. Plenty of seeds and grains on the bagel. Good flavor all the way through. 

The bagel is about 8$ (comes with a bottle of water, coffee or tea). Comparing it to other top and comparable bagel shops, I think this price is very reasonable. 

Would recommend for a nice breakfast. Note, that section of Essex market is really cold due to the AC unit near by. It didn't bother me all that much when eating that hot omelette bagel though."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2016-03-13,4.0,"yummy! my first time at this small bagel shop inside Essex street market. Came here for a to-go bagel but they have some tables and seating as well. simple selection of bagels but lots of different bagel types - sesame, poppy, everything, wheat, plain etc. I got their LES Bagel - lox, lettuce, cream cheese, capers, red onions, tomato. I thought it tasted great, their lox is very fresh (nothing is as good as Russ and Daughters), their red onions were delightfully sweet and they gave me a thick layer of cream cheese. Great price and I checked in on Yelp and got a free Coffee as well (they give you a large cup too!)

it wasn't out of this world amazing but it's a solid bagel for satisfying bagel cravings without the long lines! and I must agree with other reviews, come here for the bagel and go to Russ and daughters for the cream cheese, salmon and fillings - it would make the perfect combo"
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2016-04-05,5.0,"Best bagels & breakfast from our whole trip to the city. Fast & EXTREMELY fresh bagels piled high with smoked salmon & the perfect schmear of cream cheese. I kind of think the razor thin slices of onion brought it all together. This is the kind of food that makes you sad to head home. 

Tip: order the LES, coffee, & o.j. (tastes fresh squeezed). It's enough to feed two people but you won't want to share. 

Better than any other bakery, brunch, or breakfast joint. Hands down."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2015-06-14,3.0,"Seating was limited, and the girl working the register wasn't friendly. Also, they should keep serving omelettes past noon especially on Sundays. And my iced coffee didn't have enough ice and she only offered to put milk and not sugar. Those are the only negative things I have to say.

The bagel was delicious- fresh, soft and not too chewy and not too toasted. It had a good balance of everything (everything bagel)... The salmon was fresh and was good quality- I hate when it's stringy and hard to bite into without it getting stuck in your teeth. I had the LES on a whole wheat everything bagel."
148,davidovich-bakery-new-york-2,2018-09-03,2.0,ordered from postmates and they completely messed up our order. only gave us one of two cappucinos and forgot the chocolate croissant. the bagels are good but the attention to detail seems to  be completely lacking. will definitely go elsewhere for my bagels in the future.

149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2020-05-14,5.0,"I'm not a big breakfast person, but on terrible and/or slightly hungover workdays, my favorite mid-morning indulgence was always Bread and Spread's breakfast sandwich (ciabatta, bacon, cheddar, with arugula, tomato, and extra hot sauce) and a cold brew. This is the best upgraded breakfast sandwich that money can buy - especially in DUMBO, where I count Sweetgreen as a 'cheap' lunch option. Definitely not your standard bodega BEC, but if you're looking for something slightly extra ('slightly extra': the title of my memoir), this is the one. Now that we are all homebound, this is no longer a local option for me, but I honestly think about walking 90 minutes to get one sometimes. 

Also, one time I was here and one of the employees was giving out samples of gluten-free banana bread she had baked (which sadly, they weren't selling by the slice). This banana bread was so good I would occasionally walk by just to look in the window and see if they had any. I never encountered it again, but maybe when the world reopens I'll have more luck??? 

Anyway, the moral of this story is that if you are close enough to get takeout or delivery from Bread and Spread, you 100% should - and I will live vicariously through your meal."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2020-03-12,4.0,"Update: They changed their bread! The ciabatta used to be so great...now it's chewy and too thick and tastes less...good. This is sad news. Taking a star off since I staked my reputation on that bread. Sigh.  

I've lived in Bushwick, East Williamsburg, Park Slope, FiDi, and Hudson Yards. In every neighborhood, my first port of call was to find my local breakfast sandwich. But let me tell you, of all the ones I tried there is no breakfast sandwich that compares to this one. Look -- I know it's not a bagel -- but this bread is so tasty, fresh, airy, and crisp. You need to open your horizons here about the bagels,okay? This place is the best. It is so worthy that I want no one to know about it. But I'm willing to hold the selfishness at bay just this once. The people deserve to know.
Go."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2020-01-15,5.0,"Great place, great food, and would love to visit again when I'm back in Brooklyn. 

This is what I want from local restaurants!!! SIMPLE IS GOOD. Went for a breakfast sandwich- the simplicity of ingredients and loved the kick of aji verde spread on a ham sandwich. That's creativity. Was in town for five days and went to so many restaurants but I think this place is only place I would give five stars.

149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-09-05,5.0,"We found this gem after we visited the flea market. We were looking everywhere for cheaper food and we were so discouraged by the smell from one of the restaurants in the area. 

When we were almost giving up, we came across their door and thought they are closed because the door wasn't huge and super welcoming. BUT!!!! We went in anyway because we have no self control and too curious. SO GLAD we weren't too shy to go in because we would have missed such an amazing little restaurant. There's not much option but a few good ones are already good enough. Everything sound very good so even though there's not a ton of options, I still had a hard time choosing. 

We ended up getting the beef short rib with blueberry jam and arugula. I was a little iffy in the beginning because I'm not a big fan of the peppery/bitter taste of arugula but it works! It works so damn well. Me and my bf are foodies and we are not easy to satisfy. But this sandwich hit all the right places and we left full, happy, and very very satisfied."

I got the porchetta sandwich on ciabatta bread and man the word ""sandwich"" does not do what I ate justice. It was a MONSTER of a sandwich overstuffed with a generous serving of porchetta, perfectly pickled onions, arugula and a divine peppercorn jam. The bread was toasted, warm and pillowy in texture -- something I never usually am impressed with by sandwich shops. The flavors were well balanced and rich with every bite. I split the sandwich with my boyfriend and, despite coming in extremely hungry, we both left extremely satisfied and full. 

For $13, we basically had two meals and this was conveniently 5 minutes away from the Brooklyn Flea Market. So worth it!"
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2020-01-18,5.0,Delicious and fresh ingredients. Really fast  service.  They gave me no grief for customizing. I ordered the multigrain for health despite the delicious looking white bread beckoning. It waS shocking soft and satisfying the way you wouldn't expect it to be

The sandwich was quite large for the price, and I was left feeling full and satiated for hours. The staff were also very nice, and accommodating to any dietary restrictions, and minor substitutions. I also enjoyed a cup of coffee from here which was also very good. If you are looking for the best egg sandwich in Brooklyn, and quite likely all of New York, I highly recommend coming here."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2018-10-08,4.0,"Solid sandwich joint with large, fresh options. For a bit over $10 you get a filling, flavorful lunch. Mine actually lasted two lunches, for me. 

I had the porchetta, with a generous amount of fatty pork belly inside. The ciabatta bread was nice, as well as the slightly bitter greens. It was a bit heavy for me, but they do have some lighter veggie or chicken sandwiches that seem delicious. The breakfast egg sandwich seems like a great deal."

149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-09-01,5.0,"I'm normally not the biggest fan of breakfast sandwiches but ho boy, I'll make an exception for this one. Eggs were absolutely perfect, sauce worked perfectly (I got the aji verde, highly recommend), and bread was great. And the whole thing only came out to 5.50! You can't get a better deal than that. Definitely planning on coming back here the next time I'm in the area."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-04-29,4.0,"Would have loved to try their meat sandwiches, but keep in mind those are only available after 11:30am! They grill their own meat and that requires time to rest the meat etc. Because I came here too early, I opted for their breakfast sandwiches which were also great and delicious. They have several bar seating and two dining tables, but most customers get their food to go. I think this place is worth a visit if one is visiting the DUMBO area.

Only problem I had here was that the cashier taking my order was a bit rude and unapproachable. She was frustrated with a previous big order and just didn't seem to care how she was coming off."

Good vibes, All employees are very friendly really ""FRIENDLY""!! 

Visited this place everytime before go in the city. They never let me down with everything i reviewed."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-04-07,5.0,"The Bear (sub turkey bacon) is my absolute favorite sandwich in Brooklyn, but this charming sandwich shop in DUMBO has an amazing, well planned and well executed selection of sandwiches on offer.

An excellent place to grab a bite to-go, walk two blocks, and enjoy it on the water overlooking manhattan."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2018-12-20,5.0,"Was in DUMBO the other week, it was lunchtime, and we were in the mood for sandwiches. Bread & Spread's sandwiches are exceptional, the menu simple, the service quick. I appreciate that they only have a handful of sandwiches to choose from; it allows for ease of choice for the customer. The ones we tried were: 

PORCHETTA~ Pork belly sandwich; pork belly was tasty, the pickled onions and arugula counterbalanced the pork, while the provolone and red pepper spread tied everything together nicely.

BEEF SHORT RIB~ Gingered shallot was nice, but the blackberry jam spread was an interesting touch that I liked. It added an extra dimension to the sandwich, I still remember the sandwich for the moistness of the beef and the blackberry jam. Yup.

I believe the other sandwiches were chicken, turkey, and something vegetarian; and I'm sure they're really good, too. Even for a more ""modern"" sandwich counter (especially in a place like DUMBO), they're priced really fairly (around $12-13 for a sandwich) and you'll leave satisfied. Good place!"
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2018-12-07,5.0,"Bread and Spread is my new favorite lunch spot in the neighborhood. I know this restaurant has existed here for a few years tucked away and hidden inside of the building next door, but it was only after their move to a standalone storefront that I visited. Still, the place is relatively hidden from street view, so you may walk right past it without discovering this gem.

I've been twice now, each time getting one of their specialty sandwiches from the menu above the counter. The first time, I grabbed the Tuscan Roast Turkey sandwich which includes moist sliced turkey, crispy onions, and a delicious cranberry mustard on a toasted hero. This was right around Thanksgiving so it hit all the right nostalgic spots, also well balanced with the fats of the meat, sweetness and a little sour from the mustard, and crispy saltiness from the onions.

The next time I went I tried their Beef Short Rib sandwich and my life was changed! Short rib, gingered shallot, blackberry jam, swiss cheese, all on a sourdough roll, this master creation was perfect in every way. My new favorite sandwich in the city.

Reasonably priced for the neighborhood, and exceedingly delicious, do yourself a favor and go find Bread & Spread."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-06-17,5.0,"Hands down Best Sandwich Maker in Town.
Best Bread, and chicken caprese is my favorite. Ask for extra spicy.

149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2018-11-20,5.0,"Bread and spread is tucked away in the cutest part of Brooklyn, Dumbo. It's very close to the Brooklyn Bridge Park and the pedestrian walkway. The area is fun for shopping, sights and Instagram photos! 

This sandwich shop is small and cozy. It offers bar stools and small tables around a open style kitchen. The menu has 5 signature sandwiches. I tried the porchetta, it was great! I really enjoyed the toasted bun and pork belly, mixed with the sweetness of the pickled onions. They ran out of ciabatta bread (my fav) but the cook assured me the sandwich would be just as good on a multigrain roll. Not only did he trick me into eating healthier but he also didn't lie, the sandwich was melt in your mouth gooooddd. 

My sandwich costed $13 which was a bit pricey for me but worth every penny. They had a corner of the shop dedicated to coffee, which I really loved the look of. Made me feel like they made a mean coffee. 

I would definitely recommend this sandwich place if you're looking for a savory, healthy and quick lunch spot ! Thanks Bread and Spread for a great date spot ! I'll be back!"
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-01-23,5.0,"Quite possibly the most perfect Beef short rib sandwich on the planet (or at least in Brooklyn) This quaint sandwich shop tucked politely in the shoulder of Dumbo, right off Jay street, crushes the sandwich game with killer combos of meat and cheese topped with the ever so delicate fancy bread of your choice. I know what your going to say 

""More than ten bucks for a sandwich, you got to be kidding me!"" but with the rent in dumbo more than the budget of some cities, these tasty treats are worth every penny. After drink and a bag of chips at another place you're spending the about the same amount anyways. 

So if you are in the area and interested in eating a sandwich truly a cut above the rest the go get some spread on your bread."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-08-03,5.0,Walked by after working out in DUMBO today on my way back to York St station. Saw the accolades and I'm glad I decided to stop in. Porchetta sandwich was melt in your mouth fantastically delicious. Can't wait to go back for their breakfast sammys and others.
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2017-11-09,4.0,"The porchetta sandwich! Drooooool.

Perfectly cooked semi-fatty pork belly on ciabatta bread with pickled red onion, arugula, and melty melty provolone.

Prices for sandwich are on par with Manhattan (around $11 for a sandwich that's not exactly huge).

They have a pretty crazy drinks selection. All the hipster stuff people love, like Harmless Harvest (at $6 a bottle), cold brew, health juices, etc."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-11-15,1.0,Thought this would be a nice place. The photos of the food were nice. The place is small. Just a few on staff. Gets crowded easily. And the food is basic. Like a high school cafeteria. They should change the name to Bread and Stupid. So many better places in Manhattan.

149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-02-17,5.0,"On top of it's all day freshly grilled meats that go into the porchetta and beef short rib sandwiches (complete with pickled onions), this place has, hands down, the best breakfast egg sandwiches in the whole city.

Making good egg sandwiches has become a lost American Art of late, and Bread and Spread has resurrected it with a vengeance. Have an eggs over easy sandwich with American (or your choice) of cheese and bacon on their delicious -crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside- ciabatta roll and you will know breakfast heaven. In a time where every fancy brunch place is doing ever more outlandish takes on breakfast, it seems like a great bacon egg and cheese sandwich has become a rarity. Love this place. I would give it ten stars if I could. You will not regret coming here for any meal at any time of day from 7-7pm 7 days a week."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-02-18,5.0,"Their sandwhiches are amazing. The Porchetta was heaven, with the Short Rib a close second. The ingredients were unique but worked in perfect harmony."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-05-04,5.0,"Love this little place. I'm so used to food experiences like this to require some level of crowd-tolerance and line-waiting except for very early morning or right before closing, but for Bread & Spread I've yet to have to wait in any sort of line even at a sane hour of the day. Their sandwiches are big, heavy, warm, and emotionally healing after a rough night out.  

The little ways that they've made their shop an efficient machine are all very fun. e.g. Your order is written in sharpie on a sandwhich bag which is then the very same bag that you get your order in. 

Some highlights as I try out different combos of their customized BEC:
- Ciabatta - truly something special. It's surprisingly thinner than the usual puffy behemoths I've come to expect with ciabatta. It's beautifully fluffy on the inside but crispy on the outside, and all-around chewy, much like how I've once heard a French Youtuber describe perfect bread. 
- Multi-grain bread -  awesome, and hits the spot when I want something chewy and full of texture from the seeds and rough.
- Eggs - They always leave their yolks a little runny which is e x a c t l y the way I always love to have my eggs!
- Swiss - Creates a very satisfying stringiness when you first open your sandwich, but from there on I don't know if I taste it much as I get to eating the sandwich. Perhaps I need to order extra cheese if I actually want a gooey experience, or perhaps I need to try one of the other cheeses.
- Bacon - WOW. Magical and transformative. It's like another class of sandwich once bacon is added. 

I always like to make a comment on good service as well. I've seen the same guy behind the counter every time I go, and he's always super nice, obviously believes in the sandwiches here (e.g. was a little surprised the first time I ordered when I didn't say I wanted sauce), and seems to recognize us even though we've only been a few times. A great sandwich place can easily be dampered by an unfriendly face in the morning, but this place is full of only good vibes for me."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-06-16,4.0,"This is my favorite sandwich place in Dumbo. I ordered the porchetta sandwich. It was served on ciabatta bread. The pork belly was flavorful. There was arugula, provolone, and onions on the sandwich. The location was very close to the Brooklyn bridge so it was a great spot to pick up lunch. The price was reasonably priced,  it was $12. I would go back to try the other sandwiches like tha short rib."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-06-05,4.0,"Porchetta sandwiches,  and egg sandwiches are amazing.  Highly recommended.  If you are in the area,  pass on the fancy joints and do yourself a favor and just go here."
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2018-11-25,3.0,Interesting place ... stopped in for breakfast on a recent Sunday morning .... not a lot of options for breakfast in this area of Dumbo ... was greeting by friendly staff and made to feel right at home ... had the ciabatta with ham eggs cheese and tomato very good ... also good coffee... check it out you won't be disappointed
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-04-19,5.0,I was a lil skeptical because I thought it was overrated.... It's not it's delicious and fresh and you can taste everything... I'm in love
149,bread-and-spread-dumbo,2019-05-17,5.0,Great chicken bacon wrap with jalapeños. Small place busting out excellent sandwiches in Brooklyn. Will definitely go back next time I'm in DUMBO.
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-22,5.0,"Super cute small cafe / plant shop. It gets pretty busy on weekends and grabbing a table for more than 2 people can be difficult. The ambience is great though! 

The matcha lattes (standard and berry flavoured) are both pretty good, although a little small in volume for what you pay. Can't speak to the quality of the coffee. There are some pastries for sale as well, best in the morning when still more relatively fresh."
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-20,5.0,"Love everything about this place.
Smells amazing being full of flowers!
The coffee also tasted perfectly roasted and creamy. The in house lavender and rose syrups were just fab!"
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-17,5.0,"i've stopped by Remi's regularly in the past for quick flower pick-me-ups and coffee, but writing this review now bc of how much i adore this gorgeous V-Day bouquet that my boyfriend got from here! (see pic attached, still in love with these flowers and they look so beautiful sitting in a vase in my bedroom) don't think i've squealed over a bouquet as much as i did -- it was perfect and from all my experiences at Remi's, not surprised at their talent. COME HERE FOR UR LOVED ONES YALL.

their love and care for the flowers and aesthetics in general really shows in their work, and this is so much more than just an ""IG spot"". Remi herself is so fun and enjoyable to chat with, and the staff and vibe they create it make the space so much more cozier and relaxing than just any other flower or coffee shop."
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-17,5.0,"They're actually florists that sell lattes and pastries in their beautiful and super cozy space. It's the besttttt place I've had coffee at. We got the Rose and Lavender Lattes. Somehow I imagined the Rose one to taste better, but I enjoyed the Lavender latte more. Loved the vibes. The store smells great thanks to the flowers.

Very Instagrammable too!"
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-31,4.0,"We found this place through some pretty Instagram photos. This coffee spot doubles as a flower shop which I think is awesome! The view and the smell of the flowers makes this a great meeting spot. On the weekend afternoon that we came here, there was a nice amount of bustle that made it seem like the space was hip, but not so much that it felt like a tourist destination.

My friends and I got an iced oat milk latte and a rose milk latte. The rose milk latte wasn't overly sweet and the rose flavor was present but not overpowering. The regular latte was strong too. I would recommend this place as a cute place to grab a drink, but it may not be the greatest place to study if you need an outlet or a lot of table space."
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-26,4.0,"It's such a beautiful cafe and flower shop, there can create custom bouquets and succulents all over, but there are only a couple of seats. 
The drinks seem interesting and it was highly recommended to me. I tried the rose latte and the latte art was beautifully drawn. The drink had subtle rose fragrance, dried rose pieces and was mildly sweet. 
It is a great place to check out!"
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-19,4.0,"""Stop (to grab a latte) and smell the flowers."" Is that how the quote goes? Remi is a beautiful coffee shop + florist combined! The interior is decorated with, well, flowers and plants. It also has a modern design with white brick wall style. 

DRINKS: I got the Berry Matcha Latte ($6). I loved the attractive latte art on top. It tasted like I expected a matcha drink to be. Not too sweet or creamy. The berry made the drink unique. 

The space is small and there's only a few tables. Lots of customers going in and out. My group got ours to-go. Even if you snag a table, I feel like the constant foot traffic in a tight space might be distracting if you're trying to settle down and get work done. 

It's pretty neat that you can also buy plants, flowers, and vases from here. I came just for the coffee, but my friend purchased a plant and is very pleased with it. 

Prices are reasonable but a little on the higher side of coffee - kind of like Starbucks prices - however, it's made with quality coffee (I saw they use La Colombe) and it's handcrafted with care!"
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-19,5.0,"If you love flowers + coffee, this is the perfect spot. The shop doubles as a floral and coffee shop and feels like an oasis from the deary busy streets of NYC. They have an array of different plants and flowers on display for purchase at the front and back of the store, and a coffee counter with pastries near the entrance.

The flowers here are as beautiful as the coffee is good.  And the latte art here is so aesthetically pleasing with the color and floral petals that it's almost too pretty to drink. But alas, its bound to happen eventually. 

The rose and lavender lattes are a must, though I'm more in favor of the lavender. 

Rose: Floral without being overwhelming or overly sweet. This one had a slight after taste that reminded me of Blue Moon. 
Lavender: hands down my favorite lavender latte because most lavender lattes lack in flavor. This one did not disappoint! 

I honestly felt so happy and at peace sitting in the shop with my coffee. And the bathroom is filled with beautiful dried flowers and plants. Seating is limited to a few small tables and one large communal table so I wouldn't recommend it for groups."
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-10,5.0,"This place combines two of my favorite things. Cacti and beautiful lattes.
I didn't know beautiful lattes were one of my favorite things until I came here. I ordered the lavender latte and a friend ordered the rose so I was able to try both. The floral flavorings sounded odd at first but they were surprisingly as delicious as they were beautiful to look at.
In addition to the huge number of cactus arrangements, there are also a large number of floral arrangements. You're surrounded by coffee and flowers. What more could you want in a coffee shop? It's a genius combination.
It's a nice city escape because you definitely don't feel like you're in NYC. I can't wait to come back here and bring friends as well!"
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-17,4.0,"I love this place! It's a chill garden oasis in the middle of a bustling city. I live/work downtown, and don't typically like trekking all the way uptown just for coffee, but this place was worth it. 

It was originally the rose latte that drew me to this place, but unfortunately it has coffee. I can't drink much coffee, and they couldn't make that drink without the coffee, but they did recommend an alternative: the berry rose tea latte. 

The berry rose tea latte was excellent. It tasted just floral enough without being overwhelming. It also wasn't overly sweet, which I appreciated. In addition, the barista carefully prepared latte art on my drink, complete with edible flower petals. It was so pretty, I almost didn't want to drink it (but I'm glad I did). 

My only complaint was that the syrup in the drink must have been acidic because as I got to the end of my drink, the milk on the bottom became a bit curdled (but only at the very end), so I docked a star. This might not happen with the non-milk alternatives e.g. almond milk. 

I also had one sip of my friend's rose latte, and that was also really good. 

The interior has both the coffee shop and a florist. The flowers were bright and beautiful, and it felt like I was in a garden. It's a great place to relax, read and meet up with friends. I didn't see many outlets, I'm not sure whether they have wi-fi, and the tables are first-come first-served. But even if the place is full, you can still get your drink/pastries to go. 

I'd definitely come back and bring more friends here."

151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-01,5.0,Remi Flower & Coffee is an absolute must visit while in NYC. If you want a peaceful start to your morning there's no better place than a beautiful flower and coffee shop. I've never been to a place quite like this -- you can buy a bouquet of fresh flowers while drinking an ornate floral cup of coffee. The drinks are not only tasty but ranks among the most attractive coffee drinks I've personally ever seen. The owner was lovely and warm. If being in nature is good for your mental and physical health I think drinking your daily cup of Joe at Remi Flower & Coffee may double the benefits. There are now two locations in NYC and I hope that they bring their third to Los Angeles!
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-27,5.0,"With all the busyness of NYC, sometimes you just need a latte in an Acme cup with a scone and good company or a good book surrounded by plant and flower friends to finally exhale that deep breath you took ages ago! My friend and I got the rose latte and were pleasantly surprised. The rose flavor wasn't too overpowering. It calmly hits at the end without losing the espresso. Remi Flower & Coffee is all about attention to detail with the dried flowers they put around a third of the perimeter along with some professional latte art. They're not fooling around. We shared a scone (which is from Amy's Bakery I believe) and it was so good! Paired perfectly with the latte. I do not know what flavor it was I know shame on me, I should've asked what it was exactly. 

In addition to all those great things, I cannot put into words how the ambiance of the cafe made me feel! I was stressed out at the beginning of my visit due to external reasons but this place really gave me some peace of mind. I love how they also sell flowers and make awesome bouquets (just check out their IG) and place them all throughout the cafe so that you can take a look around and see all the beauties you get the honor to share the room with. I will definitely be returning and am ecstatic that I was able to find this amazing place!"
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-30,4.0,"A coffee shop located inside a flower shop! They have various coffees, teas, pastries, and flowers available for purchase. What makes this place unique is the floral accents/flavors that are infused in their drinks along with the beautiful latte art.

I ordered the Rose Latte which had a subtle hint of rose that didn't overwhelm the coffee. I thought it was something different to try and the opening seating allowed my friend and I to catch up without feeling rushed. It is first come, first served so hopefully you're able to snag a table during your visit."

The coffeee is so good, but really lavender and rose lattes always win in my book. They have oat milk too. The guy before me got that so I copied him and it was so goood, made the flavor so much richer. The flowers to so pretty to look at, feels like you're in a garden.

The light comes through the windows, there are gorgeous flowers and plants all around, and there are cute and definitely instagram-able drinks.

I tried the Berry Rose Tea latte. A quick note if you're not a coffee drinker- be careful to ask them which drinks like lavender latte, Rose latte, etc. come with coffee and which don't (matcha latte, etc.) I think the total price was around $6.50.

The drink looked beautiful. The first sip was nice because of the rose petal on top. However, after the first sip I realized I couldn't taste any tea flavor or any rose flavor anymore. To be honest, it tasted exactly like strawberry milk! The drink was mostly ice and mostly milk. It was a waste of money. 

I would be willing to try another drink on their menu- perhaps one of the matcha ones or to try a hot drink better! Hoping to have better luck next time."

It's small inside but definitely an IG spot (I got multiple messages asking me where I went when I posted a picture on my a story). My friend and I got the rose and lavender latte and loved both of them. They added a subtle floral taste to our coffee but didn't overwhelm them. 

I'd recommend Remi if you want a cute place to grab coffee and catch up with a friend!"

Coffee shop is uniquely located within a florist! Between the rose and lavender lattes, this establishment as done a marvelous job blending the two types of businesses. 

Prices are somewhat reasonable for the city. A latte will run approximately $5-6 depending. 

This place is open for all sorts of diets offering gluten free options as well as various non-dairy milks (including Macadamia nut milk). 

I've frequented this location many times. It closes at 7PM during the week and the clientele are mostly more established, older, mature. A lot of people from the UN visit this location. 

Highly recommend. The coffee is wonderful. Ambience is unique (although the aroma may not be for those with allergies). Despite being in a florist shop, not too cold. Will continue to visit and be productive."

They also have different flowers all over that are for sale. It is one of the more unique coffee shops I have seen.

We ordered coffee and a spinach pastry. The spinach pastry was cold and tasted old. It was definitey not fresh which was disappointing. They don't have a wide array of pastries but they do have other snacks like bars/nuts/etc.  The coffee was good and the service is quick. 

We were lucky enough to get a table so we enjoyed our time sitting and enjoying the flowers. It is a fun place and I would suggest coming to check it out.  Someone thought outside the box and they should be applauded for that!"

They have a pretty limited supply of pastries so if you get there past 10.30 you might be out of luck for food. But I would still recommend this purely for the experience aspect."

1. Rose Latte
2. Lavender Latte
Sweet latte inside a flower shop!"
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-09,4.0,"This coffee shop is super cute because it's mixed in with a flower shop. It's a relatively small space so I don't recommend doing their to study unless you literally just need a notebook/laptop todo work from. I think it's more of a place to chat and mingle. Because it's a really cute place people will go, snag a seat, and take pictures. I recommend being considerate of your space when you do that and don't hog the area. You can totally snap and go. 

All the seats were taken when I went and this kind local person from the neighborhood shared her table when me. I really appreciated that. 

The iced dirty chai was good. If I wasn't visiting in town for such a short amount of time I totally would have bought flowers too.

151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-12,4.0,"A cute, aesthetic floral shop/coffee shop hybrid. It's a small shop but there's a good amount of seating, and it's a nice environment to chill at for a while with your drink. Went with the berry matcha latte (with oat milk), and ordered it hot because honestly I wanted the pretty latte art.

Had great, strong matcha flavor and a not too overwhelming berry flavor, which I actually think could have been a little stronger. It is on the sweeter side due to the berry flavor.

They offer a few baked goods as well but selection is on the smaller side.

It's a cute space, but I have to admit that I thought it'd be way more impressive in person... idk should've hyped myself up less haha."

I like the matcha latte iced and hot."

It's a combined flower and coffee shop, so you can really take a breathe of fresh air. The cafe beverages are also very beautifully made (for example the rose latte). The drinks were delicious, albeit a bit pricey. I just love the whole ambiance and vibe of this café.

There are a few tables for seating. 

TLDR; I would come back again and again."
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-28,5.0,"I really loved this coffee shop. Its a perfect spot to sip and enjoy all the flowers around you, as it's also a flower shop. Their lavender latte is very good, the lavender wasn't  so overpowering which is something I liked. Also the service was great, everyone is so nice and I got my latte in a timely manner. 
However, I wouldn't recommend this place for studying."
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-24,5.0,"So having friends as an adult is a bit more difficult than it is when you are still in school. Life seems to become a bigger b*tch and next thing you know it, it is already the next year. Being a tax accountant in a very demanding industry, I have a hard time finding time to just breathe. If I didn't Juul, I don't think I'd get fresh air (not promoting nicotine products).

Anyways, my one good friend and I decided to grab coffee after our respective workouts on a Saturday afternoon. I was pressed for time so I couldn't linger far from my place. So, I decided to try this place out. I've walked past this place on my way to work and never really thought much about it. However, that seems like the theme with all my serendipitous encounters. My friend and I met up and ordered our drinks. She got a matcha moment and I got a lavender latte with oat milk. Three things about this cup of latte. 1. lavender anything is a win 2. it came in a cute mug with a very cute design 3. they had oat milk. Any place with oat milk is a winner in my book. Extra star just for that!

The ambiance is great and if you like plants, guess what? You can buy flowers before, after, or during your coffee moment. The coffee gods were smiling down on me by having this place a block away from my home. Anyone want to grab a coffee? Oh! I know a place! ;)"
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-20,5.0,"Love this place! Why anyone who is in the neighborhood and wants to sit down for a coffee would go anywhere else is a bit of a mystery. 

Sure, if you're looking for a coffee to go, there are other places that might be faster. But if you're looking to take a few moments and catch your breath, why not enjoy a cup of coffee surrounded by the sights and smells of beautiful flowers?"
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-12,5.0,"Was searching for a coffee spot near my hotel. The high reviews coupled with all the pretty photos and I knew I had to go. Two of my favorite things in one place - flowers and coffee.

Not gonna lie, ordered the lavender latte for the gram. It was prettier than I imagined for it being iced! You can tell the coffee art is truly something they've mastered. 

There are a couple small cafe tables and a long picnic bench. Perfect for grabbing a coffee with a friend, reading or catching up on some journaling."
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-05,5.0,"his place is fairly unique and you'll notice that when entering. As you enter the door, you're immediately greeted by lots of beautiful flower arrangements that sets its decor apart from any of the NYC coffee spots I visited on my trip. The staff were quite friendly as I ordered my drink and I even managed to get a seat. They have fairly limited seating, so expect to be required to take your coffee to go the majority of the time. I ordered a standard latte and it was slightly better than average. The flavour was good but I felt it lacked a little in consistency.

Even if you're not a huge coffee drinker, I would recommend you come here as it's just a very unique setting."

It's a flower/coffee shop and you would think what went wrong but instead it just made the whole experience a lot better. Sipping on a coffee while being surrounded by beautiful plants/flowers just has something special. 
I had the violet coffee and not only do they make it into an art piece, it actually had nice balanced flavors. 
So if you're looking for a nice coffee spot that is different from any other coffee shops, try this place. You won't regret it!"
151,remi-flower-and-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-02,5.0,"This coffee/flower shop is so refreshing. From the delicious coffee to the smell of flowers. I always order the rose latte with nonfat milk, and I have not been disappointed. It's a small shop, so there are only a few tables and chairs. I walked in around 4 pm on a Sunday and was able to get a table for myself so I could sit down and enjoy my latte."

We ordered hot chocolate and iced chocolate and even though he said it was his first time making the iced chocolate it was amazing.

The banana pudding in a cup was so good and exactly the snack I needed that cold afternoon.

Chocolate chip cookies were excellent as well.

That same week I realized that they are featured in the movie Late Night with Mindy Kaling. She brings"
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2019-11-30,3.0,"We order from here at least once per month - cupcakes, smallish cakes, cookies, other necessities for celebration. We recently couldn't pick up the cake and asked if it could be delivered.

$30 for delivery of a cake is completely unreasonable, even for TriBeCa.

If you decide to take tour order to stay, they have a cute cafe part with tables and chairs. They sell coffee to go and to stay. I would come here for a casual non-drinking meet up for sure. The treats are really good."
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2019-10-08,5.0,"If you are looking for a birthday cake, run to Billy's immediately.  Billy's confetti cake is the most amazing birthday cake I have ever tasted.  Everything is perfect: the frosting, the cake, the cream--- everything fresh, vanilla, buttery and just what you'd want a birthday cake to be.

I also got:

chocolate cupcakes: extremely chocolates frosting on top of a chocolate cake.  

Carrot cake: excellent cream cheese frosting with a moist carrot cake full of pineapples, carrots, nuts.  Always a favorite of mine.

Definitely worth the carbs!"
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2020-03-14,2.0,"Too many bakeries in Manhattan to do this sloppy of a job. Ordered a Crowd Pleaser Cake for a birthday and we received a cake poorly iced with uneven layers (see pics), dry and all over sloppy.  I sent the pics to management and she disagreed that the layers were uneven (maybe she needs glasses?) and she stood by the product. She didn't care less that I was dissatisfied with it.  Seriously, my 10 year old could have iced it better.  

Customer service is generally pretty blah and staff unfriendly.  Since there are so many bakeries to choose from in Manhattan I choose not to patron this one anymore and I tell all my colleagues to get their birthday cakes elsewhere."
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2020-02-19,5.0,I found this place via food for all! I didn't know they have discounted cakes & cookies via the app. This is awesome to bring some goodies to parties or just to the office
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2019-07-12,4.0,"Billy's Bakery banana cake is one of my favorite desserts ever, full stop. Even my boyfriend, who hates cream cheese frosting (not sure what's wrong with him), admits that it's pretty good. I also have had their chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, which I picked up for said boyfriend's birthday -- chocolate on chocolate is generally way too rich for me, but I loved this! The cake was really moist and the frosting somehow managed to not be overbearingly sweet. 

So this review would be five stars for taste, but why are the people in this store so mean??? The girl at the register gave me such attitude while I was trying to buy my cake, and got frustrated when I took a minute to think about what I wanted (while there was NO ONE else in the store). Sorry, don't they pay you to work here?"
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2020-02-21,5.0,"Great find on the ""Food For All"" app! I got a discounted treat box via the app of absolutely YUM red velvet cakes!! I love that an adorable, clean and friendly bakery cares so much about the environment by partnering with Food For All but really speaks to the quality of this bakery! The red velvet cakes were an absolute win as well taste and presentation wise!"
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2020-02-13,2.0,"The staff (at least the afternoon male person who tried to assist me ) were very unhelpful .  My wife Tried to inquire about ordering cupcakes , and a cake and the person couldn't be less helpful. I don't understand how places like this hire people without training the staff on how to be friendly and helpful to the customer . I gave them 2 stars because their stuff usually tastes good .

152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2019-06-01,1.0,"If you want your cake to be late and your party ruined, order from here. Their 12-5pm delivery window leaves you waiting around all day and they can't even figure out how to get the cake delivered within that time. That's right. My cake came at 6:30pm. Not impressed and will never be ordering from here again."
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2018-01-13,4.0,"This place comes in a close 2nd to the original Billy's in Chelsea. The space is roomier and just as cute, done in an Eastery yellow-blue color scheme. I found myself in this part of Tribeca and decided to grab a few dozen mini cupcakes.

Still as delicious as I remember, moist and flavorful in every bite. They're perfect bite-size morsels to satiate your sweet tooth, in an array of flavors including my favorites banana and carrot, both with cream cheese frosting. The chocolate with chocolate buttercream is also a winner, whereas the yellow daisy cupcake is a bit sweet for me. 

The space would be nice to hang out in as they have a few round tables. And this location sees less foot traffic than Chelsea's, which is a win-win."
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2019-05-02,2.0,"Much like the recent reviews I was not impressed by the staff and cupcakes when I stopped in. Ordered the lemon & red velvet & was not impressed - just ok. In any event while the staff and cupcakes were mediocre at best, I would probably go back to give them another shot."
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2019-09-15,1.0,"Billy's completely ruined our gender reveal surprise for our family. Put yourself in my shoes: you are having a baby, and your whole family has gathered together, including several people from out of town.

We got gender reveal cupcakes from Billy's TriBeCa. First of all, the ordering experience was a nightmare. I was on the phone for 30 minutes to order a dozen cupcakes. I was put on hold about 10 times. When I asked for 6 vanilla and 6 chocolate... I was put on hold for another 10 minutes and finally an angry worker told me that they would ""do me a favor"", but ""I would have to stick to the standard order configuration in the future."" Just very impersonal, frustrating, and cold. This is cupcakes, people.

When we finally got our cupcakes and surprised our family, they forgot to fill them with the gender reveal frosting.... so everyone just had plain, empty cupcakes.

They truly have terrible customer service so I would order somewhere else for important occasions."
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2017-08-27,4.0,"This accidental find on side street Franklin between Broadway and Church might have been like my Grandmothers fresh baked afternoon love, except mine didn't cook that great.   She once made some brick dense chocolate cupcakes where she added popcorn in the batter for instance.

No matter what, no one matches the hand of my grandma, even if the food IS better.
These cupcakes were no joke.  At $3.75 a pop, they aren't excessive in size which can alleviate some worry for the calorie conscious.  

I ate mine in about five minutes - strawberry lemonade - moist strawberry cake with a lemony cream cheese frosting made my day instant awesome.  

What's your favorite ?  I asked the bright friendly gals behind the counter.
""Banana Nutella"" said the blonde.
""Carrot cake"" said the brunette.

This place is right around the corner from my office.
""I didn't know you guys were here - how long have you been open?""
""7 years."" 

They must be doing something right. 
Whole Cakes looked good too - and they sell birthday candles for .10 if you need a sure to please fast and easy birthday gift. 

Look for the faux laundry line on display in the window, and go through the paint cracked old door.   You'll happily gain a smile."

152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2018-02-25,3.0,"Came here bc of my friend's suggestion to give Billy's cupcakes a try, but unfortunately, I left the place a little disappointed because the cupcake was stale. We brought it to their attention and they gave us a new one, but the new one was still very dry. I always prefer the more moist cake. Their cupcake wasn't really my style. We also tried the banana pudding, which was much better. Not too sweet, very soft, chunky bananas. And you get to keep the cute jar.

Cute store. The place is like mom's kitchen in an old country house. Which... is why I thought it was odd to be located in Tribeca."
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2020-01-19,2.0,"Cupcakes are good.  Miserable, grumpy people working here.  They make you feel as if they are doing you a favor buy letting you buy their products."
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2017-04-09,3.0,"Haven't been to their other locations but this one in particular was pretty lacking. I don't know if it was the particular day I went or if it's always like this but their selection of cupcakes was almost non-existent. I ultimately settled on the Confetti cupcake only because out of the handful you can choose from, it looked the best.

It looked like they had a few kinds of cookies and pies out as well, but nothing piqued my interest.

The cupcake itself tasted fine. It wasn't spectacular nor terrible. The icing was very thick and very sweet. It was at times a bit too much, and I love sweets! Definitely needed a drink to help get it down. But I agree with the worker (who was wacky) that the confetti sprinkles were the best part...

Interior was decorated nicely but seating was kind of chaotic. There were only 10 chairs in the entire shop and a bench against the wall. One of our tables was lopsided and would tip over if you leaned on it... at all. Wish I could've liked it better here though."
152,billys-bakery-new-york-2,2017-01-24,2.0,"So the products themselves are good. Had cheesecake, espresso. Was wonderfully prepared. The atmosphere is nice and it was not crowded on a weekday evening. 

My wife has never been at Billy's and we had picked a night, searched for parking, parked and were glad to be inside. My wife had asked to use the restroom. The guy behind the counter said they did not have one. We asked if they relieve themselves at McDonalds or would they be as so kind to let a lady use the restroom? Out strolls the manager, who enjoys his authority over who gets to use the restroom in his fine establishment. He tells us ""It's for employees only because we have hot ovens in the bakery."" I get it, thats where hot ovens belong, I think my wife can navigate around them. Long story short it took ten minutes of conversation to use the restroom. At the price point of the goods, how about empathetic customer service and a restroom? It's the city, there are plenty of alternatives."

153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2020-04-23,5.0,"Aroma has the best blended coffee in nyc. I first discovered aroma is Tel Aviv and was in love at first sight. I wish the nyc one had more israeli dishes but they still have some very solid options. I thought their borekas were very americanized in a way- not traditional but im sure that most people will still enjoy. How i would recommend experiencing aroma: order their signature aroma blended coffee, shakshuka and enjoy that little free chocolate. Great spot to get work done as well which is a major attraction."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2020-01-05,2.0,"Let me start off by saying that I am not one who uses Yelp as a platform to complain. I also don't think I'm special or above anybody, including other patrons and employees. When something is wrong, it's wrong. I'm hoping that with this management makes some improvements so others can actually enjoy their experience when they go. 

I used to be a regular at 72nd and Iced Aroma Light was my fav. drink. Sadly that location closed. I was thrilled when I spotted another Aroma so I could get my drink. As soon as I got this drink that I know ridiculously well, something looked and tasted different. The color was off and the bottom was much darker than the top. I took a sip and this was totally different than what I recall having time and time again. I took one more super tiny sip thinking maybe after I took a bite of food it would take better, or I would be able to just power through and finish the drink Nope. It was horrific. I couldn't say something until I was on my way out, as I was alone with my two year old who was strapped into her high chair eating. 

On my way out I told the girl making the drinks that my drink didn't taste right. I asked her if it was an iced aroma light and not just an iced aroma. She insists and tells me that maybe the other people who made the drink (that I drank  
tons of times before) were trained differently. She offered to make another anyway. I would have taken her up on it if, but I thought if this is how she believes the drink should be made, I don't want another crappy drink. Therefore, I asked for an iced matcha. She seemed pissed and I saw her speaking to other employees about it

After waiting for an eternity, I was handed a medium iced matcha and told by the cashier, ""We are doing this for you this time, but we had to give you a medium (despite my Aroma Light being a large) because the drink was half empty."" Now she wasn't the one who I handed the drink to, and once she said this I knew she must have never seen my drink. I felt like she was implying that I drank half of my drink so I was trying to get away with getting another drink for free. I was pissed. I questioned the drink being half gone as I only took two sips. She finally goes over to where the original drink is, looked at it...paused for a minute...then tells me well I'm getting a medium. 

Now back to the rest of the experience...service wasn't friendly from the start. I put money in the tip jar anyway. When the food came, I picked up my oatmeal and Halumi salad. I was told it would be another minute for the bread. I place everything on the table and come back...still waiting for bread. 

When we start eating, the first thing I notice is the oatmeal is room temperature. They were also stingy on the fruit on top that I was charged extra for. Again, being something I ordered a million times, this isn't at all what I remember. My daughter, who loves oatmeal, only took one bite. 

I look back at the tray and noticed they forgot my salad dressing. I went up and got my dressing, and went back to eating. Their Halumi Salad was good.

My daughter ate a little salad and a piece of bread, but wasn't feeling the rest. I went back for a fruit bowl and croissant for her. She LOVED the pineapple, but spit out her first strawberry and didn't eat the rest or the strawberries. The croissant was standard. 

I'm not sure what's going on there, but the employees that were working that morning were rude and slow and the food was disappointing. The End."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-12-15,3.0,"My friend and I were looking for a quick bite and Rochelle happens to dine here often. So we took a break from the Oculus and stopped in.
What I really wanted was soup and salad. Rochelle raves about their butternut squash soup. Unfortunately, soup du jour was lentil chili. Well hopefully that changes because it's the holiday season and the nearby Oculus draws a lot of traffic.
Aroma offers nice bites like paninis, various salads and soups. There are also pastries and coffees.
After perusing the menu we decided to order the following: Caesar salad,Shakshuka with feta, and beverages.
Let me start off with the positive:
I really enjoyed my Caesar salad, fresh, croutons aplenty and dressing on the side. It does come with a side of bread: whole wheat or multi grain. What isn't so great: for $15 you would think my salad would be generous bowl portion. No.. it was plated and really not worth the price( honestly if it wasn't so windy and cold my choice was to eat at The Odeon where a tuna burger is $26 but I know what I'm getting..). I also ordered a hot chocolate and was told by the server to make sure I stir my beverage??? Big mistake in ordering marshmallows in it: this huge white blob was in my drink and my h or chocolate was not hot. As much as I stirred, the chocolate did not distribute evenly.
There I was carrying a tray of food bigger than my head to one of the booths. Sorry but this knocks place by one star. I can't imagine on a busy weekday the lunch crowd carrying trays and not knocking into each other. I guess I'm not into cafeteria setting restaurants.
Rochelle enjoyed her Shakshuka but had feta added to it and didn't care for the feta. $22 for Shakshuka??? She did like her iced Aroma coffee.
This is a spacious location ( bigger than the now closed Soho location)however, it could be cleaner. We sat at a booth that had torn sugar packets strewn in a top shelf.
All I can say is meh."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-10-23,4.0,"I like it here, plain & simple. Originating in Israel. Clean and quick service. A step above Panera quality as far as eating and the coffee is decent--the frozen slush is pretty popular. Comes with a little piece of chocolate. Recommend shakshuka (classic Israeli breakfast dish) and the California chicken sandwich (tangy aroma sauce makes it) kind of similar to any ""special sauce"" at fast food joints. Everything tastes fresh here."

What we liked- the dining area is spacious and clean with both communal spaces and private tables. Lots of big windows and filled with light.  Our food on all occasions was fresh and delicious.  The avocado toast with side salad, the shakshuka, the bureka and cinnamon pastry were all top quality.  We had never had a bureka before but had seen it featured on a food show. It was a crisp puff pastry with toasted sesame seeds and filled with sliced hard boiled egg, pickle, tomato and light spread of hummus and it was amazing!!  The fresh squeezed orange juice and the coffee were delicious.

What needs improvement- the staff was indifferent to rude on all visits.  No smiles, no cheer, just not friendly and very different from the service that I consistently receive from low cost fast food in Atlanta.  The staff was also slow to clear surrounding tables.  

I like this place and would dine here again on future visits. A friendlier staff would be make this place a winner."

We also got the omelet on a croissant. The croissants  are fresh and have a great taste. The omelette are good, my only recommendation would be to add something to this dish to give it a burst of flavor.

For the soup I got the sweet potato and it was hot and delicious on a cold day. 

They also had great paninis that I saw and I'm looking forward to trying those next time."

Was staying at a hotel around the corner from  Aroma during the Christmas holidays and Aroma became our go-to place for breakfast. Large mugs for tea and coffee and the pastries/menu options are incredible. If you're in the area and need to grab a bite, look no further!"
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-06-20,5.0,"FYI: This review is solely for the cafe's atmosphere & a beverage. It was my first time here & I wasn't too sure what to order so I asked the employee to suggest something and I ended up with their signature beverage Aroma Light. It was a cold coffee beverage that was a bit sweet. Definitely flattering to my taste buds. The beverage came with a complimentary piece of chocolate. The cup the beverage was served in was cool and different. The cafe's atmosphere is relaxing; patrons were on their laptops or reading or having intimate convos. 
Didn't try the food but take out is offered if you chose not to eat in."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-05-15,5.0,"I love this place! I have visited Aroma in Miami, Maryland and Israel. I was so excited when I learned about one in the city. Their iced aroma is one of my absolute favorite drinks. It's a bit like a Frappuccino, but better. For food, I ordered shakshuka with cheese added. It comes with bread and a cute little chocolate. It was all delicious and very quick to come out."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-04-25,3.0,"Had the ugliest and weirdest tasting Matcha latte I've ever had here.... weird...
Not sure what happened...
Environ is fine- it's a chain, so most are pretty much the same as far as decor.  We closed he place down tho- I guess cuz it was downtown in the financial district.  Seemed early to me."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-10-28,4.0,"So I was in the area for work, was craving a breakfast and coffee place and came across this. I see it's quite busy here so I have it a chance. I ordered the California panini and a cup of hot coffee, both are very good choices I enjoyed it. This place has plenty of seating area and the service is fast. I'll come here if I'm down by this area again."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-12-26,2.0,The pastries and drinks are good but way overpriced and on top of that all the table were dirty. We had to clean our own table.
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-08-22,2.0,We had a couple of salads with grilled salmon on them. The lettuce was not very crisp and fresh and the salmon was awful. On the plus side it can be tough finding places to eat in that part of town so it is handy but also very speedy for crappy salads.
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2020-01-02,5.0,"It was a cold and drizzly nIght. My wife and I had just spent the day playing tourist and found ourselves on Church street. We were cold and tired. There, on the corner was Aroma Espresso Bar. We trudged inside and our spirits were immediately lifted by the warm smile of the girl at the order counter. We ordered mocha coffees and were delighted by how flavorful and uplifting they were; we were warmed to our toes and our energy was renewed. It was a bit of magic to end our day."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-10-11,4.0,"The location of this espresso bar is so convenient! In the same building as my office! I love coming here in the mornings to pick up an iced aroma!

It's a perfect pick me up in the mornings before I get my day started."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-01-30,2.0,"This is my second time here and very unhappy with my
Visit. Got a mocha coffee and was very unpleased and underwhelmed by it. For over $5, I expected a well made drink and my drink tasted very blah. The chocolate wasn't even properly stirred and it tasted so sugary and artificially I just couldn't finish my drink. Waste of time and money. Not impressed..."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-11-10,3.0,"We visited the locations in Israel and loved all the food so we had to try one in the States. But I have to say, it was just okay. I didn't have the same quality as the food in Israel.

One of my favorite Israeli dishes is Shakshuka. It's basically a dipping sauce with a tomatoe base, onions, bell peppers, different spices, topped with a few eggs that cook on top and make a nice topping. The point is to scoop the bread it is served with into the sauce.

Sadly, the Shakshuka was very disappointing. I would never order it again. It was watery and flavorless and way too spicy. The bread at the Aroma in Israel is amazing but they don't use the same bread here. The one here was thick and fluffy, which was nice, but had no flavor. Even when I dipped it into the sauce there was still very little flavor. The tahini sauce it came with also tasted funny. So all in all it was a poorly made dish.

I don't know if I want to come here again."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-06-12,3.0,"The kale salad was way too expensive with the add-ons
They got my green tea wrong. How do you get green tea wrong ? Too much wait to pick up. 
Overall tasty salad but overpriced and boring"
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-08-22,4.0,"This is one of my favorite places in the city to buy coffee.  You get a little piece of chocolate with your coffee when you order.

But the pricing sucks.  It's ridiculously expensive.

But the good quality coffee makes up for it."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-07-25,2.0,"I've been to Aroma on 4 different occasion.

The only pro is that the coffee is pretty good, and comes with a small piece of chocolate. But it's not worth the overall experience - especially if you plan to order food.

One time I went with my coworkers and ordered a steak sandwich and a soup. It took FOREVER to come, and when it finally did, both were very disappointing. The steak was dry, and soup had some hair. While the server did exchange my soup, he was not very nice or attentive. (This goes without saying, but I was in no way rude).

While I do like the coffee and the free chocolate that it comes with, I don't go here anymore; despite it being one block from my office."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-07-16,4.0,"Coffee is always consistent and good. Soy milk available at no extra charge!
I did finally try the vegan chickpea omelette sandwich for breakfast- it was good although hardly an omelette (more like a thin veggie burger). It comes with pickles, lettuce, tomato, tahini which your choice of bread. In the end this ended up just being a veggie burger sandwich, edible / filling but nothing special."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-10-24,2.0,"I always walk past this going to school and wanted to try it. Honestly, I regretted what I got the moment I got. It costed me $27 for a panini, cheese danish, and an orange juice. First of all, the food was not at all good to me. The bread was hard and the salad it came with tasted like hard leaves from outside and the cheese danish was hard and crumbling apart. I would've rather spend my $27 at Dunkin' Donuts."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-02-06,4.0,"I'm gonna go ahead and give Aroma a 4 because it is seemingly one of those rare NYC coffee establishments where there is ample seating, friendly staff, and a decent place to work. The coffee is pretty good, too. I think depending on what you're looking for/needing (which is often work space), checking out Aroma would be a great bet."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-05-01,5.0,"I love this place. I usually dine here whenever I can. The dining area is very spacious and always clean. I must say the California chicken sandwich is amazing. The aroma coffee is delicious! This is my favorite spot for coffee! I am usually here 2-3 times a week. The staffs are great and helpful. Especially Jay, he is very hard working and friendly. I always see him there! And thanks Liz for always putting on a smile and greeting me!"
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-08-04,5.0,"I had a perfectly made iced chai tea latte! You have to wait awhile since lines get pretty long, but I'd much prefer the quality of this drink over a quick and thrown together version from some of the national coffee chains. Definitely pop in if you're in the area! They give you a pice of chocolate with some of the drinks which adds a very nice touch."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-01-03,3.0,"Decent food and espresso. I ordered the marshpresso after seeing the beautiful picture on their banner. When I received it, it looked nothing like it and was a sugary mess. The eggs on toast was okay, the bread was toasted too much and the eggs were runny, making it very messy."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2020-02-02,2.0,"Why can't Americans figure out how to serve a decent breakfast? This place didn't know how to poach eggs, the toast was cold, and we had to go  back to the counter to heat up the crossaint. On the plus side, the Orange Juice is nice"
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-02-03,3.0,"Standard chain cafe with pastries and other goodies. The coffee was fine (I take mine black and love a bright cup paired with a flaky pastry).

This time I ordered an egg croissant. Someone else stole my order apparently and the servers got mad at me. Hey, I wasn't the thief...but, I'm sorry?

Them getting mad at me reminded of when my daughter pre-emptively gets mad at me because she thinks I'm mad at her. ""You said I lose a toy because I didn't listen."" Um, no, I actually didn't say that. I said if you don't listen, you will lose a toy. Tantrum ensues.

Anyways, I wasn't mad at them for not having my order, having lost it to the space-time continuum. I was more amused than anything at their irritation with me. 

When I finally got my order (after popping up at a couple false alarms. Is ""Mandy"" even a real name? Have we ever heard of just using numbers? Or a P.A. system? Poor baristas have to yell themselves hoarse to get through the day.), the warm croissant (a bit denser and less buttery and airy than I prefer but still good) and egg layered with cheese just really hit the spot. 

All the waiting and trial to obtain this plate made the gooey cheese taste that much more satisfying. I washed it down with my middle-of-the-road Joe and was on my way."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-04-15,3.0,"This place is definitely overrated and overpriced. I ordered a grilled cheese panini with turkey and avocado for lunch. It was almost $15 but that's pretty normal for the area. 

I was disappointed because the panini only had three slices of turkey and the avocado was not very fresh at all. It was all black. I should have taken it back but it took so long to get it that I just took the avocado off the sandwich. I'll make sure to stick to my usual grilled chicken sandwich and place my order ahead of time to beat the lunch crowd."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-03-15,3.0,"Went in on 8:40am on thursday morning. Not crowded and no line. Ordered my food on an app because it was half off (thank god). My manhattan style bagel which should have been $10.30 was meidocre. The bagel wasn't toasted and was hard. Theres not a generous amount of salmon, cream cheese or onion. Wasn't terrible but wasn't great."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-11-16,4.0,"We ended up getting to the city super early from our flights and decided to bide some time by scooping up some breakfast. The place was very open with plenty of seating with a pretty trendy vibe. The first thing that caught my eye was the French toast made with the homemade bread. It was thick sliced but so fluffy! Paired with fresh fruit syrup and whipped cream, it was really the stand out dish. My girlfriend got a croissant egg and cheese sandwich which was solid, it did feel a little plain. If it had some seasoning in the eggs it would have been fire. For beverages since it is a coffee house I went for a standard cup of joe which for a coffee place was kinda underwhelming. My girlfriend on the other hand got a Aroma Coffee which after drinking almost half I can to the conclusion that is what I should have got for my drink. I feel for a quick bite to eat with a friend this place is a great choice for both breakfast and lunch. Which by the way their lunch menu sandwiches looked amazing!!"
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-07-25,5.0,"Wow! Food was absolutely amazing! I got the boreka treat, which was a cheese boreka filled with Tahini, pickles,tomato..etc that was light yet really filling! But that's absolutely not what wowed me. The wow factor turned out to be the iced hazelnut which was heavenly! I never thought that an Israeli cafe based in the heart of Tel Aviv could come across the world to New York and keep the amazing food and drinks! I was hesitant to try it at first but now I will definitely be a regular customer! I can't wait to grab another iced hazelnut! I would recomendable this place to anybody and everybody! And if you're reading this you should absolutely try it!"
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-12-18,5.0,"This place I feel has one of the best mochas and hot chocolates I have ever had. I order online from them and wanted to compliment them because they always deliver quickly and package my orders well! They made a mistake in my order once, but they were very quick to send me a replacement to correct. I love Aroma Espresso and it always feels like a treat to order from them."
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-01-17,5.0,"Love this Aroma location! The cafe is very spacious so it is great for studying or just hanging out with friends. I usually get their cafe au lait which I love! I have also had their nana (mint) tea. From food I have tried their burekas and the salad with veggies and tuna. Food is good and always fresh! Prices are very reasonable. They have WiFi and plugs to charge your electronics. The music can be a little loud sometimes, but other than that I love Aroma!"
153,aroma-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-08-22,5.0,"Best food, everything is fresh ana delicious!!!
love everything about it.
The staff were really nice and friendly great service !!"

154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2020-02-22,5.0,"A quintessential New York treasure with everything you may need to create a comforting, cozy weekend at home. They have candles & lighting, all types of international spices, a large variety of salts, and, of course, teas! My favorites for winter include their homemade mulling spices for apple cider or red wine, and their Winter Chestnut Tea. It's like a Warm Hug  Enjoy!"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2019-11-18,5.0,It's such a cute little place in soho/village area. Tons of tea and the prices are on par with what you pay in nyc. The service is also just really nice and they are super knowledgeable. Definitely worth checking out if you are a tea fanatic and want to try some new things.
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2018-12-25,5.0,"I yelped tea shops to buy a Christmas gift for my friend and this one came up first. I'll be the first to say I don't know much about tea besides Lipton tea. Walking in the store I immediately felt intimidated with all the options. Everything looked the same and I didn't know where to start however the staff was very accommodating and welcoming. One of the ladies there saw how lost I was and began explaining the different types of teas, buying options and providing recommendations. She was patient in answering my questions which I really appreciated. 

I would definitely come back here again to buy other teas for my friends due to their extensive stock and very friendly/helpful staff."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2019-09-20,5.0,"That big coffee chain we all know stopped serving unsweetened fruit iced teas. I decided to brew my own. I stopped in at Sullivan Street Tea and spice co. while on a walking food tour when I visited NYC. They have a fantastic variety of teas. The staff was very knowledgeable. They were able to suggest the perfect teas for me to take home and brew. I liked it so much that when I ran out I placed an online order for more. I also added a few flavors to try and I love the additional flavors. The online experience was quick and easy. I would definitely order again. 

I love the Sweet Nectar, peach oolong, wild strawberry and white pomegranate. I am drinking better flavored iced teas and saving money!"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2019-11-24,1.0,"Just another overpriced spice shop.  I bought a few spices and not that good.   I purchased a couple of ""mixes""to make various salad dressings and they were all too salty and not good at all."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2018-09-15,5.0,"If there's a spice heaven (with tea), this has to be it! The selection of spices is insane! Sea salt with black truffle? Yep, they have it! If you like to cook, and fancy premium ingredients that go into your food, and looking for inspiration, this place is for you!"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2019-09-11,5.0,"A delicious surprise that will get repeated visits.  This tiny shop is packed with teas, spices and the few salts in its collection have me hooked. A special salt in a small quantity can make a big difference. Try the smoked bonfire (we were told 7 woods are used and it tastes that good) and the Cyprus Back Lava is a wonderful finishing salt. 

As you can tell the staff are super helpful. Be sure to ask about the shops history in NYC lore and take the time to look at the walls and ceiling in addition to all the enticing jars. And buy something yummy for you and those you in your life!"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2018-12-20,5.0,"TLDR; I made some fancy shortbread cookies and they were delicious because of the ingredients I bought from here. Ha!

I've shopped here in the past and I've always liked it for their floral things. Last year, I purchased some lavender and rose buds to make some linen closet smell-goods and also a for a (failed) bathbomb-making activity with a small, 8 year-old-human. 

I almost forgot about this place until this week, when I've been in the midst of holiday baking. I came by here to buy vanilla bean pods ($5.25/pod for Papua New Guinea beans and I think ~$6 for Madagascar beans). The people who work here are sooo helpful and nice! A guy helped me my first visit here; I also purchased hulled cardamom, which he was glad to grind for me. 

My most recent visit, which was two days later was to purchase more vanilla beans. While I was there, I ended up buying my brother-in-law's holiday gift, which was a custom salt trio of - porcini salt, black truffle salt, and ghost pepper salt. I got to pick which ones I wanted and the ladies there packed it up really nicely for me in little vials and a little gift box that really brought it all together. (Again, the people who work here are just so nice.) I never really noticed how many salts they had until today. I'm going to be back for myself! 

I also picked up some sage sticks as a holiday gift for my friend. They sell long sage sticks for $3.50, as well as a trio of shorter sage sticks for $9. I went for the trio; she has some cleansing to do.

This place is clearly a great place to pick out and create gift packages for your friends... or even yourself! I'll be back for their gift-packaged sampler of hot spices. Or maybe their pizza rescue trio. Maybe all of it?

This place is an amateur/professional cook/baker's dream. There's a huge selection of sweet, savory, warm, hot, etc. spices. Whether you're shopping for gifts, specialty teas and spices, or just ran out of something as ordinary garlic powder, this is the place to go. The prices are super reasonable and the quality amazing!"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2019-07-06,4.0,Excellent variety of fresh teas and spices. Could stay all day! I have my usuals I buy once a month. Wish the staff that work there were nicer/friendlier.
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2017-03-19,5.0,"This is a salt - lovers gift paradise. Everything is so well curated and packaged beautifully. Last week I had friends come over for a dinner party and I had black Hawaiian volcanic salt. My mother gave it to me after a friend had come back from Hawaii. We couldn't find the store --- however for the obscure -- this is the place I sent everyone to when looking for novelty when up leveling beyond a Williams-Sonoma spice tray. 

Foodie hack - buy some of their test tube jars when getting spices when traveling, looks way better than ziplock and way easier to label for gifts."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2018-03-19,5.0,"GREAT STORE!! The staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The spice assortment was unbelievable and I loved that you weigh it yourself. If you love spices, this is a MUST!"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2016-11-12,5.0,"Inviting, tempting, beautiful store.  I felt like I was on vacation in some cute little town. Some children were raving over the tea samples as the mom shopped for spices. I tried a sample of some lavender hand cream. I bought some crystallized ginger pieces. The worker was so kind when I asked for help even though I only wanted to purchase a tiny bit.  I also bought some truffle salt and mentioned to the girl I eat a lot of popcorn. She said oh yea and try with Parmesan cheese too. I ended up later at a grocery and bought some of that too ...
So back to the store: interesting and wonderful service. Spices in jars for good prices. Special and unique place--stop by !"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2018-11-14,5.0,"This place is cool. This was the Chins' old club. I only realized it wasn't; when I walked in.  It still looks the same. The floors are the same and the artwork is still on the wall. The members only sign is still in the back. I was looking for Vinnie, but all I found was great tea, spices, and amazing soaps. I purchased a couple of bars today. Maybe one day the owner will put a couple of tables inside and bring back the expresso machine. Highly recommended."

Even though they could have simply ignored me or explained they were shut down for the night, they let us in and helped us get the spices needed for my chili recipe (which wouldn't be anything close to as amazing with other spices!).  Hooray for Sullivan Street T&S Co, both for their excellent employees as well as their fantastic spices!!!!"

I make a stop by Sullivan every time I stop by nearby Porto Rico (for my coffee addiction).  They have a great selection of loose leaf teas and the service here is always great!  She was knowledgable and able to help me find what I was looking for in a jiffy.

I could go on, but there's really not much else to say!  Great little tea shop!"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2016-02-24,4.0,"The staff here is super friendly and helpful.  They were happy to answer all my questions and always did so with a smile.  I wanted to purchase some chili powder and there were a number of them.  She kindly explained all the differences among them.  

The variety of spices was amazing.  It's much better being able to buy the loose spice.  it allows you to get the quantity you are looking for without it being stuck in your cabinet for years slowly loosing it's flavor. The team selection is also pretty good and everything is very reasonably priced.  I will be back."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2018-08-11,5.0,"Cute store, fantastic staff and a huge selection of delicious teas that are very affordable. I ended up taking home some creamy Earl Grey and deliciously smokey Lapsang Souchong. Highly recommend a quick stop here."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2018-07-29,5.0,Sooooo much selection and cool knowledgeable staff! They had so many things I'd never heard of since there are of course so many spices out there. Great tea collection too. They offer jars for you to purchase for your spices and it's easy to shop here waste free! Yay. Also bought a cute lil candle
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2018-01-28,5.0,"What a great spice shop! I used to go to Aphrodisia when it still existed on Bleeker (RIP!) but had never been here. My husband and I stumbled upon it yesterday and I'm so happy we did! It's a small shop but they have a fantastic selection of spices that you can scoop into little bags so you get just as much as you want. Really nice collection of different types of hot peppers, a few types of cinnamon including Vietnamese cinnamon which is my favorite, whole spices that you can grind at home, flavored salts and sugars, and botanicals for making tinctures or teas. They also have a really nice loose tea selection. Also, their prices were really reasonable. $1.50/oz for Vietnamese cinnamon! So good! I picked up a couple types of pepper there as well, including one that apparently hasn't been available in the US since 1970! I can't wait to try it. Overall just a really nice atmosphere, helpful staff, and really nice spices. I'm looking forward to going back."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2017-01-01,4.0,"During a visit to NYC I stumbled upon this little tea and spice shop and was glad I did. They had a nice assortment of teas and spices to choose from. I especially liked the different gift sets they offered, like the Spanish Spice combination with rosemary salt, smoke-dried salt with oak wood, and saffron threads. The gift sets are a bit pricey, but I guess that's why they're considered gifts.

I didn't find the staff particularly friendly or helpful. I did go pretty early in the morning, so maybe they hadn't enjoyed their morning caffeinated tea yet :-)

Definitely worth a stop if you want to pick up a gift for a friend who likes to cook, if you're looking for a random spice that you have trouble finding elsewhere, want to try a new kind of tea, or simply want some cooking and flavor inspiration!"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2015-09-22,4.0,"This place is a tea drinker's dream. If you drink one of their teas every day for a year you most likely still wouldn't get through their inventory. I purchased half a dozen teas my first visit; even though I still return, I only do so for their Winter Rose (black, unassuming, and floral) and Gyokuro (Japanese green). I was first introduced to Gyokuro at En Braisserie. I didn't think Japanese green teas could get any better than Yamamotoyama or be exceptional, but the gyokuro at En Braisserie showed me otherwise. I've since purchased gyokuro from the Bleeker Street, Porto Rico Import and haven't been as impressed. Sullivan's gyokuro is superior; for $9 an ounce, it's also pricy. 

Except for the Winter Rose, I found most of the Sullivan Street's blends to be slightly off. I found the sweet note in their White Pomegranate to be too strong and strident. Their truly heinous Chocolate Bliss was only strong and didn't taste of chocolate at all. Their Lapsang Souchong was too smoky for my tastes. For blends I prefer Spice and Tease. Even the Porto Rico Import on Bleecker has pretty solid blends.

For teas of just one variety (s.a Sencha, Darjeeling, White Needle tea) Porto Rico import provides a good price (slightly cheaper than Sullivan, and definitely cheaper than Spice and Tease) for the quality."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2013-12-22,5.0,"Love this store! Came in on a Friday after work and the girl who worked there was very helpful in putting together a grab bag gift for my brother's birthday. She was knowledgable and let me smell some of their teas. I was able to get a lot of great things and felt like I could spend forever in that store. I even got him an all-natural lavender soap that smells incredible. They also have candles, chocolate, and other great gifts. 

Make sure to check in on Yelp and you get 10% off! I stupidly forgot to do it myself. I would love to come back and try more teas/spices."

I had a great time today when I wandered into Sullivan Street. I am just getting into teas and found the sales associate to be very helpful in helping me browse through teas. Tea shops can be overwhelming so I appreciated her patience and her understanding that I didn't quite know what I wanted.

Prices are reasonable and so far I love the two I picked up! Creamed earl grey & winter's remedy. Will go again!"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2013-11-07,3.0,"Cute place for some spices, specialty salts, and tea leaves.

I got the black ginger and herbal chai last time, which were delicious. Just make sure you brew it according to recommendations to get the best taste. 

You can make your own gift set by choosing cute containers the shop offers and buying the tea/spice by weight. They also sell pre-made gift sets as well."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2016-06-28,4.0,"What a cute little tea shop. I was on my way back to the office from an appointment and found myself walking by this shop. ""Try our iced tea!"" said the chalkboard sign outside and it was so hot and humid that it was impossible to resist. I stopped in my tracks and grabbed the door. 

There was one other patron inside on a late weekday afternoon, so I was able to browse and chat with the sales associate for a bit. I asked about the iced tea, which they offer 4 options of. She recommended the peach oolong and gave me some dissolved honey to sweeten it. Great choice! I then wanted to grab something else to pay with my card and there are so many different options from loose tea to spices and little gift sets. I asked about some of the black teas and she recommended the Creme Earl Grey. I'm excited to try it out!

Note that they don't take card purchases under $5, but I gladly grabbed a box of tea bags to add to my iced tea, because they were packaged too darn cute. These would definitely make great little gifts."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2015-07-14,5.0,"Great selection of teas and spices, at great prices.  All available in this charming shop or on-line.  (Vanilla pods for $2.75 each -- I've never found for less than $4.50 elsewhere.)  They had ground vanilla bean to make your own vanilla powder or sugar.  I've never found that elsewhere, not even my other favorite online spice shop.  (Most vanilla powders are cut with fillers.)

High quality teas -- love the chai and green teas we bought.  This is a destination spot with helpful, knowledgeable staff."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2015-06-17,4.0,"This charming tea shop is a great (and cheaper) alternative to Teavanna for lose leaf tea. They also have a lot of fresh spices and other dry goods, although I did not buy any. 

 I purchased some strawberry fields tea, which was absolutely delicious. I would recommend stopping in even if it is for a few minutes to look around."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2014-07-08,4.0,"I love my tea. 

I love my tea from Sullivan Street Tea & Spice Company. 

Their selection is incredible. And the taste of the teas are out of this world. 

Highly recommend."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2014-05-16,5.0,"I love tea more than life itself. Tea is a form of a food that is sufficient to consume for human subsistence, so it has many fans around the world. You can understand that when I heard of this place, my tea-loving boxer briefs melted in delight (but not my wallet). Warm atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and the teas are excellent and affordable. To my surprise, they also have spices and a wide variety of other hipstery stuff. You can taste and smell the quality. I recommend this to everyone. It's like stepping into a warped dimension of tea and spice world. Your taste buds and teapot will thank you. Welcome to the Fun Palace. 

Despite the fact that I'm a hardened criminal drug-lord/murderer gangsta, I appreciate the times of leisure and reprieve. This tea-house is my second home away from the streets.  

I shall return many times and satisfy my uncontrollable tea urges here. Come join me on a mythical quest of sensual dreams for infiniTEA."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2017-12-20,5.0,"Even though I do not live nearby, I will hold off purchasing spices and loose leaf tea until I can make a trip to the city and stop here.  They have all the basics, and some new spices I had not seen before.  And I found my new favorite tea.  All the staff I met (I visited twice in one weekend :)) were friendly and very helpful."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2016-08-22,5.0,Beautiful place! They have excellent service and a great selection of spices and herbs. I liked that they had sage sticks and herbs in pill form!
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2014-02-14,4.0,If you looking for rare spices come here. I was on a search for juniper berries and they were unfortunately out but the staff searched high and low for it. They were shocked for themselves. I would come back because they had tons of spices I've never heard of and the staff was awesome.
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2014-12-28,5.0,"Great find!!!  Wonderful selection of teas, spices and salts!  Knowledgeable staff.  We always stop by a after a lovely meal at Sacred Chow right across the street or when spending time up the block at Washington Square Park.

We usually go on Sundays and the service is always friendly and welcoming!"
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2014-08-25,1.0,"My wife bought a special powder 2 weeks ago and today we went back in this shop to buy some teas and the same powder.
10 minutes to explain and describe which kind of powder they gave us.... And guess the conclusion????
They gave us the wrong powder last time.
TERRIBLE. I m tired to see and be served by employees who  don t know which kind of products they are selling and so TIRED to hear these words: "" well, i don t know "".
Bad bad bad bad."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2013-04-25,5.0,"The store looks really old in a good way from the outside and when you enter the store, you will instantly feel calm because of the tea aroma in the air. Love it! They also have impression tea selection here. I mean, they have everything from the very basic jasmine tea to kombucha tea. Ask them for the tea catalogue and just search for what you want there. Don't hesitate to ask the storekeeper to find you your perfect tea. They are quite knowledgeable and very friendly!

154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2013-04-14,5.0,Stopped by here looking for a couple of spices for a tea blend that I was working on and lo and behold I found them all here - and more. The staff here were attentive and answered all of my silly questions with a smile. I even picked up a few canisters and know where I can get Hawaiian black salt!
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2014-01-15,4.0,"Wow, what a wonderful store in the village! Great selection of teas, salts and spices."
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2016-01-18,5.0,Really cute and wonderful shop. A friend suggested it for tea. Bought a really nice tea pot and some delicious rooibos tea. I got 4 ounces for about $2.50 an ounce. The guy said it should last about a month. The staff was very friendly and helpful! Definitely recommend it for tea. They also have lots of spices to choose from too.
154,sullivan-street-tea-and-spice-company-manhattan,2012-12-10,5.0,"Fantastic coffee and tea shop!   The baristas really take their time to make you a delicious drink.  They will literally shave nutmeg into your coffee.  

The coffee is fresh and clean.  (especially compared to Starbu*ks that pumps syrup full of chemicals into every coffee).

My only complaint - the gluten free cookies are with the regular cookies.  Sullivan St, please separate the GF products. 

 Even the littlest sprinkle of gluten on a gluten free cookie means someone with Celiac Disease (who must eat gluten free) cannot eat your gluten free cookies.  Don't make your customers sick.  Otherwise, there's not really a point to make gluten free if it's not really."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-07-08,5.0,"Native Bean is the perfect morning breakfast spot. The staff is incredibly friendly and always smiling. I've been going here weekly for over 5 years and every meal is always fantastic. Highly recommend this to anyone in the area

**Update: After living in east village for 7 years I've finally made the move to Brooklyn and what I miss the most is Native Bean. So fantastic in every way."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-07-23,5.0,"Stopped in for bagels on a Saturday morning and so glad we did! There weren't many people there which is surprising because the bagels were fantastic. Some bagel places go way overboard with massive sized bagels and 6 inches of cream cheese. The bagel I had here was perfect! Perfect size, perfectly toasted, perfect amount of cream cheese! I would definitely go out of my way to come back here."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-06-30,5.0,"Almost didn't want to write, as this may be my new secret hideout spot to get some work done. 

I've had their smoothies and their green juices and they are very, very good. I'm sure the food is just as good, there's a wide variety of options, including sandwiches (vegetarian options listed conveniently for you!), bagels, pastries, etc. 

Also an eclectic variety of caffeine drinks! They have the standard espresso drinks, but there are also ones with cardamom and others. 

It's a nice open space, has ample wind and it has this peaceful vibe to it. I love it, you will probably see me here a lot. Small bench outside, a couple tables set right next to the outdoors. 

Love this place."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-08-13,4.0,"Totally unassuming place with great sandwiches and bagels! I got the tomato, mozzarella and basil on a plain bagel this morning and it was delicious. The tomato sauce spread was especially good, and the bagels are so soft! I was on the run so I didn't get to take a pic of the warm, tomato-y goodness. But rest assured, I will be back. 4 and a half stars."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-05-11,5.0,A gem on the lower east side. It is cash only but they have an atm in shop. Their breakfast sandwiches are made to order and so delectable. The people who work here are so kind and service is fast.
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-12-15,2.0,"This review is just about their bagels.

I stopped in for a quick bagel, and was shocked to be charged $6.50. The chalkboard menu above the register doesn't give any pricing for bagel options, but does say that a bagel costs $1.35. I figured there was a mistake, so I politely asked why the scallion cream cheese cost $5 while the bagel cost about $1. This is a wildly higher price than any other in the city (including the legendary spots which could charge extra). The manager condescendingly scolded me, saying I don't understand how businesses work and he has to pay for the building rent and his employees. It was irrelevant, rude, and still doesn't explain the price discrepancy. $5 for the cream cheese on your $1 bagel?? On top of that, the bagel was a little smushed and soggy, and ultimately mediocre.

I won't speak to the other food or drink, but if you're looking for a good bagel in the area I'd walk a couple blocks to Heaven's Hot Bagels, or a little further to Russ & Daughters or Kossar's. You'll spend far less, get a better bagel, and not risk a pretentious encounter with the manager."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-06-13,1.0,"My friend had an incident at the end of March where there was a mix up with the cashier.  He paid for his coffee with a $20, but the cashier somehow thought he paid with a $5 (probably because he was trying to do multiple transactions at once).  My friend pointed out the mistake, but the cashier refused to give him the change.  They went back and forth for about 5 minutes and only after me and my other friends back him up did he finally relent and give the correct change (but with a nasty attitude).  

After the incident, my friend sent a message to the owner via yelp.  He didn't receive a response.  

I understand that people make mistakes.  But instead of admitting the mistake, the cashier continued to argue and give attitude.  And the owner didn't respond to my friend's complaint via private message (he didn't want to post a public negative review because he's too nice like that)."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-03-14,4.0,"Losing an hour to Daylight Savings on Sunday meant losing an hour for brunch, so we ordered in. We placed an order on UberEats around 10 am and it came under 20 minutes later-- now that's service.

I had smoked salmon, goat cheese, and capers on toasted wheat ($10). The salmon was decent quality and the goat cheese worked well with it. A sizeable breakfast. My boyfriend had a bacon, two egg, and cheese on ciabatta ($7) which was normal. The coffee ($2.50) was middling.

Good convenient pick."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-07-04,1.0,"Do NOT get bagels from here. Placed a delivery order and the bagels tasted so artificial and stale. The bacon, egg and cheese I ordered was on a multi-grain bagel even though I ordered an everything bagel. Additionally, the egg yolk was coming out even though I ordered over over hard. Lastly, there was no bacon on one half of the bagel. Do not recommend this place at all."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-10-04,4.0,"What could be better than a coffee shop with great bagels that's right around the corner from the laundromat? Native bean was just what i needed in that awkward 24-minute stretch while my clothes were in the washer. 

I ordered an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and an iced coffee. My coffee was ready, literally, immediately. Like I ordered it and had it in my hand 20 seconds later. The efficiency of Native Bean's staff is quite impressive and helpful if you're in a hurry! Even better, the coffee was great. 

My bagel was a bit on the pricier side, but not completely outrageous. It had a generous amount of the ""everything"" on top--although they included oats which i wasn't a huge fan of. The scallion cream cheese was great too. It wasn't overwhelmingly scallion-y and they obliged with my request to only put on a little. 

The staff were also very warm and friendly and the decor in Native Bean was cool, various hand-made weavings and ceramics."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2017-01-22,4.0,"Native Bean is a local cafe. It has great bagel options and a long list of sandwich possibilities. I usually order the #3 sandwich (ham, brie, apple slices, arugula) on a toasted multigrain bagel with a chai latte. Every time I visit Native Bean the food and service are consistent. It is a calm cafe environment and a comfortable space to get work done (there is WiFi for customers).
Great spot to grab a quick bite, it's not just for breakfast. It is CASH ONLY but there is an ATM available inside."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-10-06,5.0,"It's just very good food. Simple, uncomplicated and it has soul. Very good omelette. Reminds me of home cooking from mum and grandma. Healthy portions and fresh. Come here and eat your heart out."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-06-12,5.0,"I had the most delicious turkey, avocado, basil sandwich. Everything was so fresh, the guy was super nice. Totally recommend it."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-10-14,3.0,"The service is CRAZY slow, like even ordering a simple bagel with spread takes at least 10 minutes, that's if no one else is waiting. Also very overpriced and cash only, the quality/taste of their iced coffee is the only redeeming quality."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-05-30,4.0,"I came in here not realizing this place was cash only. I hate that! (Yes, they have an atm but who wants to pay that ridiculous fee).  So I think if this place accepted credit cards I would be more inclined to give it 4 solid stars (I think right now it's wavering bt 3.5 and 4)! I had an egg and cheese on a bagel, and it was yummy. My partner had the Tunisian omelette and thought it was spiced so well she didn't need cholula sauce.  The coffee was decent; if you don't want c&s, specify. The guys behind the counter were very friendly, and after you order they bring your food out to you so that was kind of nice. They have a few tables to sit at, and the temp inside was perfect."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2015-11-10,4.0,"The true local bagel place favorite!

Native bean offers all your breakfast favorites and more all served from the happiest and friendliest staff ever. When you walk into this cozy eccentric shop you notice it has truce character and is different than your typical bagel place. 

I stick with my typical bagel and cream cheese which are both always very good and fresh. The coffee here is also delicious which brings an added plus to this place.

If you ever live in the area or are stomping through early morning grab a bagel and coffee and head over to thompkins square park to relax with friends and watch the dogs in the dog park.

In short:
- Friendly Staff
- Great Fresh Food
- Local Favorite
- Good Coffee
- fair priced"
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2017-04-25,5.0,"I don't know how I would've spent my time in New York without native bean! 
Me and cousins went there every morning and never walked out disappointed. 
I had two omelettes #29 #30, and a kaiser roll with egg and cheese. Everything was fresh, delicious, and filling. The omelettes were served with your choose of bagel with butter and a small coffee. The guy taking the orders gave me refills on the coffee.
Overall great place for breakfast if you're in the east village."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-02-12,5.0,"My favorite bagel place in the area. I live in the neighborhood and come here frequently. I've tried different things, from smoothies to oatmeal and bagels (of course!) and I've never been disappointed.
It's also a good place to get some work done if you want to stay longer, their wifi is fast and they have music playing but it's not too loud which I like.
Very friendly staff also!"
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2017-02-01,4.0,"Great find next to my gym!
They have heathy options for post workout meals. They do get a little busy for the morning rush but the workers are super nice and work very hard to get orders out as quickly as possible."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-07-23,5.0,The customer service here is amazing. The men who made my sandwich were so kind and gave me a free water bottle (it was 90 degrees outside). I got a sandwich with chicken and avocado and it was pretty good. They also didn't charge extra for avocado instead of cheese which is rare in nyc. Love these guys!!
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-01-19,3.0,"All the workers here are great and super friendly, except for the Eastern European/white looking guy.
He charges inconsistently. Once I got a meal for $5 and the same meal I got for $8.50 another day. He has also messed up some of my orders in the past. I've seen him yelling at the other workers and it's just awful to watch. After inquiring, he is not even their boss.
I saw another customer order a tea and he poured some strange green liquid that was just sitting on the counter into her tea (you can't make this stuff up...) the customer and I exchanged a worried look, they tried their tea, and tossed it because it tasted off.

I've been here lots and want to keep coming for the generally decent prices, no-frills environment, and the other workers friendly faces. My repetitively strange experiences with this one guy just makes me scared to come back."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-03-11,4.0,"Spent the weekend in East Village, this place was just around the corner. Warm, friendly, and inviting. Bagels were great, coffee came with unrequested  cream and sugar."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-03-05,5.0,"Great, unassuming gem.

Delicious, reasonably priced quick food (sandwiches, juice, smoothies, omelets, bagels). My favourite is their multigrain bagel, I am so sad when I walk in and they've ran out. 
Friendly, smiling staff/owners.
Personal, familial vibe.

This little cafe is so much better all things considered than a lot of the pricier spots in the neighborhood!"
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-03-04,4.0,"I ordered an everything bagel with lox spread, a coffee, and a cookie for delivery. It delivered really quickly and came with a free rugelach which was so nice!! I have a nut allergy so I had to call and ask about it and sure enough it had nuts, but the guy I spoke to was SO friendly and accommodating and he even made a note for next time. 

The bagel itself was really good and there was a decent amount of spread! However, the bagel was slightly burnt on one side (but I happen to like bagels overdone) and the cookie was also over baked. The coffee was good though!

Overall, great for the price and tasty bagels, they just need to keep an eye on cook time, with outstanding customer service!! :) will order from here again."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2019-02-09,2.0,Poor customer service. Had to wait 10mins for them to make a bagel with cream cheese and they forgot about me.
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-08-17,5.0,"Amazing food, prices, drinks (coffee!), atmosphere, people! 'Nuff said, Too bad I'm a tourist..."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-06-21,5.0,Such amazing food and costumer service. Never been to a friendlier place where I felt so at home. 10 out of 10 recommend to everyone!
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2017-03-10,5.0,I love this place! The garlic bagels are simply amazing. The prices are great. For a 2 egg and cheese bagel it is under $5!! They also don't charge extra for egg whites which is amazing too. Other bagel places in this area would be $10 easily. I usually order delivery and they've never gotten my order wrong. I always get an iced coffee too and it's never spilt. I have eaten there too and brought my laptop. They have free wifi. They have a good amount of seating for the size. My boyfriend usually gets the sandwiches on ciabatta and they're under $9. They are CASH ONLY.
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2015-02-11,5.0,"Great coffee, awesome spot. About a million times better than Starbucks and not a corporate spot.

The other thing I like about this coffee shop is that it that it isnt completely filled with hipsters wearing skinny jeans and lenseless reading glasses, holding up a Hemingway novel that they will never read trying to appear relevant while flipping the same page back and forth while listening to arcade fire on their iPhone."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2015-01-18,4.0,"New Place!  Same Face! Ibrahim (Sounds like Abraham), Iclriss and new partner Nester moved one block over from 50 Avenue A to this new location. Bagels and fillings are the same, Coffee the same, even the tables. 

The significant difference is the lighting,  elbow room(not so many tables but more space per tab located ) & front facade during the summer time. No more open canopy, so dog walks in  area beware. they upgraded the size of the grill for hot breakfast.  Stay away from the Moscow bagel and
the chocolate croissant, sweet on the lips, you'll get thick in your hips."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-06-05,5.0,"This is for their postmate service review. My food is usually prepared right away, really this is very very important for breakfast delivery, because you do not want to wait for an hour for weekend breakfast (unlike some of the other postmate breakfast options). So I always start my weekend with an order from Native Bean. The bagels are good and reasonably priced. Coffee is not bad either. 

Hands down, one of my favorite place for postmate breakfast order! 

- Lazy-Sat-Sunday-morning-lover

P.S. after reading all the other reviews, I realized a common theme here - friendly, inviting, smiling store environment. This is precious in NYC and it is so good to hear that my breakfast is prepared by these lovely people (even tho I have never met them yet). More reasons to visit them in store!"
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-05-21,5.0,Hidden bagel gem! One of the best bacon egg and cheese in NY. Haven't been in awhile but the staff is so sweet. Delivery option is perfect to cure my hangovers. Yum!!
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-10-27,5.0,My go to bagel place in EV!!! Their vegetarian bagels are my absolute favorite and I find myself coming back every weekend. Also such a friendly staff
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2017-12-03,5.0,Great spot. Great selection of sandwiches and the staff are quick and efficient. Bagels are top notch and goat cheese is delicious. Try the #6.
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2017-10-27,5.0,"This is my favorite local coffee shop- they have everything, are friendly, speak French, and it's just the best."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-02-02,1.0,"It's the worst restaurant in the neighborhood, one time I wanted to go the bathroom but I went to the basement where they make their food cause I thought the restroom is downstairs , I saw a black guy who's obviously working with them making chicken or tuna salad by his hand not even with a spoon and he was sweating . I agree that the environment is good in this place but when we decide to go to a restaurant we look for the quality of food because we don't get Poisoning."
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2018-01-28,5.0,"Native bean is the nicest environment ever created in east village! When I'm hungover and seamless, Gatorade is not on the menu. Instead they let me order a ""green tea"" which is now code for red Gatorade! It's the kind of support you need!"
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2016-01-10,4.0,"First experience: 2 stars- First time I went they messed up our order and the person's order in front of us (siiiigh, why I am I so unlucky with these shops?). We ordered 2 small coffees, #1 bagel, bagel with lox and the price came out to be around $23 (we learned the second time we came, we were overcharged). Good thing I checked our bag as we walked out, since I realized there was only one coffee inside and when we went back and told the people they realized that they messed up our order and the girl's order in front of us who already left the store.

Second experience: 4 stars- Today, I went again and finally everything went seamlessly! We ordered the #1 bagel with lox ($9), tomato, onion, and cream cheese, another bagel with lox (roughly $4), and 2 small coffees for $18.

The people who work in the store are incredibly friendly. Personally I like Native Bean more than Heaven's (But I like Heaven's coffee) Every time I've been there, the place is relatively busy, but not completely chaotic, and there are people quietly chatting at one of the many tables. You can also get hot foods too like omelettes, but I've always just gotten their bagels.  

*Tip: Double check your orders if you are getting something to-go and also double check the prices of your food to make sure they charge the correct amount.

*Cash Only"
155,native-bean-new-york-2,2016-06-14,5.0,"Super good food! Best sandwich I've had in a long time. I got the avocado, egg and arugula sandwich and it was amazing! And the onion bagel, also really good. I would totally recommend."

156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2018-03-04,4.0,"Macau style egg tarts are much tastier than the regular ones most bakery sells.
Just wish they were bigger for the $1.20 price.
Next best thing to the real deal in HK."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2020-02-02,1.0,"I can't even say that I'm reviewing the food because apparently I couldn't come in? 

I arrived at 6:52, peeked my head in and immediately the first woman I Saahirah shook her head at me. I asked, are you closed? And she responded ""You can't come in. No."" 

I promptly left and tried to find another bakery to no avail. 

I walked back in the direction of this bakery to catch my train and lo and behold, minutes after 7 were upwards of 7 guests being served, one was even sitting down enjoying his pastry ever so slowly. 

I walked in once again and was once again told I couldn't come in even though there were customers in the store. 

I hate to be this person, but as the only person of darker skin in this establishment I'm forced to think that this is the reason I wasn't considered a customer like the other guests."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2019-10-28,4.0,"I love their egg tarts - I think they might be the best in the city. The pork buns are great too fresh out of the oven. Getting a seat here is difficult, lots of aunties and uncles just sitting around drinking milk tea and chatting, or reading the newspaper."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2019-03-05,1.0,"I'm on the hunt for a decent Chinese bakery, so I stopped by this place since it seemed super busy, there was a big selection of buns, and there were ads showing off their fresh Portuguese tarts.  I had really high hopes for this place, so I bought 5 things to try: taro bun, pineapple bun, brown sugar steamed rice cupcake with red beans （缽仔糕）, Portuguese tart, and a cocktail bun. 

Starting off with the buns - I gotta say, they were hands down the worst buns I've ever had.  They were hard, dense, and when I bit through them, you could see how solid it was.  I really doubt that the buns I got were fresh - it seriously seemed like it was at least 3 days old.  Even when I have fresh bakery goods bagged up overnight on my counter - they are still softer than the buns I got from this place.  All 3 were almost inedible.  

The rice cupcake didn't seem to have the right chewy texture.  Its supposed to have a bit of bite to it, but this one just mushed apart in my mouth. 

As for these famous Portuguese tarts - maybe mine was overcooked? But when I cut into it, the egg custard seemed more on the stiff side, not silky smooth. 

I really didn't want to give them 1 star, but each item I bought failed miserably."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2019-08-06,4.0,"I came here during the off hours, so around 2-3pm. I didn't expect much good customer service or anything considering that all I came for was the Portuguese egg tarts. I thought it was quite pricey that one egg tart was $1.35, but after tasting one I found out why. The egg filling is thick and very filling, which to some people is a good thing, but for me it was too much. The tart is crispy and has the happy medium between soft and hard. Would go back again considering that they had a good amount of Portuguese egg tarts at the hour."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2019-01-19,3.0,"I used to get the breads here more often, but after trying breads from other Chinatown bakeries, the food here just can't compare. Their sponge cake is much sweeter and not as bouncy as those of other bakeries. However, they have a large selection of breads such as lemon and taro, which are my favorite whenever I do come here. They also have whole roll cakes for $7 that come in a variety of flavors, including green tea, vanilla, chocolate, and a few more. There are many savory buns as well, which I have yet to try. 

I like coming here because it is in a less crowded area of Chinatown and so it does not seem to be as packed as the other bakeries around. Double Crispy Bakery is worth one try for the many Chinese delicacies it has to offer, but there are other bakeries that you can find that offer the same."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2020-01-29,3.0,"Solid, fairly priced no-frills Chinese bakery. I tried their macau and regular egg tarts as well as their pineapple bun and pork floss bun. The tarts were good-- flakey crust, good custard, though on the smaller side and the buns were decent, if not a bit dense."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2019-06-26,5.0,This bakery has the best egg tarts! Their Portuguese style egg tarts are so delicious. I also really like their shredded dry pork buns. Highly recommend. Also very inexpensive! This is definitely one of the more authentic Chinese bakeries there are many Chinese grandmas here having their milk teas and buns!
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2019-08-04,4.0,"Not gonna lie--their staff IS a little rude, even to a Canto-speaking (albeit ABC) patron! But I guess ya gotta grow some thick skin and struggle a bit for authenticity. In spite of the less-than-warm welcome, I took home a sponge cake, a pineapple bun and a coconut (cocktail) bun for a few dollars. That's what I love most about Chinatown bakeries--they're all so cheap! Because I was stuffed from lunch, I took the breads home and enjoyed them the next day. When reheated in a toaster oven, they tasted just as good as if they were just baked. The crumbly, flaky crust on the pineapple bun had just the right amount of sweetness. The cocktail bun was loaded with shredded coconut. The sponge cake was ultra fluffy and brought me back to my youth. They made for the perfect tea time treat. In addition to the bread case, they have lots of other baked goods as well including egg tarts, swiss rolls and cakes. They're sure to have your mooncakes when the season rolls around too. If you're looking for a classic Canto bakery, Double Crispy is it."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2018-08-17,2.0,"I heard the wife cake is the best one in the city's Chinatown, and was also eager to try the variety of baked buns. 

Upon entering, the ladies working there were very pushy as I was thinking about what to buy. When I did end up asking for help, they weren't even able to find what I was looking for. I found them myself.

The wife cake was tiny and bland. I didn't expect that from a place that's supposed to be known for their wife cakes (Serious Eats, you've failed me). 

Then I moved on with higher hopes for the taro bun. For reference, I love taro things. The bun's pastry was too tough and chewy. I didn't get to the taro filling until getting far into the pastry. The filling itself was bland like the wife cake.

I threw both of them out after a few bites. Fortunately it's so cheap I don't mind throwing it out if it sucks."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2018-07-21,2.0,"Good low prices, but the pastries here are dry and lack flavor. I'd recommend the Fay Da Bakery instead. 

I got the chocolate cartoon cake and coconut cake, each of which were about $1.30 including tax.

The cake bread itself was dry and lacked flavor; and the icing tasted very mediocre. They looked cute though! I wouldn't come here again for sweet pastries, but maybe I'll come back and try their other breads one day."

I have to give a shout out to their mochi. I got the green tea mochi. They were soft and chewy without being overly sweet. Bought 2 and 1 survived the trip back home to Boston. The mochi lived for another day in the fridge. When I ate it the next day straight out of the fridge, I was surprised to find the mochi was still soft and chewy.

Kinda difficult for mochi to retain its soft and chewy texture after 24 hours. 

Will definitely be back next time around for more mochi. I think they have peanut mochi too but were sold out the day I was there. Hopefully they make a red bean mochi.

Also got their red bean rice dumplings and put chai koh. Forgettable. Stock with the mochi."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2017-05-26,2.0,"There's a lot of great Chinese bakeries in NYC, but this is not one of them.

Walking in, the place is already kind of small and there's not a lot of seating. You may end up sharing a table with strangers. I don't think this is too uncommon in these sort of places so you can tell yourself you're getting the authentic experience if you'd like. However when I went, the tables were dirty and it didn't seem like they've been wiped down recently. In fact, that was the vibe I got from the whole place. I can't tell if everything is dirty or just old. 

The bread tasted fine. Not bad, but also not amazing. They have a pretty wide selection of bread, but still less than other bakeries in the area. I also had their taro boba tea and it was one of worse ones I've had. The boba was actually pretty good. The texture was almost perfect, but it was really inconsistent with some of the boba being undercooked and too hard to chew. The tea part was made from powder, which a lot of places do, but what I had was too watered down and flavorless. I might as well have been drinking water with a little bit of purple food coloring.

The service was meh. Not bad for a Chinese place.

Conclusion: Chinese bakeries are not hard to find in Chinatown. Go to another one."

Food is phenomenal. Nice location, busy, freshly made. 

Good choice for bakery."
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2017-04-09,5.0,"This is my go to spot for egg tarts in Chinatown - the only place, actually, I'll get them from. I make excuses to come to CT just to get these. The Portuguese style Macau egg tarts (caramelised on top) with a blow torch are my favourite, at 1.20$ (formerly 1.10$ - I blame you, gentrification). 
As with most Chinese bakeries, this is a family run business and everything is made fresh in the morning. A lot of hard work, blood sweat and tears to into it, and it amazes me how little inflation has happened over the years. But back to the food! 
As a self-proclaimed egg tart connoisseur who's tried them all over the world (Hong Kong, NYC, LA, SF, Chicago, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, London, etc.), I can safely say this is one of the top 5 I've had. Here are the 5 criteria I use to judge them on:
1) Crust - must be flaky and crumble as you take a bite. Lard + flake over shortbread crust every time. 
2) Colour - must be a natural light yellow, not pale, not big bird, natural light. 
3) Texture - the top should be a thin layer of congealed baked egg, and the inside somewhat runny with the consistency of pudding. When you take your first bite, the filling should fall out like a finance Bro who's had 5 too many tumbling out of the uber when the passenger door opens. 
4) Taste - proper egg tarts have a natural sweetness to them but a subtle, hearty, comforting, savoury egg taste remaining. 
5) Moisture - most of all, you will know a good egg tart when you see one because the top will have a natural meniscus of baked condense. 
Double crispy hits all of these out of the park (except the last one - since its caramelised, it skips this). Enjoy!"

I was a little dissapointed at first but oh man was I wrong. The egg tarts here are freaking awesome. Crunchy crust on the outside, fluffy warm goodness on the inside. Not too sweet but tasty and flavorful filling. Pretty cheap as well. Thank god I don't live close by because I'd be getting these tarts everyday. Will be back!"

156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2015-04-22,3.0,"Overall, I was rather unimpressed by their buns. Having tried their egg tarts during my first visit a while ago and finding them satisfying, I had high hopes when I decided to try their buns. 

The ones that I like:
-as I have already mentioned before, their egg tarts are delicious; they have Portuguese, regular egg, and egg whites at the register and they were all really satisfying. Prices and sizes are standard
-""milk and egg"" bun: I'm not quite sure why it's called that since there's no milk or egg inside the bun but instead a rather sweet crusty top; the bread itself is soft, although personally I would love to have some filling
-sweet potato bun: the most memorable one I had and by far my favorite one; the bun is soft and is filled to the rim; the filling is smooth and perfectly sweetened. Together it has the texture of mochi, chewy and glutinous. They somehow even manage to get some amount of sweet potato mush on the top of the bread, making it a rather nice presentation

Anything else:
custard bun: bread is dry; didn't get to the filling until half way done with the bun
baked char siu bun: very little filling (only the bottom 1/3 or upper is filled; mostly onions, very little meat; but if you dig onions, they are fresh and crunchy)
Taiwanese pineapple bun: I don't see anything taiwanese about it; it resembles a pineapple bun with some raisins on top, but instead of having butter crust, it is laid with condensed-milk crust; it doesn't have any filling, although it would be nice to have some

Service:
Typical Chinatown service, you know what it is"
156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2012-11-09,4.0,"I love this bakery. So many choices and they all look so good!

Today I went the simple route, the Butterfly Cookie ($1). Excellent choice,a flaky pastry that's light and crispy but oh so sweet, loved it. (See photo) They have a huge display case of buns and pastries on the left-hand side as you walk in, I saw lots of good buns to try. I'll definitely be back to explore this place further.

One exception, there was a bun in the display case called the ""Bug Bun"" I think I'll avoid that one.

Two thumbs up from me on the Double Crispy. Enjoy!"

156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2017-02-23,5.0,"Love this bakery, its close to my apartment so I go here probably weekly. Coffee is good, all of the breads and different buns are great. I bring them to my coworkers sometimes in the morning and they always love it. The prices are low and the quality is high. I think that is always a plus. Its cash only, but as long as you have 3 bucks you can get quite a few things. They are quick to help and check out. Its a little busier in the morning. If you go in the evening the food in the warmer might be a little old. But I love this place, and will continue to be a regular customer."

Their goopy chicken pot pie,

Holding bits of subpar meat,

Did very little to move my foodie heart.

156,double-crispy-bakery-new-york,2012-03-30,3.0,"Didn't get anything here but the Portuguese Egg Tart.

For some reason, a friend of mine craved an egg tart while we were exploring Chinatown so Yelped around a bit and found that they have egg tarts here at Double Crispy!

Went in and found the place was packed with Cantonese-speaking locals.  That's definitely a good sign!  Majority of them were sitting down drinking milk tea or coffee and just chatting.  On the left side there's a huge display case with all sorts of buns and baked goods but we came it for one thing and that was the egg tart!

We ended up getting the Portuguese egg tart and I was a little bit disappointed when I found out it was cold.  Portuguese egg tart is at its best when it is hot, and while it doesn't have to be straight out of the oven, I wish it was at least warm.

Now, the big difference between a normal egg custard tart and the Portuguese variation is that the Portuguese egg custard has a consistency that's more like a creme brulee and when it is heated, you can tell by the characteristic burnt look at the top of the custard.  However, since it was cold, the egg custard somewhat settled so it was like.. a normal egg tart with that burnt top.  The egg tart was still pretty good though and the size of the egg tart was very surprising!  It i's double the size of most egg tarts that I've had.

Just for the egg tart, Double Crispy is alright."

As an avid Asian bread-eater, everything tasted delicious. The pork bun actually felt fresh with the pork and the crunch of the onions. It didn't feel so processed or gross as it might at times. The bread is soft but still chewy and has a subtle sweetness that I enjoy. The service is okay. Someone is always there to help bag bread for people, but they are just kind of there. I would come back for the bread."

Ad Hoc is one of my favorite spots in NYC - the perfect west side coffee shop with inventive takes on coffee and the menu of food you always want to see. There really aren't enough positives I can say about this space. 

Ad Hoc is exactly what home feels like. Each mug is different, an electric combination of furniture and fixtures, a warm space to go to on a cold winter day, or spot you want to meet a friend for a coffee catch-up. The vibe here is one of the biggest selling points. There's no other cafe in the village where I want to go when I need to get some work done but want a change of scenery.

The vibe isn't the only selling point: all drinks are delicious. I have yet to have anything I don't like... and doubt that will ever happen. The food is also incredible, and if Keet is around, you can probably have her create something for you.

Finally, the best part is the staff. Everyone here is so wonderful - from the baristas to Keet (the owner). It makes Ad Hoc even more special among New York's overly saturated coffee/cafe scene."

If you followed my NYC coffee shop hunt adventures for getting some work done, you'd know I always look for four things: a good latte, free wifi, outlets, and a restroom. I'd say this place satisfies 3ish out of the four. They have outlets and a restroom, but my drink and the time limit on the stay :( for me.

I ordered the honey lavender latte, but this one did mainly had just very sweet honey taste and not so much of the lavender. 

Another thing is that this place has lots of rules regarding laptops and duration of stay posted next to the cashier area. One of them was one hour limit per purchase - I wish it was 2 hour limit, but I totally understand the rules considering the size of the place and they wouldn't want you to stay there for centuries to come.

Overall, I really like the vibe of this place and would come again, but probably not to get work done because the time limit is too short for me."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2018-11-19,4.0,"I'm having dinner in Atlantic City at Chef Michael Symons restaurant. I peep his Instagram account and see he was here and raving about the place. I'm going to be in NYC over the weekend, lemme see what the hub bub is all about.

First off, if you're looking for this spot be alert. There's some basement action going on, there's a tiny black plaque that says Coffee Shop. It's a neighborhood thing for sure.

Once I step inside, man this is a small spot. I mean, it's so small my pantry can kick it's ass. It's small. However, I see the Ferrari of coffee machines on the counter and that gets a pass. 

There are many flavored lattes, I'm not sure if I want to step too far out of my comfort zone. I see as a choice a Velvet Cafe Au Late. I ask the barista what is this drink? She explains it's their cold brew made hot again and the result is a silky coffee. Sold!

It's early Sunday morning and my wife is in the car. The reason why I stopped, our hotel offered a continental breakfast and she had only a tea. I asked the barista if I could order an egg white and chicken apple sausage on multigrain bread to go. I also see some outrageous looking muffins but no cookies? I asked if they have biscotti, they do I'm told. 

Now I'm looking at the barista. She has her hair up and she's in some sort of, yoga pants wearing get up. She turns around and starts frying eggs!! In your face stupid Starbucks!? In my eyes she's a coffee superhero to me at this point. 

I see her take the Chicken- Apple sausage out of a packet and that biscotti?? Was a Costco Nonnas biscotti. However! All these millennials love avocado on Toast and there was dishes coming out with topped with a single egg that I could be down with for breakfast. 

In the end, the coffee was good and I'm the husband of the year for getting my wife a breakfast she'd enjoy.

I enjoyed the beet root latte with a shot of espresso which was good! Next time I'd like to try the beet root tea just as tea and not a latte. It is made from powder so think of like matcha powder, you can have it with water or with steamed milk and then add espresso as you wish. You got options! Other items I was eyeing on the menu were the different oat milk lattes and also the Reese Pieces Mocha. Mmmmm sounds good for next time! Also, if it weren't for those fancy drinks, I would've ordered a cup of black coffee to try the roast on its own being that it is wood roasted! Dope. 

My husband enjoyed a honey lavender latte and killed it so it must've been good. 

Pastries caught my eye but my belly was too full to try. Again next time. 

Be sure to knock on the office door before entering. It's the loo.

157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-03-08,5.0,"Charming, cozy, and small; the WiFi works super well. Sorry Cindy!

Thank you Ad Hoc!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-01-25,5.0,"Really a wonderful place, was very happy to support. I can be a bit of a coffee snob and I was in the mood for something of a high standard the particular evening I dropped in (literally, as it's below ground, very charming!), but I also just wanted a cozy place to take care of some items and to support a local business, which is the real reason why I arrived. 
I was so pleased because everything hit the mark. Coffee is by a small roaster out of Maine, and a delicate single origin espresso was on offer that day. Refreshing to see when most coffee houses have a basic, dark chocolate espresso blend (..which still has it's place). Skillfully prepared, very good foaming skills for a cortado, in a beautiful China ceramic to boot. I only know one other shop that does that. 
Moreover, it was entirely quaint and cozy, very easy to relax or converse with the barista (counter seating ++) or whomever else. It was like an espresso bar in a living room. Makes me happy such a humble and pleasant space can still make it in the West Village."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-03-27,5.0,"Awesome coffee, great atmosphere in the heart of West Village, very cozy! It's one of those hidden spots you hope to stumble upon from time to time in the village"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-09-05,5.0,Just wandering around the neighborhood and found this quaint coffeehouse. I was greeted with such warmth. Cant wait to return and try everything!
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2018-11-24,5.0,"I came here on a cold and rainy Saturday afternoon looking for a nice relaxing coffee shop to reflect and mentally prepare for the upcoming week. The coffee is expertly made.  If you are a coffee snob like myself, you will enjoy the wood roasted coffee.  My wife had the beet latte which was unusual yet very delicious.  The barista was exceptionally friendly and very helpful in helping us pick out our drinks.  The music is relaxing.  It is a very nice and non pretentious place to enjoy a good coffee and relax.  Give this place a try, you won't regret it!!!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-04-11,5.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVE ad hoc!!!!! Keet, the owner, has the most incredible staff!!!! The food is always incredible, regardless of the cook. The insane attention to detail and professionalism within this beautiful coffee shop in unmatched. 11/10 would 5000% recommend!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-07-01,5.0,"From the moment you walk in you are at home. Great coffee, great snacks (sangita - my mouth is melting as I type this). You can tell who the owner is right away because she makes you feel like you are at home instantly. Definitely a place to stop while checking out the iconic gay/Christopher street crossing."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-04-07,5.0,"It's a bizarre, almost Alice in Wonderland atmosphere with quaint but retro furniture and china. Everything is supposedly for sale inside the shop. Most importantly, the coffee knocked my socks off. The cortado here is one of the best I've ever had, with very bright and refreshing fruit flavors. Will definitely come back."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2018-11-01,5.0,Great spot!! The best is they have a menu of ingredients and can make you whatever you want. And delicious Good for working too.
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-02-21,5.0,"This coffee shop is amazing. It is a great atmosphere to either meet friends or do work in a cozy atmosphere. The lattes are unique and delicious, and the mixes of flavors in each one is brilliant. In terms of non-dairy options, they have soy, oat, and macadamia milk, and some of their most popular lattes have cardamon and honey in them. They're yummy but not too sweet, and super foamy. You can get them in a cute mug or a to-go cup.

Additionally, I left my AirPods there by accident (they are so easy to lose,) called them up a week later and nobody had taken them! They were so caring and kind to me, and explained that it is such a safe space that nobody took them, and that they would be waiting for me when I returned. Such an incredible place - I highly recommend!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2018-06-12,5.0,"Is one of the most cute, cozy and comfortable coffees I ever been, I am always looking for places like this.
The decoration is amazing, super original, great music and very friendly service.
I loved this spot!!! 
It's a perfect place if you want to relax and do your stuff.
I'm definitely coming back!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-02-28,5.0,Cute neighborhood coffee spot with the sweetest staff! I forgot my laptop charger at home and the owner/manager went way out of her way to help me find one without my prompting. This place and its people are a treasure!
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2017-10-15,5.0,"This is the best kept secret of the West Village!  Think of it as an extended living room in your favorite design magazine with great coffee and company on tap. After you fall in love with it, you can bring home one of your favorite curated pieces with you. 

For a newly-minted Seattleite visiting NY, good coffee is always appreciated. The wood roasted coffee here is unique and delicious. The oat milk lattes are amazing and subtle. 

I picked up two of their tea towels, a cool tape measure, and an awesome hand-woven blanket with a good cause. I wish I could have brought home more, like their cool ""EXIT"" sign lightbulb. Sadly, that was not for sale. 

I'm glad I discovered this hidden gem before it becomes the talk of the village."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2017-07-30,5.0,"Like drinking a smooth cappuccino in the living room of a West Village brownstone. Such a charming spot run by a very pregnant and beautiful woman who lives just across the street. After doing a ton of small-business consulting in SF, she moved to NYC and now runs this coffee shop/breakfast spot where every single thing is for sale - from the couch that you sit on, to the pillows, to the chairs, to the vases etc. so you, too, could feel like (and spend like) a West Village millionaire. 

The coffee was actually superb too, which was a delightful surprise. So smooth and delicious - nothing bitter about it. Would certainly come back and stay a while. 

5 stars!!!!!!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2018-08-29,5.0,"Ad Hoc Collective deserves a 5 stars review. I accidentally found this place earlier today, and decided to give it a try. It's a hidden coffee shop along with variety of home decoration products. I love everything inside and everything just felt right. The causal vibe, great hospitality and nice crowd makes this place so perfect and flawless. The barista politely introduced herself to me and told that they've been here for a year. If I had known I would've come sooner. It could become my favorite place to grab coffee. They also serves a good collections of food menu, don't hesitate to ask barista about their food menu. I like their coffee it's very smooth and tasty. I can't wait to revisit!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2018-12-16,5.0,"I was seeking respite from the rain and this place appeared as if sent from heaven. Delightful ambiance, a sonic space filled with jazz and joyful banter, much to love."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-03-29,4.0,"Love this coffee shop. You walk down into lower garden level of a sweet west village building, and the ambiance is everything you want your coffee shop to be. The coffee is good and the food was definitely 5 stars alone. We had a salmon lox with cream cheese and a bagel with egg cucumber and tomato. Both were fantastic. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because it took about 30 minutes to get my bagel from when I ordered it. My friend got her bagel after 15 minutes and then she was done by the time mine even arrived. I will definitely go back an give another chance though, because everything else was great!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2018-08-25,5.0,"This cafe is excellent. The food is homemade and the the coffee is delicious. You won't find a friendlier staff that genuinely care about their customers in the west village.

If you're into antiques there's a variety of furniture and fixtures available. Love it."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2017-06-29,5.0,"I'm completely charmed by this place!

I stumbled across this coffee shop/homewares boutique while on vacation. It's very interesting as everything inside is available for purchase. They sell decorative items and accessories with a modern-vintage aesthetic, and all of it gives you that understated-luxury vibe. One item that screamed my name was adorable bohemian tote in charcoal. I didn't walk out with it, and now I'm hoping it'll still be there when I go back. 

As for the coffee, it hit the spot. I had the cold brew with almond milk, which was smooth and very strong. They said that their beans were wood fire roasted, which I think gave it more body... or I could have just appreciated the body who served it to me . Very cute.

I will be dropping by this place every time I'm in the area."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-02-08,5.0,"As a 20-year Greenwich Village resident, Ad Hoc Collective is my favorite cafe.

Low-key, friendly, welcoming, charming, simple, unhurried . . . the opposite of a national chain. This morning, for example, I arrived before my friend, so I spoke to the owner while I waited, as she prepared food by hand for a couple regular customers. She chopped the vegetables, fried them, and crafted a dish into something beautiful before my eyes. The other dish, a fruit plate, could have been a work of art.

Meanwhile we chatted about life, the neighborhood, and so on. Other customers worked and spoke quietly.

If you want impersonal, loud, plastic, get-your-coffee-and-get-out, you can find many alternatives. If you want quiet, cozy, and personal, where the owner can tell you every ingredient because she sourced and prepared it, on a charming block, in a historic neighborhood convenient to the subway: Ad Hoc Collective."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2018-05-22,5.0,"The best of the West village in one cozy spot.  Grab a coffee and chill in this hidden gem (food is also delicious).  Keet, the owner will know you by name if you walk in a second time."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-07-15,5.0,"So friendly and calm, and excellent food (I had a breakfast sandwich with fried egg and apples and it was great!).  It's great whether you want friendly chat, or to be left alone with your book or laptop - in any case it's comfortable and cozy. I will be back!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2018-04-16,5.0,"This is a bittersweet review, personally. Mainly because the place was so AWESOME that I am concerned with more people in the world knowing about it.

It was unlike any typical coffee shop. It was all the things you would hope for in a place like this. it was homely, employees and customers were nice, it was super comfortable seating, and obviously fast internet and accessible outlets.

Their is an additional kick to this venue. It has a lot of cool vintage items for sale. Something to look at, when you are taking a break from work or conversation.

Long story short. Great place. Worth trying."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2017-07-08,5.0,"Love this place! It's awesome in here, the owner is super sweet and attentive. The menu is completely ad hoc so what ever you'd like as long as ingredients are on stock from breakfast to Lunch ! 

The ambiance is really smooth, music is time and weather appropriate, antique furniture and all displays are for sale ! How cool. It's not a chain company which in my opinion adds to the chill vibes!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-06-02,5.0,"Walking down the stairs and into this cafe was like walking in to a low-key, ongoing house party. The staff joked with the regulars who streamed in an out to share details of their day, tell jokes, offer brain teasers, and catch up on each others' lives. It was a privilege just to be welcomed temporarily into this warm community, but the rose hot chocolate that I ordered was also a terrific way to recover from a rough night. I felt included, and I also felt that they read the signals that I also needed a little space to myself, to read and get ready for the day. The lovely woman behind the counter is a gifted cook and a generous spirit. The space is cozy and eclectic, like a living room, as others have said. If you need a space where you feel welcome and cared for, this is it. Thanks to them for making this traveler feel at home!"
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2019-06-02,5.0,"What a nice place. I wanted to escape and be somewhere different whilst in the city. I worked here for a few hours. The team were nice, the environment was great a long with the tea an coffee. As a local I will come back."
157,ad-hoc-collective-new-york,2018-10-23,5.0,Awesome and cozy place. The barista was very nice and friendly. Try the rose oat milk matscha! Delish!

158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2020-01-17,5.0,"Cuuuuuuuuute! I love this little bakeshop. I've stopped in a couple times just for a coffee and can vouch wholeheartedly for their lattes and the really friendly baristas. I even pulled out my laptop and got a little work done last time I stopped in and never felt rushed or in the way, even in this teeny tiny shop. They have lots of tables outside for when the weather isn't too cold and they probably have about 8-10 stools inside as well. 

What else do ya need to know?! Just go get some good coffee, maybe a hot cocoa, and lots and lots of cookies. Everything looked mouthwatering. I absolutely need to indulge next time I stop in."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2020-05-05,5.0,I've been there a couple of times since I am from Brazil and often miss my home country goodies... so I had my brigadeiro bday cake from there this year and was the best brigadeiro cake I've had in a long time! I am in love! Thank you sweet corner team for making this difficult bday an amazing one!
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2020-05-14,5.0,Just got the fudgiest brownie from this cute corner shop. delicious!!
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2020-01-13,4.0,"hopped in here because we were craving something sweet, we got the chocolate chocolate chip cookie and it was absolutely insane. I'm gluten-free and I still had a bite. The staff was super friendly and they even gave us a free cheese ball."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2020-01-05,5.0,"You really can't go wrong with anything you get here.  Rodolfo Goncalves is the baker/owner, and everything he does is perfection. You've probably seen his giant nutella hearts - they went viral online not too long ago - but his baked goods are so much better IMHO.  His cookies are so good they'll make you cry, and he makes a mean passionfruit cheesecake so definitely make sure to pay him a visit if you're in the Big Apple."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-04-15,3.0,"Oy, I REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to love this piece of cake so much! But the cake itself was dry and crumbly and the raspberry jam inbetween each colorful layer was a bit overpowering. When I think of a rainbow cookie cake, I guess my tastebuds were expecting the usual dark chocolate ganache layer that helps counter balance that raspberry flavor. The buttercream frosting on the outside was light and delightful though. 

Checked in with Yelp and received a free cheese bread and that was just... ok. 

Staff is really nice and it's a really cute spot regardless!"
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-10-27,5.0,"I didn't know I loved Nutella until my cookie was full of it! 

Service was great! The guys greeted us immediately. I ordered a red velvet w/ Nutella cookie and the chocolate chip w/ cheesecake cookie. My guy ordered a slice of Oreo cheesecake. 

Each cookie was a little over $4. Worth it.
I couldn't finish the cookies in one sitting; had to revisit them. What I love most is the fact that the actual cookie, minus the fancy filling, tastes great! Before you reach the cheesecake, the chocolate chip cookie is great. Same with the red velvet option. 

Before leaving, they offered to warm the cookies, which contributed to the amazing texture. 

Can't wait to return! I'm hooked."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-04-15,5.0,"I was around the area and decided to stop by and see what they had.
I was pleasantly surprised when I realized they had
A gluten free peanut butter cookie! Which was really good.
The cookie was nice and chewy in the center and had a bit of crunch on the outside. It was overly sweet , the flavors were well balanced. 
I also picked up a chocolate chip cookie and sea salad chocolate chip for a sick friend. 
My friend loved the cookies, literally devoured them in one sitting.
They also have the brazilIan cheese bread, which was also gluten free.
They also have a trix brownie, which is really good! 

The service was awesome, they were patient and they were able to provide some great recommendations.

This is a place to stop by for a cookie or two if you're in the area."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-10-13,5.0,Warm cookies served all day??? Say no more! I (luckily) found this bakery one afternoon and am so glad I did! I got the confetti cookie (warmed up) and it was sooo good!!! Nice and thick and SOFT. Would absolutely come again!
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-02-03,5.0,"Swung by here on a Sunday afternoon; I had heard of their famous rainbow cake and wanted to check it out. It's a tiny little shop on the corner of a West Village street, with a few limited counter seats if you want to stop for a bite. They have plenty of bakery options to choose from, and I think everyone could find something they wanted.

I didn't end up getting the rainbow cake but instead opted for a coffee and their carrot cake. The carrot cake was phenomenal. They cut me a huge slice (which I got scarily close to finishing), and it was the perfect ratio of icing to cake. Carrot cakes often come with very heavy cream cheese icing but this one was lighter and I could eat more of it. Definitely plan to come back soon to try their other items, and hopefully the rainbow cake!"
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2020-02-06,5.0,"This cookie is amaze-balls. Seriously, I was so pleasantly surprised. Tastes like your grandma's homemade cookies--but with better chocolate and the perfect amount of sea salt. I usually will save half of my cookie for later but I downed this whole thing. It is in such a cute area of the city as well and the employee working was so nice and accommodating. WILL BE BACK PLENTY OF TIMES."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-08-24,4.0,Tried this amazing chocolate mousse cake slice. The slice is pretty big than what I would expect. It's nice and moist !
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-07-31,5.0,"This place truly IS sweet. 

I'll admit, I can be a terrible New Yorker sometimes and finding this gem was one of those times. While I don't typically have much reason to pop down to this corner of the village, I am glad I did today. Just another sign I should come by the water more often. 

I stopped in for a quick coffee and to get some work done before meeting a gal pal for a manicure. Boy am I glad I did. I ordered the Tropical Feelings smoothie made up only of Orange Juice, Pineapple and Mango and before I knew it.... I was in transported to an island paradise just one block from the Hudson with a raspberry tart in hand. 

Outside, I did find it very hard to get work done because I was so incredibly distracted by the deliciousness of what I assumed to be a simple pastry. I'm not kidding when I say I have zero guilt over eating this thing... and I've already tweeted that I'm on a juice cleanse. YOLO. I'm also taking one to go. 

While I cannot currently attest to their coffee I will be sure and update you all when I inevitably come back to order 6 of these tarts for my next dinner party. 

The inside and outside cafe tables are incredibly clean, with a clear glass view into the bake shop where what I can only assume is the last master baker in Manhattan is whipping up towering frosted cakes! If I had any semblance of self control when I walked in, it's certainly gone now. 

The wifi here is great and remarkably fast, get the password from the pastry case to the left of the card reader. 

It's a thousand degrees out in the dead of summer and I'm lounging under their awning in cool shade. Seriously, a fruit juice smoothie and a fresh raspberry compote tart? Could a Tuesday get any better? I think not. 

They're card or apple/samsung pay only, come prepared to swipe, tap or beep and enjoy the best street café below 14th street."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-07-16,4.0,"4/5 because 
I'd like to have a bigger cookie or two cookies of the size I got for the price paid, other than that, it was pretty great 

Considering the space they have they make a lot of items and they mostly look pretty good (and apparently they make full sized cakes) 

It arrived basically instantly
The place is clean
Tiny sized seating area, space for maybe 4 people, but they also have a few tables and chairs outside on the sidewalk 

Cute interior design matches the food 
The service is friendly   
The quality that you get is above average
Also non dairy options beyond just almond milk so that's cool 

It's somewhere I'd want to go again but the cookies aren't really enough in quantity- quality is good though

Would come back here and also recommend this place as a sit down bakery dessert spot, though to be clear it's a general bakery so they don't have a specific item they specialize in, if you're craving a great cookie, you might want to go to a cookie shop"
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-06-12,5.0,The staffs were very welcoming and friendly! The bread was really good! I'm a sweet tooth and a chocolate lover. I would eat it everyday if I did not have to control my weight Highly recommend the place!
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-09-12,3.0,"I had the cheesecake cookie bomb. Was super excited to try it. For $4.84, it was meh. You couldn't taste the cheesecake. I even had a bite of just the cheesecake center, but it wasn't a salty sweet juxtaposition like I had envisioned. I'm on the search for the best cookie in Manhattan - and I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately didn't love it. Culture espresso still has the best in my opinion"
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-07-23,1.0,"Went here with very high expectations all the way from Boca Raton Florida made a special trip just to visit for their treats. I have to say Service always makes all the difference in the world I would've look past the fact that the rainbow cake was extremely dry and tasteless, the pan de Bono  was brought out cold we had to ask if it was possible to heat it up and then she had an attitude took it back inside and then heated it for us. I had ordered a latte that never even came out! when I went inside to remind her about it she said oops I forgot. 
Literally no one was inside of the bakeshop it was dead for her to forget is inexcusable. Save yourself a trip over here and find a better place!"
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-02-19,4.0,"my wife picked up a couple cookies and I had to try because they looked good. We had the red velvet cookie and the salted choc chip. My favorite wad the red velvet there were big chocolate chunks in it. It was soft even though she had gotten it a couple hours earlier.  The salted choc chip cookie was also pretty good. 

You can tell these are homemade with love. Excited to try the other stuff there."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-07-10,5.0,"SCB is most excellent -- wonderful coffee, tasty delights, kind staff and enough seating made this place opportune. 

The Goods - I had a cappuccino in house, which I'd recommend, as their mugs are neat enough to put you in a good mood (and are reusable, of course). 

I also had a cheesecake chocolate chip cookie, which was very tasty. They'll ask you if you want it warmed up, too (protip: you should accept this offer). 

SCB has more seating than some of its closest competitors, and so you're more likely to get a seat here.  

The staff are kind and take a nice tone with you. They are also accommodating and want to make your experience a good one. 

I'd highly recommend SCB.

P.S. -- apologies, but I forgot to take pictures before sipping up (guzzling?) my capp and scarfing down my cookie. A novice mistake."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-10-28,4.0,"Cute little bakery with decent coffee, and I really wish I could bottle up the delicious scent of this place. It was trick-or-treating day in the West Village, so there was constant entertainment with a continual flow of adorable kids in costumes popping in for mini chocolate bars. The counter staff were super smiley and friendly to every single one of them, even the ones without any manners. Added bonus, there is a yelp check-in offer for a free mini cheese bread bite, which was quite yummy."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-04-10,4.0,"After seeing photo after photo of the Red Velvet Nutella cookie, I knew I needed to make a pit stop here! I'm so glad I did - absolutely delicious! Unfortunately there were no Salted Caramel cookies at the time, so I ordered Chocolate Chip. This wasn't a stuffed cookie like the Red Velvet - I would have rather ordered another Red Velvet :)

Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area. We went right when the shop opened on a Saturday and not everything was available, so maybe wait until later morning to get the full experience."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-11-06,4.0,Those cookkieesss wow! I had the cheesecakes chocolate chip WARMED up... oh boy and the coffee (even using 2% milk) was top notch.
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-07-12,4.0,"Came here because of a video I saw about the Nutella hearts. They're not cheap!! Small one costs $8.50. Be careful because they melt in the heat! 

You can come here to chill and get some work done as well."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-05-12,5.0,"Because of the outdoor seating, this sweet shops is best visited on a sunny day.

When you order, ask them to warm up the cookie it makes them 10x better. I ate the red velvet Nutella cookie cold, which was delicious. But the thought that the cookie would have been better warmer troubled me. So when I ordered a cookie for the road, a sea salt caramel, I asked them to heat it up and it was INCREDIBLE!

Other notable things: the cashier was charming and gave me great recommendations including an Ice Latte, thank you!

Save Your Money: Don't order a smoothie. I got one for lunch but was underwhelmed. It was merely okay. This isn't surprising since it's a sweets shop, but now you can't say you didn't know."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-05-02,4.0,"Great place! It's a little small, but the atmosphere is great with really friendly staff and cute handwritten signs. Everything looked really good, but I settled on their signature sea salt chocolate chip cookie and the red velvet nutella bomb. 

Sea salt chocolate chip: A very delicious and chewy cookie, but I found the sea salt to be overpowering. If you're really into sweet and salty desserts, this is for you. Note: it's also more expensive than the rest of their cookies, which I found a bit strange. 

Red Velvet: SO good! I'm not usually the biggest red velvet fan, but I loved this cookie. It's a melt-in-your-mouth explosion of nutella piece of goodness. Definitely recommend!

Overall, I enjoyed the experience and would love to go back and try some of their other treats (carrot cake was so tempting!)."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-12-24,1.0,"Didnt even get to taste the cookies cause the employees wouldnt even let us in. Right when we walked in the lady in the rudest tone yelled ""no we are closed"". It says that it closes at 7 but she said they closed at 6. But even if it closed at 6 there shouldn't have been customers at 6:30. We got kicked out without an apology. Never going back."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-06-14,5.0,"I don't think I've ever truly tasted a cookie until I ate the salted chocolate chip cookie from sweet corner bakeshop. I insist that it's the best cookie in the city. 

*voice in the back of your head: ""but what about Levain's?""

Good question! Levain's bakes a dope cookie-like dessert that's really more of a slightly baked ball of cookie dough than an actual cookie. It's delicious and indulgent and much too rich for a casual cookie. It's still one of my favorite desserts in the city, but you can expect a sugar-high and maybe also a bit of a stomach ache after eating one or two of their cookies.

Sweet corner bakeshop has more than just cookies (and a wider variety than just the salted chocolate chip--red velvet Nutella is also super popular). They have cakes and breads and muffins. Try a Pao de Queijo, a cheesy Brazilian bread ball. They're SO good! Get one free when you check in on yelp!"

Showcasing a menu full of photo savvy treats, cookies, and whole cakes (customized/made to order), and at a cozy spot in the West Village, you won't be disappointed, some of their cookies are held to high praise. As far as I can tell, this is their one and only location in New York City, fits right in with the comfort, good indie spots of West Village, and as with most reputable bake shops, allows for delivery in NYC + nationwide in regards for their baked goods. The closest subway stops are: Christopher St-Sheridan Square (1, 5 minutes away on foot), and Christopher St (PATH's 33rd St-Hoboken/Journal Square Lines, 5 minutes walk), and plenty of other subway stops at the West Village within a 10 minute walking distance. Outdoors, there's a brown awning showing it's name, and sandwich boards promoting their products + praised cookies/cakes, and coffee. There's also 4 tables outdoors if you've wanted to enjoy your time off snacking/having a quick bite. Inside, there's only 4 stools inside with counter side space to eat, and it gets a bit crowded if it's at capacity. Milk/sugar/condiments are at the left side near the entrance/exit, menu is at the back, and a gallery of their fresh baked cookies + treats are at the right, and at the right hand side of the shop is the cake making area. The staff are helpful + courteous, and able to satisfy what you have in mind. Keep in mind that Sweet Corner Bakeshop is a cashless business, so cash/money purchases are NOT allowed (you can still tip them however you much in cash), so you're only permitted to pay with credit or debit cards. Same would also go for advance purchases of cakes and/or cookies meant to be picked up here. 

As implied by their name, they focus mostly on fresh baked pastries and sweets, such as cookies, brownies, bread/bagels, cupcakes and other things that can be brought in an instance. Some cupcakes are offered in 4 packs, like a chocolate 4 pack or their other arrangements. They can also prep açaí bowls for those who want a quick, fulfilling breakfast meal. There's also a wide array of coffee/teas/hot cocoa, in any style that most high style NYC indie coffee shops can do. Last, they also excel in crafting custom made cakes and cupcakes too, meant to cater to however you desire, but patience must be valued since that takes 2 or 3 weeks due to time involved, so if you're inclined on doing so, plan ahead in time for your anticipated event/birthday/gifting date, and those cakes can be delivered to the area/nationwide or pickup. Pricing is a bit up there, but at the same time, it's for the rich ingredients used and buzz the business has generated. 

Personally, I was aware of Sweet Corner Bakeshop before discovering it on Yelp, and their reputation is well deserved! In regards to my previous visit, it was a warm, sunny Sunday, and stopped by here on the way to spectate the TCS NYC Marathon, so fueled up on my favorites: a rich, small hot chocolate, one of the specialty sea salt chocolate chip cookies, and a Rollo cupcake, all paid via card (the only way possible). Sat outdoors under the awning to witness the sunny, crisp day, and drank my smooth hot cocoa, and munching on their salty/sweet cookie, and dunking it too (don't knock it til you try it!). Overall delight, had a brief friendly conversation with one of the workers there, and ate the smooth, bite sized Rollo cupcake later, which also lived up to its hype. I might go back for another visit later on to try out their açaí bowl, but it was a good visit nonetheless!

In conclusion, Sweet Corner Bakeshop graced the West Village with a creative, festive shop preparing fresh pastries, cookies, and cakes and most likely won't be going away anytime soon. The cashless rule might be an inconvenience for some customers, but it wasn't an issue for me. Easy to access, has classics and new favorites I can grab in an instant, I hope I'll get there soon again! PS: remember to grab your free cheese bread (Pao de Queijo) when you perform a Yelp Check-in (assuming they're in stock), you won't be disappointed!

Until next time."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-07-31,3.0,"I had the sea salt chocolate chip cookie. I felt it was a bit expensive at $4.75 but I'd been wanting to try it for awhile so I didn't mind. Outside the store, they have signs saying how it is considered the best cookie in town etc. I think it was a good cookie; I could taste the sweetness and I appreciated the multiple types of chocolate chips. It was soft in the middle and harder/more crispy on the outside which was the right consistency. The only downside I would say is I didn't feel enough 'sea salt' flavor coming through. After reading the signs, I was a bit disappointed. The cookie is good, maybe even great but not the best in town. I really love the Fat Cat Kitchen chocolate chip cookie with sea salt. It's just my favorite and I kept naturally comparing it to the Sweet Corner cookie. It's definitely still worth a try though!"
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-12-14,2.0,"Wow, I was sooooo disappointed by these cookies. I visited NYC and did my research about top cookie places. I went out of my way to go to Sweet Corner. Not only did they give and charge me for an extra cookie that I did not order, but the flavor was incredibly off. So much so that we threw the cookies in the trash very shortly after we left. I got the sea salt chocolate chip, regular chocolate chip, and chocolate chip with cheesecake. Not one was edible. Incredibly disappointed and will never return."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-07-12,4.0,"This place was pretty good. I got the Nutella banana bread. It was decent and very dense, but I wish it was a little more like banana bread. It seemed a little bland. They have a lot of options though. Their cookies looked delicious."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-11-18,5.0,"Soooo amazing 
So when I first walked in there was cute chalk on the floor leading the way. Like a super sweets place.  Very cozy, seating outside.  I had the blueberry muffin.. to die for  with a chai tea.  SUPER FRESH light with the right amount of flavor.

Check this place out"
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-10-28,3.0,"So the last time I was in NY I stopped by for the RED VELVET NUTELLA BOMB COOKIE and it was to die for so much that I started following them on Facebook and Instagram just so that I can catch a glimpse of this heavenly cookie. I occasionally would go on their website to see if they began shipping out of state and to my surprise that option recently became available. I immediately placed my order for 6 red velvet Nutella bomb cookies and waited in anticipation. Well, I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or if it was the three days in transit but the cookies arrived HARD and CRUMBLY and some were broken. These were definitely not what I had when I went into the shop. I understand them not being 100% fresh because they've been in transit for three days but I don't expect them to be rock hard. Especially when I'm paying $40 for 6 cookies. I order cupcakes from DC and deep dish pizza from Chicago all the time and have no issues with freshness. Something definitely needs to be done so that online out of state orders are received when the cookies are still soft and moist. I definitely will not place another online purchase from this bakery as $40 is too much money to waste on hard cookies."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-03-25,5.0,"My boyfriend and I stopped here on a whim during our stroll around west village. We wanted some sweets and decided to come in here to take something to go to continue on our stroll. Inside of the store smells so good with a freshly baked smell. 

We decided we were gonna buy an Extreme Butterscotch Oatmeal raisin cookie and a twix brownie. Both baked goods were extremely satisfying but I have to say that the oatmeal cookie blew my socks off. The cookie was still warm when I bit into it, the outer portion of the cookie was crunchy and the inside of the cookie stayed moist. It was everything I could have asked for right then and there. I didn't even know how good butter scotch could be with an oatmeal cookie until I tried Sweet Corner's kind. WOW.

The twix brownie was a bit on the soft side. My boyfriend loved the softness of the brownie but I like texture and I wish the brownie was more ""hard"" instead of soft inside. But overall, you best believe I am coming here again one day for their extreme oatmeal cookie. It was sooo good."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2017-12-22,4.0,"This review is solely for their raspberry cheesecake! Eileen's and Jr's has some serious competition...and I'm not even a cheesecake fan! Coming off a bout of food poisoning, I only allowed myself a few bites of this heavenly tasting dessert, and was already saddened that The Husband was going to be able to enjoy this all to hisself. The raspberry fruit compote on top had a nice tart taste, but still sweet. The cheesecake was so creamy, rich enough, but also, a hint of delicateness, which is rare in cheesecakes. The ""crust"" was more of a yummy cake. My employers gave me this cheesecake to try and what a sweet treat it is. The Husband immediately said ""Bookmark this!"" Looking forward to an entire one of my own next time."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2019-08-14,5.0,"This is my go to breakfast place on the weekends. It's small, cute, and the servers give you the biggest smile and are so patient with you. The food there is very good;their sea salt chocolate chip cookies are to die for! No matter the temperature, you can taste the gooey-ness of the chocolate, with the salt balancing it out perfectly. Overall, sweet corner is a very adorable bakery with welcoming smiles all around! I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a quick bite."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-10-09,5.0,"I had the sea salt chocolate chip cookie and it was life. Changing. There is something about sea salt with a fresh baked and gooey chocolate chip cookie that sends your tastebuds into overdrive. 

Still in a cookie coma !"
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-01-23,4.0,"Excellent chocolate chip cookies with sea salt.  Really fresh and tasty.  I don't live in the area, so it's not a place I would travel across town for, but I would grab cookies again anytime.  The service was friendly and my coffee was just OK (sorry, lost just one star).

Grab yourself some cookies when in the west village.  Way better than Levain or Chip NYC."
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-02-14,5.0,"Saw the Nutella heart chocolate on FB thus came all the way to buy this for my little nephew! Very satisfying. 
Tried the sea salt chocolate cookies and love it. Not too sweet and full of chocolate flavor. Crunchy outside yet soft inside. Strongly recommended! 
My friend recommends their americano so will come try their cake next time!!!"
158,sweet-corner-bakeshop-new-york,2018-01-06,4.0,A bit pricey but the cookies are awesome! I had the sea salt chocolate chip cookie and a bite of my friend's red velvet. Definitely want to return and try some of the other goodies in the case - they have a huge selection and the cookies are just the tip.
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-03-09,4.0,"This is a (dare I say it) cute, hipster type spot decked out with surfboards, scuba suits and clothing. Saturday's  is what happens when Ocean Pacific and Starbucks have a baby... and then this baby grows up to date Hollister. Its like Abercrombie and Cream, light sugar. LOL. 
Theres benches in front for hot summer days and a big backyard where you can sit and enjoy your ""coffee bean juice"" of choice. The music selection is amazing [at least to me, I like Fusion Jazz] and played at the perfect level, low enough for comfortable conversation but high enough to Shazam if you hear something you really like. 
Its has an 'alt-trad vibe', meaning it feels very open and non judgemental, which isn't the case in many boutique stores in this area. Its weird seeing surfboards in such an urban landscape, but that's a part of its charm. If I had the space I'd buy one just to watch the faces of my fellow New Yorkers on the subway. What a juxtaposition! Urban...female...surferchick! Lol
I like the place.
It smells amazing...and my bf raved about the espresso. They have tea as well. 
.Worth a revisit!"
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-05-27,4.0,Super cool joint. Great coffee. Cool stuff. Nice merch. Amazing Patio. I will def.m be back.
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2018-09-04,4.0,Love this coffee bar and I am obsessed with the gardens they have in the backyard. They have different things for sale (think SoCal surf vibe) and everyone that works here is super friendly and chill.
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"When I worked in the area I would visit Saturday's almost daily - they make what's probably the best damn cappuccino in the USA, and their iced coffee will get you through the hottest of summers."
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2018-04-25,5.0,"This may be one of my favorite stumble upons within NYC. It's on a quiet street in SOHO, and is the opposite of a speakeasy. The front is a coffee shop, with a surfer vibe/ clothing store behind it. You can literally buy surfboards. In NYC. It's wild and amazing. The menu is limited but they have the necessities. My loose tea was perfect and the pastries looked delicious. 

While there is no seating indoors, they have a stunning, large, beautiful courtyard with tons of seating, lots of outdoor lights, surfboards, classic charm, lots of greenery and quiet. Bring a book, buy a surfboard, drink some tea. It transports you out of NYC, and into an australian surftown. It's charming, simple, and so soho. I'm obsessed."
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2017-06-18,5.0,"Walk in through the entrance and you're welcomed by a line of surfboards and a small and simple coffee area on your right serving La Colombe coffee + pastries. I love this minimalist design - there's not even a menu, so order your coffee or espresso drinks. No syrups, powders, flavors, etc. 

Keep walking forward, maybe shop a little, and enter the BACKYARD space. You'll find wooden benches in the shade or in the sun, perfect for a chill afternoon. 

YOU'RE WELCOME !"
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2018-03-20,4.0,"Beautiful place. The coffee was good and I LIVE for the outdoor space. It's also nice that there is some shopping inside as well. 

I'd stop in for another coffee sometime."

A surf shop in the middle of the city, attractive crowds, a stunning courtyard, and stellar beans & pastries... now that's what I call paradise. Well for city standards that is (nothing beats the great sea). Any who, at Saturday's you'll find trendy foreigners stuntin' in comme des garçon & Cowan, post-workout city moms, students seeking a secret hideout, and me.... clearly. In idyllic soho scene. So step in for a peak, pick up a board for the Hudson (jk please don't), or take the afternoon and hangout in their back courtyard and enjoy the scene"
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2018-01-24,5.0,"I love this little gem! If you've ever gone shopping in Hayes Valley, San Francisco, then you will know exactly what vibe I felt walking into this cafe/men's clothing shop. Quite a small coffee bar but beautiful backyard patio. The juxtaposition of surfboards in the middle of NYC is quite refreshing. If I were a guy, I would most definitely buy majority of my closet from this store :)"
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-05-02,3.0,It's basically a clothing store with a coffee machine and a courtyard. The coffees are made very slowly and are only served in take away cups - very wasteful. If you're ok with all the above then you'll probably enjoy yourself. Otherwise keep looking.
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2018-03-23,1.0,"Wow. I just walked out before even getting a drink because the barista was so incredibly rude. He didn't acknowledge me and continued chatting with a friend or employee (not sure) he had just made a drink for. When he finally acknowledged me I asked if they had regular coffee or cold brew, he said it's all cold brew which is typical now so no big deal, I ordered a latte. He audibly sighed. More work I guess? They had skim and whole milk so I asked if he could do half skim half whole (also typical for coffee shops...) and he made a face like it was a crazy request and says ""I guess."" By that point I was just done and said I changed my mind and walked out. No reason to treat people that way. He was rude to the two women who came up behind me also. Clearly has a chip on his shoulder.

I've never walked out of anywhere because of rude service. I started a new job just around the corner but I will be bringing my daily coffee business elsewhere."
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2017-03-13,4.0,"For a less frequent coffee drinker like me, I wish there was a menu. Otherwise, absolutely no complaints! I also love the back area where you can sit, chill, and enjoy the weather! I came during the winter, so obviously no one was crazy enough to sit outside in 30 degree weather. Therefore I liked how spacious it was. But I can't imagine what it would be like during the summer time."
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2017-11-05,5.0,Perfect start to every morning! In a cute kind of hidden street in soho. Delicious coffee in front of Saturdays the boutique shop. Pretty small but most people just take their coffee and sit outside or walk around. Ideal first date spot in a trendy neighborhood (or after morning spot if you live in the area).
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2017-02-18,5.0,Coffee was on point! No menu so know what you want! Got the almond iced latte and was pretty simple tasting! Very good small shop for quick coffee fill
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2017-08-27,4.0,"* small hot latte with whole milk was $4

They serve la colombe coffee so that speaks for itself. A+ coffee
 
Vibes, A++. The backyard is very cute and I like how it's very quiet on sundays

This place loses a star because of pricing. I think they should add a menu just in case people are concerned about the price of what they're buying."
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2016-10-08,5.0,"Omg I found this place when I finished shopping in soho. It's a great place to chill because it's a coffee place inside a clothing store. The owner uses the backyard to create a nice atmosphere and the customer can sit everywhere to enjoy the coffee. Also, The coffee tastes so good. I ordered a latte and my friend ordered a ice coffee. We hang out there for awhile for chatting, the place is so relax."
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2016-04-19,4.0,"If it was not for the wonderful world of Instagram, I honestly would have stayed away from this place if I saw it on Yelp due to the mid 3 1/2 star rating. Although I just got a black iced coffee, it was good. The backyard space is super cute and a nice hangout spot. I also like the fact that it is part cafe and part shop!"
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2015-12-18,4.0,Cool vibe and coffee lover dream but I'm into tea and thus was disappointed.  The sitting space is fun and outdoors but the indoor clothing options are a tad odd.  The whole aura gels but nonlinear-like.  Must be the waves...
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2015-05-20,5.0,"Forget speakeasy bars, what people really want to feel smug about is their ability to hunt down hidden coffee spots. 

Saturdays is painfully cool. You'll line up waiting for your iced coffee with people who look half your age, double your cool-ness and four times your attractiveness. But once your coffee is made, and you slink on out to the gorgeous courtyard, their awesomeness will have rubbed off on you and you'll fit right on in."

There is no menu so if you don't know what to get, get a latte cuhs they'll draw the cute leaf design in your coffee. They also brew La Colombe! From there it's a straight shot last their surf apparel shop to their backyard which is amazing!!!! I think it's differently a gem in SOHO. Great place to sit and chat with friends in their backyard quad. Not only that it gets alot of shade so it won't be too hot in the summer. Can't wait to stop by again!"
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2017-11-03,1.0,The blonde barista is by far the rudest person i have met in ALL customer service experiences I've encountered.

Coffee is consistently great and service always fast, friendly but laid back. I like espressos and black iced Americanos, where you could truly taste the roast.

The surfer shop owner is also super friendly and cool with my toddler son hanging out there."

Their coffee is produced in collaboration with La Colombe  which is arguably some of the best coffee on the planet.  Staff is super-duper friendly and helpful.  I bought a coffee on the way in and on the way out.  Great spot to get away from how busy and suffocating NYC can feel."
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2015-10-02,2.0,Didn't pay much to the environment but it did have a chill vibe to it. I got a soy latt and I found it to be quite bitter and gross tasting after a while and wound up throwing more than half of my cup down the drain. It costed almost 5 bucks for such a small drink which did not taste palatable either.
159,saturdays-nyc-coffee-bar-new-york,2012-11-26,4.0,"Love love love this place. In the warmer months I make frequent stops here with close friends to just chill out on the back patio area with their ice coffee. Always usually able to secure a spot comfortably. I can't really speak to the actual surf gear that is sold in the store b/c I've never taken a thorough enough look. Staff however is really chill and it's just a nice place in the city where you feel like you're relaxing at someone's quaint Soho pad.  

I only dock a star b/c one time when I was there with a friend we saw a humongous rat scurrying in the corner of the back patio area. We decided to stay anyway the first time we saw it even though it seemed ginormous (seriously seemed twice the size of a normal rat) but after the second time it popped out we decided it was time to go. If this was a restaurant or inside I'd probably never return. It was an isolated incident though so hoping we just never see the mutant rat again. 

Otherwise come for some good coffee and conversations!"

The staff is incredibly hospitable and do their best to make you feel like you've been coming here for years. Please note: the inside of this place does offer seating, but it is extremely limited. We're talking four small tables with stools sandwiched near the counter and order areas. However, don't let the small space get you down, though, especially if you're looking for a home-cooked meal taste. The food will absolutely blow you away with the generous portion sizes and incredible flavor profiles. There are a ton of options for every type of eater, including vegetarian, pescatarian, and vegan options. 
Note: I am knocking one star off for the tight sitting quarters and also because I wanted the daily soup offered two weeks ago, and instead they gave me a soup that was the previous day's special. I realized this after I walked back to my office in the cold rain. :("

160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,"First time here. I loved it. I liked the atmosphere. Tiny little place. I went with two co-workers for a short break. We had walked into two other coffee shops, looking for a place to seat but were all busy...we were like "" people in New York don't work?"" Finally we find Paradis and it had three little tables. I got an almond cookie and a cappuccino. But I was taken by the smells coming from the kitchen...it smelled like bread or briosh...delicious... and their to go food looked really good. A place to go back for lunch for sure."
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2017-05-10,4.0,"I am attending a business conference that was catered by Paradis. I think this hosts might have gotten the ""deluxe"" package but everything was pretty delicious! I recommend this place if you ever need breakfast catering. 

My favorite offering was a rich, savory vegetable quiche. It was cheesy and eggy but the broccoli was the real star! The bacon was bountiful, you could tell it was baked. They also offered a sous-vead egg cup. I didn't love that but I think it maybe had goat cheese in it and I don't care for that.

They also had bagels, fruit, smoked salmon with ""the works."" The onions were nice and thin. The capers were a nice touch. The dill was fresh sprigs of dill. Fresh! I wish the melons were peeled, I didn't care of the rind on the melons. I would have preferred a fruit salad to be eaten with a fork, not my hands, because it was a business setting and I was already feeling awkward.

I didn't know this place existed. But! I will definitely be back when I'm in the area, especially for that quiche!"
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2016-12-01,4.0,"Great place for lunch if you're looking for something healthy that's not a salad. Also a great place for vegetarians. They have lunch options including sandwiches, soups, roast chicken, salmon, salads, mac n cheese, pot pie, vegetable sides, etc. The food is similar to the buffet at Whole Foods except better quality. 

The shop is extremely small with a few small tables so most people take things to go. You can also get in and out quickly unlike those long lines at Whole Foods, Chopt, and Sweetgreen. The entrees and sides rotate daily so check their website to see what they have for that day. I like getting the three vegetarian sides for $12.79 (including tax). They are very generous with their portions. 

Turkey, arugula, swiss, onions, cranberry pecan bread - Tasty turkey sandwich that they heat for you on their panini press. Although this sandwich wasn't as advertised on the sign. Instead of cranberry chutney as the sign said there was onions in the sandwich. Ick onions. After I took out the onions, I enjoyed the sandwich very much. The sandwich was kind of small for being $9.25 (including tax).

Celery root, potato, butternut squash gratin - Super tasty and cheesy gratin. Definitely order this if you're lucky enough that they have this on their daily menu.

Parsnip, heirloom carrot, mushrooms, whitebeans cassoulet - There was way too many onions in this cassoulet. Otherwise this was pretty good and healthy tasting.

Mac 'n cheese, garlicky kale (VG) - The mac n cheese wasn't salty enough or garlicky at all. It's not a very cheesy version.

Kale salad-lemon vinaigrette, roasted beets, celery root, pear, feta, toasted almond & pumpkin seeds - I didn't get all of the toasted almond, pumpkin seeds, celery root, pear as advertised, but I liked the feta and salad dressing.

Brussel sprouts, honey sambal vinaigrette - This was cold and not crispy, but the flavor of the sprouts was good. The texture was soft, but at least it wasn't too overcooked.

Coconut oil roasted sweet potato, bagel spice - The sweet potatoes were shaped like fries but roasted instead fried. This side dish is also cold.

They have containers of mac n cheese and potpies are in the fridge in the back which you could purchase to heat up in your office or at home. I have yet to try their baked goods, but their cookies look huge and freshly baked. I'll keep on coming back for lunch and maybe try one of their cookies some day."
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2018-12-07,5.0,"Absolutely amazing food and the most accommodating staff. I placed a large order online for breakfast and put the wrong day! I showed up a day earlier and they were able to put everything together in 1 hour and it was still delicious and beautifully presented.

 I have always been a fan of their food but this customer service really puts them on top. Their food is fresh, unique and beautifully presented. I don't believe I have had one thing I haven't loved. Highly recommended"
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2016-06-26,3.0,"Location: a small place where people can find some cozy spot for some bakeries and some coffees.

I have been longing to come here because I wanna try their sandwiches.
However, the sweet teeth always come to the first place for empty stomach. 
So spinach pie is my alternative.

Actually, it was not sweet.
It was a little bit dull but huge portion size tho.

I mean, if you are not in the neighborhood, it is not worth the time or money for you to travel all the way here but if you work/study or live in this area, it might be a good spot to visit tho.

3.5 stars"

160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2015-09-21,3.0,"Paradis is a small cafe in Union Square with a ton of variety and is great for lunch or a snack. I came during lunch time on a week day and got the spice rubbed pork sandwich and the broccoli and Gouda quiche. (Yes, you can tell I was extra hungry that day...or I just couldn't decide which to get.) The pork was juicy and the bread was toasted to the perfect degree. I enjoyed the quiche a lot too. Since the place is so small, there isn't much room to stand while you wait for your food, especially when it gets busy. They aren't the fastest; my friends and I had to wait 15 minutes (longer than I would prefer to wait for lunch), but at least the food was good. I regret not trying their famous chocolate chip cookie though, so maybe next time.

160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2016-10-21,4.0,"Accidentally discovered this cute coffee shop during my last visit into this neighborhood so decided to give a try today. Having a rather small inside space (two to three tables), Paradis serves very extensive breakfast items as well as seasonal specialties (got so attracted by their maple leave sugar cookies, very lovely!). 

My cappuccino was ok, but I did enjoyed the chill vibe. Hopefully they could also bring in more seasonal specialty drinks."
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2016-06-02,4.0,"Short review number I don't know

Solo cashier was friendly

Got a banana whoopie pie though the sandwiches looked good (next time.) It was 3 bucks exactly or something similar.

The texture of the two sections were proper. It was a little squishier than other variations I have had.

The banana cream inside had a pretty  heavy banana flavor though I did find it to be oddly sour. Good stuff for the price.

3.7, I'll give it a proper review and really decide between a 3 and a 4 next time I buy a sandwich."
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2017-11-01,1.0,"I just stoped by Paradis - my first time so I didn't know what they were offering. The lady who was behind the counter wasn't friendliest or most welcoming person I've met... but it's ok - not expecting much. It's New York. She said she was going to be serving me in a To-Go  plate because they were closing soon. It was fine - I don't care about the plate - they have to close. 

So assuming I can't sit inside I sat on a bench outside to have dinner (the bench is between two stores so I had no idea whose it was). I literately had one bite left when this other lady comes to me - almost angry and says: ""the bench"". I wasn't sure if she was talking to me so I looked up - she points down and repeats ""the bench - I need it"". I had one bite left. I left - it was 7:03. If she let me stay I would have left at 7:04. One minute. 

I understand they were closing and have to go but there are much nicer ways to treat your customers. Especially first timers. I don't appreciate bad treatment."
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2018-09-05,1.0,I cannot believe this terrible experience. Please read on. The address on this platform will send you to 2nd Ave. And if you're anything like me you will be running late and having foot pain ready to pass out on top of that. I finally find the location by calling the spot and letting them know about their address on Yelp being incorrect and they said yelp is not their responsibility. Okay! Now I ask for the avocado and goat CHEESE but I get the turkey sandwich with something I'm allergic to. When I asked to replace it to the right sandwich the barista said she cannot do that because they gave me a curtousy of 10% off. Now I'm stuck with a sandwich I don't like that is so hot you can't even get the nutrition from the greens- they toast that too. If I could give a 0 star rating I would. This place is atrocious!! Never coming back here again! And I want a refund. I was in way too much of a rush to do that at the store.

- Staff was good with their suggestions"
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2015-04-08,4.0,"Great sandwich! I had the spice-rubbed pork with provolone , sweet and sour cabbage on semolina. That with a Sanpellegrino was about $11. It was plenty filling and tasted very fresh. I would take this over a chain sandwich option for sure."
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2017-01-07,4.0,"The exterior would make you think this place is much smaller than it is, but there is ample seating and a huge counter full of ready-made savory fare, and bakery items. I wasn't sure what to expect, but Paradis falls somewhere between a bakery/cafe and deli. My mocha, while definitely on the sweeter side, was good, and although the turkey sandwich looked unassuming, it was stuffed with turkey and onions, and was delicious and filling! The staff was super friendly, and brought the food to my table after I ordered at the counter. I definitely recommend stopping here for a quick coffee, or for taking home some prepared food that you can heat up for dinner!"
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2016-08-25,4.0,"This was our office favorite to go lunch spot for many years. Friendly owners, quaint decor. Food is solid, their entrees are creative and delicious, hearty soups and healthy sandwiches. Their daily specials are often inventive combinations of seasonal ingredients, and delightful flavors that kept me going back. 

They also have the best chocolate chip cookies here. No doubt, there's a lot of butter in them, but they're so chewy, moist and chocolatey; this is what a real chocolate chip cookie is suppose to be. They have a good selection of iced beverages, I recommend their seasonal iced lemonades. In the summer, they offer a delicious Arnold Palmer. Their teas and coffee are great for taking to go or to stay. If you have time for a leisurely afternoon break, I recommend nabbing a table; you'll easily find yourself one around 2:30-4pm."

This will probably be my new spot, mostly given how close it is my office. I bumped up the rating to four stars given the variety of baked goods -- very important to me. I've had a berry pudding cake, snicker doodle, and strawberry scone. They were all decent but nothing to rave about. Luckily for Paradis there aren't many bakeries around so they win by default. 

I've also had a turkey club. A little on the greasy salty side, but I'd give their other sandwiches a go. Prices are reasonable and selection is wide."

160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2014-03-16,4.0,"A very quaint cafe adjacent to Salvation Army Thrift shop.  A brief quiet moment before the start of a chaotic work day I was able to enjoy life's stillness seated with hot green tea with honey at $1.75 and one cold Empanada at $2.75.  Despite the Empanada's temperature served cold - it was tasty.  Menu is written on traditional black chalkboard.  Food items are more than your typical pastries as they carry sandwich, soup, and salads.  Decor is very cute.  Staff are accommodating and warmly welcoming to customers.  Seating is available but limited.  This small cafe can be easily missed while passing in the street."
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2015-12-05,4.0,"I went here for a late lunch, and it was pretty good.

The restaurant is very small and has a cozy feeling, very inviting. The staff is super nice and sweet. I ordered the Spiced Rub Pork sandwich (grilled), and it was good, not really that special though. The bread was a little hard and greasy, but the meat was really good. I would give it a 3.5 star rating. The chocolate chip cookie I got though was great. I definitely agree with the other reviews; if you come here, try and get the cookie. It was pretty much what a cookie should be, soft and not overly sweet. 

I give this place 4 stars because of the really good cookie and the overall pleasant experience. It's a good place to grab lunch and have a nice conversation."

160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2015-11-22,3.0,"Cute place, but that's about it

I love this little french feel cafe. I love how its decorated and the music they have playing. However, I just didn't really love the food. I actually ordered two sandwiches, and both of them were greasy to the point of being unappealing. Also, they are premade and the staff heats them in the paper they're stored in, causing the paper to actually stick to the cheese in the sandwich. Gross. 

It's just a cute date spot to grab a coffee and maybe a cookie, nothing more."

160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2016-02-07,5.0,"Paradis is the real deal - everything is homemade and DELICIOUS!  They use local and organic ingredients whenever possible.  

The chocolate chip cookies are baked fresh throughout the day but watch out because they are addictive!!

The salads are SO good & they are about to change everything up which means more hot foods ready to go!!

SO GOOD.  You can choose between healthy and comfort food.  ;)"

My friend and I stopped by and she didn't know what to get. So I ordered 2 hot chocolates and 2 chocolate chip cookies.

Dam I loved the hot chocolate is was so decadent and smooth. Ooh my gosh my friend was trying to lick the bottom of the cup. Lmao.

This place is a real hidden gem with all the chain stores surrounding it. Shh don't tell anybody.

P.S. They need to fix those seats very uncomfortable and the wood table tops are so sticky."

Spice rubbed Pork sando - out of this world.  Get it grilled.
I probably come here 2-3 times a week - it is that good.

I am trying to get our of my Pork bubble and try other things.

The Chipotle Tuna Sandwich - is good, very chipotle and a little fishy tasting, not my favorite.

Baked goods...worth dreaming about.  Their chocolate chip cookie is just melt in your mouth delicious...and it's huge!  Their zucchini bread is also phenomenal when they have it!

It is so easy to spend $15-$20 here on lunch though if your eyes are bigger than your stomach.  You must enter with self control."

I had the chicken sandwich (and ordered it grilled), and it has potentially ruined me for all other Paradis sandwiches. High-quality perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken on oozing, melted cheese plus barely wilted greens with bright pesto and fresh crisp bread. Under appreciated bonus: there is no way this sandwich will fall apart in your hands! Finished with their ever-popular and insanely decadent chocolate chip cookie that's impossible to finish solo (but you'll try)."

Staff was friendly, although a little rushed because they were really busy.

The Grilled Spice Pork Sandwich was very good.  Very reasonably priced too.  The salads look really fresh and I would like to try one on my next visit.  The chocolate chip cookie was really good also.

The quiche looked good and I think I'll try that next time."

I'd walked by for years thinking, ""their menu looks really good. I should go there someday."" Today, I finally walked in the door, and saw display cases with a huge array of homemade goods, and a line of people almost all the way back to the door. Cookies, sandwiches, soups, everything looked great. I got a sandwich and am looking forward to going back."
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2015-10-22,4.0,"I've been living across the street from this place for four years and just finally stopped in for lunch and snack. Holy hell am I glad I did! Are there any Ina Garten/Barefoot Contessa fans in the house? Because Paradis' sandwiches and treats are what I'd imagine she'd call perfection. 

Tip: Get the sandwiches grilled, the cheeses they use are very high quality and even the cheddar retains a butter-like texture long after you've brought your sanwich home and decided to chow-down. 

I had the roasted chicken with white cheddar and arugula pest and a stick-bun (with a cookie for later) and it all tasted like home to me. Not what my mom would make at home, mind you, but what I'd imagine a perfect, cozy French kitchen to put out.

Bottom line - if you live or work in the neighborhood, you're missing out if you don't patronize this gem of a spot."
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2014-10-02,4.0,"I've been working in the area for a while and I can't believe it took me so long to discover Paradis. I've had the famous chocolate chip cookie which lives up to all of the hype. Recently, I started popping in for their miscellaneous savory items: soups, frittatas, quinoa and veggie dish, sandwiches, etc. and it's all VERY good. They use high quality ingredients and veggies. For example, I am used to getting a piece of stale bread with the soup I order at other places. Here, the bread they give with their soups is incredible! Go here, it's delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable for what you are getting. 

Also, I'm not a vegetarian but if I was, I'd eat here every day!"
160,paradis-to-go-new-york,2014-04-25,4.0,"Solid place for fresh and affordable salads.  They usually a couple with and a couple without meat, for those of you vegetarians.  They have a choice of red wine or balsamic vinaigrette with each salad- I prefer the balsamic, which seems to be house made and thicker and more garlicy than store bought ones.  The sandwiches are also yummy and I like the spicy tuna, which has just a little heat. Simple, but healthy and delicious.  The spinach and gouda quiche is also quite fluffy and delicious. 

Their pastries are delicious and it seems like there's something for everyone.  There are a lot of interesting things that are always rotating so getting bored with their stuff doesn't really happen.  I would, however, advise against their small savory pastries because in my opinion, they're just kind of oily.  You're better off with a sweet one if you decide to get a pastry.  ;)

If you come in around 2:30pm on a weekday you are met with a crowd of kids who just got out of class so if you're not into crowds, come a little before or after.  Seating is kind of limited, and there's no bathroom, so you're better off taking your food somewhere else, I feel.  Service is pretty efficient and friendly, and the line usually moves in a timely manner."

The space is warm and inviting and I feel comfortable alone and with a group (not a very large space but they make it work). Everyone is so incredibly friendly, from staff to other customers
 
I would recommend the chicken pot pie, full breakfast, and sticky toffee pudding- with custard, of course. They also make an egg salad sandwich that has made me a fan of egg salad."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-02-24,3.0,"I was craving afternoon tea and this was one of the restaurants that offered afternoon tea with same day reservations and at a reasonably low price, so I decided to give it a try. 

I agree with what a lot of the other reviewers said about the space. I personally was not super bothered by the snugness, however, the entire place just smelled of smoke, like as if the vent in the kitchen was not on at all. My friend and I left both smelling like smoke for the rest of the day. 

I have to say with afternoon tea, you get what you pay for. I love afternoon tea and have been to may other places around the city and I have to say that I was quite disappointed here. I had an Earl Gray and it did not taste that fragrant, even after I let it brew throughout the entire meal. The bread on the sandwiches felt dry and the selection was very plain. The scones were quite good, though ours looked a bit wonky. They were a little salty and combined with the cream made it feel like I was spreading salted butter on my scone. 

The desserts were also... large. It didn't give me the finger food feel that I expect from afternoon tea, but they tasted quite nice. All in all, I would say that if you are looking for afternoon tea that has a better selection and better atmosphere, I would recommend looking elsewhere. Though tea service here was a lot cheaper than other places in the city, it just isn't worth it. Save up and go somewhere else."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-02-16,4.0,"So yess... the space is tiny and cramped and the menu is full of  lots of rules which is off putting & adding a slight level of tension for those who want to share/ trying to save money. But there is something special about this place that keeps me coming back every now and then and I am someone who tends to hate rules and small spaces (so that says something).

First it is a lovely place to get a pot of tea, if you are feeling fancy, they have a fun high tea (which I have always loved to get when I meet my close friend there ) but even just a pot of tea and dessert Is  lovely too. When  I go with my boyfriend he loves the steak and mash so we always go for a little meal. 

I don't think I have found a  vegetarian dish I love love love but I have always found something that gets me to the real real reason I am there -- dessert. 

t sticky toffee pudding with warm custard is exceptional and will have you coming back disputed the rules. I want to try every one of their cakes with custard because it taste like a bite of heaven.

YUM!

Also I have been dreaming of the Queen Victoria sponge cake.... and the scones and cream also incredible. 

So overall, bring your patience, sweet tooth,  and hungry belly and you should have a wonderful time!"
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-01-07,4.0,"I came here on a weekday right when it opened, and we were the first in line. We ended up getting seated near the window, which was really nice of them! It is a little cramped inside, but that's pretty typical for NYC. 

The prices are a little ridiculous, which is why I took off one star, but I really enjoyed the food. I got a pasty, which is basically like a meat pie (surprisingly good and crumbly) and the person I came with got the English breakfast with all the typical items (beans, eggs, tomatoes, sausage...). With that, we also ordered two pots of tea - English breakfast and a Vanilla Mint. While I loved the classic english breakfast, I liked the Vanilla Mint more since it was so unique and also, recommended by our waitress. They say one pot of tea is for one person, but I could have shared one pot between the two of us, since it's pricy at $6, and they allow multiple hot water refills. We also shared an order of Scones with clotted cream and jam, which was one of my favorite parts of the meal. 

As someone who rarely indulges in classic English food, I thought T & S was a great way to venture out a bit and try something new. I definitely enjoyed the experience, and I will be back!"
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-11-15,3.0,"I came here on a Saturday for tea with a few friends, and I left not that impressed.  

The space is cute/quaint with a definite English vibe.  The service is curt and as they note on the menu, they really do rush you out during busy times, which I just find off putting.  The sandwiches that come with the tea are just OK, nothing special and they're kind of boring for the price - e.g., there's no smoked salmon or anything a little elevated, it's just tuna, chicken salad and egg salad, and cucumbers.   The dessert options on the tea were also just not that appealing to me, the scones however were quite good.  We had ordered a tea for 2 people to share among 4 of us, and then we each also ordered an entree - the entree prices are incredibly reasonable, and I chose a Tuna Melt, which was quite good.

Overall, I think I would come here for their cheap food and skip the afternoon tea, it's just not that good and certainly not relaxing like afternoon tea should be."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-10-21,3.0,"British Restaurant in Manhattan. This was my second visit to this tiny restaurant. Literally tiny, elbow to elbow, small table for three.   

This place was located side by side with the fish & chips restaurant who happen to be the same owner.  Everytime I crave for an english breakfast, I think of this place.  Of course, it is not as fancy as it is being in London but it was alright.

I gave three stars because of the space. It really bothers me that my arms could hardly move and I have to be careful in eating because of waitress are passing by a lot and accident can happen.  This is not a place that you can eat and enjoy the food and be relax. This is more on shovel the food and go. But that's just me."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-05-02,3.0,"I feel like Tea & Sympathy misses the mark.  

The desserts are very good and the tea is lovely, and quite frankly we didn't have any of the service issues that are described in many of these reviews.  But something about this place makes me very uncomfortable.  I think it's because they have a literal list of rules that you must follow (and it's strange because a lot of the rules are common-sense ones that don't need to be put in writing and presented to you...).  They could literally remove all the text and put the tip note and the Discover card piece and just be done with it.  

When we arrived, it was evening on a weekday, and the place was relatively empty, and they still made sure that we were all ordering food.  You have a GoFundMe up to stay afloat, you have like 14 of 15 tables open at the moment, and you are really willing to give up a customer?  Not only that, but being presented with a list of rules is really just troublesome, and not something you'd expect from a place called ""Tea & Sympathy"".

Based on my first experience there, I would consider going back, but I don't really feel totally comfortable here.  It's like going to a class where you have a strict teacher - maybe they like you now, but you know you're eventually going to get yelled at."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-10-13,1.0,"Being from the UK, I wanted to feel more at home in the Big Apple - of course, I'm enjoying my time in the city but there's just those little things about home everyone misses which is why I visited British Tea & Sympathy with many of my favourites back home at the menu including Heinz soups and baked beans.

Inside, it is really small with only a few tables - to the point where while you wait for a table you're forced to wait outside, it was a pretty cold day and the member of staff offered no apology for forcing me to wait in the cold - It's lucky it wasn't raining.

Before I waited, I asked the staff member regarding any gluten-free offerings they had but she seemed more interested in walking off after pointing me to the rules - surely inforcing arrogant rules is less important than at least letting a diner know if they can eat somewhere, before forcing them to wait?

Inside it is pretty cramped and such a small space, you can barely move without bumping into someone and I was really surprised how a restauraunt so small could actually function - the size also does bring rules that
- You could be forced to change tables in the middle of a meal
- You have to go as soon as you've finished eating and paid,

For the type of restauraunt - again prices are high especially considering they add a further 2.82% onto the bill if you decide to pay via card - which I haven't seen anywhere even in a much better more central location in the city.

 It seems the staff member who wrote the rules was also the one who served me - she seemed aggressive when handing me the menu and dealing with customers outside because one of their friends was still coming and she wouldn't let her sit down even if she ordered food in the meantime (as each guest must have a main meal), as well as walking off on me with no response when asking about gluten-free options.

Cute little place in Greenwich Village, little brunch spot. Very tiny, might be a problem for claustrophobic people.. . The bathroom is definitely an issue for claustrophobic  people because it's like a phone booth size.. . 

FOOD: 7.5/10

Food was decent, the scones were really good. Sandwiches were basic. Teas smelled so yummy.

161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-10-19,3.0,Still a 3 star for our visit today. The full Monty breakfast was ok but you have to pay extra for the baked beans or mushrooms if you want those. Again when you order this in UK it already comes with everything including black sausage. Anyhow the service was still the same. And major issue is the space and table wayyy tooo small.
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-09-07,4.0,"I really like this spot.
The other reviews aren't great though. I think the tea is yummy and I really enjoy having the afternoon tea special. It's a little expensive and my friend and I don't like all the sandwiches. I wish you could customize what you got on the afternoon tea trio, because we'd do the cucumber & cream cheese sandwiches, scones and the sponge cake. We don't seem to eat anything else. It's a small space - probably seats 15. Your whole party has to be there before they seat you. Cute vibe!"
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-01-11,3.0,"Well, I've been to tons of tea cafes. And this one I found wanting. The food is great, but the space is pretty small.

If you like to do an afternoon tea, chances are you want to chat and hang out with friends you haven't seen in a while or looking for a breather to get away from the city for a bit. You will not find that here!

The minute you finish your food , a waitress will walk over and pick up your old dishes and your unfinished teapot. During the meal you will not be offered a refill on tea or checked on. The only time you will be checked on is after or just when they are about to pick up your plates. 

Understandably the place is quite small and there is serious no time to dabble, after all the restaurant wants to make as much money and get as many people inside (expect a wait outside the restaurant). Even after understanding that, we felt so uncomfortable in the restaurant  and have decided while we were happy to give it a try it's one and done with us.

The food itself was good. We got the afternoon tea for two which was $75 and even for NYC is expensive. And no way they are going to let a third person get on that for free! The scones were classic British style no American flavored fluff served.

I would really recommend the restaurant , extended itself and became a little bigger.

And for everyone else, visit Alice's Tea, they don't have the best scones, but their space is big their prices cheaper, the staff friendlier , and you don't have to feel rushed to leave."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,"A slice of London in the Village! Stepping into this tiny gem of a restaurant, you'd think you just came in from the London fog for a spot of tea. Fancy a cuppa? Have a whole pot! They have wonderful kitschy teapots and a selection of classic and funky teas. If you haven't experienced high tea, make sure to get the Tea for One (or two, or however many people you are). And if you're so English that you have your own teasmade, you'll feel right at home here. I had Tea for Two and a shepherd's pie - food that a newly minted commoner like Meghan Markle would be proud of. 
Expect a long wait at tea time or dinner - they don't take reservations. You wait next door in the gift and candy shop, where you can buy all the English goodies you could ever want. I'm a sucker for Chocolate Oranges!"
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-04-30,3.0,"Solid 4* until I saw that there was a sneaky credit card surcharge at the bottom.  Is this even legal?  

I came here with a group of girls last week and had an amazing time just socializing and eating some delicious foods and drinks.  I ordered the chicken and veggie pot pie which I really enjoyed.  My favorite part was definitely the flaky crust because that was just delicious!

My friends also enjoyed their foods immensely.  They ordered the mushroom shepherds pie, mac and cheese, and some others that I forget LOL sorry.  

I also ordered the toffee sticky pudding at the end with custard which was delicious.  It was definitely rich (a little too rich for me) and very tasty!

The service was attentive and the lady was very sweet.  It was just those pesky credit card surcharges!!"
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-04-14,4.0,"Had a great time here for Afternoon Tea. My friend and I are huge tea lovers, we get tea no matter where we go. We like to treat ourselves every once and have tea sandwiches, scones and some lovely dessert with our tea. We heard about this place from a few friends so we decided to give it a chance. It's a pretty tiny space - maybe 8-10 tables in the entire restaurant. I love the homey feel of it - it feels very rustic inside. Tables are a little small, I wasn't sure we would be able to fit the teapots and the food all on the same table! 

We ordered the vanilla green tea and the yorkshire gold (strong earl grey) as our teas. If you love earl grey, definitely get the yorkshire gold, I highly recommend. The vanilla green tea was surprisingly good. It is a light tea, but the vanilla flavor comes through very clearly. It feels and tastes very smooth. Tea sandwiches were good, but the variety was just eh. We got cucumber and cream cheese, egg salad, tuna salad and chicken salad sandwiches. Would have liked more of a variety in the sandwiches to be honest for how much we're paying. Scones were delicious and go great with the jelly and clotted cream. Love how big the desserts are here too. Victoria sponge cake is delicious - it was my first time having it even though I've seen it about 100 times on Great British Bake Off. The strawberry cupcake was yummy as well. The cupcake itself was very flavorful and moist - cupcakes can be extremely dry and I was afraid this would be the case. But this ended up being my favorite dessert out of the 3. The last one is a chocolate hazelnut cake. I liked the flavor of that, but it was SO DENSE. I just felt heavy after taking one bite.

Service here was great too. Servers didn't bother us much, but did check in on us a few times to make sure we were alright. Overall, would definitely come back here again!"
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-12-03,2.0,"Maybe I've gotten used to stronger tea; maybe it's because their earl grey isn't fragrant enough; maybe the kitchen didn't have any better ingredients to serve for finger sandwiches; but maybe, just maybe, I've experienced better.

As a person who loves a good cuppa, and usually brew a fierce pot after I wake up and upon returning home from work, Tea & Sympathy is not up to snuff compared to what I've encountered around the city and around my kitchen. The bread for the sandwiches were on the hard side, which makes my friend question if it's been left out for a couple of days. Next tier up are the scones, which surprised me with their light weight and salty taste; I'm far used to denser scones. Upon first bite, I thought I was eating a KFC biscuit. I told my buddy and she agreed, prompting her to wonder is there a KFC nearby...

As for the sweets on the top tier for the afternoon tea, this tray was the best out of the bunch. I could just focus on those baked goods and pass the rest. 

The place is tiny and charming, but it also felt a tad run down. We visited the store next door and it too felt outdated. None of the employees in the store made us feel welcome in the shop so needless to say we exited fairly quick after perusing their somewhat intriguing items. Unfortunately, the products didn't call out enough to us to want to purchase. 

In short, if you were to visit NYC for tea time, you can find another place with way better food and experience."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-11-05,2.0,"I have been to this restaurant/ cafe twice now, and have come away with a conflicting opinion: the food/tea is excellent but the service/staff is standoffish at best, awfully rude at worst.

If I could have the scones, jam, and cream delivered I would. In fact, I think you can purchase these items in their shop next door, which I will be doing in the future. 

I went at noon today, as I had off for election day, with some coworkers for a relaxing afternoon tea. While we were able to block out much of the chaos, it was a forced relaxation. We were jostled/stepped on each time a waitress passed, outright ignored at times, and while we were finishing our tea were asked to leave our table to make room for more customers. I understand the need to keep tables moving, but I thought I could finish my cup of tea after having spent $95 dollars on lunch?? 

The wait staff was kind and attentive once speaking with us, but YELLED at the table next to us when they thought that had broken the ""rules"" of their establishment. I had sat next to the supposed infraction and can say no such egregious transgression was made, god forbid one woman leave a table and her friend take her place because the first had to leave and the second wanted to eat. This infraction would have brought Tea & Sympathy... more business so I'm not sure why they were so up in arms. 

Regardless, though our service was fine, the experience of the table next to us has convinced me to find my tea & scones elsewhere. New York is too competitive & fabulous a restaurant scene to have such establishments continue to exist, and I hope others take their business to other restaurants as well."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-11-11,4.0,"I came on a Sunday night dinner and got the chicken pot pie and the house Rosie Lee tea.   The chicken pot pie was delicious!  The filling was warm, the soup thick, and they don't skimp on chicken!  The best part was the crust which was delightfully crispy and tasted great when dipped into the soup.  The pie had mashed potatoes and peas on the side, which were both okay.  The serving size was pretty big for me--I couldn't finish the sides--so I think you get okay value for your money.

The Rosie Lee tea wasn't anything spectacular; it's an English breakfast mix with nothing particularly unique about it.  It tasted good with milk and sugar, but if I were to come again, I'd definitely try something else.

It's a small, homey place and the ventilation isn't great inside.  But it adds to the charm of a bare bones traditional English restaurant."

Food was good the biscuits or scones were my favorite my son loved the sausage!
The vanilla chocolate tea was awesome  

We will come back -- when we are good and hungry to try all the other stuff !"
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-01-23,4.0,"I was in need of a pick me up, and my buddy knew just where to take me. Some people just truly are angels on earth and sometimes little words need to be exchanged when in a slump. I'm normally a bubbly people person but tonight I just wanted to drink, crash and burn without setting anyone on fire, Lolz!

It was a spur of the moment, hop in the car and make a quick dash into a far away unknown area (just a bit away from my local area...far away but still close enough) so I can unravel my tresses and divulge in a tell all in my true form. If you know me, tea shops are my thang and if I visit a tea shop with you, you've been engrained in my heart as a compadre for life. Tea cups and saucers are the way to my heart...and don't forget cake, cookies and coffee but you get the point.

Since we came in a bit late, we were mindful of our girl talk...per se, friend was a dude but the wonderfully kind, only very slightly judgmental, non-interrupting listening type...seriously need to find more dudes like him...but we go way back like in elementary school waaaaaay back so, sadly I don't think guys like this exists anymore. 

Anyway, we left a bit before closing time as he needed to get me back before the clock strikes 12...I'm exaggerating but that was my frustrated state of mind.

Lots of stuff to 'complain' about and such a perfect and intimate setting here to do just that.

While here, we never felt rushed, servers were polite and we were able to keep to ourselves. Teas are endless and the finger foods are oh so yummy. Mismatched teapots and serving plates, I am in my element here. Mad hatter et al, I find this setting creative, inspirational, and endless comfort. Quilts, pillows and a good warm cuppa tea. I love shabby chic and organized clutter. 

Next time I'm here, I'll make time and appetite for their neighbor -a salt&battery. 

Definitely come visit this spot...dainty and sweet. Don't forget, you certainly should always order biscuits with your tea. Pinky up!"
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-11-02,3.0,"It's tricky- while my friend and I had a pretty pleasant experience I feel like I cannot ignore the many reviews here claiming poor treatment, ridiculous price minimums and other issues. I think it helped that we came in during a weekday- the place had a few open tables and we were able to grab something quick. We got coffee, tea and some scones- the people working were all very pleasant. However the space is very crowded and could do with a good revamp/redesign to allow for a more pleasant dinning experience. The prices are a little up there but it is Chelsea and compared to other places that offer high tea it seems about right. We did get kind of rushed out (only were there for about 25 minutes) but hey- we still had a nice time."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-10-12,3.0,"We came for lunch on a Friday. The place is tight! My back rested on a strangers back . The people next to us had the tea for two and it looked like an experience! We opted for a chicken salad sandwich and the big breakfast with beans. This place is a true Brit tea house, and they served food true to England. So, I thought my bread was dry... but the chicken salad was delicious. The tea was perfection as well! The beans, omg, if you like beans, it's a must to eat here. Beans were cooked perfectly and tasted even better! We even had desert, which was warm apple custard with a white sauce poured over it. It's different but clearly delicious as we had no leftovers. If I return, I want to try the tea for two. It was served on a 3 tier platter, with mini sandwiches of variety and the top was a few deserts that looked beautiful. True eye candy! The bathroom is adorable and clean."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,This place has become my go-to for snow days when you just want a quiet place to enjoy comfort food. The service is always courteous. Thanks for being such a gem. The stewed pie is my favorite!
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-02-22,5.0,"I have come here since T&S opened. This is a wonderful spot. The food is delicious. I have always been treated well, no matter what time of day, whether alone or with a companion. No one ever chased me out, made me order more food, or spoke unkindly to me. The last time I was there was 3:30 on a Thursday. Three tables open. I stayed for 1:30 mins. 

I love all three shops. T & S holds some great memories for me and I hope they continue so I can have many more and keep eating their food. I have a hard time deciding but it's usually coronation chicken, scones or steak or chicken pie. Pot of Earl Grey. Please go. It's a very special place."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-03-25,5.0,"I've been going to Tea & Sympathy for over 20 years, many times for my birthday.  My family insists on going when they come to town and my friends love it, too. The last time I went, two other people were there to celebrate their birthdays as well.  It's a special place that's cozy and charming, with a hilarious staff.  The chicken pot pie is my favorite, but the finger sandwiches are a close second.  If you are kind to the waitstaff, they will be kind to you.  Don't expect to be coddled or make unending small talk: they are British."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-10-07,4.0,Little nook that serves afternoon tea. The presentation of the tea pots were cute. The sandwiches and desserts were delicious but the biscuit could have been served warm. The server was friendly and accommodating. I'm willing to go back to try out the chicken pot pie.
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-02-02,4.0,"We were five people and called ahead to make a reservation but they wouldn't take reservations before 6pm. So we had to wait outside when we got there but we were given a table soon, people clear out soon according to Nicky's rules and for the greater good I think the rules are okay ;)

Splurge on the afternoon tea.. a little on the pricey side but totally worth it($36 for one and $68 for two). My friend took the English breakfast and I took the green vanilla, mine was definitely better. All the cakes and finger sandwiches that come with it are scrumptious. We also ordered the Chicken pot pie and beef samosas, the pot pie was good and beef samosas were extraordinary. Would advise against ordering the chicken curry. Bread pudding was okayish. All together a good experience for our party."

161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-01-14,5.0,"I came here in 2006, in 2009, and again a few days ago. The tea is hot (not the tepid crap other restaurants serve) absolutely delicious with many English flavors to choose from and they will happily refill your pot once you've finished it. We always get scones and enjoy every last crumb with clotted cream and strawberry jam. My favorite teas are black currant, rose, and Earl Grey. Thanks for sticking around, Tea & Sympathy. You are always a highlight during our visits to NY."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-01-22,5.0,This is the cutest coziest most authentically English tea shop. Amazing teas and sandwiches. Will defijitkry come back for tea for two full service :)
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-06-10,5.0,"I finally made it here!! I have always wished to eat classic British fare and one day hope to do so in England and London, however this cozy restaurant is much closer. It is a small but very cozy restaurant and we stopped in a bit before the lunch crowd. We ordered the recommended chicken and leak pot pie which is served with mashed potatoes and peas, all very delicious. It is such comforting food, flavorful and not greasy. I shared this with a friend who ordered the salmon and watercress tarte which was also delicious and came with a fresh and well balanced perfectly dressed salad. It was absolutely delicious and the staff were lovely, hospitable, and helpful with selections from the voluminous menu. I hope to return soon!!  Definitely, I wish to try a Scottish egg, bangers and mash, as well as a Shepard's pie next time."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-01-07,3.0,"Cramped cramped cramped. Such tight quarters. Decent high tea selection and good mushroom shepherd's pie. However, it's hard to enjoy when you elbow someone in the eye to reach for the food or sip your tea."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-01-05,3.0,"Been here more than 5 times and each time I am here for the Sunday roast. 
Their food is legit. Authentic British flavor. I like the proper Yorkshire gravy which is exactly like what I had in England. Their roast beef can be too well done and too dry. So I tend to order roast hen instead. I like the stuffings inside. 
Downside is that the wait time is always long and the a lot room for the service improvement."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2018-03-30,3.0,"I liked the lamb shepherd's pie I ordered.  So was the scotch egg with wonderful fresh salad and light dressing.  But the grilled chicken avocado sandwich was not quite what I expected.  It is the hardest piece of grilled chicken I have ever seen and tasted!  If not for the avocado and the good moist bread, I don't know if this was presentable.  Maybe it is over cooked.  Reheated perhaps?

Aside from our server snapping at me initially - I would have given it a 4 rating instead of a 3 as the shepherd's  pie, scotch eggs and mac&cheese were all very good; except for the stiff as cardboard grilled chicken in the avocado sandwich.

The ambience was very retro and homey like eating at a granny's traditional place; quaint but very cute.

I've never been snapped at by anyone especially when it was still quite early for dinner and not even half-filled yet.

Eventually she became friendlier."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2020-01-12,5.0,We had a delightful time for my wife's birthday. Thank you for the English afternoon tea experience!
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-04-25,2.0,"Here's the thing: this tea spot will make it incredibly hard to enjoy yourself, it's extremely small, people are running in and out.  And you are rushed if you take your time. The atmosphere is really loud and stressful.  Not a good place to rekindle with friends  or converse. Be prepared to spend a lot even if you won't finish your food.

1) it's hard to get reservations and also be on the lookout because if you miss your name being called don't expect a table. 

2) Also be aware they have certain rules you must follow, my group and I were really bummed that we couldn't get scones separately (I mean who doesn't want scones?!!!)  or that it was necessary to get a meal. OR that if you ordered a tea package for (2) it must be shared amongst TWO people even if you are a group of three. 

4) again, no scones are sold separately (still bummed)

5) didn't have a lot of the selections on their menu 

6) customer service from the waiters are ok 

The only thing good thing is, since I've eaten and lived in Wales, UK. It was refreshing to have the food taste alike and have English food

But of all there are other peaceful tea places you can indulge and take your time at."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-11-21,5.0,I'm obsessed with this place!!! I love afternoon tea and it's truly like being transported to England. The other food is also great. The pot pies are delish!
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-05-12,5.0,"Tea time in a british cupboard. The charm of this place is unparalleled. The teA in special unique teapots with cream is delicious. The scones and clotted cream with jam, ohhhh I can't even describe the taste of these without running back to get more.  The breakfast was a real british breakfast, nothing amazing but lovely.  
Sitting in this nook of a place will bring joy to anyone with a heart.
Note it has a ramp and is accessible but very tiny , so don't expect to have lots of leg room. But it adds to the experience in a way."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-03-18,5.0,"I've been coming to Tea and Sympathy for over a decade and it's a favorite of my family, so I was surprised to see the plethora of negative reviews! I feel obligated to set the record straight about this delightful establishment.

Many have remarked on the list of rules posted on the front door. To be fair, I would probably be put off by that if I saw it at any other restaurant, but that sign has been a fixture on the door of T&S since I've been coming here and I've never had any issues with them. In fact, once you're seated, it's easy to forget the rules are even there. 

The space itself is super tiny and cramped, which I think is why they feel the need to be strict about not seating people until the whole party is there, occasionally asking people to move tables, etc. It's understandable since it is tricky to squeeze everyone in there. 

Also, the staff is a bit brusque, but I've never had a waitress who was impolite at all; they just aren't over-the-top exuberant the way some servers are. 

Now that I've addressed the Tea & Sympathy haterz, let me elaborate on why I like it so much! The entire experience of dining here is enthralling. It feels as though you've stepped through a portal into a London tea parlor. (I've never been to a London tea parlor but I would imagine it's something like this.) The decor is so cute and I always find something interesting to read on the wall. 

The tea is fantastic and it's always served in a lovely whimsical teapot! Plus, they give you such a generous portion of tea--I've never finished a pot. Try the chocolate and vanilla tea--it's stellar. Also, I've never found clotted cream and scones in the US that inhabit the same realm of goodness as the ones at Tea and Sympathy. I've tried other tea places in the city and nothing compares. 

The food is good too! I almost always get the chicken pot pie, so I can't comment on that many of the food selections even though I've been here dozens of times. But definitely get the pot pie. 

This is the most unnecessarily long review I've ever written but it is proportionate with my love for Tea and Sympathy."
161,tea-and-sympathy-new-york,2019-02-17,1.0,"This review may get hidden like so many negative Yelp reviews, but if you look you will see that many say the same thing: The waitresses are reportedly rude towards their customers, which seems at odds with most decent places for a cuppa. It is a disturbing pattern of behavior. 

We arrived at Noon and we left at 1.33pm. Throughout our meal (full breakfast, pot of tea and sticky toffee pudding ... yes, they asked us if we wanted dessert) the waitresses became increasingly irate, telling us they wanted the table back (we hadn't finished our dessert). 

They eventually started yelling at us because we were there ""for hours"" and there were ""500 people"" waiting outside. There were, perhaps, 5 people outside and we spent $50. My companion said they were ""inhospitable."" I went beyond that and said they were ""despicable."" 

The oddest part was the younger waitress shouted, ""Don't come back!"" She gets the Gold Teacup Award for stating the obvious. Why would any sane person go back for more? I signed the check and then dunked it in our uneaten custard and toffee pudding. And I'd do it again, given half the chance!

As a customer in NYC, I've never experienced anything like that kind of fury, and I was genuinely shaken afterwards. As other Yelp reviews allege, they've treated many other customers like that. Time + sticky toffee pudding = comedy, but it was a shocking, surreal experience at the time."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-05-15,4.0,"Instagram worthy food at the price you'd expect to pay for such aesthetic looking drinks. Don't be surprised if every single customer here pulls out a phone and takes hundreds of pictures of their food, drinks, and themselves with the food and drinks.

Honestly though, their drinks were pretty tasty."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-03-21,3.0,"Beautiful and tasty, instagram-worthy dessert, but definitely exorbitant prices.

For the aesthetics of the little shop and the foods, this is not a totally unreasonable splurge! But also it is, lol.

The precious mango cracked open, somewhat shockingly, to expose the mango ganache within. Not too sweet, and nice fluffy texture and mango flavor. Just a pleasant treat. Do it for the gram. I did."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-03-12,4.0,"FYI: They have a happy hour at this place with specific menu items listed (their ades) but you can still order from it even when it's not happy hour if you ask!

WHAT I GOT: Lab brown sugar iced coffee, Wonderland egg waffle, and Rose lychee ade

PROS: The obvious pro is that this place is INSANELY instagramable. Interior is a bit on the minimalistic side but the desserts and drinks that come out are anything but. This is one of those rare cases where the food actually looks exactly how it does in the menu photos and it's kind of crazy how they're able to reproduce them to be identical to each other. Flavor wise, the wonderland (egg waffle dessert) was pretty good. Fruit and waffle were all fresh and the ice cream hidden inside was a nice touch/contrast. The cheese foam also added a nice tang. The espresso used in the brown sugar coffee was nice and nutty with a deep flavor. I got the ade as a drink to go on my way out since I was curious about it. Even though it was only a happy hour menu item, they still let me order it and it tasted amazing. Beautiful rose flavor and extremely refreshing!

CONS: Aight y'all. As good as this place is, there are definitely areas for improvement. First of all, the wonderland came with nutella for you to kind of dip/run your bites through but to be totally honest, adding it to your fruit/waffle was just kind of a hassle since the nutella just hardened on the plate and running your fork through made whatever was on it sort of fall off in the process. There was also definitely not enough nutella for the whole thing. On the topic of ""not enough"", the brown sugar iced coffee also needed more brown sugar. I barely tasted any of the flavor while I drank it. Like I totally forgot it was even suppose to include it since it just totally disappeared in the drink."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-05-16,4.0,This is a great place to enjoy the aesthetics of the environment and the food. They have a range of amazing-looking desserts which are delicious and soft with edible flowers on top. I think the drinks maybe hit or miss depending on your palate and the type of drink. I enjoyed my cold lychee drink very much.
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-03-08,3.0,"LRoom is a unique dessert cafe that looks better in pictures than reality. 

We ordered the Head in the Clouds (15) and the Mango (14). I was really looking forward to the Mango but the mango flavors with the white chocolate didn't really work for me. It was a beautiful piece don't get me wrong. They even had the green shadow detailing to the mango, but when I bit into it, the fatty flavors of the white chocolate did not mesh well with the fruity flavors of the mango. Head in the Clouds was okay. It's a bit pricey for what it came out to be, which was a scope of ice cream and cotton candy. 

Overall, mostly an instagrammable cafe. I wouldn't go out of your way. Come to share a picture but the food is a bit mediocre."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-10,5.0,"This is the prettiest coffee I have ever seen in my life!
One of the biggest pros of traveling off season is that you can just walk in to any of the trending places without having to wait for a table. As a matter of fact, we were the only people when we we walked in around 4 pm on a Wednesday (then a few people came in).
The decor was super adorable (if you like anything girly and pink), dessert was yummy and coffee was delicious (even though I was just staring at it for a good 5 minutes and couldn't make myself ruin such a masterpiece).
I thought the price was fair for an overall experience /atmosphere."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-01-29,4.0,"This cafe will dazzle the eyes with delight! 

Whether you're coming for a decadent, photo worthy dessert, a gorgeous mocktail or glittery lattes, L Room has made sure that you'll be visually impressed. 

I kept it simple and ordered the absolutely stunning peach lavender-ade which is essentially a beautiful, peach-lavender mocktail. Instead of regular ice cubes, round ice cubes are used with pansies frozen inside. Since the base of the drink is sparkling water, the bright colors of the pansies really stand out in the drink. The lavender syrup is brought out in a separate container so that it can be poured into the the sparkling water, and it lends just enough sweetness so that the drink is nice and balanced. 

Because I'm such a sucker for the visual I never really noticed that I would be paying around $12 bucks without tip for it. Sure, you're paying for all of the beauty, but just something to be mindful of. 

Overall, a fun little cafe to experience that is filled with creative and interesting menu items to dazzle and delight!"
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-01-19,3.0,"Really unique spot for desserts and drinks! Hands down one of the trendiest cafes I've ever been to. A friend and I stopped by here just for drinks, but we witnessed some pretty creative desserts at neighboring tables. The creations were an experience in itself.

I ordered a latte, which was good, but nothing extraordinary. My friend's Nutella Hot Chocolate was really good - rich, creamy, and perfect for the winter. Overall, great place for aesthetics, but everything on the menu is extremely overpriced. I'd recommend, but keep in mind you're most likely paying for the ambiance and overall experience rather than the drinks/food."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-01-05,4.0,"I love this place! The aesthetics are amazing and so is the food! A great balance of both. 
You MUST get the smoked salmon omelette in a crossaint. Wow! Freaking amazing. The flavors were amazing but the price  it's worth trying though lol. 
Had the mango ganache dessert and it was good. Nothing insane, not too sweet though. Looked better than it tasted honestly. I had the rose + brown sugar bubble tea. It wasn't too sweet but they did it well!"
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-03-09,4.0,"The presentation of the food is gorgeous. The entire place is aesthetically pleasing (very instagram-able). 

However, it is considered more on the pricey side and the dessert and drink aren't anything special. Didn't taste bad, it's just okay. You are basically paying more for the visuals. Worth coming here for the flicks but if you solely want to just eat dessert (on a budget) another place might be better"
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-11-19,4.0,"Cool cute place
Fancy desserts 
Staff is okay could be more welcoming and inviting 
Prices are normal for the city 
Decor is colorful 
The licheeade was delicious and fun to look at 
Loved the Christmas music and atmosphere 
Definitely recommend you try their desserts and drinks you will not regret it. 
Went on a Sunday and there was a good crowd we didn't even wait to be seated. 
Would like to come back and bring my mom I'm sure she will love the experience. 
Gifts and roses are very expensive 
Come and try you won't regret it."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-11-10,4.0,"This place is every Instagrammer's delight. Everything is so pretty, pink and perfect looking.
They score 10/10 on presentation. 

They have a unique gourmet type menu filled with sumptuous looking desserts and drink options. Only problem is most of their stuff is a bit overpriced for eg: flower milk shouldn't be $7 or a raspberry mousse can be lower than $14.
However they kill it with their presentation, every item ordered was pleasing to the senses; eyes, nose and mouth... 

The rose shaped raspberry mousse was a treat for sore eyes; pretty to look at and equally delicious in taste. We loved every bite of it. 
Their chocolate hazelnut cake with passion fruit jelly was my favorite; mix of sweet chocolate with tangy jelly was the winner of the evening.

They serve very good coffee as well, we enjoyed our caffe mocha and cappuccino. My friend's affagato was good as well.
We could see such pretty looking desserts and drinks being served around us.. I can't get over the aesthetic beauty of everything in that place. I wish I had taken better pictures to substantiate it.

Though u land up spending quite a bit for just coffee and dessert, you come out feeling happy and visually satisfied."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-09-05,3.0,"Honestly this place can be rated differently depending on why you're here. If it's ONLY for some nice good pics, then the desserts and drinks are definitely aesthetically pleasing and very photogenic. If you're here for the actual taste of the desserts, this place is no good. 

99% of the people here on the Thursday afternoon that my friend and I came were only there for the pictures (somewhat guilty as well). There was no line, but almost every table was filled. Very crowded. The place feels like it's MADE for IG pics - no real decor.

We ordered the sparkly lattes (a gold one and a pink one) the rose dessert and the one that looks like a bun. I can't say too much about the food because it all just tasted like sugar, but they looked really nice! 

The service was a bit slow, but I think it's because they looked pretty understaffed. Again, there were like 2-3 waiters / waitresses in a packed restaurant.

Honestly, come for the pics - because their desserts really are beautiful!! - but don't expect anything to actually taste *good*."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-01-17,3.0,Cute decor but it's so pricey for what you get. Go there once for pictures and a cute treat. But I honestly wouldn't return. I spent $20 on 2 drinks which is insane. Although beautiful the presentations I'd rather save my coin! The sweet potato boba tea has the weirdest consistency it tasted like there was a cake inside. My peach tea was great and I loved the fresh fruit!
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-25,5.0,Found this place due to yelp of course! Met a friend here for drinks and dessert. This spot is super instagramable/ influencer spot. I ordered the grapefruit and my friend ordered the chocolate cloud ice cream. The server was super nice and attentive. We were never rushed out of the place and took our time. I'd come back to try other items.
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-15,4.0,"Very cute and unique place where girlfriends can chat and gossip. We found this cafe on insta and decided to give it a try.             
Food: 1. Flower Hot Milk- Beautiful drink! But a little bit pricy($7.5)when all you got was a cup of milk with flowers on top. 
2. Lab Brown Sugar Ice Coffee - similar to deconstructed coffee, we found this to be a fun take on the morning ritual drink. If you like coffee, it tasted pretty good. $10 was far to much for it though. 
3.Strawberry milk and banana milk - the taste of this drink was pretty good. I'm not a fan of the fake banana taste, so I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that the banana flavor did not resemble the it's fake counterpart. Again, $7 was a bit pricey. 
4.Rose Garden - Whoa! Best tasting and most pretty egg waffle I've ever had! The whipped topping mixed with with the ice cream and berry finishings. This combination made the waffle less dry and moistened the dish enough to become more palatable. 

Location:

The place sits neatly between other shops. It not much looking at it as you walk by. When you do walk in, however, you might get the impression that they sell flowers. 

They were busy when we arrived and when we were seated, they gave us a table that was to small to fit our orders on. We actually had to utilize another table in order to place everything. They placed table decorations, which were a nice touch, but unnecessary for the extremely small tables. 

Overall LROOM's food and decorations are artsy and cute which is enough for me. I like that they have pictures available on their menu and website so I knew what I was getting before ordering. All menu items were a tad over priced and the seating arrangement was small and awkward, so I give a 4/5."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-08-05,2.0,"LROOM Cafe is a stylish cafe that serves uniquely decorated desserts and drinks. LROOM, originally an online flower shop, is owned by a graduate of Parsons - and it shows. From the moment you walk in, the highly ornate space swallows you in and within minutes, you will find yourself wondering if you are at a flower shop or an actual cafe. The cafe decor is incredibly lovely and it is easy to see why LROOM has become the newest sensation on Instagram.

The menu also followed suit. All of the items on the menu have a picture, which makes it helpful as you go through their wide selection of rather magical pastries and drinks. I tried the Head in the Clouds, The Peach, and Peach Fruit Tea with Cheese Milk Foam. I found all of the items to be incredibly lackluster and mediocre. The Peach, white peach ganache, mousse, and compote encased in a white chocolate shell, was unbalanced in flavor (sour and not enough sweetness with no peach flavor), and I found the texture to be a bit too dehydrated and almost crumbly. The Peach Fruit Tea was icy and refreshing, but it felt watered down. The peach flavor was so mild that it was nearly non-existent. Similarly, Head in the Clouds was photogenic, but it was unmemorable in terms of the flavor.

Admittedly, LROOM Cafe is a beautiful space and it serves one of the most esthetically constructed desserts in the city. However, I left disappointed in how it lacked sophistication in taste. The cafe might be worth a visit if you are ""doing it for the Gram"" or your mantra is ""camera eats first."" Otherwise, I would hesitate to recommend LROOM with confidence."

I got the lavender sweet potatoes bubble milk, omg, this was wonderful! I wanted to take the cup with me but I forgot and I'm so bummed, it was a nice to go type of cup that could have been re-used...bummed! My friend got the hot lavender tea, no milk or sugar required! She also got the head in the clouds dessert, so much fun! Cotton candy on top, strawberry ice cream with whip & fresh berries.

 I ordered lavender and lychee and I asked for half sugar less ice. The guy looked at me like I'm crazy cuz he said all of their drinks are sugar. He looked soo pissed like what did I do? Did you gf cheated on you? Then he handed me my drink and it looked ugly af, nothing like what I saw on IG. I took a sip and I inhaled mouthful of syrup GROSS!!!! Ugh. Wtffff. You can't even mix syrup and tea? Anyways, didn't finished my $6 drink and just toss it in the trash. I would never come back or recommend this place."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-17,5.0,"Honestly, one of the best places I've been to. A lot of ""instagramable"" places are just pretty photos and while this place was so cool and picture worthy it also had amazing food. Everything we ordered from the smoothies to the lattes to the entrees to the desserts was absolutely delicious. It's a great place to go with the whole family. Everyone will be happy!!
*everything is made to order so come in with patience and just enjoy the whole experience."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-07-10,2.0,"I remember seeing L Room cafe on my IG feed and feeling so excited to try out all the delicious and aesthetically pleasing options! 

My friend and I came here on a Tuesday afternoon around 2PM, so there was hardly anyone around. For a few minutes, we were the only customers in the cafe. Looking around the place, everything looked so...millennial. Picturesque tables and cute backdrops, this reminded me of a pop up museum - superficially looks great, but take a closer look and people will notice the subpar quality. 

I ended up ordering the vanilla ice cream with cotton candy. It did the job of giving me my sweets fix, but sadly I was disappointed with having paid $8 for a simple cup of vanilla ice cream and cotton candy. I was hardly impressed. 

No need to come to L Room Cafe - don't waste your money here for some inadequate treats. Looks can be deceiving but you'll notice the lack of quality once you taste the food."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-01-02,3.0,"My friend and I decided to stop by here on New Years day around 5 pm. We have been eye-ing this place for a while after seeing it on Instagram. When we came in, we were greeted right away and quickly seated by the waiter. The menu is extremely extensive with a lot of food and drink options. They have both dessert as well as salty food options. We decided to go with the matcha egg dessert which was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend that dessert, it comes with ice cream and cream. The presentation is amazing and perfect for Instagram. We also decided to get two drinks Lavendar Peach Ade and Brown Sugar Coffee. The brown sugar coffee was just alright, nothing special and quite expensive for something that was similar to just a regular cup of coffee. I do not recommend the Lavendar Peach-Ade AT ALL, it had a weird strange taste to it and reminded me a bit of drinking soap (but honestly, it could be personal preference because I saw other customers drinking theirs.)

Overall, I would return for the desserts but I would def pass on their drinks."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-07-17,3.0,"Very very aesthetic cafe to visit in New York! Super instagram worthy drinks and snacks! Basically, this cafe is an eye-pleasing cafe. 

However, the drinks are mediocre, I found a piece of hair in my drink and when I tried to tell the server, she looked at me straight in the eye and walked away from me. They seat you at a table and bring you the drinks so you have to tip them as well. But I was not happy with the service at all. 

The food and drinks are pretty overpriced not to mention the merchandise they sell there are extremely overpriced! 

If you are in New York and is a big instagrammer, I would recommend visiting once. A good first time experience but won't be going back again!"
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-27,4.0,Overprice but definitely a nice places for girls to hang out. I was disappointed that they don't have the happy hour menu anymore. The dishes was creative and beautifully demonstrate especially the egg waffles which is not too sweet. The drinks can be lack of flavors if you don't mixed it well. Probably I will come back again if I am around the area.
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-05-26,2.0,"This place was made purely for the Instagram generation. Unfortunately, it is much more about aesthetics than actual taste. 

When we walked in on a Saturday late afternoon, it was quite busy and we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. Luckily we got a text within half an hour that a table was ready.

We ordered the cotton candy dessert and lavender peach ade. The lavender peach ade tasted ok, nothing special, and certainly not worth $12. Sure, it looks pretty with the flowers and mixed fruit on the bottom, but that was about it- nothing memorable in terms of flavor. The cotton candy dessert was fine but also not worth $15. It consists of a ""cloud"" of cotton candy over a parfait with ice cream and mixed fruit, in this case, peaches and blackberries. Again, nothing special but did make for a nice photo. 

Overall I think this place is overrated and overpriced. I'll admit the interior is cute with all the fresh floral decorations, so it could be worth a one time visit just for the 'gram, but that's about it."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-01-20,5.0,"Today I went into the city with friends to go museum of illusion. After that we were looking of cafe for drinks and dessert.

Sooo soo yummy, you can choose variety of sweet options and they also have savory as well! 
LRoom is literally hands down one of the most amazing and gorgeous places. 

The way they decorate food makes me wanna go to culinary school and learn exactly how I can manage that on my own! 

You are going on love every single option, little bit pricey but it's definitely worth it, you are paying for not just looks and decoration but taste itself is amazing as well. 

Also again place is great itself that you won't be able to stop talking pictures on top of pictures. 

Did I mention how friendly the stuff is? They certainly don't mind all this craziness, specially I am selfies freak sometimes. 

Only slight issue I had was wait time but next time I went I made reservations ahead of time so there was no more confusion. 

They are extremely packed on Weekends so make sure to do reserve for sure."

We were in the area and decided to check out this place since I've heard a lot about this cafe. Their menu is with pictures that makes you want to order everything, seriously its so attractive and looks yummy. 

We got the wonderland egg waffle and it has chocolate, berries, orange and vanilla icecream. The sweetness is in the exact level that I want. Sounds like its very sweet but surprisingly its not. The berries blends well with the chocolate and waffle. We also got the strawberry and it taste like real strawberry. Its sour and sweet. Lastly the honey latte and its goes well with all the desserts we got because this one taste like coffee with cream and maybe with very little sugar. 

If you're looking to hang out in a instagramable place then this is your spot! Not just that but the desserts taste good and service was great!"
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-05-14,3.0,"I would give this 3.5 if I could. 

The aesthetic of the place is spot on absolutely love the idea and how cute everything is. It reminds me of dessert places in South Korea just over the top and a fun experience. Every detail is made for instagram. They even have flowers you can make a little bouquet. 

I think the menu is very clever with amazing ideas however these ideas aren't as executed taste wise as I was hoping. I was extremely disappointed when I saw that they use breyers ice cream for their sundaes ( I just find that a little tacky) it shows the quality just isn't there. For the price at least get a higher quality product.

The dim sum was just okay I thought it was kind of flavorless except for the hazelnut center. The drinks are unique but will end up costing you $10-$12 for a fancy latte that looks better than it taste. 

I really do love the concept and menu ideas I just think if they were willing to add quality to their products it would show a big difference."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-06-11,4.0,"This place is extremely whimsical and you can tell all elements were carefully thought about before the creation of this place. The food itself is a work of art. Every single item on the menu is photogenic, even the way the drinks are served to you. 

I got the chocolate waffle and the matcha latte which were both good, but nothing to die for in terms of taste. There's also a high premium at this place for the quality of food you are eating as well. It's more for an instagram experience rather than a classic foodie find. The chocolate waffle was a classic waffle with chewy waffle pockets which added a nice texture. The matcha latte was decent, but I didn't like the glitter that much. It's cool that you can drink glitter and it definitely makes for a great photo, but the glitter itself sticks onto your lips after drinking."
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-01,4.0,"Such a cute spot! My friend and I popped in because we wanted to check out their well known rose wall and intricate desserts. I was so happy to see that the rose wall was not anywhere near the seating area as it made it easier to have a mini photo shoot. 

My friend ordered the hot lavender tea and it came out in a tea pot & tea cup. It served at least 2-3 cups which was good for it's price. On the other hand, I ordered the Bling Bling Honey Latte which was fun to drink with all the glitter. A little pricey for how it tasted, but I guess you're really playing for the fancy glitter. I hope to visit again and actually try their dessert next time such as their Honey Toast & Wonderland Egg!"

162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-11-20,5.0,"For starters, I'm so unsure why so many people complained about the customer service here. The second I entered, I was greeted nicely with a smile by the girl at the counter. Also, my waiter was very nice and attentive. The worst thing I encountered was a customer who was being immensely(and unnecessarily) rude to the waiter and even then, he continued to be nice and handle that situation perfectly. 

With that aside.. I ordered the Nutella Hot Chocolate and the Rose Garden Egg Waffle while my friend ordered the Lab Iced Coffee and the Wonderland Egg Waffle. My friend loved everything she ordered and I would have to say the same. I was worried the rose garden egg waffle would be bland, but it was far from that! Besides all the food being beautifully presented, it all tasted good too! 
The only down side was the price.. you could probably get something similar at plenty of other cafes around NYC.. HOWEVER, you have to keep in mind that anything else probably wouldn't be presented as beautifully as these desserts were. In that case, I do understand the higher price because it obviously takes time to decorate them perfectly. 

And one tip.. I went on a Saturday around 12:30-1 and there were a lot of seats available, but it did start to get packed pretty quickly and I noticed there were only 2 waiters and 2 guys making the desserts and drinks, so be patient if you decide to give this place a try! 

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this cute ""Instagram-worthy"" place!"
162,lroom-cafe-new-york-2,2019-07-08,4.0,"This is an insta worthy place, let's be real that's the main attraction of the area. I've been twice and both times I've managed to take amazing pictures and have a fun time overall. 

One start off because the taste of the food is fairly bland, i went with a friend and we managed to order so many different things that when combined they tasted amazing, but it wasn't the best on its own. But otherwise it's a great place i would definitely recommend if you want a cute place to take pictures, but i would advise that you order a few things and experiment with the taste (just make sure your wallets can handle that). 

You'll also need to eat before going since the food probably won't fill you up."

Aside from the desserts and drinks, the store itself is lovely and unique. Large and spacious with a flower shop inside.

Lastly, shout out to the people who work here. They're so sweet and nice; really goes above and beyond for their customers. 

Would definitely be back here to try more stuff :)"

Now to the drink. I got an iced tea drink lavender lychee. It was light and cold. It wasnt the best tea I have ever had but it was made beautifully.

To eat I had the matcha bubble waffle. It is a bubble waffle filled with matcha on the inside. It was nice and hot freshly made. Eat this right away as it's hot crispy goodness will be there. It was huge so shared it with friends. I would come back here for this.

The rose latte was super cute, topped off w glitter, and it basically tasted like lightly rose flavored hot milk, but don't underestimate it! Service was quick, attentive, and very helpful with the menu items. Overall vibe of the cafe is trendy, up-beat, modern, and very pretty. A must-go to spot~ would go again!"

The lemon dessert was so beautiful but tasted like I was licking the cement on the floor. The glitter cappuccino looked so great in photos but was super grainy to drink. The place looks really unfinished - they just painted a room grey and added a neon light to make it seem ""trendy"" but really it just felt like a hospital cafeteria."

There's enough seating and plugs if you want to do work! The only downside is that the restroom isn't very clean. There was a bug in the sink and the sink wasn't really a bathroom sink but more like three faucets."

Right on 18th/6 ave.. good rating on yelp so what we got to lose Right? So glad we stopped by!

See ya soon again!"

Everything is freshly made. My smoked salmon bagel was tasty and a perfect start to my day. They have a good variety of things on the menu so anyone can find something

Staff is very friendly and genuine. I would definitely come back here for another bagel when I'm back in NYC."
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-09-12,3.0,"I really want to give this place a better review but I can't. I got there around 9:30am (peak-ish?) and there was a line of about 4 ahead of me. 
It took 10 minutes for me to get to the front of the line...I wasn't in a huge hurry but that's a LONG time. In the time I waited two people came back up the counter and said their orders were wrong, one had a fully wrong sandwich, the other was a drink, so no great odds.
When I got closer to the register it was clear that the woman on the register was the reason for the mix ups and delays. She could not seem to process what people ordered before putting it into the computer. The man ahead of me ordered a 16oz cold brew and she forgot the size by the time she turned around for a cup. 

When I ordered, I had the same problem, she forgot what iced tea I wanted and I needed to repeat my sandwich order. She also said ""remind me of your name"" despite the fact that I've never been there, which I didn't particularly enjoy, but she was nice.

I got my raspberry pomegranate tea immediately from the barista who was lovely. The tea was great, it had a ton of flavor. The sandwich took a little longer to come up, maybe 5 minutes. It was delicious, but how can you go wrong with prosciutto, egg, and Swiss? 

The place had a ton of seating and the AC running, which was great. The free WiFi was also actually fast. I wouldn't come here if you're in a hurry but it's a decent option."

Try their Egg and Turkey sandwich!"
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-05-27,4.0,Tiny place next to our office we stopped here many mornings to grab a bite. Quickly ordered from the nice ladies behind the counter. Waiting for food gets crammed as there is nowhere to stand. Very few seats but they make the best with they have. Simple decor with a French cafe feel. Food is organic and conscious. Perfect place to get relatively quick food that's quite flavorful and delicious. The coffee is good too as anything is better than Starbucks.

The salad and sandwiches were fresh and light. So, it made for a nice place for lunch. Seating limiting though. Also, menu was limiting so it was nice they were ok with modifications."

163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-01-15,4.0,"Did a bit of research to find a cafe I can camp out for a few hours at to do work in this area. Telegraph Cafe delivered! it's got all the elements to productivity--quiet ambient music, individual tables with empty seats, free wifi, clean interior, and a variety of eats and drinks to fit your appetite as it changes throughout the day. I totally missed their entire breakfast menu for some reason which I regretted because their regular menu is double the price (11-13 for sandwich/salad/soup combos). They've got treats too for that sweet tooth craving. I got the salmon sandwich and lentil soup combo and they were delicious! Fresh ingredients, not too salty, and a normal portion. They don't kick you out, and you don't feel rushed, which was the best part!! Will def come back if I need to stay in the area."
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2018-12-04,5.0,"I stumbled across this cafe while killing time in the area about a year ago, and it's now a regular destination for me when I need a place to work or read outside of my apartment.

The drinks have always been great - coffee, cappuccino, chai latte, etc. I've yet to order something I didn't enjoy. There's also fresh fruit and heartier dishes available.

Free WiFi and a relaxing atmosphere add to the appeal. And while there are a number of small tables tucked away by the entrance, I'm a big fan of the countertop seating next to the window.

Coming here makes me forget I'm in a busy part of the city, and I've never had trouble finding a seat, morning or afternoon. So hopefully this place doesn't become too popular!"
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-01-03,4.0,"Where I get my coffee in the morning. They have pain au chocolat (chocolate croissants), which I really like. Good choice of soups and sandwiches for lunch as well! I love sitting in front of the big window."

It's not to loud, and feels intimate without feeling small. A lot of people choose this place for business meetings. It's usually not hard to find a seat.
To be honest I'm  a bit of a coffee snob and I love their coffee. The espresso is good but their ice coffee is where it's at.
All the food I've had there is fantastic. The portion size it good and so are the prices for Manhattan. The menu items I've ordered feel well rounded in the sense that they have a carb-veg-protein balance. The sandwiches come with a side of salad and the salad comes with bread. I always leave feeling satisfied"

163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2018-12-10,3.0,"convenient cafe serves sandwiches and soups in addition to coffee and teas, it's located at a quiet street away from hustling and bustling 6th ave. I had a caprese sandwich (prosciutto, mozzarella and tomato), 3 different kinds of bread to choose from, for that specific sandwich, bread was neither toasted of buttered, definitely not baked on the same day as it was abit hard and chewy, I was hungry so it served the purpose, but I was not impressed w the sandwich or the bread. there are some tables, expect to bump your neighbor's elbow, or you can sit by the window."
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-03-31,3.0,"I've gone to this cafe about 10 times now and up until today I've only ever had great things to say. Their chai tea is excellent, I love all their pastries and baked goods. But today I went in, a busy Sunday afternoon. All I ordered was a hot spiced chai. 

It took probably about 15 minutes for me to get it. It was crowded and they had a very young girl (maybe 12 or 13?) working there that honestly seemed too young to handle a busy weekend time. Maybe try training your younger employees more before throwing them into the fire. Also, she mixed up mine and another woman's orders (one was vanilla mine was spiced) and I walked away just feeling bad for the girl. 

But then I took my first sip and there was a hair right at the top of the drink. Unfortunately, that's what led me to writing this review. Please try to be more careful with your baristas during busy hours! I really do want to come back!"
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-07-20,4.0,"I had the Chai and almond croissant. The Chai was very good, the almond croissant not as good but respectable."

163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-06-29,5.0,"Love love love this cafe. I've been coming here for about 3 years and have been more than elated with the food, drinks, and service. Highly recommend the spicy grilled chicken salad or sandwich on their to-die-for olive bread. My go-to is their spicy chai latter w oat milk."
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2018-09-10,5.0,"I found this little cafe just by walking around, and it's safe to say that i found my ""usual"" cafe! It's a little gem tucked away in the streets of Chelsea where they sell huge portions of food for a reasonable price, unlike many places in the same area. I had their grilled chicken salad with gouda and i was absolutely satisfied with it. My favorite part was that it costed me less than $10!

As for drinks, I had an iced chai latte with oat milk. I haven't seen many cafes that offer oat milk and I was highly impressed with it. 

I will definitely be coming back for more. I would love to try their other salads as well as the other drinks that they offer!"
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2016-12-10,4.0,"I really do love the Telegraph Cafe.

It's a small narrow place with just a couple wooden tables and the perfect place for a causal sit down cup of coffee or a quick bite to eat.

I can sometimes be a creature of habit and happen to love getting the Caprese sandwich (tomato, mozzarella, avocado, fresh basil in olive oil & balsamic dressing). 

Yummmmmmm."
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2018-12-29,5.0,"Just been to this very nice coffee 10 minutes from Union Square. I was surprised to see this coffee shop was not that crowded compared to the quality and cozyness of this place!
The people are so friendly and the place feels like home. I had a moccachino with a cookie for 7 dollars. Both were quality, home made cookie of course. I am so happy to have found my new favorite coffee shop in this area. A little piece of quietness in this noisy city :)"
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-06-21,5.0,Was attending a conference at the Metropolitan Pavilion and was in need of a coffee and breakfast.  Came to this cute little shop and had the best salmon avocado toast - tangy with a kick.  Coffee was delish too.  Super friendly staff.  I will definitely come back when in the area.
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2018-11-12,5.0,You won't stumble upon this little cafe if you're just walking around in Chelsea. But if you're in the neighborhood and in need of a pick-me-up head straight here for your fix. They'll make it just how you like it! And if you need to get some work done it's nice and quiet with a few tables and bar stools by the window. Just one of those unique warm cafés where you want to linger.
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-11-19,2.0,I used to like this place. They were fast and the sandwich is good enough for a workday lunch. But I figured that they recently become slower for some reason. And I waited for about 20min today and they apparently forgot my order.
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2016-09-22,4.0,"Great place to eat, get coffee, hang out, do some work, catch up with a friend, or all of the above! I had a few hours to kill in New York yesterday, and this place was perfect. They had an incredible vegetarian jambalaya that I tasted and then promptly ordered a bowl of, as did the person next to me in line. And my soup, bread, and soda were under $10! I spent a few hours doing some work and watching Ali Wong's ""Baby Cobra"" stand up on Netflix, then an old friend came by and we caught up over coffee (the amazing aroma of which I had been smelling for the past 2+ hours). They pack in a lot of seating for the space, and people are easy going about sharing space at tables they're not using. I also saw tons of people come and get carry out for lunch. And all the staff are super nice. 

Only two things I can think of to make this place even better: more comfortable bench seating (my back was killing me from lack of lower support) and a daily vegan bakery option (I've got a dairy allergy). 

At only like two blocks east of the Highline, this would be a great place to grab coffee and then take a walk, too."
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-10-24,5.0,I never write reviews but I came here to say that Telegraphe Cafe never disappoints. This some of the freshest food you'll encounter in the neighborhood. There's occasionally a wait - but all good things are worth waiting for.
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2019-09-06,2.0,So sloooow..... they need more help. We waited forever as the counter person carefully made coffees but really this is NYC so get moving.
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2017-05-21,2.0,"More like a cafe with simple ( a bit sketch about sandwiches here). Want to get almond milk latte but taste so sweet because they use Sweetened almond milk ( those crappy one not the barista one)! Sooooo as you can can see, it's not really a coffee place, maybe I should go with PRET now for better and consistent coffee instead of trying different coffee shops."
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2017-04-15,1.0,"Arrived at 10am on Saturday - place was dark and doors were locked.  Hours posted say 930am for opening.  There a dozen or so other confused patrons that walked away.  What a loss of revenue.

We will never know how good this place is as we have other many other options."
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2016-11-04,4.0,"Finally made my way here before going to work. Think many things worked well - wifi, a long counter where you would sip the drink, huge cookies displayed...Their coffee was slightly bland, though; a bit disappointed.

Nothing could beat a small cup of cappuccino towards the end of week!"
163,telegraphe-cafe-new-york-3,2017-12-29,4.0,"Two words: hidden gem! Quaint little cafe that serves up significant portions for very low prices (less than $10 big salads with large servings of cheese/tomatoes/avocados for example).

Highly recommend!"

It is a small cute coffee place with some really good coffees. 

Pros:
-Good cute place 
-amazing flavors for coffee
-great seasonal flavors. 

Cons: 
-I don't think there were any cons. 

Recommendations(have just tried 2 flavors)
-rose citrus 
-ice lavender latter"
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-24,4.0,"Tried this amazing small coffee shop at union Square corner.

Large Iced Lavender Latte - loved the lavender iced latte. It's a little sweet for my taste but still didn't mind a big cup!

  Rose Citrus Tea - is a water based tea with very little caffeine. Something new and different"
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-08,5.0,We stopped in here for the first time today just walking by. We were greeted immediately. Great and fast service!! We ordered an iced latte with almond milk. $11. A little pricey for a small coffee but the coffee is delicious and has great flavor. The roast of the beans is perfect. It was creamy and blended great. No bitterness. Worth it! Will be back to try the yummy donuts they offered! To be continued....
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-24,5.0,Small coffee shop near union square. Very limited seating space (10 max). Tried the seasonal rose citrus which was pretty good; not very very sweet with a hint of rose and little bit citrusy. Tried the iced lavender latte which was pretty nice as well!! The barista is very friendly as well!! They also have a lot of breakfast and lunch options. Will definitely try the sandwiches when I visit next time.
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-07,5.0,"Always pop in here for a pick me up when I'm in the area. Always super fast and friendly service. I absolutely love the iced mochas here. I know, kinda boring but it's what I like. Thank you Le Café for being there when I need you the most."
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-24,4.0,"Small cafe but with a wide variety of teas and coffee. One of the third wave coffee places (price wise at least). About 6-8 seats available for a quick bite/sip but Union Square is always a minute away.
We tried:
1. Iced Rose Citrus Tea - a very mellow rose and citrus flavor. A good flavor but I expected it to be much stronger. 
2. Iced Lavender Latte - recommended by the barista. And loved it! Very good lavender flavor. This is one of their signature drinks and a must try!"
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-01,1.0,The coffee here was so disgusting. I got a lavender latte and I thought it tasted like soy sauce. My bf thought it tasted like a smoked sausage. But either way.. it was not good.
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2019-03-18,5.0,This place has great coffee and snacks!  I have had the rose latte here and a macaroon.  They were both delicious.  This place is small with a few seats.  It is mostly a takeout place.  They also have a punch card for a free drink after a certain number.
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-21,4.0,"Came here to meet a friend, and the place is definitely small and has limited seating. I wouldn't organize a coffee chat here, and it's more of a grab-and-go than a sit-down coffee spot. 

With that being said, they do have WiFi should you decide that this is a nice spot to get some work done. The music was quite loud for me, though, so I couldn't necessarily concentrate. It's also small enough that people will always be bumping into you. 

I had the lavendar latte which was SO GOOD. I initially ordered it without thinking, but after I did, I was so glad this was the one I chose. I haven't tried other things at Le Cafe Coffee, but if everything is to the standard of the latte I had, then this coffee shop must serve great stuff!

Again, wouldn't recommend coming here to get work done or to sit-down, but its a nice place to grab some coffee or beverages."
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-15,3.0,"I'm a huge fan of Joe coffee but being a Parsons student Le Cafe is also super close and the reviews were really great so i gave it a try. i got a vanilla latte (can't stay away from the sugar, ugh, one day i will maybe be a caffe latte gal but for now gimme the syrup lol). It was just ok imo. kinda watery. maybe the other more popular lattes like rose and lavender are better but the floral flavors just aren't my thing. with joe coffee so close i would definitely recommend going around the block for that one if you're trying to find a great latte in the area! however the atmosphere of this place is rlly nice. not too much seating."
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-05,3.0,"MealPal here today, picked up mere 30mins ago, I can already review it because I finished the tiny little Pastrami Break (a.k.a. bagel with two, too-thin slices of pastrami) in the few minutes it took to walk back to the office. No way shall I ever try this bad value again. The ingredients were alright in freshness though pastrami's not hard to keep ""fresh"" and the bagel quality was alright compared to my favorite bagel place in Midwood. The horseradish is so inexpensive a way they can gussy up what is a too-small item. Pastrami itself was normal, nothing to write home about, it actually worsens the pastrami craving which sent me here at all because the portion size is totally insufficient. It's the worst fear of MealPal: paltry item with chronically under-whelming portion size. I'll note this in the daily MealPal last-meal survey.

The store space is heavily air conditioned with bright cute decorations through the tiny space, must be just 80 ft2 of standing room in there, the bulk of it is for their kitchen and storage space behind the scenes.

I shant be back, it's a reminder of the bad values of midtown eats near college areas with affluent college kids (i.e. NYU, CU)."
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-10,5.0,The coffee is super good. The barista was really kind and friendly and made me a swan in my cappuccino!! Will definitely return here!
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-10,5.0,"Stopped in here for what has to be the tastiest flavored coffee ever, after calling to check that they had some bagged coffee in stock. The guy on the phone was super-friendly and when I arrived he waited patiently as I tried to figure out what I needed. He didn't even laugh when I thought the ones they were selling were those lining the shelf that were as big as a large kibble bag. After ringing me up, he opened the door for me to leave since my hands were kind of full. Great experience. Also, they have super-good lattes."
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2017-02-05,4.0,"Came here after dinner on a Friday with my husband and a friend. There were quite a few people in the cafe already. I would say it was pretty busy for a Friday night. I ordered the lavender latte, which was very creamy and lightly sweetened from the steamed milk. I tasted a tiny hint of lavender, which I expected more.

They got these giant macaroons. Maybe they doubled the size of the regular ones. I tried the salted caramel, which was so good. It was a little chewy and with a lot of flavors. I would say if you like the chewiness of a macaroon, they are for you."
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2017-10-23,5.0,"This is by far my favorite coffee shop in Manhattan. The guys are super friendly and they make a strong cup of coffee. Usually I find that flavored lattes are too sweet or don't have enough coffee flavor, but I go in every morning for an iced rose latte and it keeps me charged all day. 

All of their other drinks are worth trying too. The rose citrus tea is surprisingly refreshing! They have a good selection of pastries and sandwiches up for grabs too."
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-20,4.0,"Great little coffee shop, just a stone's throw away from Union Square Park. Stopped by here for an iced latte, which did the trick in the crazy summer heat. They have a ton of other caffeinated beverages, including several espresso-based choices.

They also have decent-looking sandwich options, just from observing their display. Haven't tried any of their food, but I'll definitely look into it next time."

I walk in (And I do mean walk in, its very tiny) and see a full arsenal of Dough Donuts proudly on display. As a matter of fact, there is a good looking selection of baked goods at 
Le Café Coffee.

I order my lavender latte and a very small biscotti. The lavender latte didn't have enough lavender and the biscotti could have broken all of my teeth on this thing.

The coffee itself tasted good if it were a plain latte. I wanted more lavender.
Come to find out, this place is a chain? I walked around the corner and saw another 
Le Café Coffee?? Maybe they make a better lavender latte.

3 stars from me today"

I also had avo toast with salmon and a hibiscus donut. There was a nice fat amount of avocado on the toast, which was really generous.

I have been to this location 2 times just to get their Lavender Latte. 

The first time I went, the cashier guy suggested that I should get the Lavender Latte (cold) &  I did.That didn't disappoint me at all! The Lavender was mixed really well with the coffee and that made the coffee not bitter. I would give this drink 4.5/5 stars. I will try the hot version of this next time I go. 

They also sell Dough Doughnuts! I got the Cinnamon donut and it was the perfect combo with the Lavender Latte~. 

Service: Workers were friendly. That made me go back the second time. They also have another location in 4th ave but, I went to this location because it's just one block away from the Union Square station which was convenient for me."

164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2015-04-05,4.0,"I have been going on a flavored latte craze and found this great place through yelp. It is a cute little coffee shop made for those who want to get in and get out. They have minimal seating, and there is a little bench area if you wish to sit down. 

Here's what I tried:
1. Lavender latte
-this is the second one I have ever tried and definitely opposite from the first one.
-If you like a more strong tasting espresso then this is the perfect one for you. From my first experience, I was expecting something more sweeter, but don't get me wrong this one was not bad. It just really depends on what you are looking for in terms of your latte.
-The espresso definitely takes over the taste and you only get a hint of lavender. I probably didn't start tasting the lavender until about a third into my drink.
-Because it is very strong, you will get wired, which is great.
-In summary, if you like your lattes strong with a hint of flavor then this is the right place for you. If you can't handle something strong then maybe not. 

I would definitely come back if I need a big kick to start me day."

Tried their lavender latte and it was blended at just about the right level of sweetness! Their summer seasonal matcha latte and rose latte also looked so attractive to me! Donuts were even much bigger than my palm, impressive!

Also really liked their decoration, the green color simply reminded me of energy and life. I could see myself returning soon!"
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2018-04-19,5.0,"This tiny coffee shop is right off Union Square. Got the lavender latte on my first visit here - my drink was delicious! I got mine with almond milk and it came out incredibly smooth and rich, perfect temperature and just the right amount of sweetness. The lavender flavor was definitely there but not overpowering. Probably one of the best lattes I've had in the city.

They also have a variety of breakfast sandwiches that sound great. Looking forward to trying those out at some point."
164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-21,5.0,"My favourite coffee in the city. They never burn the coffee and the milk is always perfectly steamed - silky and fluffy - even when they use non-dairy milk.
They have this one amazing breakfast sandwich with eggs and avocado that is perfection. They also sell Dough doughnuts, so A++.

164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2015-03-22,3.0,"Good stuff here, but nothing groundbreaking. I tried the lavender latte - a first for me - but was underwhelmed. The latte tasted good, but nothing like lavender. That is, until I got to the bottom, where there was a sickly sweet amount of lavender syrup or whatever. Pass. 

The almond croissant was from Dough, I think, and it was decent but doesn't make my list of the city's best (and I do have a list).

Friendly service and great selection of Dough donuts (but with Dough up the block, there's not really a reason to get them here). All in all, I probably wouldn't return, because there are more interesting options in the area."

164,le-café-coffee-new-york-2,2016-10-31,3.0,"Le Cafe Coffee is a cute small coffee shop in Union Square area. A few bar stools next to the window and a counter full of pastries! 

I got the Laura Palmer (Iced Coffee & Ginger). I thought it would be ginger bits but the fizziness of the drink made me assume it was ginger soda. Firstly - quick tip! Make sure to stir the drink. As aethestically pleasing it is to see it before - make sure to stir it up. The flavor is just overwhelming ginger if you don't stir. After i stirred it - it was interesting to say the last. Coffee in the beginning with a ginger finish. Not my favorite and I don't think I would order it again. The coffee was average also at best. I was not impressed at all by their flavor. 

For coffee snobs - they use la colombe beans. 

Cleanliness - Could use more clean-up in their milk/lids/napkins table. Plenty of coffee spills on the table and the whole milk was empty. I didn't use any milk (travesty to add milk to coffee!)"

Ah, the small space and lack of comfortable seating, yes. But the others more than make up for it.

Flat white still the best I've had - zero acidity and not over-roasted, smooth and thick, thick crema and foam.

I ordered the lavender latte  for $5 (i'm afraid that this is the standard price for lavender lattes nowadays ): ) and a glazed donut. The cashier was superb and told me that I made excellent choices since the donuts and lattes were the most popular items here, and gave me a stamp card. You get one stamp for every drink you purchase, but he stamped 2 for seeing that I had bought a donut - d'aw. 

This is certainly 1 cafe I wouldn't mind stopping by more often! & if you don't want to be making the trip along the avenues to get dough donuts and don't mind paying the price difference then here is a nice alternative."

But you won't mind because you'll love the milk tea at COCO

Almost as delicious as Ice T's COCO
Even more delicious than Sheldon's Kaley CUOCO
Your waistline will hate you like Lennon's fans hated YOKO
But you won't care once you taste the milk tea at COCO

Better than every single Boba place in SOHO
Makes a lot of Boba stores just vanish like a DODO
More popular in NYC than f**king POKEMON GO
Come and get a milk tea of perfection from COCO

They should use me posing with the blue dude as their LOGO
They should open up in Singapore, Taipei and KYOTO
They will make your belly fat bounce around like a YO-YO
But you will not regret the day you tried milk tea at COCO

If you're a Latino then you're want more than POCO
You'll gulp it down faster than the raging ORINOCO
And all your former crushes will say you ""used to be a SMOKESHOW""
But you won't mind your excess weight, your one true love is COCO

You'll spend all your money here and you'll end up a HOBO
You'll stick a flute inside your p**sy, or maybe an OBOE
You'll find out this milk tea is your same gender and turn HOMO
Because there's nothing in the world you wouldn't do for COCO

WHAT

I'm cuckoo for Coco Milk Tea. Until I tried Coco I had always produced my own milk, and that was working out for me. Then my life changed. And my underwear changed. Obviously. But anyway.

What to get: Bubble Milk Tea Hot or Cold
What else: Katy Perry did a song called Hot n Cold
What else: Katy Perry is hot but her response to my proposition to her was Cold

Probably my favourite location of cocoa in Manhattan for a number of different reasons - one of which is that my picture is the top picture, and one of which is that the people in here were super friendly including the customers who took my picture for me. Another reason I really love this spot is that the milk tea is really good.

I think Coco has some of the best milk tea around and this location in particular is absolutely top-notch. They have a huge blue inflatable thing or at least they did when I was here and that just added to the charm of this excellent location.

I actually think my first Coco (Great Neck) was so good, that it was one of the reasons I became obsessed with Bubble Tea aka Boba in the first place. I've probably had 3,500 of the things since then. But not all from this location. Most, but not all.

This is one of my 5 fave Cocos in the world - the others are the outdoor one in Flushing, the one out near Little Neck which is my bae - like the Yonge St Toronto location - and then this one, which has a piece of my heart. At least I think it's my heart.

Their hot milk tea is perfect in winter, and their cold milk tea is divine. Don't get the 3 ladies and all that stuff, it's too many toppings and too sweet. Stick to boba/tapioca in regular milk tea.

Now I've got to GO GO
My backyard needs a MOW MOW
Then Barbie wants it SLO SLO
Because she's a nymPHO PHO
And I'd never say NO NO
I go down like a YOYO
Because I'm such a HO HO
And also because YOLO

I'm the K-Ci to her JOJO
And she's my favourite PRO PRO
But keep this on the LOW LOW
Lest the rumours GROW GROW
Yes, that's her in the PHOTO
Pointing her pink TOE TOE
But if you get milk tea from COCO
Wake me up before you GO-GO

The drinks are sweet/strong enough where you can decrease the sweetness and it still tastes really good. 

The Hoji bbtea was really good. Passion fruit green tea and grapefruit green tea were good too! The Yakut drinks are also yummy :)))

The shop is small; it's really just the counter to order and a bench by the window. Service is friendly and drinks come out fast tho, so it's a good place to stop by!"
165,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-21,2018-11-25,4.0,"Coco is my favorite bubble tea brand in China. I'm glad to see it opened in the center of Chinatown.
I ordered passion fruit tea with coconut jelly and aloe. I asked for 30% sugar which is what I always get. Shockingly it was sooo sweet that I had to ask the staff to add more tea. She immediately remade a new one for me with no sugar and the sweetness was just right.
Good job on dealing with customers' request! That's how you live up the brand's name!"
165,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-21,2019-05-01,4.0,"I love bubble tea! CoCo is probably my favorite chain to grab bubble tea at.

We came in after dinner in Chinatown and quickly ordered. I had the taro 30% with less ice, boyfriend had the taro 50% with less ice, and friend had the original 50%.

The actual store is small and there aren't many places to sit, but the drinks come out fast and you can be on your way. My drink was absolutely perfect. Just enough sugar and just chilled enough that it wasn't watery. Tried the 50% just to see, and it was way too sweet for me. But that's just a personal preference.

Overall, a solid place to grab bubble tea with fast service and deliciously made beverages."

I scrolled through my Yelp stuff, looked at the Lemon Dunk with Lychee and was reminded of how AWESOME this drink was. Wish I could have one now. Yes, it was cool and refreshing on a day that was (at least for me with raging hormones) hot and kinda sticky, but this was one of the best alternatives to bubble tea. I usually go for a regular chocolate or Lychee joint but the way the lady explained what a dunk is had me thinking this might be better.

The lemon was really good. Like better than chic fil a lemonade good, and then instead of tapioca pearls, I had small chunks of Lychee. I loooove Lychee. This was a great addition. 

I wish we had this joint in NC. Another reason for me to consider moving back to NY. They just have so many more options for everything there."

There are 2 customers sitting and enjoying their drinks on a bench by the window.  If you need a cushion, there are 2 seat pillows available.  Forewarning - there are no other seats/tables.  

The menu is display on the screens overhead.  I order my usual drink - taro milk tea.  You can add bubble and can request your sugar preference.  My drink was quickly prepared.  It was warm and perfect.

The Taro tea was fantastic. Even though I got it at 30% sugar, it was super sweet and tasted delicious. I also got it with ""less ice"" which in my opinion was the perfect amount.

Was looking forward to the promotional deal of getting a red envelope every hour for the first five customers. After waiting several minutes I saw a customer infront of me get the first red envelope. I ordered and payed yet I received no red envelope and asked the cashier why? She claimed that it wasn't the hour yet and it would go into effect within the next two minutes. I was very confused and the cashier seemed like she didn't want to give me a red envelope on purpose. She eventually did but made it seem like she did me a favor. I can't help to think that it was due to me being Hispanic because my Chinese friend and the asian customer before me got a red envelope. Overall the drink was fine but the customer service is bad.

We were celebrating a graduation, which was briefly mentioned when making the reservation. We were pleasantly surprised with a congratulatory card and a special dessert. Cherry on top of the already delicious cake. The service is beyond professional, informative, and overall appealing. Every moment and item, including the music, is designed to match the current chef and style, even the dishware. The food and plating is all beyond anything I have ever tried before. I was in awe with each sip of my drink, bite of my food, and interaction with staff. It is quite pricey but most definitely worth the splurge.

Second thing is the design. Lexus is sponsor of this project so there are a lot of cool car stuff and amazing automatic Japanese restroom. It's like additional experience during the dinner :)
Actually there are three places: cafe, bar and restaurant. So you can come anytime. There is always something open. 
We had asian chef and menu. It was pretty tasty. 
But this place is not only about food, it's about amazing people. Everybody were totally involved in my allergies history  Hostess asked me about it when I was making a reservation, waiters - when I came and even chef wanted to be sure that everything is ok. 
Waiters there are not just waiters. It seems like they all are owners, because they did everything they could to make our dinner ideal. It was the first time in my life when I couldn't wait to leave them a huge tips but you know what? It's tips free restaurant! They didn't take my money.

For food, my partner and I agreed to share 2 small plates and one main. We decided on the Quail 'Piri Piri' and the Prawn 'Balchow'. Both had very good flavor, but the winner was most definitely the prawn. It had a wonderful flavor and spice. Overall, the quail was tasty, but ordinary . The breadfruit tostones it was served over really shone as they brought something different, yet familiar to the table. Definitely my favorite! 

The Goan fish curry was in one word: disappointing. Goa is known for its fish curries and this did not deliver. The flavor was similar to that if a panang curry, with a rich coconut flavor. The fish was encrusted in ""crunchies"" which tasted bitter. 

The finale of our dinner was the sorbet sundae. It was reminiscent of a palate cleanser and did not really satisfy as a dessert. 

Overall, the dinner and drinks were pleasant. This is a no tip restaurant and the food was served by several different waiters throughout the evening. One great thing the counter seating did offer was the opportunity to connect with fellow patrons. We did very well with a couple sitting next to us. We exchanged numbers and were even swapping plates mid meal! The waiters were even kind enough to bring us complimentary dishes to share between the couples which I thought was so kind and thoughtful. They really cared about creating a sense of community over food and conversation and this was the best part of the meal truthfully. 

While the food did not meet expectations, I would consider going back for another chef's pop up."

The flavors are so strong and rich and unique: it's not the kind of meal you need to come back for again, but it's one you savor and worth recommending to people for a nice night out and the treat of something wild and delicious. I hope Francis is your server; he is so passionate about the food and is so kind and helpful that you feel in very good hands.

My favorites are the divine Before You Goa cocktail (a hot and comforting latte-style mix of rum, turmeric, oat milk, and coconut milk), the bread and incredibly creamy orange-colored butter, and the curry green pea stew with banana bread (incredible!) that is one of their full-dish meals.

The bread and sauces at this place are especially top-notch, while the crispy fish and pickled shrimp are pretty good, and the charred chorizo-octopus is pretty eh and heavy on the BBQ pig taste. 

Would come back for the drink, breads, sauces, and their Pedro crepe dessert, which we hear is awesome. 

5 stars!!!!!"

I think the concept of this restaurant is awesome and our menu in December 2019 was from Chef Tomás Kalika of Mishiguene

Since it was Friday night and in light of the resident chef at the time, they had a Shabbat celebration and broke out into music and dancing around the tables for several minutes, which we joined in on!

We ordered a couple cocktails and appetizers to start, a bottle of wine and several mains to share, all of this for under $90 per person with tax and tip included, which I thought was incredible value:
Beet hummus - delicious, and the bread that comes with it is perfect.
Babaganoush- I love eggplant and this did not disappoint 
Kibbeh - tasty and loved the texture 
Foie gras - I'm basically ordering foie gras everywhere I go before the ban for NYC goes into effect. It was very good here 
Pastrami Short Ribs - Cooked very well and you definitely could taste the pastrami spice! We ordered the smaller size and it was a good portion for sharing between 4

Chocolate dessert and baklava - both of which were great.

The restaurant was pretty gluten free friendly for my husband except for the dessert and a few modifications that were needed. I look forward to coming back when there is a new menu."

Currently they have a Winter Glow exhibit which is stunning and a masterful concept of art. I recommend wearing a dark color if you go, because the whole room is golden glowing wonderland. Dark colors stand out in gold. 

Afterwards, we went to the restaurant to eat but the menu was too expensive and sophisticated for my palette. I decided to leave and find something else to eat. 

Something you need to check out is the bathroom, I'm not joking. The restrooms is completely decorated in race cars when you first walk in and it has a completely modern and futuristic vibe. It feels like it's own exhibit."

The chefs rotate at Intersect, making this a fun place to come back to. I came for Mishiguene, which serves Argentinian Jewish food. I came with one other person and we split 2 small plates and 1 large plate, which we couldn't finish. The waiter even suggested 3-4 small plates and 1 large plate for the 2 of us, so I'm glad we did not listen. The babaganoush was smoky and soft and the chicken liver pate, which came with toasted challah bread, was enjoyable. The pastrami short rib definitely was the stand out - very tender and flavorful, and came with a side of truffle spatzle. We were intrigued by the warm babka for dessert, which comes with caramel sauce and smoked vanilla ice cream, but we found it altogether too dense. The cocktails are great - I had the Yenta and would come back for it.

On a Tuesday night, the bar was pretty crowded and fun. The restaurant, however, was empty. By 8pm, there were only four tables of diners. Hopefully it's more lively on weekends!"

The staff and service was good but the vibe was just off. The lighting was bright and jewish music was blasting in the background. At Mishugine in Buenos Aires, the restaurant is dimly lit with quiet music. 

The menu had a fair amount of options but was very expensive. We got the hummus, cigar, tongue sandwich, and eggplant, followed by the short rib. All of the appetizers were fine but they didn't stand out to me and hit the mark. The short rib was pretty good and we loved the spatzel that came with it. That was a fun edition.

To share, we ordered the:
-Challah Bread: fluffy, warm, delicious and served with onion pate and pickles. A great starter and also great for dipping! 
-Beet Hummus: creamy and paired perfectly with the Challah bread 
-Cigars: this was basically more art than food. These ""cigars"" were served over a teacup (very instagrammable) and the taste is honestly a little hard to describe. At the center of the cigar is smoked artic char. I highly recommend because it's just too unique not to order! You can get by with sharing 1 Cigar between two people.
-Tongue Sandwiches: I love beef tongue so this was a must get for me. We each ordered our own because these fall under bite-sized. The beef tongue was tender and the sandwich was phenomenal. 
-Pastrami Sandwich: Probably the least interesting item we ordered but the most filling. Nothing extraordinary but still very good.

After lunch, we headed upstairs to the 3rd floor which housed an exhibit featuring ballet costumes by high-end designers. We really enjoyed how Intersect by Lexus was more than just a restaurant. I would definitely come back to try their new menus in the future."
166,intersect-by-lexus-nyc-new-york,2020-02-15,2.0,"This is the second time I've been here -- the first was this past summer at the Asian fusion concept, which I loved. We came back here for Valentine's Day for O Pedro, and oh boy was I extremely disappointed.

The food was 3/5 for taste, 1/5 for portions -- we paid 150 dollars (plus tax) per person for 2 bites of ceviche, one small taco, 3 pieces of king crab, and half of a duck breast. This was for 2 people too, not per person. The dessert was fried donuts, which did not even fit with the concept. 

The service itself was 2/5 -- for a tasting menu, you should not be asked 3 times for still or sparkling. Additionally, different people delivered each of the dishes and did not explain the food adequately. 

None of these dishes was extraordinary in the sense that the portion size could be forgiven, and I have been to many top omakases and menus in the city for comparison. This is simply not worth the price.

Quite honestly, India Accent offers a much better tasting menu, and I got less food here for the price than any other restaurant in recent memory. Will not be returning to Intersect again, as it seems that they're using their good reviews from before to skimp on food."
166,intersect-by-lexus-nyc-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,"You'd be mishiguene, as my mother says, if you do not make a reservation at Mishiguene. 

First of all, the bathrooms on the lower floor are super impressive. All the doors open automatically and the toilet is heated to warm your tush! 

I digress...

I dined at the counter that overlooks the open kitchen on a Sunday evening. The place was quiet but filled up later on. I loved the tasteful decor and how they had cookbooks from Jewish authors/chefs on display. Apparently, you can get a tasting menu at the counter for what I overheard to be $90. I went a la carte.

I started with the Victory Garden cocktail [$18] which was refreshing and neither too sweet nor too tart. I was afraid it was going to taste like a Bloody Mary. It was actually the perfect balance of all the ingredients- tomato water, honey, basil, green chartreuse, and vodka. 

The bread service [complimentary] was outstanding. I'd pay appetizer price for that alone [don't tell them that]. The server placed a basket of challah bread and pita, as soft and fluffy as a cloud, in front of me. For me. To consume by myself. Let's not forget the butter, which was actually schmaltz and melts the longer it sits (!), and the pickled vegetables, mostly baby beets (?). They're served in tiny mason jars along side the bread basket. The last time I raved about complimentary bread was at Crown Shy. To die for.

I love chopped liver on crackers so the chicken liver pate [$19] on challah toast really spoke to me. The pate was so smooth and creamy. I love how the fat hardened around the edges just like with authentic chopped liver. The herb salad served on the side was spectacular too, the acid cutting through all that fat. The tongs to place the salad on the toast were a little hard to maneuver though.

Okay, so, $39 for roasted cauliflower made me pause for a second [or a minute really], but once you actually see and eat this dish, you'll forgive the price point. The head of roasted cauliflower, which is soaked in milk, can feed two people for sure. Naturally, I demolished it by myself. It was hard not to, especially sitting in a super flavorful beef jus. I really wanted to stick my head in the bowl and lick the remaining sauce.

The dessert was really good, but not to the same level as the rest of the meal. I had the chocolate [$13], which is actually a chocolate tart with orange compote on top. The tahini, olive oil combination didn't really add much to the dish. The tart was also pretty hard, I wish I had a knife to cut through it. I felt like I was going to end up hitting someone in the face every time I went to eat a piece.

I paired this with the Pedro Ximenez dessert wine from Spain [$15]. 

Tip and tax are included so overall I spent $112 on a superb meal. I am dying to come back before the chef rotates out. 

More importantly, when can I book a trip to Argentina to eat at Mishguiene in Buenos Aires?"

The Pita(Maybe not) is so fluffy and fresh from the oven. The chicken pate does everything right, without being salty. 

Flower For A MISHIGUENE : Highlight of the night. It's a little much for a cauliflower to be an entree. But oh boy, that's the cauliflower of the year for me. The stems which are usually dry and hard becomes tender and juicy.

A cousin raved about the restaurant in Mumbai and while their pop up menu is a slight departure from their traditional restaurant menu, they didn't come to play. The food was so so good. 

We had the chorizo based octopus and the peri peri quail to start with. From the large plates, we had the red snapper and then finally finished off with the crepe cake dessert. 

I'm so glad they are here till June because I plan to go back, just for the dessert. I've never had anything that delicious in my entire life of eating out and I will say, its going to be hard for anything else to top that. 

The quail was so tender and juicy and the peri peri sauce had the right amount of kick to it. The chorizo based octopus was really good too, however, the sugar snap peas on the dish, didn't do much for me. I liked the crunch it gave to the dish but the taste not so much. The red snapper was also really good, maybe a little too much tamarind but still super delish. But that crepe cake. It's making me drool as I right this review.

SETTING: the restaurant is upstairs and in a nice open space with high top seating around a bar that looks right into the open kitchen. There's also multiple other dining tables for two / four. There are bookshelves covering the walls with food related books signed by people like Danny Meyer. 

The chef of the night was Tomás Kalika, a chef known for his modern Jewish restaurant in Buenos Aires, called Mishiguene. It was fitting they were playing ""Jewish"" music and we went right around the time of the Jewish high holidays.

FOOD: I really liked the food. Every dish was creative, beautiful and well thought out, including (1) the chicken liver pate served with delicious toasted pieces of Challah bread; (2) perfectly cooked pastrami spare ribs that literally fell off the bone served with truffle spaetzel that was rich and savory; and (3) Gefilte Fish Carrot served with trout roe, pickled vegetables fish gribenes and beet-horseradish purée.

If you enjoy Jewish food, this is the place to be.

SERVICE: service was excellent. Our waiter was great, always refilling our water, checking in with us the right amount and the food was served quickly and efficiently.

Honestly, I didn't think about Lexus even once when I walked in, and didn't think of it when I left either. I had a really great anniversary meal (they were really sweet about celebrating it with a personalized card). Resident chef currently is Sergio Barroso, and the 12-course tasting menu is priced reasonably at $115 tip included. 

Most courses were interesting and playful (almost no utensils are involved), and all were delicious. Some bites were a non-Japanese take on Japanese food, not exactly fusion but almost a re-imagining of what sushi is. For example, a large plushy pillowy gnocchi as the rice, topped with pork belly. Looks like sushi, tastes like Italian. Beet ""rice"" topped with pink cured hamachi; Chinese buns stuffed with Spanish sausage. Then you're taken to a different part of the world entirely with scallops in bacon foam and a luscious oxtail sandwich - welcome to America. The flavors keep jumping back and forth so you really don't know what you're going to get for the next bite. Definitely don't call it boring. 

As our waiter suggested, we didn't get a menu and just let ourselves be surprised, and we were clearly in very capable hands. I left comfortably full but wanting more, which is always a sign of a good meal. Service was extremely attentive and welcoming, 5 stars.

Gotta deduct a star, because Mishiguene was great but not as great as Frenchette (still my favorite) and 040. Standouts were the Friday Night Lights cocktail, tongue sandwich and varenike. Beet hummus and qatayef were decent but the flower for a mishiguene was sort of overcooked/too soft. 

Previous review:

Returned to try the new tasting menu and had a great experience! I do miss Frenchie but am glad to have tried 04They've switched up the bar, too, so many are the cocktails are different.

The food was good, but was excited to go back and try it again, this time with a different chef (they rotate chefs from different restaurants around the world who take residency for a few months at a time - menu changes completely). Both times now now, we've sat at the kitchen counter - if you're a party of 2 I HIGHLY recommend this... even if it means waiting for another day to make a reservation, or eating at an inopportune time.

Ok, so this most recent visit we had the opportunity to try the menu of Chef Sergio Barroso (from Chile). Honestly I didn't think it would be all that exciting, and didn't at all expect a tasting menu - last time it was just a la carte - so this was a welcome surprise.

My least favorite was the salmon on wasabi ice cream. Just not sure what that ice cream was made of. It was very thick and creamy.

The space is great, a real intersection of meatpacking chic, industrial design and culinary science. Cafe and brand marketing space downstairs, dining room and bar upstairs. Chef Shahzad's O Pedro prix fixe lunch menu is succinct and catchy if a bit mysteriously named (prie fixe?) Bread and balchao butter came out quickly and the server was friendly and knowledgeable. Then the trouble started.

With a near empty dining room and a humming kitchen with 10 staff, took about 15 minutes to get around to taking our order. We ordered the prawn balchao, tamarind kampachi, striped bass, short ribs, pastel de nata and kokum sorbet. The balchao was the star - creamy, spicy, balanced. The short ribs felt over cumined and the kampachi limed to within an inch of its life. The kokum sorbet was savory and tasty and the pastel de nata brought images of Sintra back. 

Couldn't really focus on the tastes because...10 minutes into lunch I saw the following. A pastry chef using his ungloved hand to scoop and pat the kokum sorbet on a serving plate, then wiping on apron with no hand wash. Another pastry chef using her ungloved finger to wipe the rim of a dessert plate. A line chef dipping a tasting stick into a broth, tasting on his tongue, then sticking into his apron pocked. No rinse, then repeat! Not joking here, he dipped his taster in two different pots, with a trip to his mouth and apron pocket in between. Exec chef Nick Martinez was in the kitchen at the time. It's possible this is the new haute cuisine trend, but in a time of flu and pandemics this did not go down well with us.

KenScale: 7.75/10

When a restaurant concept revolves around replicating the menus of other restaurants from around the world on a rotating basis, it isn't always clear how involved the latter was in putting together and executing those menus. Since its opening last year, Intersect by Lexus is now in its third residency, this time with Mishiguene (which means ""crazy"" in Yiddish), a modern Jewish restaurant in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Given that I have never been to Buenos Aires (although that will change in the near future as my wife Jun and I just booked a trip to Argentina in December!), not to mention eaten at Mishiguene, I was intrigued to see what the dining experience at this third iteration would look like. While not all the dishes I've had from the kitchen at Intersect were perfect from the prior two visits, both of those visits still showed enough ingenuity and execution that made us look forward to what the next projects at Intersect would be like. This time, though, the experience was more decidedly mixed.

The biggest strength at the current Intersect project lies in plating. Who wouldn't want to get a hand on the pinkish beet hummus (accompanied by charred vegetables, gribenes labneh and pickled quail egg) that are almost too pretty to eat? The babaganoush, using smoked eggplant and tahini tomato coulis sauce, was another beautifully plated dish that works well for an appetizer to dip your complementary bread into. On the other hand, the flavor from the dishes we've had were generally off. Jun and I have always been fans of Middle Eastern cuisine for its clean and soulful flavor, but this time it was hard to see that same identity from the hummus or the babaganoush. On the other hand, other dishes could've toned down on the seasoning. The playful ""cigar"" dish with smoked arctic char, feta and spinach tapenade inside showed good complexity of flavor with the way ingredients worked together, but it left a bit uneasy tension on my palate afterwards. We didn't appreciate that the portion of the three dishes we had started with would be larger than our expectation and were already nearly full by the time the main dish, a ""generous"" portion (for 2-3 people, available at $75; there is also a ""very generous"" portion for a larger group at $125) of pastrami short ribs arrived. The texture of the short ribs (with elaborate preparation on full display from the counter where we were sitting) was quite stunning; the problem again was the flavor, this time coming from the honey-cognac glaze that overwhelmed the meat. While the truffle spätzle that accompanied the short ribs could've been a wonderful side dish in any other setting, this time it didn't quite help neutralize the aggressive seasoning of the meat. By the time we were done with the short ribs we were too stuffed to even think about ordering from the dessert menu.

Getting a reservation at Intersect isn't too difficult although the dining room was nearly full this time when we visited on a Friday evening. Reflecting the root of Mishiguene, the wine list at the current project consists mainly of the varieties from South America, especially Argentina. We split a rich bottle of Mendoza Malbec to complement the meal. I wonder if Intersect could explore redecorating the dining space every time it launches a new residency to better align the space with the restaurant's theme, similar to what Chefs Club does from time to time. After our meal, we were both wondering what the source of the flavor mishap could've come from. Jun noted that it could very well be that the kitchen was faithfully replicating the dishes from the original Mishiguene the way the latter would've served the diners in Buenos Aires. Due to time constraints (we are spending only a few nights in Buenos Aires, with the rest in Patagonia), it's probably likely Mishiguene will not be on our list of restaurants to visit during our December trip so we will not figure out this riddle any time soon. Suffice to say that we both felt the food could've tasted better when considering all the creative plating."

Food: presentation - ok, but last season was so much better ,most dishes are overly salty , overly Smokey  on the foie gras dish , it's like they wasted the foie gras ~ 
We ordered most of the dishes on the menu , nothing was really good , just OK . 

Drinks : it's ok, just like you went to regular bar ~ 

Service: was really good !

Decor of the restaurants are very cute ! 

But if you are a foodie , and don't care the decor of the restaurant , it's not worth to visit . 

I have 4 stars only because food and drink just normal =2 stars 
service and decor =2 stars ~"

When I walked in, she was already seated and she happily announced that the crew got her a birthday card. We started off with bread - I only tried the pita bread to save room for entrees. Pita bread was soft and fresh. I hesitated ordering the tasting menu because I had a full lunch and was afraid I wouldn't have the appetite for it but I was glad to have ordered 5 courses for $95. Their portions are big even for tasting menu. I liked the food even though I wasn't hungry so that means the food should be good, yeah? And because we were celebrating my friend's birthday, we had extra desserts on the house!"
166,intersect-by-lexus-nyc-new-york,2019-04-12,5.0,"Now this is a great concept.  The restaurant portion of Intersect is like what Ramen Lab is for ramen.  Intersect by Lexus has some cool displays, but the star is the restaurant upstairs which is run by Danny Meyer's group.  The concept is that they bring in internationally renown chefs to take up residence at Intersect for a few months.  In this way, the cuisine and menu change often.  There's an in-house team cooking the chef's food and there's a pastry chef who does the desserts.  So while the menu savory menu changes based on who the chef in residence is at the moment, the desserts stay the same.

We came to Intersect because we found out that Chef Gregory Marchand of Restaurant Frenchie in Paris was the chef in residence.  We had eaten at Restaurant Frenchie in the past and loved it, so couldn't pass up the opportunity to try his food in NYC.  His menu had subtle hints at New York City and was delicious.

Every single dish was excellent.  Standouts were the fois gras dish with pastrami as well as the pork with harissa.

The staff were great and our waiter was very knowledgeable and seemed excited for the menu.  He gave great suggestions and made every dish sound as amazing as they tasted.

I already want to come back as their current chef in residence is Chef Sergio Barroso of Santiago Chile's 040 restaurant."
166,intersect-by-lexus-nyc-new-york,2019-05-23,5.0,"Top rating for a top spot. This place has it all - cafe, restaurant and bar/lounge, each with their own offerings and ambiance. Everything is A+.

When you enter on the first floor, you are greeted by a host and see the cafe to your left. They have small bakery items, fresh coffee, and everything is Lexus-inspired (the coffee spigots are stick shift-esque). On your right is a display of items designed by Lexus sponsored artisans, like a $400 leather ball or ceramic vase. There are also 3 interactive touchscreens you can use to look at the menus, or read about their other 2 locations (Tokyo and Dubai).

As you walk further into the first floor, there are tables and books, and another panel and display of Lexus items, but it's all done to a museum-like quality. There's no blatant advertising; everything is very tasteful. The first floor also has the coolest bathroom I've ever seen. The fastest automatic sliding doors in history open to a wall of toy cars behind acrylic, a common hand-washing area, and private stalls with top of the line Toto toilets for a life-changing...ahem...experience.

As you walk up to the second floor, take a look at the real Lexus parts covered in white and draped like art along the wall. You can either dine at the restaurant or the counter, or have snacks & truly crafted cocktails at the bar, with comfy lounge seating.

Because this is a Danny Meyer institution, the prices are inclusive of tip - but actually still reasonable. Cocktails are below $20 and the snacks available (like the fried chicken, the cheese plate etc) are great. 

You simply must visit this gorgeous and museum-like concept space!"
166,intersect-by-lexus-nyc-new-york,2020-02-03,5.0,"New menu, new drinks, and new theme but same quality and services.  They are currently featuring an Indian cuisine menu and I cannot tell you how amazing the food and hospitality was.  From the half plates I tried the pedros seafood tower, Alaskan king crab, purple potatoes dangar, bone marrow and the chorizo braised octopus.  For entrees, we ordered the striped bass coconut curry, mapusa sun dried pea curry, pork neck, short ribs and the dry aged duck.  For desserts I had all 4 options.  

Honestly everything was amazing, you can't go wrong with anything you order.  A few of my favorite dishes were the chorizo braised octopus, the octopus was cooked perfectly. For the seafood tower, everything was so fresh and the flavor and creativity was amazing.  The Alaskan king crabs had me craving more.  As for entrees, I want to highlight the short ribs, oh my gosh was it tender.  It just melted into your mouth.  I loved how hands-on the duck was with the tortilla wraps as well as the Goan banana bread with the pea curry.  I wasn't expecting too much of this dish, but it was a pleasant surprise, the freshly made banana bun you can smell the aroma of the banana.  The dough plus the pea curry went so well together and it was a light dish.  We were told this is eaten as a breakfast food in India, which I can see and this would be something that I wouldn't mind eating to balance out all the meat I had.  

Just when I thought intersect can't out do themselves they then surprise me every time.  I love the concept of how the menu changes, gives that limited edition feeling and makes you want to go even more because you know if you don't try it now it won't be there waiting for you later.  I also love their attention to detail not only on the food and flavor but it goes down to as simple as the plates and cups.  This is definitely a place that I would recommend and a place that I would keep coming back to, they have the cafe for a simple coffee meet up, the bar for drinks and snack for something casual and main dining area for lunch n dinner."
166,intersect-by-lexus-nyc-new-york,2019-04-02,4.0,"At first I was pretty skeptical going to an automotive sponsored coffee shop, however, Intersect By Lexus did not disappoint. 

This place is completely sponsored by Lexus. The first floor is a small cafe with nice interior design. The upstairs is supposed to be a nice restaurant founded by a few famous Chefs. This rating is purely based on the cafe, I didn't get the chance to walk upstairs to the restaurant. 

Since this was a pretty brand new place, I asked for recommendations. The barista immediately suggested that their Matcha Hot Chocolate is a hit (usually go for coffee) and I was intrigued to hear matcha flavored hot chocolate. I also got a PB&J cookie for the complement. 

The Matcha Hot Chocolate presentation was super classy, but the taste is what nailed it home for me. Instantly, you can tell that they don't use any powder, it tasted super fresh matcha. I was so amazed of the taste that i simply took my time to sip on this. Also, the cookie tasted really good to the drink. 

Overall, Intersect by Lexus is a gem, and a really great place to spend time alone. I would come back and give the restaurant a try since I was impressed by the cafe."

Stumbled upon this place while looking for coffee shops to get some work done. The place was quiet and there weren't many people so it was perfect!

I got the Matcha latte and the whiskey chocolate, which were both good. Loved the matcha because it wasn't sweet and the whiskey chocolate was rich and delicious.

The bathrooms were clean, they are very nice (heated seats!!), check them out!

I would definitely go back."

Intersect has a sexy, cozy vibe to it. It wasn't congested or loud and the music playing in the background was lovely. The ambiance was great and my waiter was attentive and made sure my experience was exceptional. 

I love the cashless, no tipping concept. 5 thumbs up for me. 

The Valentine's day menu was a 4 course prefix menu for $95. I wanted more flexibility & options so I ordered from the regular menu and wasn't disappointed in the least. Everything was flavorful & delicious. If you was thinking about ordering the duck, GET THE DUCK! 

As a foodie, I love the idea of a rotating line up of internationally celebrated Chefs-in-Residency, and for that reason alone, I'll be stopping in during every rotation to check out the new food menu & cocktails. 

The duck was so good, it made me want to buy a Lexus :p"

I came here with 2 other people. The service was excellent. The food was amazing. Everything was Instagram worthy. I got to try around 12 different dishes. Lets just say the flavors were on point.
I would recommend friends and family to come eat here. Best nyc restaurant experience in a long time."
166,intersect-by-lexus-nyc-new-york,2019-08-07,5.0,"Sleek looking spot with a great concept of rotating chefs every six months to keep the flavors rolling.  Bar area is cool enough to hang out in the entire night with bites and cocktails and the open kitchen dining room is a show within itself.  This time around the sirloin tartare taco, cod churros, frenchie fried chicken w/jalapeño aioli and the intersect burger with miso cheddar on a boa bun were menu standouts."
166,intersect-by-lexus-nyc-new-york,2019-02-20,4.0,"Unique concept restaurant with modern designs and impeccable service, the only reason I didn't give the restaurant a five star is because the food, while innovative, wasn't anything out of this world in taste. Upside to that is I can come back again and again with the next rounds of resident Chefs! 

I came with my best friend for Valentine's day lunch (2/14/19), the restaurant was nearly empty when we came for our 12:15pm reservation and it quickly filled up. We chose to sit at the Chef's counter hoping for some kitchen action, but all we saw was one guy prepping veggies for the day. I would definitely recommend table seating next time. 

We chose to do the $35 two course lunch tasting menu, being a tip-less restaurant this price is extremely reasonable! 

STARTERS
Baby leeks (3.5/5) - the presentation is better than the taste, hope you're not lactose intolerant because this dish is 95% milk based and 5% leek 
Lamb ragu (4/5) - full punch of flavor packed in the most perfect little plate of pasta, stay away if you're not into the gamey taste of lamb 

MAINS
Duck confit (3.5/5) - I really wanted to love this dish, the skin was perfectly crispy and the meat was tender, my only complain is how much fat there was! I spent too much time trying to cut the large chunks of fat off, not a pleasant dining experience 
Halibut (3.5/5) - my friend had this as her main and said the dish could use more flavor and be less dry"

167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2020-03-23,5.0,"Stumbled upon this gem before visiting the 9/11 museum. My food was INCREDIBLE. 
- Some of the best avocado toast I have every had... which is saying a lot, since I have had MANY a piece of avocado toast. It was a simple avocado mash topped with evoo, lemon, and red pepper flakes on a thick multigrain bread. I think what made this so good was 1) the fact that they probably used an entire avocado on the one slice of toast 2) the fresh and thick bread and 3) adding olive oil on top. the olive oil really elevated the toast. 
- I also got an iced oat milk latte and it was AMAZING. The oat milk was very creamy - I think they use oatly. 
My only complaint is that it was a bit expensive, and the avocado toast took so long to come out. I had already finished my entire coffee by the time my toast came out. Maybe 15 minutes? Regardless, I'll definitely be back because this is a great stop for healthy, high-quality bites and coffee."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2020-02-12,4.0,"We went to this Blue Bottle location multiple times during our trip to NYC. They're situated right near the Oculus, making it a very convenient location to grab a coffee before or after a shopping spree.

The place inside is classic Blue Bottle, a lot of light, wood and branding.

I understand that this is a very high volume coffee shop, but I feel baristas could be friendlier. We've been to this place 3 times and the service we got could have used a lot of improvement, each time.

They have a decent amount of seating, but if gets very busy so it can take a while to get a place to sit in, especially for 3-4 people.

The coffee tasted great each time so kudos to the team for the consistency. I enjoyed coming here, so next time I'm in NYC I will stop by."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2020-01-22,2.0,"It's a no for me. 

I was so excited to have a bluebottle next to work. I was mentally preparing myself to shell out $5+/day for a cup of good coffee that would upgrade my day. 

But no cup of coffee is worth waiting around for 30 min in a crowded space...you could tell the baristas were frustrated and the management stood next to them just talking. This was the case for the last three times I've been there.

If you do end up going and waiting around , I recommend the winter latte and the lemon poppy seed bread."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2019-12-09,5.0,"Happy to see west coast coffee in NYC and no doubt the coffee tastes dope whichever coast you're on. If you're in the World Trade Center area or shopping at the Oculus or Brookfield Place, this location is in the middle of all that. 

Ended up bringing my cousin here to get something hot to drink. I tried the seasonal winter latte which tasted great and my cousin who doesn't really drink coffee enjoyed their hot chocolate which also won her seal of approval. Service was friendly and they got the drinks out piping hot and in a timely manner. We ended up relaxing at their bar stools which also has a window front that faces the 9/11 memorial. Great spot to people watch or enjoy the scenery.

I also appreciated the water they had on hand and the clean bathrooms for customers. Would definitely recommend trying if you're in the area!"

The Cafe Latte was excellent. Milky and not acidic at all. Every sip was purely fantastic. Also comes with foam art over the top. The New Orleans Iced Coffee was superb as usual. Chickory forever. 

The service was excellent as usual. The interior was immaculate as usual.

After visiting the museum, I dropped by with a friend to grab something warm and let's face it, winter calls for hot chocolate (although my non-caffeinated tendency makes it a call at every season, but that's another story). My friend got the matcha latte. The bit chocolate was unbelievable! It was so delicious and super rich. The matcha was good but hot chocolate so much better. Highly recommended!"

I ordered a small shakerato, which was over $8 after tax, and it was not good at all. Because I'd never had it and usually get the New Orleans iced coffee, I asked to switch to the New Orleans, which they agreed to do for me, but that wasn't as good as usual either. Usually I consider Blue Bottle expensive but worth the treat once in a while, but It was definitely not worth it here today."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2019-04-26,4.0,"OMG! My new favorite coffee shop in NYC! Located in the downtown FIDI area right across from the 9/11 memorial. So, I originally wanted to try Blue Bottle because the grocery market I actually work for sells their canned cold brew. It sells like crazy, so I knew that Blue Bottle had to be something special. When I first walked in, I was amazed at the openess (is that even a word? Spell check says THATS A LIE!)... of this location. The windows brought in all the sunshine and positivity for all the crazy new yorkers coming in to get their coffee. Some coffee shops can be dark and dingy, so I appreciated the light...I'm a socal girl and we LOVE the sun!

The barista was super cheery and friendly for a weekday morning...ok I'm so feeling this place. I decided to order the avocado toast, breakfast sandwich, 2 Oatmeal cookies, mocha, and New Orleans Iced Coffee....Everything was fantastic but if I had to pick my tops they would be the Iced Coffee, Avo Toast, and Oatmeal cookies...First of all these Oatmeal cookies are out of this world, caramely, nutty, chewy heaven. I Stan them so much and wish they sold them by the dozen. The avo toast was definitely hearty and a good portion size. The iced coffee was simple but you could taste the freshness and quality of the brew! Overall, I had a very positive visit and Blue Bottle and it's definitely a must-try!"

The cashier informed me they didn't have lemon slices only lemon juice which I don't like so I decided to get a cafe mocha instead. She was so kind and said it's on the house. Who was I to argue. I'm going to assume it was because they didn't have what I originally wanted. If that's the case that is excellent customer service. The coffee took long to prepare but boy oh boy was it worth the wait. Absolutely delicious. Made to perfection. I almost never wanted to finish it. The cherry on top was the pretty heart design that was made on top. I will b back!!!

I have had their coffee before and I really like their cold brew and cappuccino. This time also I ordered cappuccino and loved it. 
Their service is amazing, the shop itself is very nice, clean and well maintained. They also have few tables inside the shop. They not only serve coffee but also pastries and breakfast sandwiches, not a lot of options but surely healthy."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2019-08-14,5.0,"Blue bottle coffee definitely have their way making my ice latte great. In the morning, there were always a long line to get your order in. Their menu was also limited to few kind of coffees and pastries. I usually get their ice latte which offer only in one size(small, 12oz). At the price of $5, it is a pretty pricy drink but I would say it is definitely worth it. It is smooth, not bitter and a bit of sweet after taste. The service is quite slow compare to other places since there is always a line."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2019-11-10,4.0,"Great spot to grab a quality coffee if you're around the World Trade center Area.  The store is thoughtfully designed and beautifully integrated with the architecture in the area, blending seamlessly and naturally into its surroundings.  Admittedly, this is quite an expensive cup of coffee ($4.90 for pour over) if you're like me and are primarily motivated by caffeine intake rather than specific coffee flavor profiles.  

However, for that $4.90, you get to interact with Blue Bottle's wonderful and knowledgeable staff who are willing to impart some of their knowledge about the coffee you're drinking if so desired.  I learned about their brewing process and what sets each of their coffees apart while waiting for my cold brew, which is an experience you can't find at Starbucks.  Consequently, this also means there can be long waits (however, they have just released an iOS app that will likely alleviate this issue; I have not used it yet). 

If you're serious about your coffee, or want to learn something new about what you drink every morning, I suggest you pop in and grab a pour over as an extravagance beyond your usual morning coffee.  If you want a quick and easy coffee irrespective of flavor or quality, chances are you'll find Blue Bottle disappointing and the experience confusing (but I don't think it was meant primarily for this customer, anyway)."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2020-01-14,5.0,Best coffee I've ever had. I was dying to try this place after all the hype and I was not disappointed. The quality is definitely there. I thought it was one of those fads that don't live up to the hype but I was definitely wrong. The coffee is super strong and you can taste the quality. Lines get pretty long so I'd mobile order if you're in a rush.

The order taker was very polite and helpful. They came out fairly quick too!

The Mocha was better than the Macchiato and important note: the Macchiato is served traditionally small here, which I was fine with, but just a forewarning to others!

The music was a mix of Spanish music playing in the background and it was a great little atmosphere.
They are across from the WTC memorial and right next door to Spotify HQ. 

The only downside is it was very warm in there and they didn't seem to have a lot of seating... almost too much empty space."

Definitely a busy joint, lots of people working in nearby financial buildings come here as well as tourists coming to the 9/11 memorials. I waited probably around 15-20 minutes total for my drink, so if you're in a hurry, get here early or find somewhere faster. 

**Important note, there is no Wifi -- I'm sure this is intentional to prevent people from hanging around, as the store has very little indoor seating (max 12 seats), though there are a few 2-person metal tables out front and ample seating nearby. 

Everyone I interacted with was very cheery and accomodating. I asked for a flat white with skim milk, which isn't technically on their menu, but they were happy to make it for me. 

On to the drink -- and what a drink it was! It was probably in the top 5 flat whites I've ever had (and I have had a lot, let me tell you). It was a very unique taste, but absolutely in a good way. I honestly can't think of a good way to describe it, so I's recommend heading over if you're a coffee fan! 

The prices are about what you'd expect from a boutique coffee place, $4-5 for a smallish cup. The also offer a few sandwich/brunch options for $7-9. Nothing that will break the bank. 

All in all, an excellent place to get great coffee if you want to splurge a little on a weekend stroll or if you want to visit the 9/11 memorials and museum."

It is seriously understaffed and the current staff is super slow and super tardy. I stopped by this morning while walking my dog to get a latte togo and it was crowded as usual (they get a lot of tourists at this location because it's right in front of the 9/11 memorial). That was fine, but I had to wait --believe it or not -- 40 minutes to get my one small latte. While waiting I observed the staff behind the counter and there were two people making one small hot chocolate, slowly and surely...and the person who was running the cashier was solely dedicated to it so whenever he had free time instead helping the baristas he just stood around. And the entire time they had about 25 people waiting in front of the counter for their coffees. 

Blue Bottle, please I love this location so please hire more staff and please train the current staff so they are more productive. This place can do so much better."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2018-08-23,5.0,"They do take a bit longer to prepare the coffee here but it's worth the wait. Great tasting expresso macchiatos and cold brews. You can get the cold brew to go in a can.
There is limited seating in the cafe. That's not a problem though - plenty of other places to sit and enjoy in this beautiful location! If you are visiting the World Trade Center and enjoy your coffee, this is a pit stop worth making."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2019-05-05,5.0,I came here on a weekday late afternoon and the service was quick and my latte was on par with other Blue Bottle locations I've been to.  I will definitely come back as there's a good amount of seating and nice open windows which is great when doing work.
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2017-11-13,3.0,"The staff is super friendly, accommodating, and welcoming - the employees really seem to enjoy working there. And I love their music choices playing in there - it's been a good range of the oldies and the 90's. The coffee, on the other hand, has been quite disappointing. I've had Blue Bottle Coffee during a visit to California years ago before Blue Bottle started spreading around the tri-state area. I really enjoyed my coffee then and I was super excited when I found out that Blue Bottle Coffee was opening right by my job!

I've ordered a latte with almond milk on two separate occasions now. I don't know if it's the coffee or the almond milk, but drinking my latte has not been enjoyable because of a very grainy texture. Is the almond milk made in store and wasn't strained enough? I think it's the almond milk that's making it grainy because it seems almost neutral colored when I try to take it out for examination. It was like this the first time I had the latte with almond milk and I wanted to give it another chance the second time, but it's still the same texture.

Next time I'll just order coffee instead of a latte because at my old age, I can only take almond milk! But I know this place has the potential to make me happy and to be my go-to coffee before work! We'll see!"
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2018-02-14,5.0,"Excellent coffee, service, and location. You can see the 911 memorial from the window and it makes the experience just that much more special. 

The employees are nice and they seem to enjoy working there. I love the overall vibe."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2019-12-14,5.0,"You don't need the app! Of all the coffee joints in the hectic apple, best one is this godsend gift perched overlooking WTC. My boyfriend & I take a daily morning walk & we certainly tried all the coffee shops in the city including many other blue bottle spots. But our first time here was the last time we went elsewhere. Beans are good but the people are why we go back every day. They came up with an app to preorder your coffee and its ready when you arrive but after our first try we never used it again because the human factor of interacting with them for 5 minutes every morning is homey & warming. 

Not only do we get the best tasting coffee, but we also have the best team of coffee experts sharing it with us: Zack, Simon, Owen, Inga, Nia, Renee, Richard, Arturo.. they make us feel welcome, comfortable, and prepare our order like we're grabbing a cup of coffee in our own kitchen amongst friends. Highly Recommend!"
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2018-08-21,4.0,"Unassuming entrance on first floor corner of a building across from the World Trade Center memorials. Solid coffee with sleek interiors as always. I always get the New Orleans ice coffee with whole milk- so good on a hot day and just a little sweet (perfect pick me up on a work afternoon). Note if you get the drip coffees, can take awhile so be prepared to wait. Otherwise the line usually isn't too long despite being near tourist destination. I've tried the food/dessert items and am relatively unimpressed - would stick with the coffee."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2019-04-29,5.0,"One of my best coffee chain,always good quality of coffee and excellent service and atmosphere"
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2019-10-25,5.0,"Excellent coffee, expertly made every time. They rotate coffees and offer new varieties quite regularly. The line is done times discouragingly long."
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2019-07-09,4.0,Every location is the same. Coffees is always consistent wherever I go. I love their coffee. The interior in this one is beautiful. It has somewhat of the view of the World Trade Center. The staff was friendly. Bathroom was clean. And it's an amazing location to get coffee and walk around.
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2018-10-07,5.0,"What in the WORLD...I thought this was just a coffee shop. NOPE!!!
So pleasantly surprised! Sipping on my china yuanyang coffee/tea mix, with this lightly butted, dark chocolate drizzled, perfectly toasted belgium waffle. Not to mention this croissant, with think cut bacon and eggs sandwich. AND to add insult, I ate there salted, chocolate chip, cookie...JUST GRAND!"
167,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-11,2019-09-17,5.0,"I was told to give this place a try by a friend in Boston. I will admit, this is by far the best coffee I've ever had. I had the New Orleans cold brew and let me tell you, give it a try!!"
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2020-02-28,5.0,"Awesome place! Chicken sandwich is great to. Had a bite here with some friends and its the perfect place to hang. Friendly staff to. Especially the big dude Ryan.
:D"
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2020-02-16,2.0,"This is a special place because it's a gamer cafe, and even though I'm not into games, I love that this exists so gamers can feel at home and enjoy playing with others who are into the hobby. It's more of a Mecca than a regular cafe. They have free WiFi (password is BuySomething) and to play games there, you need an account, which you load money onto. It's clear that the majority of people who come are regulars. Cool place. 

The reason I'm giving it two stars is because 1- the coffee was really bad, and for $2.5 at a local place, I'd expect something better than what I could get at a city cart, and 2- the service is only friendly to people who come regularly, and this is not cool. The girl with the purple hair totally shrugged me off, and Ryan, the tall guy, was really rude to an older man who came in. I didn't enjoy watching that and it left me with a bad taste. If you're going to run a cafe for unusual, not mainstream, not your run-of-the-mill guys who likely didn't feel welcome elsewhere before coming here, then you've gotta be kind and welcoming to everyone, not just your regulars."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2020-01-29,3.0,"It was almost 12:30PM and I was without a drip of coffee in my system . (Shame on me). I also checked google instead of yelp to find coffee. (Shame on me x2). This place is more for gamers and they sell coffee. I didn't trust it going in but had a bit of hope and ordered a mocha for $5. The person taking the order was sitting and I couldn't see who or if someone was talking to me. (I wouldn't mind that, if my coffee was great tbh.) 

They made my coffee and it was ok...

Very special place that has such a cool gamer/ soho vibe though. I didn't get very far since I was there for the coffee."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2019-10-14,5.0,"This place is f**king awesome. Imagine an atmosphere like that show Cheers but for gamers, and computer nerds. If starbucks and gamestop had a baby this is what would be born. 

-Made to order coffee on tap. 
-The staff is like your friends working behind the counter.
-BE ADVISED kids are allowed but there's cussing and foul language cause when youre an actual gamer ""it be like dat""

Family atmosphere from the time you step foot inside and battle stations as far as the i can see. Starbucks can eat it because this place has more outlets than people and knee weakening wifi speeds. 52 inch TV's line the walls for all kinds of twitch streams and fortnite tournys and anime.

harwood floors. classroom style chair though, so not very comfortable for long periods of time. The battle stations all have gaming chairs though. Also memorabilia on all the shelves."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2020-02-23,5.0,"Amazing gaming cafe! Tons of great high-end desktop computers, a couple TVs to play console games on, and a number of tables where you can play boardgames or other games you love. The staff is incredibly nice, friendly, and helpful, and they keep the gaming cafe clean which is a plus. They also serve an assortment of coffee and snacks so you can stay energized while you game. Lastly, the energy and vibe in this place is awesome and there is a great sense of community, fun, happiness, and inclusion. Definitely check it out if you are looking for a great place to game with great people!"
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2019-07-14,5.0,"I went here last night, and the impression I left with was ""this place is so cool."" Not only was everyone playing smash as you walk in, but the staff was just incredibly friendly and had great customer service. It felt like I came to their house and they were a great host. The dude who doesn't know how to make grilled cheeses (sorry I didn't ask for a name!!) helped us most of our experience and he is probably one of the most friendly people I've interacted with, who was at their job. We didn't feel awkward asking any questions or for help. 

We used the computers in the back and getting set up was really simple. It's cool that your hours stay in your account to use next time and that the cafe is flexible about games that they have and download. 

My friend got a grilled cheese and they used thick toast and three cheeses. It's great the food is actually good and not cheap crap. 

Hardly anything wrong, only a couple of annoyances:
The desk and chair height was a little messed up for me. I needed the chair all the way up to comfortably use the desk, but my legs were not at the right height. It's hard to please everyone's height though. 
The other customers got HEATED and loud. But that's not the stores fault at all. It just made playing multiplayer games with my friend a bit hard to hear. 

Overall, had a great time and would love to come here again! Hope non-grilled cheese chef is getting treated right here, he's a gem of a worker."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2017-12-03,5.0,"This spot is super cool! I'm not a gamer, but all my friends are so we came here after a friend's birthday dinner while we were in the area. The front section is a cafe set up with seating, TVs and the counter from which food, drinks, and account access can be purchased. Further inside is the Internet café, with high quality chairs, mechanical keyboards, mouse, headsets, and essentially everything you imagine gamers would want. 

An hour of internet / computer access is 5 dollars and the fifth hour is free if you pay for the first four. The guys running this place were very nice and helpful in explaining how their system worked, and also allowed us to bring and eat the birthday cake we brought without fuss or charge. In fact, they set us up with utensils, plates, and a cake cutting knife without us having to ask. 

They serve a variety of snacks and pastries, Harvey and Son's teas, coffees, and recently introduced a lavender latte - so, all the essentials really. It got pretty packed by the end of the Saturday night, but not rowdy, so seems like a good late night place for a low-key night."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2020-03-13,3.0,I love the setting and devices but internet been too unreliable lately ruining many games
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2019-10-25,4.0,I was here with my son playing fortnite.  They place was kinda half filled when we were the there.  They do make a good cup of coffee.  We be back again.
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-02-06,5.0,"This place is probably one of my favorite venues in the city, HAHA. I wouldn't say I'm a die-hard gamer by any means, but it's a good way to kill time when you have a free day during a chill weekend. Waypoint has exceptional rigs and setups, their chairs are super comfortable, and the staff beyond anything makes the experience that much better.

On a given weekend day, it's $25 for an all-day pass, which is a pretty sweet deal, and starts out-valuing the $20/5 hours at the 6-hour mark. That being said, you'll probably end up killing the whole day here anyways.

Haven't tried the food, but their teas are really really good, and they're super cool about you bringing in outside food and drinks."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2019-03-30,5.0,"I went there today to check it out because I had been putting it off for a while (I get busy).

I've never been in a cleaner cafe. I mean, with all the pc gaming rigs in there, they can't afford to let dust pile up. It was so sleek and spotless, especially with how packed it was. There were around 30+ stations to rent and nearly each one was taken. There were also standard cafe tables for ""hang-out"" customers or card/small board gaming, and these were full, too!

Everyone I talked to was nice, and the mocha was excellent (tasted like they added honey or something similar, and that was honestly delicious).

It appeared that they had their own unique launcher for their available games. I would assume that's standard (never been to a net cafe before), and the printed price options were really attractive. Plus, your unused time rolls over and accumulated on your account, so you're never wasting money if you have to leave early.

I didn't get an close-up in-the-case inspection of the rigs, but can confirm they're all 1060 GPUs, water-cooled i5-7700 CPUs (THIS I might have blurry memory on. They might be K versions.). Don't know the RAM, but I'd be surprised if they had less than 16 gigs. All the machines are carbon copies as is, again, an assumption, per usual.

They even have a special sound-proofed room set up for streaming with 3-monitor setup, camera, mics, and lighting kit.

They host events, too, and I'll definitely be back with friends to hang out, at least."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-10-13,5.0,"This place is PHENOMENAL! Every single staff member is Awesome but Shaquanna is the woman to ask for when you need to get things done! Lol 
Three kids on a Saturday afternoon. Wait time was a little over an hour and Shaquanna made sure they were all entertained playing other video games while they waited for the computers to play Fortnite. 
Prices are definitely reasonable ($5/hr per person) and the coffee is great as well! I would 100% recommend to come here and let the kiddos play."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-12-22,3.0,"Unfortunately there is no AC here and no limits on how hard children are allowed to screech, but still the best gaming cafe in the city"
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2019-03-07,5.0,Awesome place! My kid had lots of fun for a great price. The employees are very helpful and the environment is great.
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2017-10-13,5.0,"Pros: Awesome decor (love the Moogle on the shelf and Indiebox releases!) Very clean and cute. Also, they have Bawls.
Cons: Nothing, really! If I had to give one critique, maybe add a few more chips or snacks to the menu, bc I will probably just live here from now on.

I stopped into Waypoint for lunch and to explore NY's first gaming cafe! The place was not too busy, I'm assuming everyone shows up after work/school or at the parties.

This place has everything you need for a good time: a fridge full of energy drinks and some kickass RGB rigs. I love the fact that these guys carry Bawls. It's one of my favorites, and aside from ordering a gigantic case of it online, I'm never able to get it in individual cans, so this alone is awesome. Also got the Mexican Beef Burrito, which is very good! They also have Intelligentsia coffee and delicious pastries. 

I'm really looking forward to coming here more and hoping it becomes a new hub for gamers. I tend to play solo, story heavy RPGs at home, so I am not as familiar with multiplayer stuff (aside from FFXIV) and I'm excited to 
bring my laptop and play around actual people IRL.

Overall, I'm really impressed that there is a new gaming cafe in town! This place is a must-visit if you're a gamer in the city. This is my first time here, but I can already tell this will become one of my new favorite coffeeshops."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-04-01,5.0,"Great place to hangout and play games. Computers and equipment is great, and the selection of games is also comprehensive. Girlfriend said the beverage selection was also on point. Prices are reasonable and overall an amazing comfortable place to hangout!

For those of you coming here to do things, please buy something. Don't be cheap, or these places will go out of business."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-08-17,5.0,"This little hole in the wall cafe is one of the many places in NewYork City where people come to be entertained and grab a good smoothie! Waypoint Cafe is a safe place for gamers and esport enthusiasts, offering a generous menu of items and computers to play on. The whole process is stress free and very simple to complete. The staff and fellow gamers in this cafe are so welcoming and friendly! Waypoint cafe is one of those places you will never forget going to, and makes you want to go back the second you leave, although they do close early in the night on week days, they open early so you can hop right back into your game."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-02-28,5.0,"This place is awesome. Think back to the early 2000s when LAN parties were still a thing and you'd spend hours playing counter strike until you became so pale that your mom thought you turned albino. Relive those days in a cool sleek environment in LES with good coffee, pastries, even a storm trooper. The rigs are well maintained and comfortable. The prices are super reasonable. The real question is why aren't you there right now pwning newbs in pubg while downing a double espresso"
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-10-31,4.0,"Sweet cafe on Ludlow in the east village.  The staff is really nice.  A friend is a real gamer and she brought me here to hang out for a bit.  There are two sections, really.  The front is the cafe part with tvs and a\the counter area.  Overall, a really nice spot with a unique concept."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-12-29,5.0,"I love this place, (although u have to show your I.D before u get your headphones, because some shit shows were stealing headphones) it's amazing they have GTX 1060 3gb, a lot of games, and the food here is really good, I really enjoy myself Everytime I come here, and the staff r really nice and r very helpful also, the place is also very kid friendly, and clean. It's $5 hr, if u pay more, u get bonus hrs, and the thing I hate that I have no control over is when this place is either booked, or there r no more PC's, there r 30 of them BTW. Other than that, this is the best internet cafe in NYC."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2017-10-24,5.0,"Waypoint Café has a smart and unique business model, serving coffee and pastries aside PC gaming charged hourly. While I'm not a PC gamer myself, my go-to coffee spot has fled the LES so I am always open to new and excited neighborhood options. Waypoint nails it by being the only coffee shoppe in the area (I believe) that is pulling Intelligentsia beans. The gentlemen behind the counter made me a mean latte with all the punch I'm accustomed to when brewing Intelligentsia at home. After a great cup of joe and a brief discussion with the management about the possible inclusion of console gaming, I can definitely see myself returning to Waypoint and wish them only the best of luck in the always evolving small merchant community on the LES."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-08-09,5.0,Finally a real gaming cafe in nyc. Tons of computers food and good people! They have all the popular games!
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-09-03,5.0,"This place deserves 5 stars. Signing up was easy. Adding hours was easy. Logging on to the computers were easy. 
However
1.They didnt have the game path of exile, it way more popular than diablo 3, i dont know why they don't have that game on their computers. Its one of the top free to play games.
2.Some of the games were not updated but thats not really an issue, i just lost 4 mins, no big deal.

Still I would recommend this cafe to anyone. You can check out what games they have on their website. (Just google waypoint cafe, should be the first link) 

PLEASE DOWNLOAD PATH OF EXILEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2019-05-19,5.0,Great place. Had a very good time. The equipment was good and the staff was very friendly. Highly recommended!
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2017-11-10,4.0,"Super dope concept, and I'm glad I checked It out. The store is spacious and warm with simple seating arrangements. Please snag a cup of cider- it's amazingly sweet and slightly tart. The chocolate chip cookie pairs nicely with the cider, and it was soft and packed with chips. We sat at a table right by the front, and to our left on the wall was a television screen showing someone playing some RPG game with a PIP style display. It's a quiet place to hop on WiFi and work on assignments. Head to the back and there are rows of comfy computer chairs filled with gamers hanging out. It's a really cool place to geek out, and the shop was nice and clean. I may return for finals week for a WiFi-cider combo. It's also really cool that they have a digital punchcard, so sign up and collect rewards!"
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-06-21,5.0,"Just came here to print something and I don't know if he was the manager but some guy helped me out so much. The staff here are really friendly. It's $5 for an hour and about $3 to print something (it's expensive but so is ink) overall, good spot to lounge, eat a snack since they have a really cute cafe and or just be on here to use computer."
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-01-01,5.0,Great spot to hang and play pc games with a great addition of a cafe. $5/hr or $20/5hrs.
168,waypoint-cafe-new-york,2018-03-02,5.0,"Amazing and personable staff, comfy chairs, yummy pastries and I'm about to try their drinks soon. Reasonable prices for the games you get, and they're open to adding more if they can get it on their systems. Super clean and the people there get loud but are generally not pains in the butt, so if you're worried about a rowdy crowd, breath a bit because everyone has been decent so far. It reminds me of internet cafes in the Philippines, except so much nicer for gaming. Haven't seen anyone using the computers for projects or paperwork or presentations, so I don't think it's that type of system, but I've seen people sit by the front and work on their where they have free seating tables. Not a quiet spot, so don't expect to be able to concentrate if noise bothers you. Overall an amazing spot!"
169,chipilo-new-york,2020-03-04,5.0,"Wow, this little hole in the wall hits the mark. Just walking distance from the court house making it the perfect spot for downtown lawyers, jurors, and others. Let's dive in ....

Venetto (5/5): This sandwich is pretty much everything I wanted. The bread came out warm, fresh, and soft. The avo, normally the king of all things millennial was fresh, but I was more taken aback by the roasted red pepper and artichoke. The arugula and house vinaigrette tie it so nicely together. I added fresh motz for $2 more and it all felt whole. 

Service (5/5): Quick service, brought me the food. Super friendly and helpful when ordering. 

TL;DR: A major win for City Hall and Downtown Manhattan. Affordable bite to eats are hard to find here. If I'm in the area would absolutely return."
169,chipilo-new-york,2019-06-17,3.0,"I visited Chipilo on a Monday. Overall service was good and quick - I had my sandwich within 2 minutes of ordering. The staff was also very friendly.

The sandwich itself was a bit bready - I got the Chipileno and they were a bit stingy with the Prosciutto. The meat to bread ratio was not ideal. The dressing did taste nice and the bread was very fresh.

Overall good service, but the sandwich itself was just average."
169,chipilo-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,What a great find in China Town.  My wife & I have new delicious brunch spot with fresh amazing dishes.  Great service also.
169,chipilo-new-york,2019-01-23,4.0,"Small high quality Italian sandwich shop. Excellent ingredients which are fresh and assembled to order. I usually get the whole size (vs. half) which can be a bit pricey depending on what you choose. Bread is usually fresh but have had a couple instances where it wasn't as fresh as I'd hoped. I tend to go with the sfilatino. They are happy to customize which is nice, I like their hot spread so often add it. All in all a fantastic option in the area if you're craving an Italian sandwich."
169,chipilo-new-york,2018-11-03,4.0,"Love the quality of the breads, the contents and the nice service. However its pricey for a sandwich. Small hole in the wall place with maybe 5 seats. Half sandwiches run around $8-9 dollars and full is around $14 depending on what you order. Got the full Massimo (ham, olives, artichoke and smoked mozzarella) and I was hoping to eat it as 2 separate meals. I didnt last 2 hours before I devoured the other half. a delicious sandwich sitting right next to me will never last."
169,chipilo-new-york,2018-10-03,5.0,"Ohh man, I just started working down here and have been Yelping to find new lunch spots.  I was craving a yummy sammich and came across this place that looked like it had fresh ingredients on delicious bread.  

Chipilo did not disappoint! It is a neat little hole in the wall across from Columbus Park. I went with the namesake sandwich the Chipileno with prosciutto, sopressata, red peppers, arugula, fresh mozzarella, and balsamic on fresh sourdough bread.  You are asked if you want a half or whole, I went with the whole and have lunch leftover for tomorrow as well. Can't wait to try more sandwiches from this gem."
169,chipilo-new-york,2018-05-16,4.0,"What a cute little sandwich shop, perfect if you're doing a little jury duty nearby.  Friendly staff, cheery decor, small but cozy.  They have a few veggie options, so I got the Venetto with artichokes, avocado and sun-dried tomatoes."
169,chipilo-new-york,2018-09-14,5.0,This place is delicious. I work in the area often and this is a great addition to the neighborhood
169,chipilo-new-york,2016-07-14,2.0,"Stopped by on a hot evening to see what has become of what used to be Sharkey. Was surprised to see that another business was in operation already.

Decided to pop in and give the sandwiches a try. I decided on the Stefano (smoked chicken, smoked mozzarella, roasted peppers, arugula, hot spread). The sandwich itself is pretty big. I didn't measure it, but I'd say it's probably a foot-long.

First complaint. When I unwrapped my sandwich back home, it was uncut. I mean, it's not a big deal but what reason is there to not cut a sandwich that long? Would someone really pick up the whole foot and start chowing down? Also, the bread it is on is a very basic whole wheat (I think) bun. The bread was a bit dry actually.

On first bite, my thought was where's the hot spread?? Upon inspection, there is SOME sort of sauce in the sandwich. I couldn't tell you what, but it sure wasn't hot sauce. Not even a hint of spiciness.

Overall, unimpressive. The sandwich was super basic. Way too expensive. Came out to be $14 and change after taxes. I miss Sharkey's Cafe :("
169,chipilo-new-york,2017-06-26,5.0,"Excellent small Italian sandwich joint. I highly recommend this place if you are in the Judicial Square area. While the shop is extremely small, like no more than 6 customers inside at once small, the delicious sandwiches make up for it. Ask for them to heat up your sandwich, it makes it that much better."
169,chipilo-new-york,2016-07-21,5.0,"The place is great!!  Sandwiches made to perfection :)
 I'm a huge fan of my sandwiches but I'm a little picky with my food, so I hate it when I go to the store and they only have turkey ham and w.e but no pork so being able to go somewhere, where you can look at the menu and everything seems good it's not something I see every day. The people are so nice and friendly that when I asked if they had mayo because I didn't see it at all they said they'll get me some. So that's something I truly look for in a place. Great service, great food and my next must go to spot for sandwiches."
169,chipilo-new-york,2017-08-12,5.0,Most underrated place in Chinatown. Best sandhwiches in a mile radius. Very highly recommended !
169,chipilo-new-york,2019-01-02,5.0,The quality of the sandwiches and bread is amazing.  I love the sourdough bread.  You can tell everything is fresh & you also can see it be made.  This is my go to lunch place in the neighborhood.  The service is always great too.
169,chipilo-new-york,2016-07-13,5.0,This place is great!  They specialize in really nice Italian sandwiches...all imported meats and cheeses and fresh toppings. The bread the use is really good and I can't wait to try the focaccia bread it looks amazing. I can't wait to go back!  Here's a tip: if you aren't super hungry you can split a sandwich with a friend because the portions are really quite generous. I'll post more pictures and updates soon...I definitely plan on being a regular here!  These guys are awesome and a welcome addition to the neighborhood!
169,chipilo-new-york,2016-07-26,5.0,"The bread is SOOOOO delicious here! Everything is new to me!
Ive never tried a cured ham I loved so much.
Chipilo slices the meat practically into your mouth, it's so fresh!!! 
This is a great spot for lunch - they have Italian sandwiches, san pellegrinos, and even a salad bar! What else do you need? The decor and space is very cute and small. You can choose to munch on your scrumptious sandwich in 1 of 6 seats. There is a small table where you can even enjoy an intimate lunch.
TLDR:
Great quality meat + freshly sliced + delicious breads + amazing quality cheese + toppings and dressings and sauces = GREAT QUALITY AMAAZING SANDWICHES 
Pompelo san pellegrino
Very dainty space
Friendly staff"
169,chipilo-new-york,2017-07-15,3.0,"Noticed this Italian sandwich shop and came in on a whim. Asked the staff for recommendations and he recommended the first two items on the menu. I got the ""Marconi"" sandwich and it was delicious. Only downside is that the sandwiches are kind of pricey. 

It's a very small shop but the interior is very stylish. Will definitely try other sandwiches once the craving hits."
169,chipilo-new-york,2016-08-26,4.0,"I was a huge fan of Sharkey's so I was sad to learn it closed--but Chipilo is really great! While the basic white bread should be upgraded a bit, the actual stuff in the sandwiches are very fresh and tasty. The portions are mega generous--so for that $12, you really are getting two meals, which is a solid deal.  I'm happy now I don't want to walk down to Pisillo on Nassau when I'm having an Italian sandwich craving.  The staff is super friendly as well. 
So happy a great sammie spot still remains in the hood!"
169,chipilo-new-york,2016-10-31,4.0,"Was working in the area and happened to see this new business pop up  right at the very beginning of Mulberry St. &  figure I'd check it out! What attracted me was the Huge Italian sandwiches sign!lol i was Pleasantly surprised! Old-school Italian sandwiches are what this place is all about and they knocked it out of the park, I went w  with the recommended""Marconi"" sandwich which consisted of smoked chicken sopressata fresh mozzarella avocado calabria and hot spread on super fresh semolina bread, outstanding! Not overloaded with meat, just perfect, The manager Manny said all the meats and cheeses are imported from Italy and the bread delivered fresh, there's only one table and a counter w stools to devour these delectable sandwiches in a small mom and pop jount. my coworker and I were fortunate enough to grab the table by the window, I left one star off because I felt it was a tad  bit pricey but it is great quality and I look forward to coming back soon!"
169,chipilo-new-york,2017-04-19,4.0,"Had the Stefano on on semolina bread -- incredible.  The ""hot spread"" was an good addition to an already great sandwich.  The smoked motz and turkey (instead of chicken) was delicious and the arugula was fresh.  Will definitely be back!"
169,chipilo-new-york,2017-01-16,5.0,"Got the Chipileño on sfilatino bread (highly recommend it bc of the crunchiness). This was a seriously incredible sandwich with mozzarella and peppers. The staff is also super sweet! Yes, it's expensive, but a full sized sandwich lasts me for two meals."
169,chipilo-new-york,2017-02-27,5.0,"I got the Chipileño on Semolina bread. Great Italian sandwich. Made with care & fresh ingredients. If you want quality, you need to pay for it. Well worth the money. Cheers"
169,chipilo-new-york,2018-02-15,5.0,On jury duty and found this gem. Yummy and nice staff.
169,chipilo-new-york,2016-07-29,5.0,"I've lived in Chinatown for a few years now and this is shop is a great addition to the neighborhood. The food is great and the service is fast and friendly.  I have been eating vegetarian recently and they have many vegetarian sandwich options (salad too) so it's great for me. I usually go with the sfilatino or semolina bread.  I don't eat the delicious Italian meats anymore but they were telling us how they only use the best imported prosciutto, soppressata, etc.  It's nice to know that they aren't cutting corners here. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their work. The sandwiches are pretty big but it's nice because they somehow don't put you in a food coma for the rest of the day. I'll be back."
169,chipilo-new-york,2017-07-06,5.0,"I come here at least once a week! Sandwiches are fresh, delicious, made with care. I've tried all the veggie ones and the Al Tonno. The mozz is top notch--super creamy, the stuff of sandwich dreams."
169,chipilo-new-york,2017-08-05,5.0,"Stopped by Chipilo on a Saturday looking for a quick bite on the go. Lovely decor, great playlist, friendly staff, UNREAL sandwich. 10 out of 10 would come back for eats and vibes."
169,chipilo-new-york,2016-09-19,4.0,"This place improved a lot in the past few months. After a pretty mediocre experience, they prepared a much, much better sandwich (and toasted it!). I got the Chipileño and enjoyed it very much -- super fresh ingredients. The staff was very courteous. My only remaining criticism is of the sandwich size and corresponding prices. While the price is appropriate for the amount of food, they serve you way more than the average person would want for lunch. Otherwise, this is a very solid place to grab a sandwich around Chinatown / the court area!"
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,"Amazing quality espresso drinks from sustainably sourced coffee. Plus, it has just the right amount of traffic most of the time so you can sit and have a conversation."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-11-13,4.0,"I was looking for good coffee and a place to sit down to work on my computer. Many coffee places around here close early but this place was great, open till 10pm. 

Located right next to NYU campus, I would think a lot of customers are NYU students.  I also like the fact that this place was spacious. No need to worry about find a place to sit down.

I ordered a latte and it was good. Very comfortable and I would definitely come back again."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2020-02-01,3.0,Not my favorite coffee in the city. The hot lattes are extremely small. They do have a wide variety of nondairy milks and plenty of seating but I wouldn't recommend going if you're a latte person!!
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-07-31,3.0,"Coffee wasn't bad but the area and inside seemed a little sketchy. I used the bathroom which was a kinda creepy space with no mirror and seemed a little dirty. That doesn't take away from the actual coffee, but again, the coffee was just good not great."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-09-20,5.0,Amazing lattes! I usually get a nonfat latte and this place has delicious brewed coffee. I'm used to Starbucks but this beats it.
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-05-19,5.0,"There are times when you need a place to rest and get something to drink (and perhaps a snack) in downtown Manhattan.  Sure you could hop into a Starbucks (though there are less left than there used to be) but then you will likely have to deal with the tourist hordes and bathrooms that look like a crime scene out of ""Law & Order"".  If you want to up your cafe game in the are around the Bowery then Think Coffee is the place for you.

First off, the location is perfect.  It is on the corner of Bleecker and the Bowery so it is easy to find and you have two directions worth of people watching.  Historical note: the former sight of CBGB's is right across the street (this will possibly depress you, make you nostalgic or both).  There is a ton of seating inside that can easily fit over a dozen people comfortably without everyone squishing together like hamsters in a cage.  There is a large area for ordering and there is even a clean rest room!  In a particularly nice touch, a doorway next to the rest room leads to a small bookstore next door.

The staff here ranges from extremely super duper nice to ""Hey man, just order so I can continue my day, ok?"" which is about right for a NYC coffee place.  The crowd waxes and wanes here.  There are times where it is virtually standing room only and there are times when it is half empty.  It is a tad unpredictable.

I have had two drinks here: the Chai Latte (dirty) and the Mint Iced Tea. Both drink swere refreshing though the Chai is much heavier.  I also have to recommend the Honey Peanut Butter Cookie.  This thing is insane.  It's huge, chewy and has a very unique sweetness without being overwhelming.  I have also had the grilled cheese here with cheddar and tomato and it was very tasty.  They make the sandwich fresh so you will have to wait a bit.

Think Coffee has quickly become one of my ""go to"" establishments in the area.  Indeed, I am actually writing this review while sitting in the cafe....wow...meta!"
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-05-01,4.0,"Coffee here is very good - and I like the options for the non dairy milk. 

The seating was comfortable, and the food selection for a coffee shop was nice. 

They offer a lunch option for grilled cheese (vegan cheese available and gluten free options available as well). You are able to add pesto, olive spread, etc. for an extra charge (about $0.75-$4) 

Cons:
I wasn't able to find a place to charge my tablets during my visit. I suppose if they had the outlets people would sit there all day. It still is nice to be able to have a laptop and work while you have your beverage/food and not take advantage of the time - and share space with others."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-05-20,4.0,Dropped by and got a quick coffee. It was busy but managed to find a table. Got a small latte for $4-$5. Tasted good! They also have free water and nice glass cups.
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-10-04,3.0,"What kind of coffee shop has no power outlets and WiFi? Ugh it's like either they live in the 20th century or they purposely do this to prevent people from camping out and studying. $3 for a small brew, it's ok. But I go to coffee shops to study and I won't be back if I can't connect."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-10-04,1.0,"I love Think at other locations. Don't get me wrong, coffee's great. 

However, the service here was terrible. The girl kept talking to the other cashier while I was ordering. I tipped but I sure wish I hadn't. She didn't even say thanks. Then, when I asked for the wifi - she just responded ""No..."" while giving me a fairly rude look. If you don't have wifi, why not just say ""Sorry, we don't have wifi?"" 

Honestly, try the other locations. They're nicer there."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2018-10-31,5.0,"Came in here for a quick breakfast and to do some work. To my surprise (and sadness) there is no wifi or outlets here. While it was a bummer I am really not going to hold it against Think Coffee if they want to foster a café environment where people actually chat and/or read. 

Overall the staff was really friendly and helpful and I would recommend this place for anyone to grab a cuppa joe and hang out."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-04-30,4.0,"I went there today with a friend, eight years and one day since my last visit.  The barista was quite friendly, but the (regular) coffee was very weak and bland-tasting.  Also; there was fairly loud music playing and it wasn't exactly a pleasant tune - but at least we managed to get the (last) free table (at 2:00 p.m.)."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-01-02,5.0,This location makes me so happy! There is plenty of space to do work and hang out. Also vegan grilled cheese. Also great tea selection. Also beer and wine in the evenings. This Think is a win.
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-04-16,3.0,"Looks like a dump but I think that's on purpose.  It's not dirty or anything like that.  It's just that the table, chairs, and the overall lack of decorative effort is probably the atmosphere they are trying to create.  All I had was a cup of coffee and it was OK.  They were playing some weird music.  Sounded middle eastern and didn't quite fit the coffee house vibe."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2018-10-03,2.0,"I did not enjoy my visit here during the past summer. I ordered a small coffee with a pastry and felt as though it was a waste of time and money. You're given black coffee and it's up to you to essentially make your coffee on your own. This takes away from the whole idea of even going to a coffee shop.

Aside from this, the space is very congested. There's barely any room to walk over to your area of choice without knocking into a table or chair. The main thing that I despised was the fact that were no outlets! It's 2018, every coffee shop should get the outlets memo by now.

Rest assured,  I will not be back here. I'd rather go to Gregory's Coffee if anything."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2020-01-10,3.0,As a true coffee house this place is great. Awesome coffee at a good price and the atmosphere is very cool. But avoid this place if you are planning to use it as a work space. Limited outlets and no WiFi!
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-11-03,3.0,"Staff needs to work on customer service skills. They do not greet the customers who are standing in line. They stand at the register and stare at the next guest without saying ""welcome, how may I help you."" They make the customer feel unwelcome and very awkward. No smiles. No greetings."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2018-03-19,4.0,"I came in just to get out of the cold to check Yelp for dinner options while meeting a friend, and ended up lingering awhile. They have a small selection of fresh sandwiches, I actually ended up buying a vegan one with hummus, tomato, carrots, sprouts, cucumber and other good things and it was delicious! They also offer hot foods like grilled cheese.

What really won me over was that they were playing Tom Waits. I heard Singapore and never wanted to leave. I'll be back for this reason alone."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-09-03,3.0,"Good selection of coffee and bakery items. Plenty of table and chairs but be warned this no free wifi at this location. Toasts (including the all
Time favourite avo toast) is only a morning offering with sandwiches taking over for lunch/afternoon time."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2018-11-29,2.0,I had to stop by here for a meeting. Had the nitro coffee and a quick bite. Nothing special about here
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-07-07,4.0,"The location of this Think Coffee is excellent (corner of Bleeker and Bowery) so it's ideal to stop in and get a quick coffee or tea. I've tried the cold brew and the chai latte and both came quickly despite a sizeable crowd. Both beverages were good - pretty decent cold brew for the price though the medium is a bit on the smaller side.

They do not have wifi or readily available outlets so it's not the best place to get much work done but it's a great place to stop in and rest in the middle of a busy day or have a quick coffee chat."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-03-23,4.0,"Came here with two friends at 9am on Saturday. The place was crowded and seating was tiiiiight. Although the tables and chairs are crammed and you practically bump into all of them while finding a seat, we sat down and didn't feel rushed at all. I ordered regular hot coffee and a blueberry scone. Coffee was great, scone was a bit too moist... almost like a scone and muffin had a baby. I would come back for the coffee and cozy atmosphere"
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2017-06-20,3.0,"Ah THERE IS NO WIFI
After my morning mass from Old St. Patrick's, I passed by Think Coffee hurriedly and backtracked right afterwards.

I thought to myself, ""I can get some work done with some egg sandwich right now"" and entered with confidence, knowing that I was going to accomplish things on Sunday morning. 

No wifi. No outlet. No productivity electronically. But it's a nice place to chat and watch people run and in out when your computer dies. 

I think I will direction my efforts somewhere else."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-04-25,5.0,"My go to coffee shop even though i don't drink coffee. They have a nice, frothy oat milk chai latte."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2017-03-27,4.0,"Think Coffee is a great place to sip your coffee and people watch.

We came here while waiting for a reservation at Sushi on Jones. The cortado (expresso cut with hot milk) was excellent. It was creamy, thick and had excellent expresso in it. K enjoyed his latte as well. 

The tables are small and so is the area but people were turning over the tables quickly. The staff is friendly, the space is bright and inviting. And there is a restroom here."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-09-27,2.0,"Nice location, especially with the outside seating area, but the barista girl was unfriendly, and killed the mood with that. Hence the bad rating"
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-09-21,4.0,"My go to coffee shop when I am in Bowery area. Nice coffee! They have outdoor seating to offer as well, got quite a good amount of outdoor tables. If you are a coffee lover who likes to sit outside and enjoy some views of the Bowery, this is the place!"
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-02-28,3.0,"Quaint little coffee shop. I enjoyed the very large tea bag for my peppermint tea. They didn't have agave but offered me some type of syrup honey but I don't think it was vegan. 

The seating arrangement was extremely tight we were basically sitting with others and they were very much in our conversation but they couldn't help it, so no one was upset about that. If you are looking for privacy... not here.  

I'd try this place again... not sure that my mind is made up on this place as of yet. Oh yeah, I did like the pictures they have for sale on their walls, those were cool."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-03-12,4.0,"Wonderful, delicious coffee and baked goods (I recommend the bookie bar). Great study, meetup, hangout spot and its not super noisy. Seating are is a little cramped and tables get snatched up fast!"
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2018-07-03,4.0,Simple yet nice coffee stop. Friendly staff. Wooden floors and chairs give it a relaxed atmosphere.
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2017-03-12,3.0,"Stopped by here while in the area for a quick chai latte and cookie. The cafe was pretty much packed, no seating inside but plenty outside (due to the freezing cold weather). Though it was packed, there wasn't much noise, seems much ppl were working on laptops, reading, or having low volume conversations. The chai latte i got was ok, tasted more like milk than tea. However, the gluten free cookie was delicious. Definitely try out some cookies, if you can. 

Worth noting: cups and lids are compostable, which is really important to me, so A++."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-07-07,1.0,Worst customer service ever.  Walked in with my parents and they were very rude to them. I didn't want to order more drinks so just had coffee for myself and walked out. Not so friendly place to be
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2018-11-11,1.0,"You would think that a Barista wouldn't be Racist in NYC. Very shocked at what I heard today from the counter person to a customer.  It's a shame, because it's a great location, but I don't support that behavior.  I hope management investigates this location. It's very sad."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-05-09,1.0,Worst tasting coffee I've ever had. Cream was bad too - had an awful stomach ache for hours after having just once iced coffee. AVOID AT ALL COST
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2014-07-30,5.0,"My search for the best Spanish Latte in NYC is finally over. 

$5.75 for a large iced Spanish latte was worth every cent. The perfect balance of espresso and condensed milk. 

If calories were no object, I would have one every single day."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2017-08-22,4.0,"This Think Coffee is casually becoming my ""spot"".

If you're a coffee lover, you'll know what I mean when I say that sometimes it's hard to get coffee at night in NYC. Think is a gem in those situations because it stays open until 11p on the weekdays!

But not just the hours: the staff are friendly, the music is throwback, and the shots they pull are considerably decent.

Some downsides to be noted are that they don't have too many outlets, and I don't believe they have wifi. Bring a jacket because sometimes the AC is a little too strong also. But for me, these are not deal breakers. If you care about vibe and good coffee and chill baristas, this is your place!"
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2018-07-28,4.0,Amazing service. I was staying at the Bowery for two weeks & this was the closest coffee shop to me. I came over a lot for my daily dose & then some. They're quick & friendly. The coffee was decent. Milk alternatives available. Lots of goodies as well if you're hungry. It's usually really busy & hard to find a place to sit. Definitely worth a try!
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2019-01-17,1.0,"They don't have WiFi and there should be a giant sign out front that says THEY DON'T HAVE WIFI!! So if you wanted to run in and do work on your computer or anything that may require WIFI, keep in mind, THEY DON'T HAVE WIFI! The coffee is fine."
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2017-06-17,3.0,Good cortado and their nitro is good... the staff were not super friendly and the inside was a little subpar in terms of atmosphere. It was fine in a pinch but probably wouldn't go back... average with all the great coffee shooed in NY
170,think-coffee-bowery-new-york,2016-11-17,1.0,"Bought a breakfast sandwich with just egg and it was by far the worst egg sandwich I've ever tasted! It wasn't even freshly made and took ten minutes to make. It was frozen egg and tasted like shit. Also over priced. With regular sliced bread, definitely not worth almost 6 dollars. Don't buy their breakfast sandwiches!!!

NOT TO MENTION THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS! The people who are at the register just look at you and don't welcome you or ask how can  I help. Then have this attitude like not that friendly and welcomin!"
171,malaparte-new-york,2020-06-02,5.0,"Malaparte is my favorite Italian in NYC. It's where I take family when they are in town and now I order pick up/ delivery during Covid. The food is always perfect. I always order something different because everything is that good. The pasta is fresh, pizza is divine and everything else in between is perfect. The staff is friendly and every time I'm there I feel like I am in Italy."
171,malaparte-new-york,2020-03-28,5.0,"We ordered Malaparte through Caviar app last night and it was the best decision to help with the quarantine blues. The food was so tasty, fresh, and perfectly cooked. We got the prosciutto pizza, mushroom pizza, pesto pasta, and tiramisu. Highly recommend ordering from here - can't wait to visit when we are allowed out again. Thanks Malaparte Team for making our night special!"
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-12-20,5.0,"love the vibe and food here! Very rustic Italian type situation. Kinda dark, small spot. Casual yet fun.

Calamari appetizer really tasty!! 

The one thing I cannot live without is their rigatoni pesto dish. 

Their ravioli with ricotta and spinach was also delicious. 

Shared a pizza for the table which was great!"
171,malaparte-new-york,2020-02-22,4.0,"I have been here before but could not remember the name.  While googling west village Italian restaurant it came up.  I was not very sure if it was the same.  We were delighted after we saw the chairs outside that it was the restaurant we ate at at least 3 years ago and wanted to return but could not remember where we were.

We ordered the squash soup and the carbonara.  Both excellent food as I remember a couple of years ago.

The soup is perfectly done!  It is like eating the squash itself.

As for our main course, I finally decided to get the Carbonara which I highly recommend.  They make it with home made pasta and plenty of Guanciale.

It is definitely going to be my go to restaurant.  Now I remember the name and where it is."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-04-19,4.0,"Malaparte is a cute little casual Italian restaurant in the West Village. On a nice night like it was, they can essentially double their seating capacity with outdoor tables which is great because the inside is pretty small. Reservations are highly recommended and we were able to snag and early one at 6:30 for a table of 4. Wine bottle prices were reasonable hovering around $40/bottle give or take a couple of bucks. We had a yummy bottle of rose. 

After my friends and I perused the menu we settled on a bunch of items to share. We started with the burrata which was a special (but I think it's probably always available) and the roasted beet salad with kale and pecorino. Both starters were delicious and perfect to share. For entrees, we ordered the gnocchi, spaghetti carbonara, and lasagna Bolognese, and the special pizza which was bresaola, arugula and cheese. We all unanimously favored the pastas over the pizza. The gnocchi melted in your mouth, but the top 2 favorite pastas were the lasagna and the carbonara. Both rich, creamy, cheesy and delicious pasta. Pasta portions weren't huge, but it was fun to share and taste them all! I wouldn't have said no to more spaghetti carbonara.... 

Most, if not all of the staff seemed to be Italian, which was cool and gave the restaurant an even more authentic feel. 

I had read cash only online, so my friends and I all brought cash but were pleasantly surprised when we heard they took Visa too! This restaurant is off the beaten path, but is no secret. I'd definitely come back again. It was reasonably priced and overall a very solid meal!"
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-03-17,4.0,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a Sunday night. There were a few open tables, so we were able to be seated right away.

After perusing the menu, we mainly ordered from their specials menu and got a bowl of lentil soup and split to pappardelle with pork ragu and the swordfish.

The lentil soup was a tomato base and was actually very good and nice on a cold night.

The pappardelle was also tasty and was a decently sized portion--noodles weren't the best I've had, but fine nonetheless.

The swordfish was cooked well--didn't have the most flavor, but otherwise was pretty good. The asparagus and fennel salad that came with it were both fantastic and very substantial as well.

Overall, this is a cute spot in the village with great food, friendly service, and reasonable prices. Definitely not a bad spot to check out in the neighborhood."
171,malaparte-new-york,2020-02-10,5.0,"A friend and I walked in around 4:40 and were seated as soon as we walked in. I enjoyed the vibe upon arrival. It's a nice dimly lit spot. The food arrived fairly quick, and it was delicious! The service was great as well. I will definitely return to this restaurant!"
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-07-28,4.0,"In contrast to other maybe older reviews... I just want to confirm that they are NOT cash only! They take visa and MasterCard for sure and even will split a check on multiple cards.

Some issues that removes a star for me:
- pricing (our wine was $21 a carafe on the menu we ordered from... We were charged $23 a carafe instead and they refused to change it)
- we had to wait for a table to open up outside and when two tables opened up, they seemed frustrated that we asked for a specific one that had more room (it was a VERY tight fit at the other tables)

The food was good and we really enjoyed the gnocchi, rigatoni, bianca salad. All of which were reasonably priced. 

Service was just ok, but they did let us sit at the table without rushing us. It just would have been nice to have our water refilled or menus brought to us without us asking though..."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-07-06,5.0,"Nestled in the West Village in a quiet part of the neighborhood is the most amazing little Italian restaurant you've probably never heard of (Or you have if you're in the know!) I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning around 11am. It was still quiet, there were outdoor tables, inside tables and bar seating so you could choose your poison. The guy behind the bar was muti-functional at this point (bartender, barista, server) and had a keen understanding of how to expertly craft espresso drinks. The bar is beer and wine only, but that's perfect for a Sunday morning Mimosa. 

The food menu is as light or heavy as you want. Pizza, pasta, egg dishes and salads. I had a watermelon salad that was light, refreshing and packed with flavor. Although dinner is also amazing, if you haven't been here for brunch, stop by and try them out. Between the ambiance, the service and the amazing food, you'll be glad that you did!"

This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in NYC. Cash only. I like it because the food is always good (simple, homey and authentic) and the atmosphere is super intimate. 

Food: 4.5/5
Simple, fresh, authentic tasting dishes at great prices.
My favorites:
- Dadi di Tonno Scottato (seared tuna with avocado): LOVE this dish. The tuna and avocado is always super fresh. A really light, delicious app.
- Spaghetti ai Porcini (spaghetti with mushrooms): The sauce is the right amount of creaminess with a delicious mushroom flavor. 

Atmosphere: 4.5/5
Great atmosphere. Dark and cozy. Full length doors open to the outside in the summer, so it doesn't feel stuffy. Lots of groups of friends and some couples. Really great place for good conversation and wine."
171,malaparte-new-york,2020-03-07,5.0,Fantastic all around and a great value for NYC. Best carbonara I've ever had. And Thomas Mars and Sofia Coppola sitting two tables over. Amazing.
171,malaparte-new-york,2018-09-23,5.0,"Delicious Italian food at a very affordable price. And on top of that, the setting is casual, intimate and quiet. I am a huge fan of this spot.

Complimentary bread is great, especially the rosemary focaccia.  To start, my friend and I shared the grilled calamari -- very large portion and perfectly cooked. I'd come back just for this.

For our mains, I had the grilled salmon (cooked just right) and my friend had the parpadelle with ragu. We both left happy and full.  I can't wait to come back!"
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-02-10,3.0,"Perfectly fine cozy Italian joint in the West vill. 

We got a bottle of Pinot Grigio, the gnocchi, and pesto rigatoni. Pinot was great for the price (they have a ton of bottles here all for an affordable $30-40). 

Our pastas were OK, but I did expect better for the price. Coming in around $20, the noodles and sauce were fine, but they didn't taste freshly made and there wasn't really a generous portion. Gnocci was soft and fluffy, but the sauce lacked flavor. The rigatoni definitely didn't taste fresh and the pesto was equally as bland tasting. 

Tasty end to the meal tho from the tiramisu, which was divine.

All in all, glad I came as I love cute Italian spots, but wish the pastas were a little stronger!"
171,malaparte-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,"Local gem in the neighborhood. Such a cute restaurant. Crowd and ambiance are nice. Great food, great service, great prices. I got the spaghetti with mushroom which was delicious. Husband got the gnocchi that he really liked. Portions are just right. Tiramisu is f'n amazing. The staff makes this place feel authentic Italian. Wine and beer are good. Wish you had a Caesar salad, but that's okay."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-02-17,5.0,What a lovely little spot. Stopped by here for lunch on a Sunday and was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very warm and welcoming. We ordered the specials pappardelle with meat ragú  and ravioli and spinach and ricotta. Both pastas and sauces were excellent fresh and flavorful. Will absolutely be back to try more of the deliciousness they serve here.
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-10-12,1.0,"This is probably the worst restaurant i've ever been to. The waiter is rude, and doesn't even bring us bread like what most restaurant does. People after us got there bread but we didn't. The lasagna bolognese is the most expensive one on the menu, and they heated it using microwave! The bottom is burnt and turned black and stick on the plate where the cheese in the middle is not even melt. What kind of Italian restaurant is this? No pride whatsoever."
171,malaparte-new-york,2018-08-04,4.0,"The DADI di TONNO SCOTTATO, which is seared tuna filet with avocado and sesame dressing, was really good. Oddly enough, I dont feel like I've ever had avocado with ahi tuna, but their soft textures went really well. The tuna was fresh, the sesame provided flavor, and the avocado balanced it out.

The calamari was also pretty good, I don't often get calamari that isn't deep fried. But I liked the slightly acidic and sweet flavor and the portion. However, this calamari is a little hard to cut and eat.

We also got assorted pizzas but the highlight was definitely the FUNGHI MISTI, which was basically mushroom pizza. The mushrooms were really flavorful and the cheese was nice. However, the mushrooms weren't distributed well.

For dessert, I got some apple pie with vanilla ice cream which was really really good. The heat from the pie and the cold from the ice cream blended perfectly and the sour sweetness of the apple went very well with the heavy sweetness of the ice cream.

Overall, pretty good experience. I went as a large group and we ordered family style, but in the future I'd want to try the carbonara."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-06-14,5.0,"Probably some of the best pasta I've had. Situated in West Village and equipped with plenty of outdoor seating, this place is perfect for dinner on a summer evening. We got here at around 6:30 pm on a Saturday and were immediately led to a table sans wait. We weren't super hungry so my friend and I each ordered an entree to share. The gnocchi was delectably soft, melt-in-your-mouth good. We also got the carbonara which was equally delicious. The pork cheeks added a savory flair to the dish. I would definitely recommend ordering these two pasta dishes because the flavors complement each other perfectly!"
171,malaparte-new-york,2018-01-31,3.0,"Corner store, sign was not visible but thanks to google maps we found the place! 

Came her with a large group and thankfully we made reservation so that they could accommodate us in time. 

Dark candle lights, a somewhat romantic ambiance, but does get noisy. Started off with a white wine. The waiter was very accommodating and allowed me to try the wine before selecting the one I want for the night. For appetizers we ordered the calamari, tuna, and a proscuitto pizza. The grilled calamari and tuna was delicious. The proscuitto pizza did not have enough proscuitto. Also, the pizza was somewhat thick crust, not enough flavor. 

For entree, I ordered the fried pork chop. Holy crap that pork chop was huge! It came with salad on top. Sadly the pork chop was over cooked and lacked flavor. Overpriced for its quality, wished it came with a side dish."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-12-04,4.0,"We went for brunch with some friends from Rome and as much as they were very satisfied with the food we ordered (great Cauliflower Soup and Burgers) they were shocked to see the ""gnocchi cacio e pepe al pomodoro"" in the menu. Cacio e pepe is meant to be a ""white"" pasta, pomodoro shouldn't be allowed anywhere near it."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-04-25,5.0,"I dined here a little after Christmas with my extended family, daughter and husband. We ordered so much food and everything was delicious! We shared about 4 appetizers, most of which were from the daily special menu. But the fennel and endive salad appears to be on the regular menu and if you like greens this is a must! Also on the regular menu that I loved was the gnocchi. It wasn't what I expected but it was so good that my 8 year old ate most of it! 
Cute, tight space as you would imagine in nyc. Worth getting out of the tourist area if your from out of town."
171,malaparte-new-york,2018-08-05,5.0,"Delicious homemade pasta, cozy ambiance, but portions are on the smaller side--4.5 stars and will definitely be coming back for more (soon)!

There were so many things on both the regular and specials menu that we wanted to try but we decided on: 
+ Lasagna Bolognese ($20)
+ Spaghetti ai Porcini ($18)

You know how when you choose something off a menu, you do it with an idea in your head of what the dish would taste like in your ideal world? I felt like both of these pastas completely hit the mark and were the best versions of themselves! The lasagna was creamy and robust with tomato-y goodness. The spaghetti ai porcini was not only topped with a generous amount of mushrooms galore, the pasta itself was packed with delicious mushroom umami-ness and a wonderfully chewy texture. Our only complaint is that we came to the end of our dishes a little too soon."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-09-15,4.0,"The food was awesome.  Our group mostly ordered ""specials"".  Two of us had perfectly-grilled halibut with grilled zukes and tomatoes, two had squid-ink pasta with various seafood and one person had another pasta dish. All wonderful and considering the location, reasonably-priced.  In mild weather seating stretches outside and I would personally note that if you are seated well into the interior the noise level might be excessive.  Not rowdy, just noisy.  And that might just be me."
171,malaparte-new-york,2017-11-06,5.0,"Wow this place was amazing!! I came here with some of my friends and we were not disappointed. 

We ordered two different pizzas: di rucola e prosciutto di Parma and do porcini tartufata (had to look the names up on the menu but basically a pizza with prosciutto and a pizza with mushrooms among other things).  Both pizzas were delicious and not a bite was left. We also ordered the carbonara, which was absolutely divine, and a appetizer on the specials list that was burrata and prosciutto.  Nothing was left on any plate and we still ordered dessert. 

If you come here and don't order the tiramisu, you are missing out. This definitely made top 5 I've ever had and it's was primarily due to the cookie crumble crust! I've never encountered that before and the dessert was gone within approximately 2 minutes. I wish I got one to go but since I was just visiting NYC, didn't really want to carry it to bars and not have a fridge to put it in. 

I highly advise this place and I have a feeling I'll be coming back one day."
171,malaparte-new-york,2020-01-25,5.0,One of my favorite Italian spots in the city. The space and the menu are small but always packed and delicious. Can't go wrong with anything on-menu or off. Food and wine are priced reasonably for the quality. They accept credit cards..
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-10-21,5.0,I love grilled calamari here. Great service. Super busy always. Come looking good! Lots of hot people here. Birds of feather flock together!
171,malaparte-new-york,2018-06-06,3.0,"There seems to be a lot of really positive reviews on this place and to be fair its every very cosy and busy but to me the food was average at best .

Ordered the mussels of which half were closed and the rest over cooked . I told the server and he said we would tell the chef . Fantastic but doesn't really help my hunger !

On a good note the pizza wasn't a bad shout .

Off night perhaps ?"
171,malaparte-new-york,2020-02-01,5.0,Great fish and great pizza! Great hospitality. I would definitely recommend this place Over other restaurants in the area
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-07-15,5.0,"My new favorite Italian restaurant. Straightforward dishes with fresh ingredients, house baked focaccia (to die for!!!) homemade pastas, great wine selection, etc., etc., cute neighborhood corner feel. And I love the Italian servers too."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-05-25,5.0,"Sit down at one of Malaparte's wooden tables, order anything on the menu, do some people watching, sip Chianti. Then you'll realize that all is good with the world."
171,malaparte-new-york,2018-02-12,4.0,"This is a cute place.  We came here with a large group on a Sunday night and the place is very cozy and was quite busy.  The service was good, the food was tasty and came out quickly, and the wine was good and not expensive at all. We ordered 2 bottles of wine, a few appetizers to share and everyone ordered their own main , and it came to $46 per person with tax and tip - that's pretty good!  They only take cash though, so be prepared.

For appetizers we shared (1) sausage and polenta. I didn't really like this, but others seemed to enjoy it, (2) grilled calamari, this was well prepared and not slimy, (3) seared tuna tartare - this was delicious.

For entrees, people ordered a mix of pasta and fish, I ordered a margarita pizza, which was well prepared and yummy - it was a good portion size for 1 person.

Overall, I'd come back even though the cash only is annoying."
171,malaparte-new-york,2018-05-22,4.0,"Strolled in without a reservation at 10:45pm on a Saturday evening with a party of 3. We all got a bottle of sauce blanc to split to start. We then had prosciutto/burrata and a salad on the specials menu to start. 

We all ordered the Bolognese for entrees. Found the portions to be wildly different between 3 dishes and the sauce overall could have used more meat and a bit more red pepper to complement the profile throughout. 

Would definitely come back and try out the pizzas! 

Loved that pricing was super reasonable."
171,malaparte-new-york,2017-12-09,5.0,"Went here to celebrate my friend's birthday - they were willing and able to accommodate us with a reservation for 10, which is hard to find in New York City on a weekend.

What really strikes me about Malaparte is that their dishes are cooked in what I would think is a truly traditional manner. Americanized-Italian food tends to have the stereotype of being overly rich and cheesy, which Malaparte thankfully does NOT do. I easily would have finished my plate of pasta if we hadn't had so many appetizers and free bread (always a plus).

For a group of 10, we got two pizzas (one mushroom, one sausage), an order of calamari, and an order of burrata as appetizers, and then each person also got a pasta entree. The pizzas weren't heavy at all and were very flavorful, and the calamari was perfectly cooked to a bouncy not-rubbery texture. I got the carbonara, which was seasoned perfectly and a delight to my tastebuds. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed everything they tasted.

I haven't felt so strongly positive about an Italian restaurant in a long time, and Malaparte definitely is up there as one of the best places I've eaten pasta and pizza at."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-06-29,5.0,This is the most perfect local Italian restaurant with my favorite gnocchi. We come here on a Sunday for dinner but also bring friends for girls night and family for in town visits. I highly recommend if you're looking for a more relaxed dinner in the West Village. FYI they only take reservations for parties of 4 or more and only sell wine
171,malaparte-new-york,2018-11-08,3.0,"If you're looking for a romantic Italian dinner in the West Village with an intimate setting, this place is perfect, however the food is pretty average. My boyfriend and I started with a glass of wine each and the calamari. I thought it was a bit too chewy, but I loved that it was pan seared. I ordered the pasta alla carbonara and my boyfriend ordered the spagetti ai porcini. Unfortunately my carbonara was made with actual bacon slices rather than pancetta which killed the entire taste. It greasy and extremely salty. Super disappointed considering this dish is highly praised here. Portions are a bit small for the price, but I guess you're paying to dine in the neighborhood."
171,malaparte-new-york,2018-10-01,1.0,"Sadly disenchanted.

While several months -- if not a year ago -- I LOVED this place, now it's a GREAT disappointment.

During the summer 2018, the most humid summer of New York City on record, Malaparte kept their doors and windows open, making it a very uncomfortable place to dine in, unless you prefer to dine sweaty in a sauna on who-only-knows-how well-refrigerated-food.  

Now that summer 2018 is over, I was VERY ENTHUSIASTIC to return to Malaparte. 

What a fool I was.

First -- there is disgusting scaffolding around Malaparte. 

Second -- the people eating outside under the scaffolding are bringing lunch boxes of non-restaurant food for their kids in strollers.  

Third -- Malaparte was nearly empty inside, but the hostess couldn't figure out if the wait for an inside table was 30 minutes or 5 minutes."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-05-12,4.0,"Its gets busy in the evening! We got a table on Sat night at 6:30 without much wait but were told that the next reservation is at 7:30 so we would need to finish by then. So it wasn't exactly a sit down, relax and enjoy the dinner kind of experience. But....coming to the food, it was excellent! I had the Rigatoni with pesto and it was DELiCIOUS! The toasted almonds on top was a nice touch. The four stars are really for this dish. The bread they served in the beginning was fresh too. We didn't have time for coffee or dessert so can't review that. Service was ok."
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-07-13,5.0,Great Italian food! Awesome staff and good vibes! 1000% recommend! The pastas & pizzas are great along with the apps & salads. A gem!
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-07-07,5.0,"Great spot off the beaten patch, chill and very enjoyable environment. Amazing food pasta pizza salad and vino very well priced. Great value and service was helpful.
Will be back"
171,malaparte-new-york,2019-05-10,2.0,The food is good here but the service and management were terrible.The whole night we had to flag down waiters to get service. But what really stood out was when we were winding down our meal and were told we couldn't order any more drinks and had to leave for the next group. No time limit was told to us earlier and no warning that we needed to leave soon was given. I thought maybe the hostess had been a bit hasty and mentioned what happened to the manager and he informed me that he had told her to make us leave. Pretty rude way to treat us after we drop $500. But the food was good
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2020-06-04,5.0,"One of my favorite coffee shops!! I only discovered this place like two weeks ago but I've been coming every day. Coffee is great, reasonably priced, the people who work here are really nice, and the service is fast. The best part is all the decorative sheep they're SO CUTE. Only downside is that they give you paper straws."
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2020-03-05,4.0,Their soba noodle salad is so nourishing and their pumpkin chocolate bread is AMAZING!
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2019-08-20,4.0,Got this for MealPal. Pretty good meal and sizeable portion. It was ready right when I arrived but a lot of the salad was pretty soggy. The chicken was good but there wasn't very much of it. Overall i'm satisfied with it for a mealpal lunch.
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2020-05-24,5.0,"My favorite work spot. The atmosphere is great: relaxing music and candle light and sheep!! Their coffee is really good! Whether you order a cappuccino or regular ice coffee, your taste buds will be very happy. Their pastries and breakfast/lunch options are great, too! My go-tos are their avocado toast or yogurt. The avocado toast is absolutely amazing and filling!! Their yogurt is topped with their own granola, which is just the perfect amount of sweet."
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2019-01-21,4.0,"For a team coffee adventure, I was asked to curate some coffee spot ideas since I run a foodstagram (slightly inactive atm but follow me @phothegram) and this was one of the places I haven't been to but looked cute. It ended up being the winner because my team became fascinated with the sheeps in the yelp pictures and the coffee break became a unexpected sheep experience..

So when we went I was actually surprised by the amount of sheeps just lined up everywhere - mixed color sheeps too. Anyways, onto coffee - I was pretty basic and just got a latte but it was a nice cup of coffee. Was strong but not acidic. I would say if you're trying to read or work it might be hard because it's pretty dim in there but if you're looking for quiet it's really quiet!

IG: @phothegram"
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2018-02-02,4.0,"The sheep piqued my interest, but the espresso at Kaffe 1668 was legit. This hip and modern gourmet coffee shop in Tribeca is on Greenwich serving coffee and espresso drinks for the nearby Citibank and college crowds.

This place reminds me of the upscale coffee places in San Francisco and Sacramento with a full espresso, pourover, and drip bar setup. You can get basic drinks served very well in a dim and intimate setting surrounded by hundreds of sheep dolls. It is both comforting and surreal at the same time.

My drink was pulled about average time wise and was a decent value given the quality. The interior had a lot of seating in such a narrow, but long environment. Kaffee 1668 is a nice stop for a caffeine break or small meal in the area."
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2019-08-03,3.0,"This place is honestly great in some aspects, but just extremely overpriced. But I guess that's what you get with a chic NYC coffee shop. It's super hard for me to resist being that my office is two steps away around the corner. I will say there are some upsides + downsides:

Upsides- coffee is actually amazing. I usually get the iced cold brew or iced latte. Usually super quick to come out. They also provide you punch cards (have to go 10 times though before you get something free, lol). The interior decor is well-thought out and beautiful. Stop in to do some work or go on a cute coffee date. 

Downsides- as mentioned, super pricey. I have been in here a handful of times and what baffles me is that a breakfast burrito (with eggs, beans, and guacamole) costs $15. Whaaaaaat?! That's insane. Also always super slow to be made. I waited yesterday for about 15 minutes for it to come out and it wasn't even packed. 

My point here is... if I am coming to Kaffe in the future, it's for a quick iced coffee and that's all. I can't be spending $20 every morning for a breakfast and coffee when I can get it for half the price somewhere else. Although it is tasty, and coffee is great, I don't think it's worth it."
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2018-04-03,4.0,"Very cozy cafe with surprisingly a good amount of tables/seatings. I ordered a macchiato and was surprised when a tiny cup of coffee came out even though it was very cute. I didn't expect a $4 drink to come out in an espresso size cup but maybe that's how all macchiatos are? 

I didn't realize this location didn't have wifi available since I was hoping to work a little but it's ok, the other TriBeCa location has it so I will definitely want to check out that one. Super cute cafe and love all the little sheep decorations!"

172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2019-02-26,2.0,"I was in the area for NY fashion week so I decided to dip in and get a macchiato for the evening.   I could appreciate the aesthetic they have cultivated here.   It was a nice calm space to be able to sit at and get away from the cold.   No one was in line so the Barista took my order right away.  She was already sitting at the counter.   Ordered my macchiato and paid. And then, for whatever reason, she didn't start making the coffee right away.   She started talking to an employee (or so I thought he was employee, he was wheeling his bike from outside to behind the counter).   Then I saw another woman come from the back and I thought, oh maybe she is the barista.  Nope.   The woman who took my order eventually made my coffee with the urgency of a 13 year old doing their chores.   Coffee was just ok.   Maybe crappy service is also a part of their aesthetic.   I wouldn't return."

Staff is friendly and patient, and are really good at explaining items that you may never heard of. Orders also come out fairly quick.

I ordered the matcha latte and I thought it wasn't bad. Definitely on the pricier end, but as with all hipster coffee places, it's also not surprising.

Kaffe 1668 is a great place to catch up with friends or study if you find yourself around TriBeCa."

The music sometimes is too loud for studying.  Pretty spacious with 9 or 10 wooden tables, each can sit 4 people comfortably. It'd be better if they can play softer music. Here it comes-clubbing dancing music. Maybe it's just me-I like to study in Barnes & Noble type of ambiance."

All their drinks are really good and kinda fun. I like the seating and atmosphere at this location. It's dark, but that's OK. They have all the usual coffee drinks, milks and non-milks. They also have light lunch things and snacks. 

Prices are definitely commensurate with the area so know before you go. It's not really a great place to do work at but go to a library to work or study. Get coffee here."
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2018-07-16,3.0,"Cute shop, although probably not my cup of tea (or coffee, rather). I have been here a few times because of the convenient location. I sometimes have meetings in the neighborhood, and will stop by. The espresso is delicious. The food is good too. But everything takes forever. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese one time and it took at least 10 minutes. There was probably one other person ahead of me. I have waited at least 5 minutes every time for my coffee, regardless of what I order. I could probably be okay with all of these things, if the service wasn't so terrible. I'm not looking for 5-star, white-glove service but all the employees seem so uninterested and dissatisfied at being here. I'm sorry that my iced latte order bores you so much; maybe you're in the wrong industry. Still debating whether this hipster shop is worth it."

I heard some woman interviewing nannies declaring that junk food for her kids is ""like, RICE CRACKERS"" and how many detoxes she has proudly pushed her body through. This place is decorated like a beautiful co-working space with its long wooden tables, exposed lofted ceilings, industrial chic decor... 

THE MATCHA LATTE: I loved it here. I wish the iced version had a bit more tea and less ice since the ice cubes filled 1/2-2/3 of the cup, but the taste was superb. I enjoyed the slight sweetness with the tea as the focus as compared to the overpowering sugary taste at some other places. They also seemed to have simple syrup, soy milk, etc. I can't wait to try the other drinks here! 

THE FOOD: I did not purchase anything, but they have an extensive menu at this location unlike the other one down the street. Tons of vegetarian/vegan/raw/paleo/unicorn-friendly food options. My companion had a raw chocolate brownie-like bar and that was good!"

172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2019-09-17,2.0,Really enjoy the vibe here. The challenge is the barista in the morning is so incredibly slow! I mean to the point you wanna get mad before your first cup of coffee.  It doesn't matter if there is no one or 10 people. I may have to change spots because I need to get in the office. Everyone is on a morning schedule. Get one more barista or the current one need ms to pick up the pace.  Because of barista only 2 stars

Coffee is okay ans it's not that special compared to other cpffee roasters in nyc. I am not sure if the design of paper cup for hot coffee is a failure because on that day the paper is too thin and my coffee keeps leaking. Coffee is not a good coffee if it's leaking and drop on my white shirt. It's annoying.

I give it only 3 stars because I find it to be way too expensive for what you're getting. You could easily spend $15 on a coffee and a snack. I also get a little weirded out by their sheep decor. I get that's the theme, but there are literally hundreds of the same little sheep adorning all the walls and shelves. Lastly, some baristas have been friendly but the majority of my stops in here have been met with mediocre service in terms of friendliness and efficiency."

172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2018-09-30,5.0,"Pricey but it's tribeca, right. The food is good but I wish they would stick to the menu. They never have the soup that's on the menu. We love the veggie chili & they hardly ever have it. They always run out of stuff... like the goat cheese. They're always changing the hummus. One week it's beet hummus then another it's regular & then another it's regular with bits of parsley. It's a surprise every time  I like this place & it's super convenient for lunch."
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2016-03-08,3.0,"Ach...it was alright. Literally the darkest coffee shop I've ever been into in my life though, and it was a sunny day, lord knows what it's like on a gloomy, grey day..?

Must be a health hazard, everyone moving around with hot beverages in their hands in the near pitch black, it's a recipe for a hot drink disaster if you ask me.

I went out of my way to visit as is passed before and mentally 'bookmarked' it, I won't go out of my way again, but the coffee was pretty good if the dry as a bone scone left something to be desired."

The almond milk latte was fine, but nothing special at all. The coffee seemed pretty good quality but the latte wasn't smooth as a latte should be. No unsweetened almond milk either. Pretty pricey and just wasn't impressed."

I'm bummed with the prices of the coffee ( $4 for the small ice coffee) , and juices and small bites are pretty pricey too . It's true that baristas  could look. little but less serious , but I get it - working with people it's not easy ;)"
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2014-08-20,4.0,"Nice place for a grab and go coffee to wander down Greenwich street. 

Iced Latte ($4.75): very strong, a good amount of milk, and flavorful. They actually have Stevia packets (instead of just the usual Splenda/Equal culprits), or honey to add in. The place itself is dark as opposed to the usual bright cafe, so a change of pace if you like that sort of thing.

Wish they would put the coffee menu in an easier location to read. You can't see it until you're basically at the counter, and thus rushed to order. Also, a tad expensive, so will stick to the basics."
172,kaffe-1668-new-york-3,2018-06-01,2.0,"Too sweet!  Before ordering, I asked the girl behind the counter if there was any sugar in the savory New Quinoa wrap.  She said, ""No.""  Well, there was, and plenty!  I think it was the pickled onions, and maybe in the sauce around the eggs (mayo?).  I ate the wrap, but I didn't feel good; I'm not likely to return.  It's a pity, too, because the place looks, smells, feels and even sounds good.  Only the ""taste"" part is missing!"
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2020-06-01,4.0,"Previous to trying Bearin, I had no idea what a wheel pie was but was intrigued when I walked by, so I decided to give it a try.

Each of the basic wheel pies (with only one filling) are $2 and not that large. I ordered the cream and the taro flavors. As many have mentioned, it takes a long time to make so keep that in mind before ordering. By the second time when I brought along a friend, I just called ahead to order and they had it ready when we arrived.

What really stands out about this place is the customer service. Sometimes the owner herself is there making the wheel pies and she is so sweet. All of the staff is really nice. The first time I was there, I waited for about 10 minutes and everyone was so apologetic. The owner even put tapioca into the cream wheel pie for free because she felt bad. 

I definitely think this is a nice treat because the pies are not overbearingly (pun not intended) sweet. I definitely recommend!"
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-12-09,5.0,"I walked in here not knowing what this was but wanted to order it immediately. My friend and I each ordered a matcha cream wheel for $2.50. We had to wait about 10 minutes for it, but with how inexpensive it was, I kind of wish I ordered more, to be honest.

My friend and I were super cold so this warm pie served its purpose.

They also have bubble tea, but I didn't order it."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-05-23,4.0,"This is a good place to get wheel cake. We buy 5 and get 1 free. They have different flavors here but do recommended don't go with ice cream. My hubby ordered wheel cake with peach ice cream, the wheel cake was too hard for him to bite. So when he eating, I heard the loud noise he biting. 

My sister and I ordered matcha, taro and red bean. They even have the topping with black pearls. They all taste pretty good with fresh and soft wheel cake."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-05-14,3.0,"I been hearing rumors about the wheel pie. My friend was gonna stop at the flushing one but decided to go bearin wheel pie instead. 

Unfortunately it was sad for me but my friend liked it. I haven't tried the wheel pie yet but all the orders was wrong except 2 of them. 
I asked my friend to get matcha with tapioca wheel pie, cream wheel pie and taro with tapioca wheel pie. 
He said he ordered ice cream wheel pie and cream peanut. 

I got the buy 5 get 1 free. 
I got two cream wheel pie with tapioca, taro wheel pie. I didn't receive the correct order which was very disappointing. My friend said there was one worker and another person waiting on the line. So the orders that my friend ordered for me it went to the guy. 

My friend said he also ordered oreo shake which he said it was disappointing but the wheel pie was good even though it was a mistake order. 

I will come by here again next time to upload more pictures and give the second review how I felted."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-04-07,3.0,"I came to Bearin Wheel because of their bubble tea. However, I  saw they sold this unique flavor filled pies based on a Taiwanese dessert. I was intrigued and needed to taste their specialty. I ordered their basic milk tea as they don't have too many flavors but wanted to try a new bubble tea spot in Chinatown. Not much to rave about. 

The 3 stars is for the wheel pie I tried which I did like. I didn't particularly like the taro flavored one (quite starchy and dry for my liking) but loved the Oreo flavored pie. It tasted like what it was... a fried Oreo! Unfortunately, it takes a little time for these suckers to be prepared, so expect a wait if you order them.

Accepts card with a $10 minimum (may or may not have lowered it to $5). Cash accepted.
No bathroom. Small space.

Bon appetit!"

Tuna one doesn't have much tuna but more mayo and potato ?

Love wheel pie, I used to eat it in Taiwan's night market. Kudos to Bearin with all these flavors, I want to try it all. I picked my favorite ingredients which are cream and tapioca. 

A notice posted on the wall stating about 8 minutes of wait time. I was very anxious and can't wait to taste it. OMG, it was so good. Just about the right sweetness of cream and perfectly cooked tapioca with a good chew. Wheel pie is full of cream, but do lack a bit of the yummy tapioca. I only had a few of it mixed with the cream.

This is a small place only four seats available. Very friendly staff and willing to introduce all their flavors or savings if you buy 5 get 1 free. I would love to return and try their Taro wheel pie."

The wheel pie was ok, the crust wasn't hot and tasty like the last time I got it with taro.

This time it was with ice cream and very bland 
It was affordable though
So would prob recommend getting it HOT!!!!

Price was $2.18

Interior there was like 4 seats

Friendly servers :)"
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-02-12,4.0,"What a neat spot to have wheel pie.

I believe it's connected to a souvenir shop, if I am right. 

Best tasting one was the red bean with mochi inside. The most unique one was the corn and cheese. I don't think I ever had that kind of a combination before. 

We bought a lot of wheel pie and the lady owner gave us 1 free cream with tapioca on the house. Very nice of her to offer.

Good spot to catch some dessert."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-02-09,3.0,"Came here because the outside beary decorations attracted me to it. I didn't know what it was. They had a deal - 2 wheel pies and a bubble tea for $6.50. I ordered the red bean with mochi (this was a special filling so they charged me another 50 cents) and a taro flavor. I asked for hot bubble tea w less sugar. Waited about 10 mins and they gave me a cold bubble tea. I told her I asked for hot so she went to remake it. 2nd cup it qas hot for sure but full on sugar. Too sweet. I kept it anyway cuz it took so long. Waited another 5 mins to get the pies.
 
The pies kinda reminded me of those fish filled pastries. Same concept. I was not impress at all. It was just okay. Not really worth the money. 

But the decor is cute. I wanted the worker's t-shirts with the bear on it"
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-06-13,3.0,"Bearin Wheel Pie specializes in Taiwanese wheel cakes, a colonial adaptation of the Japanese imagawayaki. These treats resemble stuffed pancakes and are freshly made and should be consumed so as well-- otherwise the crispy exterior will wilt from the steam. 

At $2.50 a pop, they are about $1.50 cheaper than those found at Catmint in West Village. The menu at Bearin Wheel Pies is also larger, offering eight basic fillings (one being ice cream) and an additional eight specialty fillings. 

That being said, I prefer Catmint's cakes more mainly because I found the texture of the fillings at Bearin to be lacking (way too runny and bland). I did note that Bearin added cinnamon to their batter which complemented my custard filling harmoniously. However the cinnamon had the exact opposite effect for my savory tuna/cheese filling; it was a strange flavor combination overall."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2018-12-17,4.0,"3.5 stars, but will round up.  We tried the red bean, taro, and ice cream wheel pies.  Flavors were quite good and not too sweet, and I appreciated the chunky red bean and chunky taro pieces in the filling.  

Service was very friendly and welcoming, although not the most organized.  It's nice that they make to order, but it takes a very long time; I wonder what the tradeoff would be if they started some of the wheel shells and just finished/heated to order.  They also messed up our order, but after such a long wait, we didn't want to wait longer for new ones to be made.  They were quite friendly and apologetic though, so not a big deal, although it meant we didn't try as many flavors as we hoped.  Maybe next time!"
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-11-30,3.0,"Good concept, but it's really time consuming to make and receive the order. It's not all of taste to deserve a ""Wow"" therefore, for $2.50/piece, I would say it's an experience.

The staffs were very friendly."

I got a bubble tea, which was pretty standard- good but nothing exceptional- and two wheel pies. We chose taro and cream. You do have to wait a bit, if you are in a hurry or are expecting it to be ready Immediately this isn't the place for you. However it is so worth the wait because they are served hot and fresh!! I have never had a wheel pie before but I really liked it and would like to return to try other flavors. The shop itself is adorable but very small. They do have a couple seats."

173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-02-05,4.0,I've been walking past this location for quite a while. So I FINALLY decided to pay a visit for this location. They specialize in a Taiwanese snack which is a circular pie. The employees were super polite and helpful. I decided to get the cheese and corn pie which was pretty delightful. I've never had cheese stretch so far when I took a bite from this. My friend got the Oreo pie and it was quite tasty as well! If I could describe the taste it would be sorta like a taiyaki. There are deals here too for two pies and a drink I believe. The interior design is really cute and pleasing to the eye!

This shop is tiny with just a couple stools to sit on. The staff is very friendly. I tried red bean, taro with boba and cream wheelcakes. All were tasty and I liked the taro the best. There is a deal right now for a boba tea and 2 wheelcakes for $6 - I recommend doing this to try a few things."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-08-08,4.0,"Was originally going to give 3 stars but a bite of this wheel pie bumped it up to 4. MmmMmmmmm these pies are delicious! Like they say, it's best eaten fresh and it's the perfect bouncy/squishy/soft ""baby's butt"" (as my friend describes it). I got the cream filled one and it was a perfect bite at $2.50. 

Also got a brown sugar milk tea which tasted like regular (kinda watered down) milk tea, nothing special at all. I was also a little annoyed at the speed of service; two workers stood chatting over the wheel pies while the pies were being made. After the pies were done, they both slowly made their way over to start my milk tea. Very inefficient, neh?"
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-01-08,2.0,"I wish their wheel pies tasted the same as the ones before they changed the name of the place. Sadly they aren't as good. I tried the taro and the matcha one and both were ok. The taro one was what I was anticipating on trying because I really liked it before they changed the brand. I guess with changing the brand, they also changed the recipe. The outer shell for the wheel pie was a little thick and they tasted undercooked. It definitely had the taste of raw flour which is hard to get past. They also thinned out the taro filling compared to before rebranding. I remember it being thicker and now it felt a little more watery. The matcha one was ok, but it didn't taste too much of matcha. You get the taste of custard before matcha. 
The woman (possibly the owner) asked me of my opinion and I told her how I felt about it. She was really understanding and took the criticism seriously to possibly improve I would hope. In return she treated my friend and I to an ice cream wheel pie. For the ice cream one, they have shells made and they put the ice cream in between them. The shell is definitely more crispy, but in the center, it still has the taste of flour sadly. I don't really know what they did to change the recipe, but I was quite disappointed that it no longer tasted like the ones I had before. The wheel pies are affordable, so they aren't too bad to try. For $2 for one (not including tax), they are reasonably cheap. I haven't tried their drinks so I don't know how they fair in that department. Sadly I don't think I would come back unless their wheel pies change."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2018-11-12,4.0,"be prepared to wait at least 5 min for the freshly made pies.  I get the red bean filling every time but seems like the recipe/ source of the filling changed to be sweeter and the beans are whole instead of mashed.   
ordered the red bean egg yolk but they gave me tapioca red bean and i didn't realize it was tapioca until i ate everything .  went back and they were super nice to give me a free one.  
will come back and try the other flavors.  hopefully they won't be as sweet"
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2018-10-31,2.0,"My sister and I walked by Bearin while on our way to KFTea to get boba. I love wheel pies, so I dragged her in to get one. They're made to order, so rest assured your wheel pie is always fresh. They offer a variety of stuffing options.

I opted to go with the cream pie, as that was my favorite when I had a wheel pie for the first time in Japan. We waited about 5 minutes for them to make it.

First, I'd like to mention that the staff here is SUPER nice and when one of them noticed that I was trying to peel the super cute bear sticker off the packaging, he offered me an actual sticker. Super nice!

But, I do have to mention that the wheel pie really didn't taste like anything? Maybe I picked the wrong stuffing... But even when I picked a cream stuffing while I was in Japan - or even at Mitsuwa - it was sweet and tasty! I kind of felt like I was eating paper...

I'd give them another try with another topping the next time I'm in Chinatown. But I definitely won't be making a special trip to get one."

I ordered an Oreo pie and while I was waiting (it takes 5-8 min to make), the owner - super sweet lady from Taiwan - chatted with me. Even scored me with a free vanilla ice cream pie... both were super tasty, especially the ice cream since it complements the doughy pie pocket so well.  Def recommend, plus they got boba which I gotta try next time. Literally made my night to meet such friendly peeps. :)"

They also have several different fillings for the wheel pies and tea drinks.

I would recommend people to go to this bakery for wheel pies. I will go back to try other fillings."

I couldn't even stop to notice I had finished my pie so fast! They are delicious and made fresh. The tea isn't overwhelmingly sweet which I find bumps the sweet of the pie itself.

I'll be sure to visit again soon!

Neither of us had heard of wheel pies and when we saw the ""medium drink + 2 wheel pies for $6.50"" deal we couldn't pass it up. We ended up in some back and forth with the workers who were trying to charge us more for the deal because we wanted a milk tea even though the sign says a medium drink is all you need to qualify. 

We both ordered taro milk tea and I ordered a cookies and cream wheel pie and my friend ordered a taro wheel pie. We were both shocked when our teas came without boba since that's what we were there for but chalking that up to not reading small print on menu.
 

In the end we both enjoyed the wheel pies and I'll definitely want another one in the future. 3 stars for how difficult the order process and wait time for the drinks and pies."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-06-22,2.0,"The wheels pies were not bad. We had the matcha and cream ones. The inside was chewy and the filling was delicious!

The problem was with the milk teas. The boba felt like it wasn't cooked all the way (had a hard center) and the milk tea was just average. It did not have a strong tea tlavor and just tasted diluted. Prone to spillage as well, since the plastic covering is flimsy."

There was this bundle promotion happening where its $6.50 for a drink and two wheel pies. I ordered a red bean one and a cream one after asking the staff there which ones are the most popular. They recommended these two so I just went with it since I wanted to try the simple ones first. (Not like I've never had red bean or the cream custard filling pastries tho...) Was looking forward to the cream one since these wheel pies are similar to taiyaki...  (kind of...), but they gave me a taro one instead.  didnt realize until after I left. I also ordered the bearin.... something style milk tea... (didnt realize it didnt come with bubbles... =w=... they didnt ask me about it) so yea.... the milk tea wasnt that good either... tbh
Overall, was a little disappointed with my visit this time..."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-09-03,2.0,Really disappointed! This is my fav snack/dessert in Taiwan and I've had horrible ones and really good ones in Taiwan. After reading the reviews when it first opened and looked at the pics it looked pretty legit despite some reviews. I gave it a try...ate it on the spot at it was already soggy. I don't know how... I legit ate it a few seconds after getting it. Also the dough was too thick. It should be thin crispy crust with soft inside and a good amt of filling. The filling was also kind of bland. And tasted wierd. I got the cream filling and it was bland and I had thought it was same as Taiwan's custard filling but maybe that's why it's called cream instead of custard. Only reason I gave it 2 vs 3 stars is that it's better than the places I tried in Taiwan that were completely horrible

Got the ice cream one and it was brick hard, literally felt like biting a stone. The ice cream was good but the pie was severely hard from being frozen.

The cooked ones tend to have a really long wait time which isn't really pleasant when there is a lot of customers.

Not impressed at all. Maybe their boba would be better."

They do not skimp out on the bubble tea which is a super plus for me. It might not be your cup of tea so make sure you tell them your preference of boba added. 
They have some interesting flavors on the menu. Even though I ate so many in a row (this is one thing I do not recommend doing) I didn't find myself thinking the flavors were ever boring. If I had space in my stomach, I probably could have kept on eating those delicious little wheel pies. 
There is a wait time of 8 minutes when you order a wheel pie because they want to make it as fresh and crispy as possible for you so that you have the best experience eating it. I have to say, the wait is so very worth it. 
Some of my favorite flavors were the matcha and the matcha with boba. I also really enjoyed the taro with a salted egg. The sweetness of the taro and the saltiness of the egg really complimented each other. If you are adventurous, there are flavors like tuna with black pepper, or a radish and mushroom flavor. Though it may sound weird, both flavors are pretty solid. 
If you're even in the area, I recommend that you give this place a try. It's a nice little snack to have while you walk around the Chinatown area. It's also a very typical snack that children have in China when they are young so why not let yourself experience a new culture in a fun way."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-01-06,3.0,"I really wanted to leave a good review for this place. I had high hopes. When I asked if the fillings were ice cream, the guy responded yes, so I got green tea with extra red bean topping (toppings are +$0.50 each). I also got oreo. They have a deal where two wheel pies and a medium bubble tea costs $6.50, so I got that deal. Everything came out disappointing. First, the wheel pies did not have ice cream inside. The green tea was some kind of hot green mush that tasted like green bean, not green tea. The oreo filling was just warm mashed oreos. The bubble tea tasted like water. No sweetness and no cream taste. Some tea taste but barely. Mostly tastes like water. Kind of reminded me of bakery milk teas. Only the tapioca was sweet. The staff was nice and it's a small business so I wanted to support them, so I gave them a good rating for that. I don't know if I'll be coming back."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2018-12-29,3.0,"For those who know me, I am a sucker for boba teas. And if you have something to pair it with, you got me. What do I like about this place...I like the mother-like woman who stands in front of this large griddle making batter mix and puff pies with various fillings. I got the taro pie since I saw everyone else getting it. It was very good. Disclaimer: Everything is made to order and a pie takes 8 minutes according to their sign. I will say the logo and character design of the place is great. Menu is on point, and branding is up there.

My dislike...the financial attachment to the souvenir shop next door. They run their credit card purchases there, which means they disappear with your credit card. It was not an easy feeling. If you take my credit card and disappear to the back, I will, and always will, assume you are writing my card number down. Please invest in one of many card processing apps."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2018-11-23,5.0,"Stopped by on Thanksgiving mostly because of their cute bear logo. For those who don't know what a wheel pie is, it's a filling inside of a thin pastry shell sort of like a taiyaki. They also sell various teas (bubble teas included).

They make the wheel pies when you order, and there is a sign saying it will take 8 minutes to make. I didn't time it, but that time estimate seemed correct. Since they're freshly made, they come out nice and hot, but you'll have to wait a bit.

I tried wheel pies with matcha, red bean, and cream with tapioca (3 different wheel pies that is). I don't like overly sweet desserts, but these were not too sweet. The red bean had full beans, which I prefer because it adds some texture. The matcha and cream were also very good. I ate one a few hours later, and though it wasn't as good as when it was fresh, it was still quite tasty. They have some savory options for an slight upcharge but I didn't try them.

They have a combo for 2 wheel pies and a standard medium tea for $6.50, which I got. The tea was also good, with a good flavor without being too sweet.

Finally, the staff was super nice. Overall, if you're looking for a tea and small dessert, this is a good option."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2018-12-21,3.0,"Made to order. Takes about 8 mins to make. Currently there's a $6 deal that gets you a bubble milk tea and 2 wheel pie. I got the buy 5 get 1 free deal. I ordered sweet and savory kinds. They label each flavor so you won't get them mixed up. The wheel pies starts to get soggy if you don't eat them right after but you can pop them in the toaster oven to get it crispy again. The tuna with black pepper had a bit of a kick. The corn + cheese was not as fresh and lacked cheese. The shell is lighter than the Japanese types though. The sweet ones are better. The tapioca in the milk tea is hard. Overall, it's alright."

Not only did we had to wait a while, we also did not get the correct order and it was also a bit raw in the middle. The place wasn't even busy so how can you get one order wrong. I do not recommend coming here."
173,bearin-wheel-pie-new-york,2019-01-12,5.0,I stopped by after hearing about it from my friends and decided to try some wheel pies. The lady worked there were really nice and made a new combination for me. I ordered taro with cream together and peanut butter cream with Oreo. They were both delicious!!! It is a cozy and small business. Definitely will come back to support it and order other savory flavours like radish and mushroom or black pepper tuna.

174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2020-01-06,5.0,"I found this place based on Yelp reviews and I'm glad I did. Went for lunch on a Sunday. No wait for party of three.

We ordered Tutt Chicken and a pizza. Food was great. Authentic and nicely seasoned Mediterranean food. Don't know if I've ever had better chicken and hummus. The Turkish coffee was really good too.

This place is simple and small. No frills. We weren't in a hurry so didn't mind that it took a little while for our food to be prepared. (That is, it's not fast.)

I won't hesitate to come back on a future visit to Brooklyn."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-09-13,3.0,"This place is one of the more better value places to eat in Brooklyn Heights that also doubles well for a takeout spot.

As for food, the pistachio baklava ($2.50) is so good and I'd def recommend that over the almond one. Then for my entree I had the chicken pitza ($12) and it didn't hit the mark like I hoped it would even though the reviews are great on here. Maybe they can add a bit more cheese or a lil extra sauce.

I had takeout so I can't speak to the onsite dining experience but the staff seemed nice and efficient.

Overall, it makes me happy to see this place in Brooklyn Heights as a contrast to the other restaurants."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-11-27,4.0,"The salad sampler was delicious! If you're into tangy and sweet, make sure you get the labna (yogurt with mint leaves) and the beet salad and eat it together with that delicious, hot out of the oven pita. My boyfriend and I came here for a quick bite and it was the best decision ever. The kebab might've been a lliiiiitttlee overcooked, but other than that everything was on point. @tam.mah.go"
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2018-08-18,4.0,"The three best foods at this longtime BK Heights spot:

- their creamy labneh: unstoppable good, packed with flavor 
- their hummus: I'm not a big hummus fan but this one is really well balanced and dotted with olive oil 
- their hot, homemade pita bread: dip in the labneh and it's especially heavenly

On a warm day, the outdoor seating here is prime and the service is kind and lets you stay a while."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-08-12,1.0,"Took my friend here tonight for dinner. I raved about this place to my friend, but when we came here, it was a different experience. 

It took the server a bit of time to clean the tables outside for us to sit. We were seated after waiting 10 minutes or so. The place was fairly empty.

The sever gave us our menus. We ordered beers and 3 appetizers and 2 entrees, 1 pitta and grilled chicken wings.

We waited for more than 1 hour to get our appetizers. We had to flag down the server to get our appetizers. My friend ended up going inside to ask the server for our appetizers. 

The appetizers finally came, but the server did not provide utensils. My friend came inside to get us utensils. At this point, we were extremely mad that it took us so long to get our appetizers.

My friend's entree came and the dish consisted of 4 chicken wings, salad and French fries. The food was not what my friend ordered.

At this point, we were frustrated that it took over an hour to get 3 appetizers and a missed up entree. My friend went into complain but the workers did not offer an apology or explained why the food took so long.

This place should have zero stars."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2018-05-30,3.0,"Read all the great reviews, but was pretty disappointed by them when I had food delivered to my office.

The portion sizes were generous, but the food was just okay.

The mixed salad was boring. It came with 5 types of things - we got 2 different types of chickpeas, a regular salad, stuffed grape leaves, and hummus.  The pita was good.

Also split the mixed grill. The rice was bland. The pork chops were too burnt. The lamb was the best part, but not extraordinary in any way.

They also didn't give us any hot sauce. Maybe you have to ask specifically?

Tutt Cafe may be better if you actually go there, but I won't be ordering delivery from them again."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-12-07,5.0,"Amazing food!!! Fresh food and ingredient. The harira soup was perfectly seasoned. Love the hummus and fresh hot pita bread right out the oven.

The roasted leg of lamb was so tough and looked and tasted like it was boiled. My jaw hurt after eating it. Interior is drab. Avoid this place at all cost."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2020-02-09,5.0,An absolute gem of a place!  Phenomenal food from a family-owned place where the service was friendly and fast.  I can't say enough good things about the place.  Every time that we go it is great - welcoming of kids as well.
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-06-09,4.0,"Good and quick. Get their chicken swaurma pita. This place is a very easy walk from Brooklyn Bridge Park and away from all the crowds.  

Keep in mind this place has a $10 card minimum: however, including tip in the total will easily get you above the minimum."

174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-02-24,4.0,Love Tutt Cafe - one of the gems of Brooklyn Heights! At least once a week I get a craving for their pitzas. It's like a pizza meets flatbread meets Mediterranean. My default order is their $12 chicken pitza.
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-09-02,3.0,"Ordered food, the guy shows up and doesn't even try to buzz me he just calls my cell phone and claims he doesn't understand how to use the door buzzer system, so I have to go all the way out to the front door to get my food because he is pretending not to understand how the door buzzer works. So lame. The food is great but I wont be ordering delivery from them again after having such an annoying experience with their delivery guy."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2018-07-07,3.0,"Tucked away on Hicks St on the north end of the Heights, this middle eastern joint screamed Egypt!   The usual middle eastern fare w many vegan options 

The soups were good, especially Harir though the lentil soup seemed under-seasoned.  The beet salad was fine, the tabouli a bit dry and the falafel over-cooked. 

Service was speedy and the place is kid-friendly."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2018-03-19,5.0,"Tutt Cafe is amazing, it feels so homey and is so so so good. Super friendly and cheery people here.

But the food.. The green pitza is the greatest most interesting pizza you'll ever try (leeks, scallions, fenugreek mix topped with lots of cheese). My boyfriend exclaimed it was the best pizza he's ever had. 

Also had zaatar bread, a little more oily than usual, but still really good. I got it with the baba ganoush, spread it on the zaatar bread and it is heavenly. They serve it with some pita bread....really fresh and delicious. Cant wait to go back and try more of this amazing food."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-04-24,4.0,Cool little restaurant in a Brooklyn neighborhood that I randomly stumbled onto.  I had the chicken wrap and it was good.  Staff was friendly and it was cool to sit at the dining tables outside the restaurant on a sunny day and watch the neighborhood bustle.  I recommend this place if you're ever in the neighborhood!
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2018-09-19,4.0,The food was really good!! We enjoyed the green pizza!! When we come back we are definitely ordering this again! We also got a decent sized portion of marinade chicken which was not dry at all and babaghanoush accompanied with pita bread. I really enjoyed the babaghanoush. The only downside that I have is the fact that we waited awhile before we got our food. We weren't given like an appetizer like pita with some hummus while we waited which would have been nice! Anyways we were really impressed with the food and that everything was reasonably priced which means we will definitely be back!
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2017-05-15,4.0,"2nd time coming here and the food is good!

I came in to grab dinner before my last class of the semester.. 

Food is great here and the price point is good, the small toubeleh was a little overpriced though for the amount you get. 

Ordered: Leg of Lamb plate $13, small toubeleh $6, food was good, I'm a big guy and I was full, I think the last time I came they gave you more hummus. 

4 out of 5. It's a staple in my list of local spots to goto as a new resident of NY. The only other place to date that has been better is Istanbul on Bay Pkwy/86th (Bensonhurst) area off the D train @ bay Pkwy stop. 


Note: the older server guy couldn't stay off his phone and had to be flagged down to place my order; mind you he's legit 5 feet away... Now we all know ain't nobody texting him like that Lol"
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2018-05-29,3.0,"They have great pizza that my son loved but there delivery person is awful. He almost never has change for a 20 and isn't the most pleasant. Plus it took 45 minutes for a pie to be delivered 2 blocks and I had to tip him extra because he had no change, again."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-10-14,4.0,"A friendly place with good falafel and hummus. The leg of lamb is a little dry but overall, the price is an excellent value and drinkable beers for $5. A nice place for dinner after a walk on the promenade."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2017-03-02,4.0,"Alright, so one of those things you learn after many years of being a New Yorker is to spot a hustle, i.e. know when you are gonna be overcharged for things.  Take, for instance, the DUMBO (District Under Manhattan Bridge Overpass) dining options near Brooklyn Bridge Park.  DUMBO used to be a bit of a boony until the yupsters and dotcommers moved in, and with the park, Fulton landing and St. Ann's warehouse nearby, getting a cheap quality meal nearby become a bit of a tall order.  Grimaldi's isn't run by a Grimaldi anymore.  Juliana's (run by a Grimaldi) is decent but catering mostly to yupsters and out-of-towners.  The gastropubs on Front/Water/Washington are either Upper-East-Side meh, ridiculously expensive, or both.  Shake shack is okay but boring.  Suppose you and your lady (substitute subsequent pronoun ""young lady"" for ""beau"" if you are a lady or you play for the other team - love is love and I don't judge) are in the area with a picnic blanket on your backpack, a pair of Jacksons between the two of you and the sun is setting in 90 minutes.  Where could you go for maximum return for minimum investments?

Situate the young lady down with the blanket on the Pier 1 lawn facing the skyline.  Make a phone call, ask for a Lambajin, a chicken pitza, a zaatar bread, a lentil soup or tabouli, a hisbiscus and a loomi (or an iced mint tea), and ask for a pickup order.  Wait 10 to 15 minutes, give her a peck on the cheeks, walk out of the Brooklyn bridge park at Pier one, up Old Fulton until you get past the crowds around the two pizzerias, the BQE underpass onto Hicks street, and into the cafe.  Hand the man the 2 yuppie food stamps and receive thy change (should be $10 left over) and you shall be greeted with a hot bag of goodies - ask for extra hot sauce and/or spices on the side.  Carry it back to the park and laugh at the idiots still waiting on line for Grimaldis and Julianas.  Walk back into the park and present the meal al-fresco to the young lady at your presence, unbox the goods, serve her a choice of hibiscus or loomi, watch the sun set over the greatest city in the United States.  Prepare to receive much subsequent lovin'.

Okay, some stuff I should talk about - their food is actually solid, but when it comes to run-and-gun outdoor eatiing, nothing beats their levant-style pitzas.  The chicken pitza is really a large zaatar bread with tomatoes, peppers and a small amount of cheese, and unlike their Italian cousins, it does not leave you feeling bloated or gross due to butterfat from the mozzarella.  The Lambajin is basically their take on Lahmacun, which is ground lamb, spices, tomtaoes and whatnot.  If the young paramour in question is a vegetarian?  Spinach and cheese pizza.  The tabouli is refreshing on hot summer days and the soup warming on cool autumns afternoons.  The hisbiscus tea is pre-sweetened but it's at least healthier than downing a soda.  The Loomi is a chilled, dried lemon sun-tea which is a little tart, a little bitter, but quite refreshing at the same time, and is available during the summer.  

Now, suppose you don't want to eat outdoors?  What about dining in?  Well, the atmosphere of the place is like a quieter neighborhood pizzeria, except much more laid-back.  Don't expect doting attention from the staff, but they will come by to say hi but generally leave you alone with your thoughts.  Order an Egyptian coffee and a Bambooza (honey soaked polenta cake) or a baklava, and just chat.  They got reasonably comfortable chairs.  Munch on their mezzes, and maybe order a pie within.  The good thing about Hicks is that unlike Henry street, it's quieter, so you can conceivably go there to have a quiet meal.   The place isn't that expensive, and is one of the better options bang-for-your-buck wise in the neighborhood."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-01-03,5.0,"This no-frills gem is friendly, clean, delicious and fresh - not fancy or trendy/sexy. Come here for deliciously fresh falafel, shawarma, freshly baked pita, green ""pizza"", and babaghanoush. Beer and wine are now served - yeah!!"
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2018-09-03,4.0,"The wait was quite long to have our meals to our table and there are also lots of pesky flies but for some reason it was all worth it for the delicious 15$ grilled lamb chops!!!!

174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2018-12-16,5.0,Been in Dumbo for 6 months and have been here 10x times. Always ordered the doner lamb gyro - it's some seriously good stuff. I had better pita here than anywhere else. It's a lowkey hole in the wall that doesn't cut out quality.
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2016-12-11,5.0,"Probably one of my favorite meals I had last week. 

The cafe was quaint. Which isn't really a word I use much, but I think it fits the place well. The waiter was good to us. Gave us time to think about what we wanted, told us the smoothies were delicious, and laughed at our jokes. 

The pita is freshly made. Which is a BIG PLUS. I mean, have you had fresh pita? Most places just pull it out of a bag. Which isn't so bad. But when you can have fresh-out-of-the-oven pita, why would you ever go back to bag life? I don't know. 

I got the chicken plate. Salad (yes, yum), chicken (flavorful and plentiful, and yes, yum) hummus (so good) and the bell of the ball, the pita (delicious). I left very full. It was enough food for two people, easy. Or just one person who really loves that kind of stuff (me). 

Go. It's a good way to spend an hour on a Saturday. And if I lived close by, I think it would be the way I'd spend a lot of my hours on a lot of my days."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2016-09-26,2.0,"I was here this past weekend for an early dinner with a few friends, and the place was empty. 

They have a varied selection of appetizers and mezes, and their mixed salad options seemed ok. 

However, the lamb was horrible. It was an old cold dry piece of tough meat thrown on the plate with the rest. 

The family-own restaurant is welcoming, but what we had here was uninspiring, and quite frankly pretty forgettable."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-01-05,2.0,"Food: falafel was dry, lukewarm, not crispy, didn't taste homemade. Gyro - never tried such version of the meat - some sort of minced meat with spam-like consistency. Sauces were just ok, bland. Pita was the only thing which was good and seemed homemade.
Service: with 3-4 tables had to wait more than 10mins to get our card back after it was swiped. Our order was initially wrong and they changed it which is no big deal typically if the food is worth it - too bad it isn't. 
Don't recommend."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2019-05-08,5.0,"Had the falafel combo and was not disappointed. Great hummus and baba ganoush, the pita is legit. They mail in the salad, but I'm willing to overlook that. No frills and easy seating."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2016-12-10,4.0,"My friends were coming out of a couple hours playing squash down the street at Eastern Athletic Club, when we did some Yelping and discovered Tutt Cafe. To be fair, we were ravenous and anything would have tasted great in the moment. However, Tutt did not disappoint with its casual atmosphere and pop music selection.

I ordered a Lambajin pizza for myself along with baba ganoush for the table. I have never seen Mediterranean/Middle Eastern-style pizza before, and I must say I am hooked. The healthy portion was hugely appreciated, regardless of our hunger, The baba ganoush was also delicious, and not a piece of eggplant or pita was left behind.

I so dearly wish my neighborhood had a place like Tutt Cafe on the corner, but alas Manhattan will have suffice with Jewish delis and bagel joints. Until next time, Tutt!"
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2018-07-04,1.0,"Sat here for over 35 minutes, when there was only one other couple seated in the restaurant, without even an appetizer put on the table. The owner kept barking orders at his 10 yr old looking son to continue making their delivery food orders. When I went up to inquire about why it was taking so long to get at least my appetizer, the owner rudely retorted that it was taking so long because I ordered the mixed plate for my entree?!! What the heck does my entree order have anything to do with how long it was taking my appetizer to come to my table? He was so rude! Instead of being apologetic and offering good customer service, he blamed ME for ordering the entree that I did as to why my appetizer was taking so long. SMH! And worse yet there was a dead roach in the bathroom, underneath the soap dispenser! Disgusting! I left this restaurant in disgust. Shame on you Tutt Cafe."
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2016-08-26,4.0,"I have to say that my love for Mediterranean food began in Brooklyn as odd as that may be. I visited this place on my second visit to Brooklyn, but this time I didn't have enough time to go into inner Brooklyn. We spent time near the bridge as typical tourists do, and ended up stopping by Tutt's since it was a good location near by. 

We ordered a regular falafel plate as well as a chicken pitza. The pitza was something I've never seen in a middle eastern restaurant, so I definitely appreciated their creativity. It was a thin crust pitza with just the right amount of crunch to maintain its shape. I liked that the flavor wasn't overly powerful which allowed you to taste the different ingredients used. The chicken was tender and genuine, unlike every chicken pizza I've eaten lol. Many restaurants usually over season chicken to ""give it flavor"" instead of using good chicken meat to begin with and just seasoning it enough to complement its natural taste instead of masking it

The service here is just wonderful. It seems to be a family owned place, though I am not sure if that's the case. The prices are also very decent for a place pretty close to a tourist attraction site. I am only giving them four stars because I felt like their falafel could use some improvement. I think every Mediterranean restaurant should have delicious falafel. Their Hamas was also very mild in flavor, so perhaps this is the general goal for the restaurant. Our whole meal itself was very refreshing and filling in a good way so I definitely would go back :)"

Granted, the dirty windows and uncouth appearance of the place never instilled me with confidence, but this???"
174,tutt-cafe-brooklyn,2016-08-17,3.0,"After researching yelp for Middle Eastern places in Brooklyn Heights settled on Tutt Cafe.

When you walk into Tutt Cafe it's a little confusing because it is essentially a Middle Eastern Pizza place.  Imagine pizzeria with Middle Eastern spice smells and some Middle Eastern art works on the walls.  The pictures say a lot about the atmosphere of the place, not ambiance, but atmosphere.  The pictures in the frames are super weathered and look as if they have been through a really bad rain storm.  Expect it to be humid and sort of warm.

There's sort of waiter service but not really.  The waiter service was just one of the guys behind the counter.  Don't expect service to be good.

The service is very slow.  For drinks we got water and cold mint tea.  The best thing is there is a little tiny cooler filled with ice next to the drinks on the left hand side of the restaurant towards the counter area.  That's where they scoop out the ice!  It was pretty silly and I had a good laugh.

We ordered falafel as an appetizer, which I would not recommend.  Dry, underseasoned and actually pretty small portion for how much you pay.

The sandwich and plates on the other hand are quite a deal with pretty sizeable portions but the food itself is really just average.  The plate comes with the meat you chose, a small salad and hummus or baba ghanoush.

Would definitely come back but to try the pizzas people rave about or get another plate."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2020-05-08,5.0,"Hands down the best coffee in New York City! Their service is usually fast and friendly. Their lattes are the best I've had in the city and has cute art on it, too. Their food is also equally delicious! They have been serving delivery lunch to nearby apartment buildings during the quarantine - thanks so much!"
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2020-03-05,4.0,"One of my go-to coffee shops in the area! Great vibes, good coffee with cute latte art with every cup. 

I'd say their matcha latte can do with a bit more matcha flavor. I had their chocolate chip cookie for the first time today. I've been eyeing it forever, it looks like it came straight out of a pinterest post! Delicious as expected, I wish I asked to warm it up or something.

Given the location, they usually have a lot of people having business chats in the morning through mid-afternoon so it's hard to find seats."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2020-02-28,1.0,"ETA - Go to Financier instead. It is delicious and true real NYC service! Just down the street are several locations. Great croissants. Almond croissant is delicious, worth the similar price, larger and more almond than just a pathetic landing strip of almond butter down the center.

Didn't think the food was that great, nor the seasonal coffee. Serves me right for trying a seasonal thing when I usually drink regular coffee. The croissants were not worth it. Especially for $6+. The ham and cheese one costs more and one sad little slice of ham. They were mostly crust, grease and air. Most of it ended up in flakes on my plate.

And the ambivalent, ""sigh,"" I work at a ""fancy"" coffee shop kind of attitude. People, you can keep that sh$t for your next failed audition. I am a NYer and I've put my time in the service industry so I know what it is like. Real New Yorkers are not a$$holes like you are playing at and pretending to be. As it says on the receipts ""Good luck out there"" to you. You're going to need it. And if you are a native New Yorker, shame on you for acting like schmucks in the way you represent us... No one should be icy and dismissive like that, period.

One star for a clean bathroom and holding the door open."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2020-01-15,3.0,"Black Fox coffee is a little small store that sells drinks and pastries as well. It's also in the financial district in New York. This was not the first time ordering here and it was pretty busy but the drinks are made pretty quickly.

I just ordered an espresso shot because I was on the go. There were some seats at the communal table but none that had a small separate tables. 

The inside is nice and pretty clean and the smell of coffee is pretty alluring. If you need a coffee fix and you are close by, this place is what you need."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-10-06,5.0,"Found out about this place through our accommodation (Sonder on 20th Broad Street). They advertised it as the best coffee shop in lower Manhattan. That's a tall order in NYC, the city with a specialty coffee shop on every corner. We gave it a shot on our last day there and it was so good that we had coffee there twice in the span of 6 hours.

The place has a very nice interior with plenty of seating and great ambiance music. They coffee, pastries and also offer a decent variety of breakfast/brunch food. 
 
The butter croissants looked so good that we couldn't resist, so we each got one. For drinks we each got a latte. The way it works is you order, get a number for your table and they bring your coffee / food to you. An exception to the rule is that the pastry was served to us on a plate by the person taking our order.

I like this system as I often go for coffee for a conversation and I like not having to pay attention to a name being called out.

The croissant was delicious, flaky on the outside, buttery and rich, it paired well with the coffee.

The latte had perfect art, very well defined lines on the very even crema canvas. Really good job. The taste was magnificent. They also use high quality milk that added a nice mouthfeel and sweetness to the drink.

I loved the fact that they had a large variety of great coffees from roasters all across the US. They even had Ritual coffee, one of the roasters I enjoy in California.

This is a great coffee shop that you should try when in Manhattan, I'm sure you will enjoy it!"
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2020-05-17,5.0,"Best Lattes in NYC hands down! This has been my saving grace since FIKA closed down. I don't know how they do it but it is just that much better than Starbucks, la colombe, etc... I wish they had one near my office! The foam artwork also gets major points"
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-12-22,5.0,"Fully loaded coffee shop in the financial district. Coffee is the cornerstone and scrumptious breakfast bites/sweets are the bonus. Rotating brews from the US and Canada make the daily coffee a little more interesting.

For breakfast, the overnight oats are sweet with a nice cinnamon kick. The breakfast slider with egg, bacon and mustard is a great choice, but even better the smoked salmon sandwich is super rich! For dessert, the brownies are chocolatey and wonderful, pumpkin cake bursting with flavour and pastries are buttery heaven.

Quick and attentive service makes this a must for a quick stop or for a longer sit down coffee chat."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-11-08,4.0,"The 85 Broad Street location is private si this review is for them. Coffee and food always great, but the price is a bit high for the portions.i miss tge kale Crest salad. You will enjoy the barista's cappucino and steamed milk designs."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2020-01-24,4.0,"Great coffee and small bites if you work in FiDi. Never too busy and they've got ample place to sit, if meeting a friend or colleague"
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-02-24,4.0,"Love their matcha latte with oat milk (yes, they use Oatly). The matcha is always smooth, and it doesn't come out too lukewarm. The lids on their to go cups are also pretty cool, the way they are constructed doesn't let your coffee spill all over the place when a little splashes onto the lid. 

Their cookies are huge, amazing, and just melt in your mouth. What also melts in your mouth, in a less fun way, are the paper straws they use here. I know they are more environmentally friendly, but someone really needs to invent a paper straw that doesn't immediately become papier-mâché if you take more than 30 seconds to finish your iced coffee. The other disappointing thing I had here was the banana bread. So dry and too sweet. 

The space, on the 30th floor of the WeWork at 85 Broad, is really spacious and beautiful. I've also never seen it crowded. Wish I worked in this building, because it would be an awesome place for meetings or lunch, but it's frankly too much a hassle to get in (you have to sign in with security on the ground floor) for me to come here every day."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2018-12-06,1.0,"Stopped in because I was hungry and wanted a quick bite. The few menu items I was interested in unfortunately had pork in them so I could not partake. So sad. Instead, I went with a flat white and a brownie after reading all the great reviews. Yes, I replaced lunch with a brownie. That's what being a grown up is all abou

Service was good and timely. Pretty disappointed with the brownie. Other reviews said it was half rich chocolatey/half cake like. Sadly mine was not. I was so excited too because there was only one left and I got the last one. When I bit into my brownie, I found that it was extremely fudgey and not brownie/cake like at all. The 2 ingredients I tasted most was oil and sugar, not rich chocolate. So. Sad. I didn't finish it and ended up throwing more than half of it away! Yes, I threw chocolate away. A travesty, I know. And I think I paid like $3 for it.. T___T for my flat white and brownie, I paid about $9. Coffee didn't strike me as anything outstanding, and a bit bitter for my tastes. Probably wouldn't return here unless I happen to be walking by and in dire need of caffeine."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-07-20,4.0,"Good coffee, nice atmosphere, kind servers, and really good bakery and healthy snack options. 
It's a bit hidden inside the building, and that's what make it a great gem so far."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-12-26,5.0,"Great little coffee shop. The service was very friendly, quick, and efficient. The person taking the order was very helpful and clear when I asked questions about the different coffees. I got the butterscotch latte with oat milk and it's really delicious. My boyfriend got a latte, no complaints! We ordered a croissant which was good but nothing to rave about. Overall, definitely enjoyed it and would recommend!"
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-04-03,2.0,"It's just ok. There is nothing redeeming about this place. Cold brew is their only defining product but for nothing else justifies their  exorbitant prices.

The oat milk they have used, consistently chunks at the bottom of the cup. The iced green tea is more like green tea flavored water. If they run out of green tea, they just pour water into your cup, I have seen this.
 
The shop is their best asset, the products, not so much.
I would take my money to La Colombe which is just on the other side of the Deutsche Bank lobby doors on Wall."

Cute environment, cozy setting, convenient location. Consider this spot the next time you need coffee and/or a snack. This spot blends an ""on-the-go"" vibe with an enjoyable cafe feel.

I enjoyed a tasty hot chocolate - the space was a bit loud at the time (late afternoon on a workday), but not loud enough that you can't hear who you're talking to."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2020-02-19,4.0,"Love this spot. Bit pricier than typical cafes (for example, $14 breakfast burrito)...however, interesting drinks and a good atmosphere. Recommend the vanilla date latte + frittata"
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-10-19,1.0,"Updating review to specifically comment on the breakfast burrito, which was almost inedible. The wrap is semi-cold, the eggs looked like they came out of a factory processor (was it even fresh?) and the beans were undercooked. All for $14 plus tax and tip. Ridiculous."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-03-28,4.0,"There are a lot of coffee shops in the area, this might be my new favorite choice. My husband is a coffee drinker and I'm all about matcha, Black Fox is one of the few that does both well! Also, I highly recommend their homemade nut milk. I was skeptical at first (like ok are you just trying to rip me off and use some Trader Joe's almond milk up in here??) but it really does taste like a mix of nuts without being overpowering. I prefer my drinks ""to stay"" here as there is a lot of seating but they also have to-go cups. Gotta day the but milk is better hot and fresh in my opinion."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2018-08-20,5.0,"I stopped by again for a sit down experience.  There was plenty of space for diners on a early Sunday afternoon, and I grabbed one of their summer menu items, the breakfast burrito, to try.  The interior remained relatively quiet but busy throughout our stay, which maintained the perfect balance between ""too noisy to work"" and ""so quiet it's awkward."" As per other Yelp reviewers, I did witness one patron get asked to move to the ""laptop only"" section, which despite the ""inconvenience"" to the laptop customer, really does facilitate conversation and engagement at the non-laptop tables.  

The burrito itself was quite delicious, though decidedly different that a standard breakfast burrito of a traditionally Mexican bent.   While this burrito did in fact come in a tortilla, and with guacamole, this is where the clear Mexican similarities ended.  The pineapple salsa added a burst of freshness to the somewhat oily nduja (an Italian spicy pork spread that truly did add an appreciable spice to the burrito).  The patatas bravas weren't readily identifiable, and the included herbs added another layer of unique flavor to the burrito.  The eggs were not overcooked or dry, thankfully.  At $12.50, it is on the more expensive side of breakfast item, but it is certainly filling and the quality does not disappoint.  

My one somewhat curious observation is that it is clear those at Black Fox can cook, and it is clear that offering food seems to be a goal of the shop.  The kitchen, however, seems very small, or lacking in equipment, to really unleash the cooking potential at Black Fox.  Perhaps this is an effort to keep it more coffee shop than brunch location, which I can't quibble with, but I'd love to see the cooking potential released at some point.  Regardless, thanks again for another great experience Black Fox!"
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-07-20,4.0,"My favorite coffee place in the Financial District...so far. It's a great place to meet with hip industrial decor, high ceilings and a variety of seating options. Nice logo and branding. You order at the counter but if you're dining in they'll give you a table number.

I go here for the oat milk lattes. They've got a variety of snacks (including lamingtons!) and fancy toasts and such, but I'm yet to try. On occasion I found the oat milk wasn't quite hot enough. I've started asking for extra hot and it's been fine since then.

They lose a star for two reasons:
1) It's pricey. An oat milk latte is over $6 and even more with a tip.
2) The loyalty card is double sided so employees have stamped on both. Does it take twice as long to get a free one then? I tried downloading their app but I didn't *get it* and thus deleted."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-02-04,4.0,"I had a work meeting here recently, and during the work day, there are lots of working/financial folks constantly rotating in and out of the door. If you walk in during just an off time, you unfortunately may not get a seat despite the shop's relatively ample seating. But if you hang around long enough, there should be a place to grab a spot. I had the short mac (which I don't think I've ever tried before), and a tiny lil cup of espresso it was, haha--even w/a 'lil fox on the small plate. It hit the spot, and was good coffee. 

If you're in the area and need a place to meet someone for a bit, get caffeinated--it's a good spot. Maybe a work meeting. But getting work done, nah. Too much hustle and bustle in this place--at least when I was there on a Monday afternoon."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2020-01-25,3.0,Very cute store. But everything was made incorrectly. Used the incorrect dairy milk and also made my wife severely ill.
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-08-03,4.0,One of my go-to places around my office for tea. They have great green tea. I don't drink coffee so I can't comment on the coffee. They are always very friendly. Sometimes it takes a while but it all depends on how busy they are. They have comfortable seating around the entire shop.
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-05-09,2.0,"Black Fox is your standard issue hip coffee shop but absurdly pricey. Should a eggs and cheese on toast cost $11? Should a breakfast burrito cost $13? Should regular drip coffee cost more than $3.50, or $4+ if you get nondairy milk? Should a small salad cost $14? I think not. In fact, I refuse. Go elsewhere."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-12-21,4.0,"Cute interior. Really solid cappuccino with house-made nut milk. 

Overnight oats were disappointing-WAY too sweet and not the healthy option I was hoping for. Felt like it was trying to appeal to someone who wanted a pastry but had gone with oats so they just threw in a bunch of sugar. Couldn't finish."

175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2019-05-15,4.0,"Absolutely love their Filtered Coffee. The taste is wonderful without the acidity. Their menu is fresh and has good options.

Pretty large and has small tables to sit and enjoy your beverage/food. I see plenty of people taking meetings here or working on their laptop!"
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2017-09-11,4.0,"Black Fox Coffee makes a good pot of coffee, and it better be at $3.50 for a small.

The exquisite Art Deco building at 70 Pine provides a backdrop fit for a high powered film noir meeting over hushed tones with hell bent urgency, and that'll be exactly how you'll feel with all the Wall St pretension of working lap toppers.  

It's a scene, and you can be apart of it at the cost of $8 for a breakfast sandwich or $4 for a muffin, think of it as a built in cover charge or the subtle wrath of fire from a voluptuous femmes fatale.

175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2018-08-02,2.0,"The cup of coffee is see-through, not a good sign. It's indeed as weak as I thought it'd be based on the translucent liquid. The cold brew is slightly better with maybe two shades darker brown compared to the drip. It also was a smidgen better in flavor, definitely less acidic than some coffee shops found across the boroughs. Flat white was better than anything we ordered so that's a plus. 

They had to close early due to a staff meeting, which is rather odd to do but it's their turf so fiiiiiine. Place wasn't selling good coffee anyway so it wasn't tragic that we had to leave. What is tragic is the brew. Basically I was lead down this path in search of an excellent cup of coffee, but alas, I was lead down with lies."

It can get really freaking busy and crowded inside due to the neighborhood and the proximity of its location to the Wall Street 2/3 subway exit. I love the Acadia (sp?) pastry here. Absolutely to die for, like a croissant fell in love with a hazelnut granola bar. It can be a little pricey -- but that's FiDi for you. You can only work on your laptop at the tiny counter up at the front by the window, which I think has 6 seats which can fill up fast. So if you are looking for a place to work for a while, be aware you may not find a seat here. But definitely worth checking out! Can't wait to head here for a weekend brunch--'cause the menu looks lit."
175,black-fox-coffee-new-york,2018-06-03,4.0,"Not my first choice. Charged extra $1.25 to substitute cappuccino with almond milk.....geez. I did not know they would charge so much, let alone charge at all!  ($5.75 for cappuccino with almond milk....) Pastries slightly over priced. Cute place, nice decor. Just that options are limited at 10am on Sunday in this area, and thus, sometimes very crowded

It's a 3.5 for me, but I'll be generous, since they are generally nice here."

They also serve a fire breakfast, I highly recommend the avocado toast with bacon, eggs, and chili oil. It's amazing. 

There's also mad seating and has a buzzing vibe that's never too loud, so it's great to do a quick coffee meeting or get some work done"

I figured that the guy must be serious about his craft to be outside all day, hauling around an espresso machine, trying to compete with some of the nearby coffee shops.

I've been exploring the SoHo / NoLita coffee scene for the better part of 2 months now and Peddler has some of the best tasting espresso around. The espresso in my Cortados and Flat Whites have an unexpected sweet and complex flavor that other spots lack. They are stocking Lofted Coffee, a small roasting operation out of Brooklyn, and everything I've had is top notch. There are pastries and toast with jam / butter available here now as well, if you are in to that sort of thing for a breakfast treat.

The baristas are friendly, the cart is clean (and recently upgraded!), the lines are short and the coffee... so good. What more could you ask for?"

The two men manning the cart were both very pleasant and were obviously enjoying themselves. The one tiny critique I had is that my flat white was made to taste like a small latte. A flat white is not a small latte. Instead of holding back all of the froth and pouring in liquid milk (as was done here), a flat white should have a mix of both milk and the micro-foam which comes from a free pour."
176,peddler-new-york-3,2013-05-06,5.0,"If you want an amazing espresso or latte you need to find this gourmet coffee cart.  It is the real deal, as good as stumptown or blue bottle but at this point it is a secret just steps from times square.  There are only 2 options, espresso or latte and they only come in one size.  For those of you looking for some kind of venti ridiculous coffee drink with weird syrups.....don't come here.  This is all about quality and flavor using the best beans and organic milk you can get.  He even uses compostable cups and lids if you care for the environment.  I keep running down there because it is right near where I work.  One other thing, it won't be super hot, if you're somone who has to have a scalding cup of coffee, this isn't for you either.  Like no other cart in the city."
176,peddler-new-york-3,2013-05-14,5.0,"Just when I had given up on great coffee in midtown I come across fiend coffee, it's as good as it gets in the city and regardless of cart size the quality and freshness of the beans are amazing. 

It's now my twice daily and every cup has been delicious, don't expect a ""double tall mocha mint slice"" but do expect ""awesome""."
176,peddler-new-york-3,2013-05-14,5.0,"Need a moment of caffeinated respite from the bustle of Midtown? Fiend Coffee makes top-notch espresso and lattes in their cart. No fuss, no bells and whistles, just great coffee for people who enjoy coffee."
176,peddler-new-york-3,2016-03-08,5.0,The best macchiato and cortado I have been ever tried. Definitely worth to stop by for a quality coffee.
176,peddler-new-york-3,2013-05-30,5.0,"Best place to get coffee in midtown? Must be!

Note: all organic, and compostable cups!"
176,peddler-new-york-3,2013-09-06,4.0,"I walked by one morning on my way to Culture Espresso Bar and the espresso machine in the cart caught my eye. I have to say, I've never noticed espresso drinks served in a cart in NYC before. As I came back from Culture, I noticed a sign that said Counter Culture Coffee and got really confused and resolved to give this a try. I ordered a latte and have to say I'm impressed and will come back for another try although I don't know if it will be around for the winter. Definitely better than Starbucks though."

i always try to stop by for an espresso and milk whenever i'm in the neighborhood, it's very smooth and aromatic, fave coffee shop around for sure!"
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2020-01-14,4.0,"This place I visited by recommendation of my good friend. 
It's as small but comfortable coffee spot with chill atmosphere. They have a great selection of different coffees and drinks. My cappuccino was great with a deep and strong espresso flavor. Baristas are very helpful and kind. 
The prices are a bit high but it's normal for this part of the city.
Unfortunately dogs are not allowed at this location."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2019-08-17,5.0,"One of the staple reliable coffee shops in the East Village.  Excellent strong iced coffee that will get you through the summer days. Been coming here for years, grab a coffee and go across the street and dog watch at Tompkins Square Park."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2018-10-08,4.0,"Ninth Street Espresso can be found on 10th Street of course. It's across the street from Tompkins Square Park. This is just around the library in East Village. It's a small place. They only have a few seats so go early if you have to. 

I like this better than going to chains. It's always better to buy local. They have a pretty simple menu. Literally it has coffee and espresso. The medium hot coffee is about $3.50, which is a good deal around here. It has a long bench to sit at. The sweetening of the coffee is all done by you, putting in the milks and sweeteners. 

Inside is nice but this isn't the best place to do work. It's pretty noisy. The coffee machines are loud, and so are the employees yelling."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2018-08-25,4.0,"Very simple, straight-forward menu. I stopped in for an iced coffee after brunch (can you believe the brunch place I went to didn't serve iced coffee?!). This coffee shop surprisingly has a lot of space, but they just have seats along the sides of the wall (benches to the left), high chairs with a bar table to the right. They also have the milk, cup covers and straws in the middle of the table, for whatever reason. They do have a lot of great options to choose from: liquid sugar, vanilla flavoring, etc. Just a little odd how it is right in the middle of the seating area. 

I take my coffee black and it was delicious. Very strong and full-bodied, which I love. I'd definitely be back again if I'm in the area!"
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2019-09-30,5.0,I love the espresso with milk at ninth street espresso. It's the perfect creamy smooth coffee. I also like the baristas - they're efficient yet friendly. Couldn't ask for more.
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2019-09-07,3.0,"No Almond milk. Not now, not ever. Coffee is less then standard for a shop specializing in it. And ironically the staff is standard for the genre.  Disappointing, but not completely dissatisfied. If I'm in a dead pinch I'll go but I wouldn't frequent the brand and I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to make it to any of the locations."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2019-12-29,1.0,Ordered a cappuccino but I might as well have ordered steamed milk. The barista is more focused on chatting than actually making a decent cup of coffee. Save yourself the trouble and go to one of their other nearby locations. Super disappointing considering this chain of coffee is usually one of my favorites. Bonus: no bathroom at this location.
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2018-11-20,3.0,"Cozy atmosphere. Lots of seating and although there were plenty people waiting, the drinks were being made quickly. I ordered a mocha latte and I found it to be okay. The latte was pretty bitter and all the chocolate was not stirred properly. Anyway, I will come back next time and try out more of the coffee menu."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2019-06-01,1.0,Good coffee but servers have a my sh_t don't stink attitude. Lousy service and always expecting a tip for an already overpriced coffee. 10 year customer who has had enough of it.
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2019-02-06,5.0,Three bucks even for the best cup of coffee in the neighborhood. Yup. Doesn't hurt that they have wifi and space to get a bit of work done too.
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2019-01-10,4.0,"Ninth Street is a super cute little cafe with only a few options on the menu. I typically get an espresso and iced coffee, both of which are great quality. The seating is very limited but great for a to-go cup."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2017-01-10,4.0,"My friend and I were looking for a cafe in the East Village, and we decided to visit Ninth Street Espresso given its proximity and good Yelp reviews.  I was struck by the simplicity of the menu, which just listed 4 items; hot/cold coffee, espresso, and espresso with milk.  I must admit that I was a bit confused (does ""espresso with milk"" mean something in particular?), but after speaking with a staff person, I got a sense on how the simplified ordering system works.  I actually found the streamlined menu to be refreshing compared to other coffee shops.

I ordered a latte, which I thought was well-made and tasty! Given the many people typing away on their computers, it looks like this cafe is a popular work space."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2019-01-20,5.0,Easily one of the best lattes in the city. Hands. down. Baristas are friendly and the milk is always steamed correctly which seems hard to find these days.
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2018-12-05,4.0,"Simple menu. Great coffee. Quick and easy for a flavorful, neighborhood cup of Joe. Not much seating so good for a grab and go cup."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2018-12-11,5.0,"Recently started coming here as I now work near by. I've had a few different items - espresso, iced coffee, brewed coffee. All have been great. I only wish they'd list more on the menu so I know the pricing and offerings. Now that I've been here a few times I know the gist of how it goes, but the first time I definitely felt boxed into one of three items listed.

Side note - anyone else think it's funny this location is on 10th street?"
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2014-09-21,3.0,"With a friend on a late Sunday afternoon who is savvy with directions we still got lost.  Named after a street but it does not help when there are multiple locations in Manhattan.  I opt for an ice tea at $3.00 while my friend opt for the standard coffee for $2.50.  It is a quaint coffee house to lounge on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  No couches to lounge but a bench and tables for the tech gadgets to lean on.  Decor is the black and white sheath.

Ninth Street Espresso's staff and service is woeful, indeed.  Upon ordering and then requesting a receipt the response was snide and callous hiss.  Unacceptable hospitality in the service industry.

Note:  No facilities exist in this coffee house."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2016-08-22,4.0,"Came here for an iced coffee since it had pretty solid reviews on yelp and was close to home. Have passed by this place a dozen of times and it has always seemed to be a popular spot, always seeing tons of people coming out with a cup of coffee. It wasn't until I yelped the place that I found out they are a chain. I always thought this was a free standing local coffee shop. Their menu is very basic and simplistic, only a couple of items to order from. The store also sells things like coffee filters, etc. Coffee was good, it was very rich in flavor. Not your watered down coffee like dunkn donuts. It was a good cup of coffee with enough caffeine to start your day."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2017-03-06,2.0,"Love love love the coffee! Two starts for that...but even the delicious coffee is overshadowed by the nonchalant service. I moved to the area a year ago and am here 3 or 4 times a week and every time I come to this location  it leaves me wondering why I bother.
Some (not all) of the staff here need a serious attitude check...acting like it's an inconvenience for them to take my order. 
I like the original local on 9th st much better. More choice of pastries, much bigger and typically friendlier staff. 
Customer service is dead here. They are more interested in taking inappropriately about their weekend than interacting with the customer."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2017-04-22,5.0,"I'm more of a flavored coffee kind of girl, so I was a little put off by their 3 item menu. However, their own roasts are excellent, and I really enjoyed my latte. The guys behind the counter were super friendly as well. Great location too, looking right out over Tompkins Square Park. There's free wifi, so I would definitely come back to do school work. They also have great music playing!"
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2017-04-30,5.0,"Great local coffee shop! The staff was very friendly and the coffee is great! I got an iced coffee ($3.50) They also have a rewards program, do you should pick up a card if you're a local ;) It's also right by the park, so it's easy to pick up a cup of coffee and walk around the park. It was the perfect start to my morning!"
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2015-04-10,4.0,"Ninth Street Espresso is some of my favorite coffee in all of East Village/Alphabet city. Not sure where there beans are sourced, but part of me really doesn't care. A good cup of coffee is a good cup of coffee whether it comes from Ecuador, Colombia, or a wombat's backside in Bali. 

They've got a real minimalist vibe going on. A couple of bar stools for sipping to stay, a few art pieces, some Ninth Street swag like coffee cups and whole beans, and that's about it. Throw in a few baked treats and a nice view of Tompkins Square Park and it's a simple recipe for success.

Speaking of baked treats, they have something called a colon blow muffin that seems to make its way to the menu on weekends. I'm assuming it's a quirky way of describing a bran muffin, but nothing about that sounds appealing. I hope someone who's tried it can prove me wrong. If you're having trouble getting things moving, I suggest you ditch the Pepto Bismol and give this holisitic alternative a shot."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2018-02-03,1.0,"A seemingly nice, neighborhood coffee shop located near the Tompkins Square dog park.  I dropped by for the first time for a quick to-go coffee on my way to the park and was told dogs are not allowed.  I happily took my business to Starbucks around the corner.  It would be cool if this small, neighborhood business acted like one."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2018-06-30,2.0,"Don't start your day with a coffee from this place. Worst customer service, attitude and too much negative energy. Oh and their coffee cup lids leak"
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2018-03-24,5.0,"If you're looking for a good coffee in the Chelsea Market, definitely stop by here! They only have a couple of combinations to choose from, so it's easy to make up your mind. We tried the espresso with milk, yum!"
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2018-03-11,3.0,"I've been here many times on Sunday mornings because my normal coffee shop doesn't open until noon on Sundays. The coffee is delicious but the baristas just aren't friendly like I'm used to elsewhere. They could earn much more of my business if they just cracked a smile, made customers feel a little more welcome, etc... 

Price point is high enough for me to notice it and also high enough to also keep me from coming here more frequently. If prices go any higher, I imagine I'll try somewhere else for my Sunday morning coffee."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2017-09-19,5.0,"BLUF: Better and more simple than your local Starbucks. There are several coffee shops like this around the NYC area but this hole in the wall shop was excellent. Their menu was simple, and the atmosphere was inviting and cozy. I ordered a small latte - they made it to perfection, how a latte should be made. It didn't have any extra fluff nor did it seem to be hastily made without care like some other big chain coffee shops. The staff and barista were also extremely accommodating and friendly. I would definitely come here in the future on another NYC trip and recommend others to come by here as well. You won't regret it!"
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2015-12-11,5.0,"I love this little spot. The espresso with milk and the muffin I had today were delicious and although the service is a bit subdued, I found them to be just the right amount of friendly. I worked there for a few hours this morning and I felt welcomed and it wasn't crazy busy like many of the other local coffee shops. The wifi also worked well. 

Most of the negative reviews here are related to the service. The service I received was efficient, polite and friendly but low-key. What else are people expecting? Cartwheels and a marching band?"

177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2015-05-11,3.0,"Let me start with what really is the heart of this place's award winning coffee:
The machines. Built, no doubt, by elves with proclivities in brushed metal, engineering, and espresso, producing the finest coffee a sleepy idiot like me can ask for.

After being told ""could you get out of the way? ((gestures and scrunches face disparagingly))"" while waiting directly in front of the register for a second too long, a thought crossed my mind. Maybe, just maybe, that this man could of said something more like ""If you wouldn't mind stepping to the side, we just have some people waiting to order.""


I'm skeptical in ascribing the delicious result to the curmudgeonly barista staff. Let's be real, I would be happier served by an android with no enabled emotional settings."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2015-12-10,4.0,"Good coffee with a side of grumpiness. 

This is the best coffee, I really love the reg drip and the cappuccino! But, the guys that work here (this location, not the one off C and 9th) are always so forlorn.... 

Maybe they need some espresso shots?"
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2014-07-10,2.0,"Coffee is good.

Service is woeful. A place where it is acceptable to be indifferent, actually scrap that. A place were it's OK to be borderline rude mingled with elitest to customers.

Go to BoxKite, far superior coffee and choice and down to earth service. They actually are genuine and not on some silly coffee elitism ego trip."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2014-07-18,3.0,"Decent coffee, great iced teas in the summer months. I often go to this location because it's near my M8 bus stop. 

They don't do decaf unless you want a decaf americano--as do most places. This is too bad, because decaf espresso--which is what it is: espresso beans ground and brewed as a pour-over--gets me wired.

There's no restroom, but I never stay in; most people are getting their coffee to take to the dog run or parts unknown. They also offer delicious-looking baked goods, which are never, ever vegan. (One star off for that.)

I go here or their original, accurately-named store on 9th street and either place will punch my card. It's a win-win!

Oh yeah: we had a friend who lived here before it was made into a commercial storefront. It's actually a better store than an apartment, according to my roommate; it's kind of tiny to live in."
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2016-09-09,1.0,"The coffee is hit and miss in this place combined with the bad attitude from the cashier on Friday morning, I thank the Lord for Abraços friendly staff and an exceptional product. Not coming back here anytime soon!"

Of course, I'm a card carrying member for life. I walk in and its a small place. Its close to lunch so I wanna grab a latte, maybe a cookie, work and relax.

Well, this place is small and there is a plug for my laptop all the way up front. I see a dude with a power strip and he has plugged into it:

His laptop
His printer
His iPhone
His Waffle iron

I'm like, dude! Sharing is caring. Lemme plug in my iStuffs as well.

Love it here!"
177,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-7,2015-12-22,1.0,"Today's Tuesday morning crew clearly needed coffee themselves. Incredibly rude and self absorbed bunch of children. Firstly, they just ignore you after talking to them (anybody home? Apparently too cool for school for us). After ordering one regular and one low fat latte, I asked which of the two was the normal one. Response ""this one is paranormal"". So....I asked if they are making fun of me for not saying ""regular"". Their first honest moment of the day in response: ""yes"". In the end, the coffee wasn't any good either. Grow up, get your act together, we are paying and friendly customers. If you don't like customers, you might want to change careers .

178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2020-02-22,5.0,"I had been a longtime fan of High Street's kouign-amann (which are delectable; I prefer the original), and I finally made it in for dinner with a group of friends.

We had an amazing time! Since we were a group of six, we ordered a mix of appetizers, pizzas, pastas and the burger--and shared everything.

Some highlights: I love tahini, so I was partial to the roasted maitake mushroom appetizer. We ordered both the lamb fettuccini ragu and the squid ink spaccatelli, both of which were cooked perfectly and delicious. 

Now onto the pizza: the crust is OUTSTANDING. (No surprise since High Street has a renowned bakery program.) I'm typically a margherita type gal, but my one friend insisted on the pesto pizza, and tbh, that one may be my overall favorite.

It's a really cute space in a terrific location. The open kitchen brings energy and the service is warm and attentive. I'm definitely heading back for brunch soon."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-10-15,4.0,"Lovely lovely lovely!

We were seeking out a brunch spot on a Saturday near the Whitney, and decided on High Street because of its popularity.  I tried to make a reservation earlier that morning, but nothing was available on short notice.  Arriving just after noon, we found out the wait would be about 45 minutes.  Our actual wait time was closer to 30 minutes, which was a pleasant surprise.

Because High Street is known for their homemade breads, we both decided to try their avocado tartine.  The bread is a Danish rye bread made with different seeds, grains, and cracked rye; the $18 dish looks a little wimpy at first, but the incredibly dense bread will keep you feeling full for a long, long time.  The watermelon radish added a bright pop of color and the soft-boiled egg was cooked perfectly (although my friend's was overcooked).  We also tried a couple of the brunch cocktails--a  spritz and a Bloody Mary, both delicious.

My only complaint is that the service is on the slow side.  After placing our orders each time (1x for food and 2x for drinks), it took upwards of 20-30 minutes for anything to be brought out.  It wasn't a big deal since Saturday brunch isn't meant to be rushed, but I still found it perplexing that avocado toast would take so long."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-10-18,4.0,"I scoped a lot of breakfast menus, because the opportunity cost of great breakfast in NYC is high, and landed on High Street on Hudson because of the pumpkin french toast.

When we rolled up, I thought we were in luck because there were plenty of open tables, but we had about a 25 minute wait until they texted us our table was ready. I think they must have been short staffed because it took forever to get our food. Unfortunately our waiter never checked in to update us, but the manager (?) noticed we had been waiting a while and got things in to motion. She also brought us a cinnamon roll to go as an apology (and the cardamom in it made for a pretty good apology). We paid right then to avoid another long wait.

So once I got my french toast, I was ready to dig in! The corners weren't terribly exciting, but the dense interior was super moist, not eggy, and the perfect consistency. Unfortunately I detected 0% pumpkin flavor, but it was still a good order of french toast. My husband had the bialy lox sandwich with a side of pickled veggies, we he described as unmistakeably not a bagel and enjoyed. I was also interested in trying their kouign amann but by late morning they were all sold out, so come early for that."

They didn't have a wide selection of pastries, but they looked delicious. I almost got the cardamom cinnamon roll, but decided to play it safe and got the chocolate chip cookie. The guy helping me out was quick and decently friendly. The cookie itself was actually very delicious! Soft and chewy with a nice touch of sea salt on the top."

My wife ordered the big breakfast- meatpacker. She raved about the bacon. Loved the bread too! Greens were delicious.
We had an everything bagel, which was great.
Scone w/ pear marmalade was not too sweet- top notch.
I had the bodega- biscuit was delicious. I'm from the south so I know good biscuits. This was a great biscuit.
Looking forward to returning!
Service was good too."

Black sesame was good though.

Definitely coming back for the pastries. They all looked so good, especially the black sesame kouign amann.

High Street is on tons of Eater's list for brunches and the girlfriends and I decided to try it out. The breakfast sandwiches are the best. I got the forager and someone else in the party got the bodega. Both eggcellent in their eggy way. The braised green was the highlight in the forager while they could be more generous with the mushroom, my side sausage made up. 

However, the service was seriously lacking from our server Haley P. She had no smiles and gave off a negative vibe the whole time we were there. When asked to put in an additional order of potatoes, she seemed bother. Did not bring a spoon for my friend's yogurt. We ended up asking the host to check on our food as we were not checked on ever. Our water carafe ran dried and was never replaced. Our bill was wrong. 

Additionally, I ordered a orange poppyseed almond cake to go and ask her to set it aside while we initially put in the order and she completely forgot. So I went up to the pastry/coffee section and ordered it myself. She saw me doing it and decided to ignore it. No apologies, nothing. 

Some people are not meant to be in hospitality. If you need a part time job and do not enjoy making other people feel welcomed and happy by your present, please reconsider being in the service industry."

1. The cinnamon cardamom roll and
2. The sesame kouge Aman

I could eat these every day. Fluffy, perfectly frosted, delicately sweetened and rolled. Incredible. The sesame is more savory than the bun so I like to tell myself the combo makes a well-balanced breakfast. 

The sandwiches? They're alright. Four stars. I'm not a fan of the sausage in the egg sandwich and will swap it out for bacon next time (tastes like cheap, meaty McDonalds sausage). The farmers sandwich with kale and mushrooms is very good for a veggie sandwich, though the kale is pretty bitter.

Comin' back for those pastries.

5 stars!!!!!!"
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2020-02-09,4.0,"Come here for two reasons, really - the kouign amann, which is baked by angels, and the crispy potatoes that come in a bowl glazed with mayo.  Everything else, as far as breakfast goes, you can probably make as good as home.  Service can be hit or miss, and the room can be a little uncomfortable.  We have never tried lunch or dinner."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-04-09,4.0,"This was great, and the service was perfect. (It was less than perfect in our previous visit.)

This time, we got the cinnamon cardamom roll, a spelt score, the Bodega, and the Jersey Girl. Both pastries were great -- we probably preferred the cinnamon roll, but we also didn't finish it because it was so heavy. We really liked both sandwiches as well -- both were also very heavy, and I think next time around I'd love to the bagel board and/or the high street leo.

Anyway, really solid brunch spot and no wait at 11am on a Sunday, which seemed almost impossible for this neighborhood."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-10-27,4.0,"I had a lovely dinner here on a Friday night. It was trendy but not overly loud, and we were able to get a late reservation (9pm) last minute. The waiter wasn't able to advise on the drink menu, but I was happy with my choice of a grapefruit spritz. We started with charcuterie--yummy meats, mustard, cornichon pickles, and crusty bread--which was tasty. The labne was delicious--a fresh yogurt spread topped with roasted squash and seeds, served with warm flatbread (which they offered a free refill of). The charred broccoli wasn't really charred, but it did taste good, topped with water chestnuts and peanuts. My boyfriend enjoyed the Brussels sprouts gratin, served in a mini skillet and baked with lots of cheese. Overall, we had a nice meal."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2020-03-13,5.0,One of my new favorites spots in NYC for breakfast now! Everything was just so tasty! Very charming and bright place to hangout with friends or by yourself !
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-03-12,4.0,"Arrived here on a Saturday morning with no reservation for brunch. Luckily only a twenty minute wait for a party of two, which they take your number down and text when the table is about ready. 

Fairly cozy inside, with a portion dedicated for to-go coffee orders. Lots of good options on the menu which is slightly different from what shows on the website. Started off sharing the Spelt Scone ($4.50) - a dense baked item topped off by a sweet pear marmalade. Would be heavy for one person, but easy to finish off with two people. For the main course, opted for the Bodega Sandwich ($16) and beer ($9). The Bodega is another hefty offering of eggs, cheese, sausage and gravy inside a buttered biscuit. Lots of flavor and certainly filling, could barely get to the side salad it comes with. Also tried the Old Bay Potatoes ($6) - which are giant cut fried wedges served with a garlic aioli. Felt the potatoes were a bit undercooked, so couldn't finish any more than half the offering.

Service is quick and they offered hot sauce without asking. More on the expensive side for the first meal of the day; worth going for the sandwich however."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-10-13,3.0,Food was good.. Avocado toast .. large portion but was overly salted.. Breakfast egg dish was small amount of food for the price.. Fast  Service .. Cardamon Donut was best thing ordered..

178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-02-10,5.0,"What a delicious selection of breakfast/brunch style entrees! Was definitely worth the 25 min wait on a brisk, Sunday morning. My party of three enjoyed our pastries from the bakery, while sipping fragrantly brewed coffee. And despite how packed the restaurant was, the overall volume was bearable, and the waiting staff worked seamlessly to attend to each table. We never felt ignored or rushed, and our food arrived rather promptly.

I highly recommend the pear marmalade scone and cinnamon cardamom roll! From the kitchen, I enjoyed the eggplant melt and was pleasantly surprised with how perfectly toasted it was. The portions were fairly sized, so I got to take the other half to go. I definitely wouldn't mind revisiting High Street on Hudson again!"

Might need to have reservation cuz we waited for 20 min for sat brunch"
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-08-04,5.0,"BEST brunch I've had in Manhattan:

1. Bagel Board with half whitefish and lox - holy smokes this is the best bagel. Not even comparable to the bagel and lox you get at typical bagel shops, which are already very good in most NYC places.

2. Buffalo French Dip - usually the dip is incredibly dry at other restaurants but this was UNBELIEVABLE.

3. Jersey Girl - pork belly with egg, do I need to say anymore here?

I hate writing reviews but had to do one here."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2018-10-13,3.0,"This place was super cute. Came In For a glass of wine. They had a few wine options. It was a nice spot to stop in once. I really enjoyed the ambiance. Service was nice. 

We got wine and a few snacks. 

Cheese ""fondue"" - more like a Brie - great flavors with pickled okra and white bean. Would recommend. 

Shishito peppers - okay. Pretty plain. The yogurt sauce with it didn't add much in my opinion. Could use a spicy sauce or other seasoning of some sort.

Would recommend it for the ambiance and the service. The fondue was good too!"

Food: We came here for a light dinner on a Saturday night. I ordered a salad and my friend ordered a lamb entree. Both taste pretty good, both have good portion, but nothing stood out as ""fabulous"". 
Service: friendly service that makes you feel comfortable 

Reservation: we did make a reservation before coming here, but that's not necessary since there were plenty of empty seats when we arrived (around 6:30)"

Even after asking for replacements, the glass smelled very unsanitary. The staff wasn't super attentive, but the hostess was great!

Went there this weekend (Saturday) and our server was so enthusiastic about the food! She was fantastic! And her enthusiasm was spot on. The food was incredible. Get the salad on the brunch menu. I know that's a hard brunch decision, but it's fantastic. 

Love this place. Great neighborhood spot."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-10-22,5.0,"Cozy but super bright spot in the Village. The food is delicious (maybe a tad on the pricey side) but it's worth the environment, especially if you're looking to meet up with someone & catch up over coffee or brunch.
They have a small section at the front for grab-n-go coffee & pastries as well."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2018-12-23,4.0,"This is one of the better brunch options in the Chelsea area. You'll never be in for a surprise here - it's classic brunch foods, decent service, and great lighting in the restaurant. 

Their menu isn't huge, which I love not having to parse through many different options. I've tried most items on their menu. Their bread is really good. Don't pass up on it or order toast on the side. Crust is sharp and the bread has great texture. It's always fresh. 

Some of my favorite brunch options - bodega sandwich is probably their most popular item. Their biscuit is great. Baked eggs are good but it's a strong mustard-y flavor. Their ""meat"" filled breakfast is popular amongst my guy friends. Their granola is good. Everything is good and classic. 

Portions aren't huge so if you're on a diet, this is the place for you. I'm usually hungry an hour after I eat so if you're looking for quantity, don't come here. But, the food is of quality and the service is above par."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2020-02-16,3.0,"When we first arrived we were told it was a 30 minute wait, with lots of tables open. The wait ended up being maybe 10 minutes. But as I was eating I saw them telling other people there was a wait even though there were still plenty of tables open. Service was a little slow and the food was just okay. We had the meat packer, which had a very lame presentation, and the bagel board. The potatoes that come with the meat packer came out after we had already finished our food. Although, they were the best part of the meal. Hard to mess up fried potatoes."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2018-05-16,5.0,"We went here for brunch on a rainy NYC afternoon. It is an Abso-fucken-lutely awesome place.

Food: We were a lot of people so we got a lot of stuff. The brunch menu is limited but not disappointing, there is something for everyone. 
We got the avocado toast, croque madame toast, meat-packer breakfast, warm poached chicken and everything was super good. The show-stealer is the House-made ginger yogurt, I can guarantee you wouldn't have eaten better yogurt.

Drinks: They have amazing freshly squeezed orange juice. The coffee tastes good too, the coffee can be bought to take away as well. They have this earl grey drink called the Jumpstart which is super super good.

Service: Since we were a large group, we had to wait for about 20 mins to get seated but as we got seated the food came quick. The server was very attentive and nice to us. 

In-all: I am crazy about this place and would go here whenever I get a chance again.

Recommendation: The ginger yogurt is a must try. Well everything else is not very far behind in being amazing. So whatever you pick from the menu, you will not be disappointed."

Went there for a Monday lunch. My friend and I both ordered a breakfast sandwich, which were quite small but filling. I like the ambiance and would've tried more if I wasn't going somewhere after. It's a nice spot but limited menu. If you like egg sandwiches, come!"
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2020-02-11,5.0,"The bodega sandwich is literally the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had! It is truly amazing! The menu is short but I can guarantee you, brunch does not disappoint"
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-08-11,4.0,"This is a good solid meal. I might have even given it a 5 star review but I tried one of the bagels that people are all about these days and wasn't wowed. It was a good bagel but it wasn't quite right. There are other bagels in NYC that are a great consistency, great flavor in the dough, and  great flavor fo the type of bagel. I just thought this one was fine.

My friend and I came for lunch during the work week around 1:30PM. There were many tables full, but plenty of tables to sit at which was nice. They asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't have and didn't need but I imagine more towards noon, dinner time, and on weekends this place gets pretty packed so I recommend doing that. There were lots of great looking options on the menu and we both had a tough time deciding. We started with the labne plate and I got the heriloom tomato salad with ricotta and my friend got the brown rice bowl with tofu and a fried egg. We didn't have to wait long for the labne and it was delicious! The bread that came with ti was outstanding. Our mains came out fairly quickly too and both were quite good. The tomatoes were fresh and ricotta was also clearly very fresh. The flavors went so well together and the tomatoes were dressed beautifully. My friend's dish was excellent! It was so fully fo flavor. I actually want to go back and get that next time! 

I think their breads are great, the bagel was just fine, and their other dishes are excellent."

178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-10-28,3.0,"Bread was as advertised: delicious. The rest of the meal (pastas, burger, kale salad) were good enough, but underwhelming for the price. 

I called to make a reservation and requested a quiet-ish table, if possible, as I was dining with folks who are a bit hard of hearing. I know this isn't always possible, but I find that it's usually worth the ask. Instead, we were seated at a high top table in the middle of the restaurant, which was incredibly loud and a bit uncomfortable. A table against the wall would have shown us that they'd heard our request, even if the restaurant was loud regardless of location.

All in all, satisfactory experience, but we won't be returning."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2018-12-25,3.0,"I wanted to like High Street On Hudson a lot more than I actually did. Everything about the place screams, ""This is totally your kind of joint!"" From the casual/modern décor with the counter-height two tops right in the front window to the nouveau American offerings on the menu, even the plating and visual appeal of each dish was splendid.... It had all the right instrumentation, but couldn't hit that crucial right note.

For starters, I found the croutons in our panzanella salad to be crunchy to the point of distraction. I could be wrong, but I thought panzanella bread was intended to be a bit on the crusty side, but soft enough to have some bite. Disappointingly, one needed to take care not to send shards of bread-shrapnel flying when forking into these. Otherwise, the salad boasted a beautiful blend of flavors and textures and would have been flawless.

Similarly, the cumin crusted lamb offered a delectable marrying of sweet, spicy, sour, and savory. The portion was even generous, and we were pretty satisfied with sharing between two people. The miss here was how tough and gristly the lamb itself ended up being.

I was drawn to High Street On Hudson based on its proximity to where we were (just wrapping up a visit to the nearby Apple store) and its mouthwatering photos on Yelp. Unfortunately, the version of food that entered my mouth did not live up to the hype of what my eyes had beheld. When it comes to recommending eateries, my stomach always wins."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-06-29,5.0,"I'm at say enough about this place.  The pastries are incredible.  The food is amazing.  The setting unmatchable.  

There is a good mix of comfort food items and healthier fare for brunch, which is really only I could comment on in this review.  All of us left raving about High street on Hudson and I immediately texted the friend who recommended it to thank her, and we planned a future visit together.  There is outdoor seating."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2018-12-12,5.0,Came here for lunch and I have to say everything was awesome! Lovely place with friendly attentive staff and excellent food!! I had the Mesquite Salmon which was a new item on the menu.  It had a cashew habanero sauce which was not spicy but very delicious! The salmon was perfectly moist inside. The presentation of the salmon was beautiful and very colorful.  I highly recommend coming here!
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2018-10-18,4.0,"I've come here twice. 

Once for dinner with a friend a few weeks ago and once recently for lunch with coworkers.  Definitely a hit with my taste buds both times I came! 

For dinner, I really suggest getting the lamb entree. It was so delicious, perfectly portioned to share, and the lamb was very tender.  For brunch, I enjoyed my baked eggs (albeit not caring for the spinach too much).

I recommend checking this place out!  Service was good both times I came and prices are fair. One thing to note about them is that their lunch menu does not have too many meaty options, so if you are looking for a nice burger, this is not the place."
178,high-street-on-hudson-new-york,2019-10-23,4.0,"Charming corner spot with great oysters, cocktails & charcuterie. It's not a particularly large restaurant, but it has a good vibe & it's worth going back to."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2020-03-09,5.0,"Really nice space to work or just have coffee with someone. There's more options if pastries and cakes here than the one on stone street. 

The Florentine is amazing! The Madeline is good and I liked it better than the financier. The coffee macaroon has a nice strong coffee flavor in the cream. The macaroon is crunchy and nice."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2020-02-22,4.0,"Dropped by here for lunch in the Financial District and it was surprisingly empty on a Friday! This place is usually packed. They offer a wide variety of delicious desserts (the macarons seem to be backed to perfection-- hard shell that gives way to a soft delicious filling). I am a big fan of their almond croissants too.

The drinks menu is pretty extensive, and I recommend the chai latte. I also like their hot chocolate; the chocolate doesn't settle to the bottom like many other places where I'd have to continually stir the cup to get a taste of chocolate. As for lunch items, the grilled chicken sandwich is made with goat cheese and edameme spread,  which blended all of the flavors together. They also have a solid selection of salads and soups. This is a great place to grab a quick bite during the work day if you're touring or working in the area!"
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2019-03-04,5.0,"Best croissants in the city! 

This place is definitely on the more expensive side but it's not terribly expensive considering they use high quality ingredients. The place itself is very nice, the music is not too loud. It's a great place to do work or just meet up with friends to chat. 
I like this place for a quick yummy brunch. I like to get the croissant with egg and cheese (no bacon). The croissant is soo buttery and flaky. It's soft and crunchy, delicious. You can also pay extra and get avocado in it and they put half an avocado! Which is great! 
Overall if you're craving a good croissant or French pastries, this is the place!"
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2019-01-09,5.0,"The pastries here are on the expensive side ($6.50 each for the ones we got), but they are definitely worth it IMO.

We got the chocolate mousse (the softest creamiest, airiest chocolate mousse I've ever had) and the lemon meringue. I've never seen a lemon meringue pastry that was as beautiful as this one! 

All in all, beautiful and delicious pastries for a hefty, but fair price."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2020-01-08,4.0,Their croissant is the flakiest! Their cakes are delicious too. Although the baristas/cashiers are not the best in customer service.

179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2019-10-10,4.0,"I really like how most of their pastries use almond cream or some other type of dairy free option.

My coworker decided to treat me here for my birthday. I got their passion fruit tart and she went for classic tiramisu. The passion fruit tart was really good (not too sweet, which I'm guessing is the way it should be). My dessert was $5.50 not including tax. I also ordered a hot chocolate, which to be honest tastes like generic hot chocolate. It was about $3 for a small, but it's very big so you get your money's worth."

And the pistachio too! Honesty they are all delicious. We had one of each. ). Their coffee is always good. It is never watered down from the ice cubes. This place is always nice to stop by for a quick snack with my daughter. It gets busy but don't let that stop you from going inside. The space is spacious enough for a small table."

1. The service from this place is beyond horrible. There is tall female employee with glasses who has no empathy and has very bad attitude towards customers. 

2. This place has never gotten my coffee right. Always made it with high acidity and therefore my coffee is way bitter than it is supposed to be. They have a very good manual coffee machine but staff doesn't know who to use it properly. (Plus bad manner) 

I hope the owner really pays attention to his/her employees. If you can't even deliver a good attitude, why come to work?"
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2018-12-08,1.0,"Very rude employees.

I was standing on line and realized I could not see the menu, so I walked around the line to grab a menu and look at the drink menu on the wall.

The barista very rudely said, ""if y'all are ordering, the line is over there. "" and pointed towards the end. 

It is not a rude thing to say, but the way he said it, sounded like he thought we were uncultured swines.

Yes, obviously I know the line is at the back. I'm just here to grab a menu to read while we wait. 

Anyway, I left the place without ordering, and will never come back again. I doubt the coffee and croissants are made to be worth taking that crap from a barista."

We spied Financier Patisserie just as a band of strong rain opened up, so immediately made a beeline to it through the puddles. 

We each chose our fave caffeine delivery--I had a Big Ben English breakfast tea and my husband had a coffee. I was eyeballing a sweet little sumthin' under the glass when my husband said, ""We'll take two of those!"" Okay, then! I always did like a man with a sweet tooth. A very friendly staff member slid two glistening treats onto little white plates, and we set off for a table.

One thing I love about this place--other than the gorgeous pastries lining the displays--is the seating. Oh, abundant seating, how I love thee. There were seats to left of me, seats to the right (cue the music)...there was even another seating area in a back alcove. If we lived here (in the Financial District, not actually in the patisserie...but there's an idea), I would be here all. the. time. There's even outdoor seating for the normal seasons of the year! ;)

We took off our drenched jackets and settled into seats by a window so we could watch all the poor shlumps NOT eating pastry scurry past with their umbrellas. Ah, the little things in life...

My husband said the coffee was ""seriously good,"" and we both thoroughly enjoyed our chosen desserts: puff pastries lined with sliced apples and basted with an apricot glaze. We loved even the little packaged cakes that came gratis with our order. And all this sweet, cozy enjoyment came to a very minor $11.90! Whoa. I could spend that at the Duane Reade on packaged junk--with none of the ambiance. (I still heart you, DR.)

We will definitely return to the Financier Patisserie to sample more goodies, sip caffeinated beverages, sit back, and watch the harried world go by."

I think I had an oatmeal cookie everyday that week that I was in the city.

179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2019-09-04,2.0,"I used to love the croissant here because it was buttery and flaky, but the quality of it dropped the last several times I got it.  It tasted like it had been sitting out for a few hours and probably because of the softened texture, the taste of butter became too prominent. This situation then turns into questioning if you should waste calories on a mediocre item or waste the $3 and some change by throwing it out.  This is always a great way to start the day."

One chocolate, one vanilla, and one raspberry. Each were HUGE, flavorful and delicious. My favorite being the vanilla. The cookie itself was the right texture and spot on with flavor. Filling was so good I could really taste the vanilla flavor and it wasn't too over powering. From what I read from the other reviews they are decently priced as well which is always a plus. These little babies can tend to be expensive at times. I can't wait for her to take me here so I can try some of the other goodies they have to offer!"

Cute display, wonderful staff, quaint outdoor space, I could go on. Well, I will go on, but that's all you really need to know.

I came for an event so I suppose the experience won't be exactly the same for the average customer, but I think the quality of the food and hospitality team should be the same. Leigh hosted the event and made sure she went around and spoke to everyone there. Before we were ""unleashed"" upon the dining area, the staff prepared the food and set little placards with each item. And oh god, there was so much to eat. Ranging from 3 (secret?) flavored macaroons to creamy smoked-salmon croissants, there was not a thing lacking. I had my fill of sugary sweet confections and savory hearty sandwiches. My favorite had to be the salmon croissants. I normally despise anything cucumbers and/or dill, but the ingredients were so necessary to the complete taste of the dish that I swallowed maybe four of those suckers before I even realized it. Definitely a must try here.

The bacon quiches were also delicious and those bad boys kept finding their way into my stomach (I tried to stop them, but their allure was too powerful). The Croque Monsieur/Madams (??? I don't know the difference. Call me a neanderthal) arrived later and served in a petite form. They were almost too cute to eat. And then we smelled them. They disappeared shortly after.

My friend tried the gelato from the stand outside and was in love. I took a couple bites and it was so good. I believe Stephanie (?) was the server and she was great. The marshmallow s'more bites were a perfect size and the big balls (?) that I'm not sure what they were (pictures attached) were my favorite desserts. 

All in all, I'm going to love coming back, especially when it gets a little cooler. A+ all around!"

179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2018-07-31,4.0,"Wanted something different for lunch. They had ran out of the ham and cheese croissants by 12:15 pm so I opted for a croque madame, a small cheesecake, and a berry cold brew tea. My total was about $22. More than what I would typically spend at my lunch break. The croque madame was good, I've never had one before today, so nothing to compare to it comes with a small side salad. The cheese cake was nice, creamy, rich.. I wasn't completely fond of the crust, but it wasn't bad. The fruit on top was a tasty, and pretty added touch. The tea was good, if you enjoy tea flavor. I failed to ask for it to be sweetened, but still fresh tasting. The service was a bit slow, but the service was nice. All staff that I dealt with were courteous."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2018-02-10,1.0,Randomly saw this store and went in. Very rude cashiers. Make it clear that Buying bread from them and wrapping the pastries are troubling them a lot cause they are chatting with their friends. And also rolled their eyes at me. However I do like the flan and yogurt. But the bad customer service offsets the good taste.
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2019-03-31,1.0,"It is a health violation that this institution , which by the way, charges top dollars, gives unfiltered water from the sink. A cafe that serves food needs to have actual filtered water. in addition, my drip coffee was lukewarm and lacked flavor."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2018-11-09,5.0,"I've loved Financier Patisserie for as long as I could remember. My go-to was the macarons (Try the pistachio and salted caramel!) When I saw they're on Mealpal, I had to get it. I got the Portobello Mini W/ Chips and a ""cookie"" (the cookie was actually a mini packaged madeleine like cake). I loved this meal and I can't wait to see what else they offer! I really liked that the chips were salted and not any other flavor, which would've masked or over-powered the sandwich. My meal was ready for me and I had even come in 5 minutes before my pick-up time. The staff were all very friendly."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2017-10-21,1.0,"The place is a great place but this is the perfect example of the employees ruining a great place due to lack of customer service. 
There was an employee that was obviously  not happy to be there in the morning she was slamming buckets of ice slamming doors walking around the store in a very angry manner making it very uncomfortable  feeling for the customers in the store. Also  rude to her coworkers I don't know if there was a manager on duty at that time but they should definitely address this type of behavior. It's a very uncomfortable feeling walking into a place for your morning breakfast and to be exposed to that type of environment. Corprate should address this type of behavior."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2017-01-07,3.0,"Workers are not very clean, the supervisor siting at the client area playing with her phone and screaming towards the workers, she don't care about dearth plate on the table near her, beverage fridge with juices is broken, they probably will spoil, 
very good tea and oversized macaroons but workers are not trained all all and don't know what is what and didn't try anything, so they can't explain
Very pure management as I see, supervisor now moved inside the retail section, chewing and drinking in front of half empty pastry display and dirty, broken macaroons does bug her
A lot of talking - not training worker or working

Too bad for such a cute place with ideas"
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2015-01-09,5.0,"There are so many good things to say about this place. Macarons are delish! I always get the cakes for special occasions. I usually come here for the lemon and almond cakes. They also have organic green tea!

Lunch special used to be $8 for half a soup and half a sandwich. They recently raised the price last summer to $10 for the lunch special. Overall great food and atmosphere to catch up with friends or grab a quick bite to eat."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2014-07-08,5.0,"If Financier was closer to my office, I'd be in big trouble. As soon as I stepped in, my eyes widened like a kid in a candy shop. Or in my case, a michy in a patisserie.

They have all kinds of pastries-cakes, croissants, eclairs. I controlled myself and only got the coffee éclair which was so delicious. It didn't have an overpowering coffee flavor.

Oh and everyone is super nice in there. From the minute I opened the door, employees were greeting me ."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2017-05-10,4.0,"I live in the area and come here so often that I can't believe I haven't reviewed Financier already. It's an all-around great bakery to have in the neighborhood, and despite the several new coffeeshops that've been cropping up recently, still holds its own with its distinguishing French/'higher-end' pastries.

The coffee is good, with my favorite being the thick and creamy mocha - it's such an indulgence that I have to actively restrain myself from getting it every time I pass by. Another bonus is that you get a small madeleine with every drink! The desserts are absolutely beautiful as well - I can't count how many times my friends and I have picked up a cake here for a birthday or other celebration. Prices are reasonable and everything always turns out scrumptious. There might be other cafes trying to make moves in FiDi, but I always have a soft spot for Financier, and particularly this location."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2016-06-26,4.0,"Financier is an ok option to get breakfast. However, what keeps me coming here is not so much their food options, but their COFFEE! 

Inside and decor: Super cute coffee and pastry place. The inside is clean and spacious. The sitting is reasonable considering the size of the inside. They have a cute sitting area outside, which is fantastic during the summer days. I had one of their build-your-own egg white omelette. It was average. It was an omelette with gruyere and the gruyere was not melted. The unmelted gruyere on the omelette was just not good. I also had the plain croissant. It was just ok. Nothing too special to it. It tasted semi-fresh, so that was a plus. 

The coffee is great. I particularly love that the servings are larger than the servings at other places around the area. And the prices are comparable to those of other places around. I love ordering their large coffee in the mornings because it is huge! Exactly what you need to get you going in the morning. The line can get long, but the staff does a great job at keeping a fast-pace check out. Also, with each coffee you purchase they give you a small packed pastry. I am not too sure what it is, but it is simple and so tasty!

I will keep coming here for the coffee. I am not a fan of their pastries or their breakfast options. BUT ... if you are looking for a lift up then you should come get your cup of coffee from here."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2015-12-28,4.0,"Even though Financier is a chain, I'm a big fan of it. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the prices, but in FiDi it's hard to find many other places that do pastries well. They consistently have very good pastries (the croissants are flaky and the macaroons are big, crispy and delicious), and good drinks that are made fast. Whenever we need to celebrate birthdays, we will order a cake, with custom writing on it (which needs to be ordered in advance and can't be added day of). While the chocolate mousse cake was my favorite, the strawberry cake was surprisingly fresh, light and delicious. Not a very big fan of the tiramisu or pecan tart (which may have been seasonal).

They also have a variety of lunch items. I love the mushroom soup! The sandwiches aren't as impressive as the pastries and drinks (ham and brie is too salty, and smoked salmon is way overpriced). The quiche isn't bad, but takes a while to get heated.

Favorites: Macaroons, chocolate mousse cake, strawberry cake, chai lattes, croissants, mushroom soup

Atmosphere: Busy, but there are plenty of tables to sit at! Perfect for coffee chats or bringing your laptop to get some work done.

Service: Good, but a little disorganized since they rearranged the store. People will keep unknowingly cutting other people in line and now everyone has to cluster around the register. The people there are very friendly and willing to help out - if something has sold out at this location, they have no qualms about calling the Stone St. location to see if they have what you want. 

Tips: Avoid the busy times! Come before 2 pm to beat the lines and get the snacks you want. They sell out of the pastries and specialty drinks (like apple cider in the winter) fast"
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2019-03-26,2.0,"As posted, rude staff. I ordered coffee and cake 'for here' at 5:45pm, was served and then told that I can't sit because they ""close at 6:30"". Firstly, so why can't I sit until then? Secondly, online it says closing is 7. Better walking a few blocks to the other location where the team is lovely."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2015-08-05,2.0,"Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me?
Fool me three times...??

Well, seeing as how this place is near my work and has legit pastries I made the choice to come here several times for a mid-afternoon sweet and coffee. The first time it was fine, albeit slow. The next three times, however, they forgot my drink order completely. Read that again. They did not give me the wrong drink, but rather they forgot it altogether...on THREE occasions in a row. So while it may take them a couple minutes to make a normal drink, I've sometimes waited upwards of ten minutes before mentioning to them that I think they forgot my drink. 

I'm not blaming the barista, because there's usually only one guy making the drinks, and he gets the orders from the people behind the counter...but the process of taking a drink order and communicating it to the barista is apparently struggling and in need of an overhaul. Rather surprising for a seemingly-successful chain cafe."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2017-04-17,5.0,"I love their financier! Every time I visit NY, I have to get some. This time, I found out the cafe was right across from our hotel! So happy that we could have our breakfast there :) Everything was so tasty!!"
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2015-09-08,4.0,"The is a great little spot for Coffee, Tea and Deserts. Indoor and outdoor seating. Pretty clear and a friendly staff.
The one thing they could do invest in some new chairs."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2018-02-13,1.0,"The staff is lazy, lack manners and are plain rude. Everything is lacking in this store and it is such a shame because the Financier is one of my favorite places. I live close so I often try visiting the store. But it disappoints me every single time."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2015-09-02,3.0,"Not bad...

Huge macarons (that aren't overly pricey and taste decent), pretty good coffee, a large pastry selection, and plenty of bar stools to sit on make this a pretty good bakery for a quick pick-me-up. But, it's not anything so special that I would ever go out of my way to come here."
179,financier-patisserie-new-york-35,2015-08-23,2.0,"Coffee was weak. It was akin to drinking water and lukewarm. How do you screw up coffee? It just needs to hot and strong and they failed on both points. They also didn't have any milk in the canisters at the mik/sugar/napkin station. Don't come here for the coffee. 

I've also had their croissants. It was too flaky and not buttery enough. For a place that touts French pastries as its main selling point, you would expect their treats to be better. I've had better elsewhere for a cheaper price. I've bought their macaron box sets for friends as presents and they've enjoyed them. Never had one myself so i can't speak to the taste of the macarons. The pastries look very pretty but are way overpriced.  

I appreciate that they have a lot of seating. It's a good place to sit and wait if you have a meeting in the area."
180,mudpark-new-york,2019-01-22,5.0,"Such a cute little cafe in a small park where you can grab you quick morning coffee! 

It's small but the workers are super super friendly and caring. This seems like the neighborhoods spot where all the locals grab coffee. Their sandwich is phenomenal and their coffee especially with oat milk is delicious! 

It's interesting they have oat milk because it's very hard to find anywhere else. 

The price is decent and the service is quick so make sure to grab you coffee rather it's hot or cold!"
180,mudpark-new-york,2019-11-27,4.0,"I get out of the F train on 2nd avenue and this is the first establishment I see. Perfect for my coffee needs before work. I love the small little ""shack"" that they have and I've seen people line up here. Their regular coffee is quite inexpensive and the quality is good. I usually get their mocha which is one of the most decently priced mocha I've had in awhile.

The service is quite fast and the people are nice. I like that there are tables and seats available around it. I also like their coffee cup and logo. I will come by again!"
180,mudpark-new-york,2019-09-02,4.0,"I came to the area to meet a friend of mine, staying at a hotel nearby. I had gotten there early, so I stopped by a local park to wait for a bit. I noticed this small coffee place within the park grounds, so I decided to get my next cup of Joe here.
I ordered one of their regular coffees, with a bit of whole milk. I also got a bottled water.
The staff was ok in service. One guy was not too attentive, but the girl working here was. She got my order processed efficiently, and I sipped on my coffee while enjoying the outdoors at this park.
Once my friend was ready to see me, I made my way to my next destination.
This place provided me a decent cup of coffee, and I like that it is located inside this inner city park. It's great for people taking a break here, or for parents who bring their kids to the playground inside the park."
180,mudpark-new-york,2019-01-28,5.0,"What a cute spot! Great for a relaxed Sunday morning. Super casual and chill, with park style wooden tables and benches. Great for people watching. 
The coffee is amazing, and the food is genuine and full of flavor. I had the avocado toast with a Sunnyside up egg. What a nice breakfast."
180,mudpark-new-york,2018-09-07,5.0,"I feel so happy when I come to Mudpark (what I'd like to think is MUD's baby sister). 

Maybe it's the laid back tunes that greet me or the ""Don't Worry, Everything is Going to be Amazing"" signage. Or the yellow stools, or the stream of rainbow paint drizzled in the wooden counter. Or the friendly staff, or maybe it's the perfectly warm and crisp biscuit with jam and smooth coffee. IDK. But it's enough to make this my weekly morning breakfast stop on days that I find myself on the F train heading to work. Love ya, Mud(park)."
180,mudpark-new-york,2019-03-01,5.0,"Conveniently right outside of the 2nd ave station (1st Avenue & Houston exit), Mudpark came in THE CLUTCH when I needed my AM coffee fix. The coffee is far from watered down and inexpensive! Decor is cute. Let's not forget how sweet the baristas are, especially the male barista who, when I came back for a second coffee, gave me a FREE LARGE coffee. What did I do to deserve it?? I don't know, but I will be coming back again when I'm around the area because the coffee and customer service is excellent!"
180,mudpark-new-york,2019-09-25,4.0,Mudpark is SO cute! It's an outdoor coffee shop with park benches around it that's a great spot to eat Russ and Daughters' bagels. The chai tea is very tasty and they have non dairy milk options. Would definitely return.
180,mudpark-new-york,2018-02-17,5.0,"I've  had their coffee a few times. It's brewed a bit strong for my taste. But the vibe here is ultra chill ---after all, it is the  East Village! The staff are always friendly and accommodating.

Here's the high note. While waiting for my friend to arrive today by Mudpark, the barista, Ryan asked me ""how would you like a hot beverage---on the house?!?! 
Today's weather was blustery cold so who would refuse?

The important takeaway for my review is that it's rare for someone to extend such a nice gesture like this these days. Today was random act of kindness day---which could be the reason, but still, so very nice.
I would have bought something while waiting if I already didn't have a cup of coffee earlier.

His gesture alone merits 5 stars. Acts of kindness as such restores faith in humanity. 
Thank you, Ryan.

To add a footnote, my diehard coffee drinking friends love the coffee here."
180,mudpark-new-york,2018-06-05,3.0,"Stopped here on a cold day and was so excited to see this Mud coffee stall in the middle of East Village!! 

I got a standard latte, took a sip, and then felt like it kicked me in the throat because the coffee is super strong and acidic. Great for people who are into that, but I prefer my coffee smooth and sweet, with no tangy aftertaste (evident by my usual choice of lattes). It was OK overall, but I would probably not get it again. The barista was really chill and service was fast which is a plus! 

I wish I could rate the coffee separate from the park because the ""park"" itself is really cute w/ cool vibes. It's in a great central location and we were able to grab a quick coffee then head to the F train."
180,mudpark-new-york,2018-12-08,5.0,"Best cup of coffee today!

I've been taste-touring coffee shops in this section of NYC because last night's carb-o-rama has left my train stuck in the tunnel and I'm tryin' to give my caboose a boost!

Not saying Mud did the trick (don't want to overshare), but it sure was tasty!"
180,mudpark-new-york,2019-06-29,5.0,Been a huge fan of mud on 9th for several years. Today was my first time ordering from this location. Same great coffee and customer service is exceptional. Keeping the dream alive!
180,mudpark-new-york,2015-04-01,5.0,"I stopped at the Mud Park this morning. And what a treat it was. There was a bearded, letterman jacket wearing barista who was really the best. He treated my small drip coffee with room with as much care as a cortado. He mentioned that they actually pour in the milk for the coffee. I asked him for soy milk and I saw him steaming some soy just for me. WoW! Talk about going the extra mile. And the location is perfect. Right before jumping in the subway, you can grab a delicious coffee with great service and start your day off on the right foot. 

I am also thrilled about the sign outside their hut ""Don't Worry Everything Is Going To Be Amazing""! Yes, it is going to be amazing because you helped start my morning off right Mud Park! We will be seeing a lot more of each other for sure."
180,mudpark-new-york,2018-02-07,5.0,"Mudpark is one of my favorite local spots. Their location is convenient, service is quick, bagels are from Thompson's Square Bagels, and coffee is great. I've had their maple mud (speciality), iced coffee, drip, and lattes. All are excellent. Their iced coffee isn't too bitter so your stomach never hurts and their hot coffee goes down smoothly. One thing to note is that it's very hot so you'll want two cups. Their food is also very nice for a coffee shop and I enjoy how they play music and make the spot feel like their own."
180,mudpark-new-york,2016-07-21,5.0,"Perfect location to grab coffee on-the-go as you rush to the F train or wait for the M15 bus. Mudpark has saved me in the dead of winter and has kept me cool in the summer heat. I usually keep things quick and simple with drip or iced coffee, black.

Cool vibe. Fast service. Great coffee. Ideal location."

There are adorable tables and benches for picnicking and a playground next door."

Its In a small park close to our Hotel.

Heated with jam and butter would have been better:)"
180,mudpark-new-york,2017-10-16,4.0,I stop by often while cavorting on the LES.  The coffee is always excellent and the people serving you are always nice.  As a favor they made me a combo chocolate milk/red eye coffee.  A nice treat!

180,mudpark-new-york,2015-01-22,4.0,"Love Mudpark!  

The coffee is delicious (as are all mud coffee outlets).  They just know how to brew really good coffee. You would think most ""coffee places"" would. Nope.  But Mudpark certainly does. 

I swing by here 2-3 times a week. Mostly on weekend morning...uhemmm, late-mornings.  The coffee is always brewed perfectly, never burnt, tasty and piping hot.  The staff are perfectly sweet and never withhold a smile.  Also, they have almond and soy milk which is great for the gluten-free bunch.  They are always willing to steam it for you and will send you on your way with a smile and a great cup of coffee. Almost, guaranteed.  

They can also whip up a nice little egg and cheese or whatever you hangover desires.  Every option here is pretty good.  

I do tend to forget that its CASH ONLY. Which is fine 99.9% of the time save that one time you forget and only have a cc.  You've been reminded."
180,mudpark-new-york,2014-01-25,5.0,Great coffee! I've passed by their truck so many times when I'm not in need of coffee so I've actually never tried theirs until they moved into the kiosk SMAC was formerly in at the park on 1st and 1st. They opened their kiosk and effectively dubbed the park Mudpark in December of last year. Perfect timing for me since I had just started at my new job all the way out in Ave D and 4th and I was wondering where I could conveniently get good coffee in the mornings. Well this is perfect since they're right there when you get off the subway. Coffee is excellent and the pastries are really good too! I love their almond croissant! Note that they are cash only though.
180,mudpark-new-york,2018-09-08,5.0,I go here every single morning before work. The food is fresh and delicious. They know my order and have it ready so quickly for me. Their staff is fun and professional and always smiling and super friendly. It's always nice to go to a place with such positivity before you go to work for a very long day.
180,mudpark-new-york,2016-05-18,5.0,"Still loving on this place & their delicious coffee. My only reason for updating is to say, ""they now accept card payments!""

180,mudpark-new-york,2015-07-18,4.0,"On our way home today my boyfriend and I stopped by  Mudpark for a latte. It was good and strong, but it wasn't hot. Still, this is a great little park to take a break, relax and grab a cup of coffee/snack."
180,mudpark-new-york,2016-06-29,3.0,"Ambience: 2.5 stars
Coffee: 3 stars
Service: 4 stars

Ambience: decided to enjoy the summer and sip some iced coffee here and stumbled upon this place. At first sight it was absolutely adorable with cute lights and nice benches. I bought a coffee and sat down on a bench, minding my own business. Within 30 minutes I had two homeless people shouting at me. Keep in mind I don't despise homeless people, but I am a young female by myself. I moved three times because I felt uncomfortable until I finally decided to just sit at the bar. 

Service: the lady was very sweet who served me and didn't rush me the way a lot of baristas do in nyc. It was a short encounter so that's pretty much all I got on the service.

Coffee: got an iced coffee. Just thought it was a-ok. 

So all in all i think this is a great to go place if you're running to the subway.. but wouldn't recommend hanging around here for too long. I think it's a shame though because they really did a good job decorating the place."
180,mudpark-new-york,2015-10-26,3.0,"Just going to keep this short and sweet. The park is right next to the 2nd Ave subway stop, so if you have to take it up/downtown this is the perfect spot to grab a coffee. Of course, if you have the time, feel free to take one of their many seats and chill. It's a relaxing spot and rarely smells of marijuana and hobos (if you live in the city you know this is a major problem in every public park). 

I've only had their chai latte and they aren't the best in my opinion. They tend to be a bit grainy and overtly sweet. Plus, they're pretty pricey considering the tiny size. I've really only gotten them due to the closeness to the subway. This place does accept credit cards however! A pretty surprising thing considering it looks like a cash-only spot. I would definitely recommend MUD when it comes to convenience as well as a nice environment to sip some coffee or have a light breakfast pastry."
180,mudpark-new-york,2015-06-15,4.0,"This is my favorite coffee place. The price is reasonable, the coffee tastes amazing and it's got the perfect blend of acid, earthiness and froth. I would give Mudpark a 5 star rating but with all of the construction going on in the adjacent streets, there are days when it's hard to sit and read or enjoy in peace because of the noise pollution from the jack hammers.

I will continue coming here though. Best coffee in the city- hands down"
180,mudpark-new-york,2017-01-11,5.0,"Great coffee, perfect if you live nearby as it is right before the subway station.

He did say sorry about that usually I open 7 but not today ? It was difficult ? What's does that even mean? Difficult why? As a customer presented infront of him he should have at least tried to serve me what if I just wanted a muffin which was clearly out n easy ? Specially that they are expected to b open at 7. 

Tsk tsk"
180,mudpark-new-york,2015-12-22,4.0,"Totally nice and delicious enough. The cider comes with a big hunk of ginger and a cinnamon stick, and when you're cold, those hunks hit the spot. Plus, this area is bizarrely low on decent coffee places, so it was a nice oasis on a cold night."
180,mudpark-new-york,2015-06-21,5.0,"Best chocolate croissant I've ever had! The croissant was flakey and tasty and the chocolate melted in my mouth. I got an iced coffee which was good quality. My croissant was $2.75 and the coffee was $3, so it wasn't too pricey! It has picnic tables for seating since it is an outdoor stand. Friendly barista and fast service. They take credit cards."

I came for the coffee, and stayed for the oatmeal (it is seriously so good! comes with berries and maple syrup and silvered almonds - this not your typical snoozy oatmeal). Great spot to grab a quick bite. Plus, the service is great, the music is awesome, and you can't ask for a more convenient spot."

Yo what's with the bad reviews the buns and pastry's  are pretty good here!

finally open a tous les jours in china town!! 

they server pretty good quick to go food...and everything is super fresh...once you walk in there's a great armor! if i want something hardy i usually go for There bread is white..very soft... and slightly sweet...They have savory buns as well loaded with favored and good amount of fillings! defiantly try out their free samples! :o"
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2019-12-25,3.0,"Korean bakery in Chinatown in convenient instead of having to go up to K-town. Not too crowded each time I have gone. Go here to primary purchase birthday cakes, however they do have pastries as well. Usually order from the same cashier when she is there...good that she knows me and service is good. Have ordered from newer folks lately and have to remind them that I requested writing on the cake ...(it's on the receipt).

One should order at least 2 days in advance esp if you want writing on the cake. Light whip cream is good, however strawberries are seasonal so hit or miss most of the time...they used to use strawberry preserves inside (which I prefer), but now use real strawberries... Cakes are made fresh daily along with bakery items. Have to try some of the other items.
Have tried the rolls before - sometimes moist and other times dry.

Overall good bakery in Chinatown."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2020-03-01,4.0,"Pretty small tables and relatively crowded, but overall very pleasant. The pastries were delicious as always - the right balance of fluffy and creamy. My favorite was the taro bun - delicious!"
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2020-01-14,3.0,"Go early, or they'll run out of the good cakes and you'll have to eat a chestnut cake. I mean, it wasn't bad, but it would be my 8th or 9th choice. Not too sweet, but still very creamy. I prefer fluffier cakes, like those at Paris Baguette."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2019-10-16,5.0,"Looking at the reviews, was I just lucky..?

Living in Greenwich Village, there are no Tous Les Jours bakeries nearby, but I happened to be around Chinatown, and I love TLJ cakes.

As soon as I started looking at the cakes, one of the girls behind the counter glanced at me to indicate she'd be there if I needed help. Someone else came who didn't speak much English, and the other woman who knew Chinese helped her out. When they finished, I asked questions about the different fillings in cake, all of which were pleasantly answered.

I ended up getting a rectangular peach & cream cake (NEW) and a circular strawberries & cream cake for $69. Both were packaged nicely, I was given a pack of free candles, and I got two cake cutting knives with free matches. Both the cakes were delicious! Fed 18 people 8 hours later, most of whom were able to try both cakes. 

People noted the white chocolate flakes on top the peach & cream cake as being not overly sweet and quite good."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2019-06-16,3.0,"I've seen a few of these Tous Les Jour bakeries pop up all around the city, but have never tried them before now. Everything in the bakery looked so good and I couldn't make up my mind as to which one I wanted, so I purchased a variety to share with my coworkers and try a little bit of each.  The sweet buns and cakes are not overly sweet, which I like. Quite a few of them are filled with some type of cream or custard. They seem to be big on this. The buns are nice and pillowy soft. They're so light you would have no problems eating more than one, and you won't feel like you ate something heavy afterwards. 

Although they have a nice selection of sweet buns and cakes, they are woefully lacking in some decent, savory edibles. I do not have much of a sweet tooth, so I searched high and low for anything savory to eat. All they had were cold stored sandwich wedges, so I grabbed a couple of these to try, as well. The first sandwich I tried was a turkey club that had a wad of turkey, unripened avocado, bits of bacon, lettuce, tomato, and I think a kind of honey mustard dressing. Firstly, I must point out that they package their sandwiches to look really robust against the cellophane window of the sandwich box, and they do not label the boxes with the ingredients of the sandwiches. After taking the sandwich out, you'll notice that all of the contents are pushed up against this cellophane window, and the rest of the bread has nothing. I get that it's a marketing tactic, but it's really annoying to try to eat. Secondly, what I thought was honey mustard, was so sweet, that it rivaled the sweetness of their buns and cakes. I really could not enjoy this sandwich because of it. 

The other sandwich I bought was a BLT with a hardboiled egg. Unfortunately, the lettuce and tomato made the bread so soggy that it was just  inedible. I ended up throwing the sandwich away after the first bite.

So the verdict is:  yes, try their sweet buns and cakes; and no, don't go in there for anything savory."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2019-03-23,4.0,I tried the strawberry cream croissant ad it was good. I wish they had more options. I was here on a Saturday at 4 and the options were very limited.
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2019-04-24,3.0,We order a birthday cake for sister! The cake was decently strawberry. I wasn't like woah! Or wow! By it other then it's just a regular strawberry cake. But usually there will be filling of strawberries on at least 2-3 layers of the cake but there was only one layer with strawberry and the rest was just wipe cream. Which wasn't very worth the 35$

nothing to complain about..

181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2019-02-07,4.0,"Maybe I am biased because I grew up and still am in Chinatown or maybe watching a irrational customer take it out on one of the nice folks working here has lead to this rare once in a blue moon review on yelp.

So the positives. I've never had any issues with service here. It's really simple, tell them what you want from their menu and you'll get it. Mostly here for the coffee/lattes, occasional bread or pastry when I'm feeling rich and sometimes even a slice or the whole cake for the special occasions. Coffee is probably better than 99% of the coffee you can get around the local area, seriously I don't want to hear about which greasy coffee you get from which Chinese bakery or diner cause that stuff is gross.

My go to items are the Morning Bread, Foliage(?) Bread, Milky Bread and this new thing called the ""Custard Soboro"". It's basically banana pudding surrounded by a bun with a crunchy exterior! As for the cakes, hands down the Mango cake for those special occasions and that Blueberry yogurt cake when I need a lift me up (more on that in a bit!).

The takeaway from the positives... It can be a bit cold here during the winter seasons, that area has always been wind city in Chinatown since way back. So if you're looking to chill here during the winter, be ready cause the seats are in front by the entrance! The Blueberry yogurt cake was so good in it's previous form, but recently they've been a bit more tart than usual. But it's still good, maybe a little too much for people who don't like tart things?

Overall I'm satisfied by my experiences here, no bangs and whistle. But I'm not here for that, am I? I'll take my quick coffee/latte with crispy pudding bun to go on any given day. It's convenient and cost effective."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2019-03-19,4.0,This place is pricey but worth it. I have been here several times and I enjoy many of the things they make here. Everything is so fresh and soft!

Green Tea O-Bread - yummy but not my favorite because I was expecting more green tea flavor 
Cranberry Apple Cream Cheese - Very good! I love the cream cheese in the middle
Chocolate Star Bread - This was like a very delicious donut. The cream in the middle is very cream-cheesy which was a happy surprise
Pain Au Chocolat - Standard but good
Green Tea Croffin - I really liked this one. Green tea cream in the middle of a muffin/croissant hybrid

This was a pleasant, chill place to grab a coffee and sit for a chat. Will happily return when I'm in the area!"

They pump up their music to the maximum making it a nightmare to sit and sip thru my $5 purchase.  Very uncomfortable.  The big plus is they have a bathroom and the view is very lovely thru the glass windows.  Note to owner - your employees are treating this place as a night club when you are not around. 
Time for a staff meeting.  If you Want the Chinatown folks to see this as a go to place then a protocol needs to be put in place."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2017-11-14,4.0,Bought the strawberry cake for a friend's birthday. So fresh and delicious. Glad we no longer have to trek to Ktown from Chinatown for the yummy Korean pastries.
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2019-01-24,2.0,I love Tous Les Jours cake. They literally make the best blueberry yogurt cream cake and have never disappointed me until recently. We don't live nearby one so we have to travel around an hour to pick it up. I ordered a 10inch cake for my sisters 21st a few days beforehand and paid over the phone. The cake was picked up around 6 and we ate it around 8. It looked beautiful but when everyone took a bite it was sour. I'm furious that I paid so much money for this cake.
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2017-07-18,3.0,"This definitely isn't my favorite Tous Les Jours ever, mostly because of the atmosphere in general. After spending several days a week for 4 months clearing off the counters in the mid-afternoon in Seoul, going here felt off. The recipes aren't quite the same as I remember, and the workers felt kind of distant. I was shuttered upon learning the hotdog bread didn't have corn on it (I never thought I'd ever utter that phrase in my life-- I hate corn!). I heard the Koreatown one is better, so maybe the next time I'm in town, I'll swing by there instead!"
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2018-11-21,5.0,"I ordered a Dream/Cloud Cake #4 over the phone just two days before Thanksgiving and they were able to accommodate me, thankfully! When I walked in I was greeted by the cashier who acknowledged me right away. He checked on my order and couldn't find it, so he asked another employee. Before returning to the other customer, he made sure to let me know that he'd be right with me. The ""other"" employee was able to locate my order after I provided her with the number for my order which I wrote down just in case. Also, the manager overheard me struggling to make a decision as to whether or not I should chance taking this large thing on the train and offered to wrap it up in a garbage bag. I appreciated it but had to run out to my Uber Pool, which apparently you have to walk to the cabs location in order to catch. What is the purpose of taking a cab then?! Anyway, the manager did remind me to hold the bottom of the cake box as I ran out. Since I didn't get to say thank you. Thanks all that helped!!"
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2015-11-15,3.0,"This is an attempt to spice up the bakery game in C-Town.  I had to walk in and try out what they had to offer. I noticed the decor was eerily similar to a bakery that started in Bayside and Flushing about two years ago but I will not mention the competitor's name.   I got the Royal Milk Tea and all it taste like was a hot milk tea from a typical bubble tea shop.  I enjoyed the free sample at the door and studied the dynamics of the displays.  It is different and my only wish was that there were either more seating or more room to maneuver.  I felt slightly claustrophobic.  

I will return to try other items on the menu in the near future.  The environment is clean and not sticky so I really like that feeling...who wouldn't."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2017-02-21,4.0,"The varieties here is much better than the boring Chinese bakeries that are all over Chinatown and serving the same items. 
Their cleanliness is much better too.

181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2017-04-25,4.0,"Although not as large and welcoming as their bakery in Koreatown, this Chinatown one still has very good offerings - especially mornings.

Tous Les Jours is a welcome relief from the sameness and poor quality at most of the Chinese bakeries in the area.

The one negative  is the cold and unfriendly manner of the various female cashiers.  The staff at the 32nd Street location are so much better with people."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2015-09-01,4.0,"Tous les Jours is the newest addition to Chinatown. It is an upgrade from the local bakeries since some people might prefer french style pastries. Since they just opened, they are suffering between understaffed to overstaffed and exceptionally slow service. Give it a few weeks, I think they will pull through.

Despite their slow service, they are much friendlier than those in Koreatown. The cakes from what it seems are apparently cheaper than K Town as well(?).

I got the honey bee hamper with a purchase of 20$ today and it's so cute! I would definitely return to this Tous as it is conveniently located in Chinatown."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2016-02-05,3.0,"Personally never went to this location but my friends purchased a birthday cake for me. My sweet potato cake tasted meh. I'm going to stick with fresh cream cake next time. 

There're sure a lot of Korean bakeries popping up in Chinatown lately. I'm not sure how this place will compete with other Chinese bakery since their baked goods are a lot cheaper. However touslesjours is still my favorite bakery because I know their breads are made with good quality ingredients."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2017-01-07,4.0,"I went to this place for the first time yesterday. Walking in I felt a home vibe. It is a small family oriented bakery, the smell of coffee and baked goods hit you as you walk in. There is minimal seating but the amount of pastries and the different kids of interesting pastries make up for the seating. The bags are cute, packaging and everything is light green and appealing. I bought three different types of pastries and loved all three. My favorite was a circle bread with cream cheese in it! The workers are all very nice and helpful. Iwill be back."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2017-02-10,5.0,"I was very happy to see Tous les Jours in Chinatown. Better tasting bread, cakes and better ingredients.  If you don't care about the quality of the bread and cakes, you can go to any of the Chinese bakeries in Chinatown.  It's cheaper too!  It's the same if you wanted to eat a better quality and better tasting burger, you might go to Shake Shack, but you'll pay double the money,  But if you don't care about the ingredients and taste, you can go to McDonald's

I don't see people complaining about the price when they buy a cake from Lady M.

I recommend Tous les Jours to everyone"
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2017-07-10,1.0,"The worst ""Butter Cream Bread"" I have eaten from this chain. In Chinatown, I bought the bread for the same price. However as seen in the photo, the bread has obviously a shortened amount compared to the Flushing one on Prince street (the longer piece). For the same price in Flushing, I believe I should have been delivered  a product that was worthy of my money and tasted as good, if not better, in Chinatown."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2017-11-30,5.0,"Fancy pastries and bread very delicious, one my favorite place for coffee time, I recommend this place"
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2016-01-02,2.0,"I was really excited to see a Jours Les Tours in Chinatown since I really like their pastries and Pat Bing Su(Korean Shaved Ice) in their W 32nd Street location. 

It is one of my favorite Korean bakery chain. It's hard for this location since there is so much Chinese bakeries nearby and their prices are almost half the price cheaper. I really like how they had a samples table in the entrance area. 


So the hot chocolate and ice coffee for me and my friend both was not good. The milk must be at an even balance with the coffee and the chocolate because all we tasted was mainly milk. The bread was only average, I think I can get something similar in the Chinese bakeries! Service is okay. I do intend to come back in the future (possibly at least half a year later) hopefully at that time things will taste better after all they just opened not long ago. I do not want to risk buying their cakes incase it doesn't taste as creamy and fresh like the W32nd Street location."
181,tous-les-jours-new-york-3,2018-04-20,1.0,"While I enjoy the other TLJ locations be it Koreatown or Flushing, this location has always been the step child. The other locations are bright,!cleaner and have better service. I have tolerated them for awhile because there aren't too many good bakeries in Chinatown. The other day, I stopped in to grab something for my mom. I was at the cash register waiting to pay. There were clearly 2-3 people behind the register. They were chatting amongst themselves and one of them even made eye contact without coming over. I ended up having to say ""Um hello can somebody ring me up?"" And finally someone decides to come ring me up. When they rang me up, I gave them a $50 for what was $5. I should get $45 back but instead I got $5 back. That's when I went ape on them. Not only is your staff not attentive to waiting customers, they aren't paying attention when they ring customers up. For any future patrons, BEWARE. Be sure to count your change. This is unacceptable on many levels and really looks bad on the TLJ brand. Never again!"

This shop seems to get a little less foot traffic than its sister locations and also noticeably less than its competitor, another Korean bakery. Check out is pretty quick, don't let the line scare you away.

The fruit tarts and fruit topped cakes, milk bread, swiss rolls, and cream breads are my go-tos. Definitely try the black sesame cream bread if you're a black sesame fan!

Today is the grand opening of their 4th store in New York City. There are 2 locations in Flushing and one in Manhattan Koreatown. This is touted as a Korean French bakery. 

I rode my bike past last night and noticed this new shiny store on a pretty dilapidated Division Steet and promised myself I would check it out today. Great addition to this area and let's hope it stays nice and clean (doubt it given it being in a high traffic area). 

For lunch, I tried their egg salad sandwich ($5.25). It was decent but a bit on the sweet side for me. I could only finish half a sandwich. Ice coffee ($2.50) was fine, decent. 

For their grand opening, they are putting out free samples of everything. I tried a few things, but they all just tasted the same. Creamy, sweet, and buttery. 

And for a limited time, if you purchase over $20, you can get a free hamper or tumbler.

We walked in and like most Cha Cha Matcha's, it's very vibrantly decorated like ""paradise"" easily one of those insta worthy backdrops, just a lot of pink, green and palm trees. For a sunday, it wasn't crazy crowded, and if we weren't in a rush to leave, we could have grabbed seats and cushions.

My friends ordered the Nitro + Matcha ($6) on tap, it's cold but the flavors blend well together - you can taste the coconut milk seep through. More than half the cup was ice though. Unfortunately, I was cold so... I got the matcha chai hot latte and it was the perfect balance between chai spice and earthy matcha bitterness.....but with the addition of oat milk, it was $7.35... which is pretty hefty for one drink.

So, Cha Cha Matcha's IG was sent to me by a friend who knew I was heading to New York City. I was thrilled when I saw this cute shop was located just a few blocks from my AirBnb. If I had liked it more I probably would have gone daily since it was so close. The actual experience was just a-okay and not something I got excited thinking about the next day when I was looking for my caffeine fix. 

I got the matcha latte with oat milk planning to fall in love with the staple menu item and return the next few days for more. I just wasn't impressed. It was fine, but I've had better elsewhere. I'll try several things for the picture element at least once, but I've got to love it when it comes to the second time. This wasn't worth a second visit for me. The customer service wasn't anything worth remembering. My drink was smaller than I was expecting it to be for the price. However, overall prices were still what I was expecting in the city. I did like that they have canned drinks too. I almost grabbed one for the train back home at the end of my trip, but I didn't get excited about going back, so I didn't.

If you're in the area, need a pick me up, and some color for the 'gram- swing by Cha Cha Matcha! I wouldn't suggest going too far out of your way for the experience though, especially if you aren't a picture person and don't care about how adorable the shop is."

They serve the puddings in attractive glassware that you can return for a small deposit or keep (as I did, and then continued to use for cheerful packed lunch items over the coming weeks).

The staff were especially kind and really made my day--whoever is training them in customer service is doing something right, as the people I encountered were genuinely warm and friendly, and clearly trying to be personable with customers as opposed to the all too familiar, ""Next, next, next."" Prices match the neighborhood, so a bit elevated for regular visits on my modest budget, but still a fun treat once in a while for a matcha ice cream or more pudding."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-10-03,4.0,"I've seen Cha Cha Matcha all over social media in the past few years, and really do respect what they've been able to do in a short time with their brand. 

AMBIANCE
The epitome of a Gen Z cafe. IG worthy interior in the heart of Soho, matcha, oat and almond milk options, aesthetically pleasing drinks with wild colors, trendy merch, this is every VSCO girl's fantasy. 

FOOD
I didn't opt for one of the crazier blue or purple matcha lemonades, but I went with a classic matcha latte. They do use ceremonial grade matcha, but I wasn't that impressed with my latte. It wasn't bad, but it didn't blow my mind either, just a standard matcha latte. 

OVERALL
Acceptable product, amazing branding, and excellent social media presence. It's no wonder why they've been able to grow so fast. It's worth it to check out if you're shopping on a humid day. The matcha latte is reasonably priced."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-09-02,4.0,"Realized how catered NYC is for everyone. Looking for a matcha drink...there is a separate store for just that - you dont have to go to Starbucks all the time. 

Anyways, a small store in the middle of Soho, Cha Cha Matcha had a good selection of matcha drinks and soft icecream. I had the matcha latte with oat milk. Very rich in matcha!  My friend got the same with hemp milk and I actually liked that more because it was slightly sweeter.  I liked how they offered a variety of milk without paying extra.

Great place for a quick healthy drink!"
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2020-06-05,1.0,Racist owners and average coffee anyway. With so many other places to go to decide on something else..

This is a very cute location in NoHo and enjoyed just chillin their sippin my drink. They have matcha drinks and matcha ice cream. I can honestly try any thing they serve because their matcha is really good. I'm excited to know that there is a Los Angeles location too so I don't have to travel all the way to go to NY.

182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-11-07,4.0,"Trendy lil matcha cafe. This is a chain I believe that have multiple locations in the city. Definitely got captivated by the trendy decor and space. Highly insta friendly place for those social media connoisseurs. Take note that all the drinks are about $5-$6 at base and of course if you opt for other non diary options (hemp, oat, soy, and almond) it costs a lil extra. I personally just got a matcha latte with oat milk. You can tell they use high quality Uji matcha. Pretty strong which I like. Take note that this is unsweetened so if you like yours sweetened you would have to let them know. The baristas are all so nice and sweet. They also offer some baked goods which mostly are vegan friendly. I tried their matcha glazed donut which was good but not great. It's dense and lightly sweetened. Overall I'd come back to try other drinks. Cute place to hang out too"
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-11-05,4.0,"If you wanna be so hip it hurts, this is probably not a bad place to stop.

With relentless overflow from KITH down the block, you can rub shoulders with fellow 20 something cool kids out-cooling eachother.  :)

For drinks, you have many kinds of milk to choose from.  From whole to macadamia, hemp and more.  I usually choose Oat milk with my ginger turmeric green tea matcha.  

For a cool six bucks, you also get a cute stencil art, sprinkled upon your drink.  These days the $5 barrier is a quant part of history."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-10-25,3.0,"Cha Cha Matcha has the best drinks and the cutest decor. I love this location because it's narrow and cute, and I can often get a seat at a table in the morning. I always get my usual, matcha latte with almond milk. 

When I went yesterday though, it kind of smelled weird, so much so that I couldn't stay in the cafe. Hoping it was just a fluke thing!"
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-12-15,4.0,"One of my favorite places to stop in NYC. I can't take a trip here without grabbing a drink (or two!) at Cha Cha Matcha. There are multiple locations around the city. They are all wonderful. My favorite thing to get is the nitro matcha latte or a plain nitro matcha. Even with the weather 30° last weekend, I still managed to enjoy my iced beverage! Highly recommend a trip to Cha Cha Matcha if you're in the city."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-12-01,3.0,"I'm conflicted because my matcha latte and raspberry croissant were both good and fine, but Cha Cha is sooooo expensive and the service is pretentious and unwelcoming. Thirteen dollars for a tea and pastry is crazy (the croissant was $6.50)! Yes, matcha is healthy and the presentation is pretty, but honestly you can get the same quality or better in a number of establishments in the city. If you go, you won't be disappointed, but just know that you'll be paying a hefty premium for the pink cup."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-08-31,5.0,I like the chai tea at Cha Cha matcha. It is delicious.  I never thought of having a chai green tea before I went there. It really does not disappoint.
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2020-03-05,4.0,"Cha cha matcha is the bane of every New Yorker's ""I don't drink coffee... I drink matcha though."" The aesthetic is for everyone and attracts natives, kids, or anyone that wishes to partake in the green and pink agenda. Their menu isnt limited to matcha they have a few other options that include exotic options like hibiscus, algae, and definitely fit your instagram aesthetic. My go to drinks are the classic matcha latte with macadamia milk. Whatever you do whether you like dairy or not (my body does not love dairy), get the macadamia milk, it has a nice natural sweetness! If i wanna grab something to go also I grab the activated charcoal matcha in a can in the fridge. I also enjoy the purple drink with a shot of matcha and macadamia milk. Overall a great place to grab a drink and a seat when one is open."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-06-17,5.0,"Cha Cha Matcha is easily one of the most aesthetically pleasing coffee shops I've ever come across. The mélange of green and pink hued décor gives the place a throwback yet hip vibe that compliments their colorful drink selection. Their decor, warm staff and island vibes will have you thinking you're on a tropical island with not a care in the world. Their staff is as friendly as expected based on the vibes of the entire establishment. Orders are taken in rapid form and you get your order just as fast as its taken. I truly do wish they had a Midtown location on my work block!"
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-06-03,5.0,"Ugh i love this place so much i wish i can pack it in my suitcase and take the whole shop with me to Miami lol.

The decor is super cute with the flamingos and palm trees, The people who work here are so helpful, nice and answered the few questions i had with no problem.

I ordered the Purple drink $6.00 (friggin amazing) | Matcha and lavender soft serve $5.00 (bombbb) and Iced Matcha latte with hemp milk $5.25 (delicious minus me ordering it with hemp milk) the quality of the Matcha was superb the only thing i would take back was ordering my Matcha latte with hemp milk and should've ordered it with oat milk-- which was completely my fault for trying something i didn't know it would taste first lol. Cant wait to go back!"

I love the decor and the staff looks happy to work there.
The music is really good as well definitely gives off good vibes.
 I tried the pumpkin soft serve, me being a pumpkin lover I fully approve this is a must try. I haven't tried any of the other matcha goods but I would definitely be back. I wish I remembered the cashier's name he was very pleasant it started with a J. He was super nice, thanks for the wonderful experience."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-06-30,3.0,"Had high expectations for this, but they were sadly unmet. I ordered a regular matcha latte with almond milk. I was surprised to discover it was unsweetened. It was honestly nothing special at all, and it's something I can easily make at home. I've had better at unspecialized coffee shops. I can't say for their other drinks & soft serve, but I'd pass on their matcha latte. Not worth $6-$7."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2018-10-07,5.0,"Another new Cha Cha Matcha, this one is one of those cool locations on Lafayette with entrances on opposite sides of the street.

Same thing as the other locations, including neon signs and all the good instagrammable stuff, plus some new things like a delicious Vegan Salted Caramel Latte ($8).

As always here the soft serve is a great option and a relative bargain compared to the drinks at just $5 for a sizable cup of high quality stuff. The special here is also Salted Caramel, and its awesome. Even though it's steps from Kith and OddFellows on both sides of it, it's still a good option for dessert."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-06-17,5.0,"Cha Cha Matcha is a delicious boba-style place with unique drinks and a wonderfully Instagramable backdrop.

Drinks [5/5] - The Matcha Lemonade I got was incredibly tasty and refreshing, as were the other drinks I tried from my friends. I head the soft serve ice cream is just as good. This place does a few things, and it does them very well.

Service [4/5] - The staff was kind and efficient in making our orders. We didn't wait more than 3-5 minutes for our drinks.

Ambiance [5/5] - Everything from the wallpaper to the decorations make for a pleasant venue that compliments the green shade of matcha very well. This would be a fantastic place to take some aesthetic photos.

Value [4/5] - Most of the drinks are ~$6, which seems to be a reasonable price for NY. The drinks aren't very large, but they're just the right size to satisfy."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-06-02,4.0,"The matcha icecream and drinks were good, but nothing special. I definitely wish this place had more seating room, but other than that it was a very cute cafe. Great for photo ops and dates."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-11-24,2.0,"After trying a number of better, and authentic, matcha spots in NYC, I have noticed Cha Cha's beverages are excessively sweetened. What a waste of the ceremonial-grade matcha flavor. I hate saying this, but it's a prime example of cultural appropriation. They're also ridiculously overpriced for what you get. I recommend Matchaful on Canal for their more respectful and eco-friendly approach. For the real Japanese ceremonial tea houses, do your research ;)"
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-04-21,3.0,"A okay 

Cute little spot. Super trendy and very instagramable

I would definitely suggest coming here if you want to try matcha. They have a good amount of options, different types of milks and the service is quick 

I think its overhyped but it's decent matcha and the location is great! Its has more space and it's not as busy at the other one."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-10-19,3.0,"While visiting NYC, my GF and I came across this cute little shop known as Cha Cha Matcha. The interior is very simple and has a relaxing atmosphere. We were in a bit of a rush to catch our plane, so we didn't get to sit back and enjoy the soothing atmosphere. However, we did order the blue drink. It was a bit pricey and came out to over $9 for a small cup. It contained a lot of healthy and special ingredients such as collagen, blue algae, lavender honey, skim milk, and matcha. It is a highly Instagrammable shop, so definitely come here with your best smile and camera. The blue drink didn't taste too spectacular, and it was unsweetened, which made it a tad bland. However, the matcha was high quality and both the blue and green blended well in the drink. Overall, Cha Cha Matcha deserves more of a 3.5 star rating because the drinks are a bit underwhelming, but the ambiance and environment of the shop are soothing and welcoming."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-03-27,5.0,I was so surprised to love this matcha so much! I had the Tumeric matcha (warm) and it was sooooooo good! The Tumeric had a kick but not too spicy and the matcha wasn't too sweet! It was such a good combination! The store decoration and lay out is pretty cool. Lots of bloggers were there taking photos.
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2018-12-13,2.0,"The matcha here is pretty average, but they're almost always out of oat milk ! You definitely get mostly atmosphere when dropping by and you get to hear all about the barista's social lives when they talk loudly to each other while slowly making your drink. 

Not my first choice, but if I'm in the area and short on time I'll stop by."
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2020-02-23,5.0,Amazing matcha. I had a matcha latte with soy milk. Very strong & gives lots of energy. Also very affordable.
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-07-30,4.0,"This location is less loud than the flatiron one and features their very pleasing nitro matcha. Nitro matcha is the most 2019 thing of all time, but it's pretty damn good. The smoothness of the nitro really matches the matcha."

The baristas here are super nice, the latte was yummy and you get your choice of milk (almond/oat/hemp, etc). The store is also super cute, there's a few seats to chill. drink size was smaller than i expected but for a solid matcha latte that isn't overly sweet, I was pleasantly surprised. Also, the super cute sprinkled matcha Gingerbread man was a nice touch!!"
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-05-25,4.0,I walked passed this place and decided to give it a try. I got a matcha latte and it was pretty good and good price for new York too.  There were a few people working on their laptop but seat is limited. Very cute place and they have compostable straw!?!?!
182,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-13,2019-04-01,5.0,"Such a cute concept. Love that the place is so pink, jet makes me happy just being there. I appreciate the variety of milk option you have for your matcha and I love that it's unsweetened. The baristas take the time to make sure your drink looks pretty which just puts a smile on my face. It's def not cheap, but worth the splurge every once in a while. Will def be back to try the iced matcha!"

183,sanpanino-new-york,2020-01-20,5.0,The speck and mozzarella was amazing. $10 for half a panini and a large chicken noodle soup. Everyone is friendly and the food is so comforting and yummy
183,sanpanino-new-york,2020-02-20,3.0,Located nearby my office I found this small but cute sandwich shop on Hudson streets. The price range from $9-12 depending on what is inside the sandwich. I chose the one with fresh mozzarella and prosciutto di Parma. They cut the prosciutto fresh in front of you which was great. It is served on focaccia. I gave a 3 because of the focaccia. The focaccia was soft but it had no salt. I like a bit of oil and salt on top as you crunch the prosciutto and mozzarella. The staff was extremely nice.
183,sanpanino-new-york,2020-01-12,4.0,"Sanpanino makes a good sandwich! The Prosciutto Di Parma was great. It had tons of prosciutto and the mozzarella was really quality, too. Next time I want to try the grilled chicken or grilled eggplant."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-08-11,4.0,"They are better! The sandwich guys are more happy and they make the place more welcoming. 

Today we had Glardino Salad with grilled chicken and #14 Speck melt (sandwich). Food is always good, coffee is regular. 

It was good to have a place to eat real quick when you don't have too much time in the morning."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-07-25,5.0,"Such a wonderful little sandwich shop! I like deli sandwiches but the portions are absolutely huge - hate the idea of eating a huge chunk of meat in a bland sandwich. 

Ironically enough, unsure of what I would get I opted for the grilled eggplant sandwich. Everything was amazing about the sandwich I tried! From the fresh mozzarella cheese that was used to the bread. It was definitely a filling lunch for me!

Well worth the price and great experience.  Can't wait to come back here for some more fresh mozza sandwiches"
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-08-17,5.0,"I was in the area looking for a sandwich place. I came across this on yelp. It was fairly close so I went. 

I was surprised to see the line was out the door. I was sure at that moment the food had to be great. So I joined the line. When I saw the fresh toppings for the sandwiches including a variety of breads, I was so excited. They were pretty fast making the sandwiches also. On top of the wall there's menus with different choices of sandwiches to choose. I was happy to see a veggie option. 

So I ordered an eggplant sandwich with no peppers no cheese and tomatoes. It also had other tasty items on it. I asked for it hot. I asked for a different bread. It was so delicious. They also have homemade lemonade and iced tea there which I picked a iced tea.

You guys should check this place out if your in the mood for a fresh tasty sandwich. There service is good but the place is a bit small. Not a place for large crowds."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-06-18,4.0,"Cute little sandwich shop. They do have a few tables but I would assume  most people grab their sandwich and go like me. I came in around 1:30 on a Monday and there was no line but it started to quickly form after me. I ordered a #9 which is called the Forte e Dolce Sandwich. It has Hot and sweet capocollo, provolone, roasted peppers, jalapeno peppers and extra virgin olive oil and lettuce. I got it pressed which took a few extra minutes but was totally worth it! 

I'm sure I'll be back soon to try the other sandwiches they offer as well!"
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-06-11,5.0,"Really good sandwich shop. The most authentically Italian one I have found in NYC, except maybe Alidoro. But the prices and location beat Alidoro for sure. If you work in the area, it's a good spot for an affordable lunch. Most sandwiches are around $10 and will be very filling. Way better option than some $20 chopped salad or a deli sandwich that's gonna cost you $8. Might as well spend an extra $2 and get the good stuff. I had the vegetarian and the sanclassico. Both were excellent. I keep an menu at my desk.

Pro tip: take your sammie to go and eat in the  church courtyard across the street. It's gorgeous! A perfect Tuesday lunch break when you need to forget about the emails and excel sheets."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2018-12-11,4.0,"This is no All'Antico Vinaio, but the paninis at Sanpanino are good for NYC standards. The bread is grilled crispy with a fluffy interior, and the sandwiches themselves are tasty and flavorful. I got a Sanclassico which includes sopressata, mortadella, mozzarella, roasted peppers, basil, olive oil, and balsamic. I went to the elementary and middle school across the street from 2002-2010 and this was the coolest spot to eat. Too bad back then we weren't allowed to go outside for lunch, but I'm glad I got to come back and eat here for the memories."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2017-05-04,4.0,"Looking for a different lunch stop than the usual; walked a little farther down Hudson to this tiny spot. Your basic Italian-style sandwich shoppe with limited seating and lots of deli options.

Order near the glass and pay at the register while waiting for your food. Decided on the #3 Grandpanino ""hot"" ($9) and an Arnold Palmer ($4). Sandwich is assembled and pressed in about 8 minutes, so fairly quick turnaround time for lunch. Sopressata and ham are thinly cut, pairing well with the roasted peppers and provolone. Cheese isn't as melted as I'd have liked it to be, but enough crunch on the sandwich to call it a panini. Arnold Palmer isn't too sweet; refreshing on a hot day.

No frills place, just say your order and get on with it. Lots of baked goods sold here as well, worthy of a return trip."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2017-06-24,4.0,"NEAR BY? Get a sandwich from Sanpaninos. You will never go anywhere else. 

Get your sandwiches hot and toasted, because although the ceiling of your mouth will hate you for that, you simply could care less because of the deliciousness.

From variety or meats, daily homemade soups to different kinds of sandwich ingredients varying from grilled eggplant and different style of tomatoes, they got their game. Everything tastes amazing.

Go Sanpanino!"
183,sanpanino-new-york,2018-12-18,5.0,Great little spot in the west village if you want a delicious sandwich and some soup to warm you up on these cold frigid days this is the spot to come to!! Sandwich was delicious. Very satisfying and filling. Will be back
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-02-16,5.0,Hands down the best veggie sandwich I've had in a long time! I definitely plan on returning
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-07-18,2.0,"The sandwich was good I had the prosciutto and fresh mozzarella with tomatoes and vinegar and oil on focaccia bread but for $11.15 they need to put more mozzarella and prosciutto on the sandwich, than the guy has the nerve to turn the screen around and the screen is asking how much percent of a tip do you want to leave ,for the price 0f the small sandwich they should take out their tip from there"
183,sanpanino-new-york,2018-06-24,2.0,"Awful. Stale, dry focaccia bread with three thin slices of chicken breast with rude service adding insult to injury. I hope the service and bread are better on the weekdays? This would make up for the price tag which one expects in the West Village... Still the product and service were inferior to other shops in the area charging the same or less. 
The people working behind the counter were much friendlier to the couple who came in right after me so perhaps they prefer a certain clientele."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-02-02,5.0,"This place is so great. Quality sandwiches on delicious bread and the price 
I get delivery pretty often here since it's so cold rn"
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-04-01,4.0,"great quality food but it takes forever to check out. Even with nobody in line, it takes longer to pay than it does for them to make the actual sandwich. I've grown three gray hairs while the register guy does what he does, which isn't facilitating speedy transactions. Additionally, it's annoying to have to sign your name on an $9 paper receipt and touch a dirty pen while doing it. i'm certain that Square machines allow for paperless options to pay and tip. Overall, great food but the register guys need to hurry up and work as hard as their line cooks do."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-05-21,4.0,"Good, unique sandwiches. Small spot but they do a nice job of cycling the orders. Try to hit this spot every couple weeks for the variety. Fresh food and friendly service."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2019-01-29,3.0,"I ordered a ham/turkey panini.  It was good, but not anything I would crave or want more of.  It was a little on the dry side, however it was a large sandwich for the price and filling."

The soups also smell very good! All homemade and wished I could of tried some."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2018-09-22,5.0,Still my favorite sandwich shop in the village. They opened up another one in Brooklyn. Be sure to visit that location when you are in Boreum Hill.
183,sanpanino-new-york,2016-09-08,4.0,"I love supporting and eating at this independently-owned, always fresh, Italian panini spot. My go-to for the freshest, fluffiest Italian bread and mozzarella and basil. I always get the number one caprese or number two with soppressata. Sometimes they don't press/melt the panini enough - if they don't, ask them to redo it and they will."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2017-06-14,4.0,"Fresh, Italian panini spot that is small but great. the bread is freshly made, the ingredients are fresh and flavorful, and everything is I think from Italy. Definitely a great spot to grab lunch at to eat or to go. Seating is limited. Definitely worth it, as they load you up on the fillings."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2018-08-07,4.0,This is a solid sandwich shop.  Good spot for a quick bite.  Everyone that works there is very nice.
183,sanpanino-new-york,2015-05-20,1.0,"Great business model, shame and ridicule customers who don't have a ""smiley face"" experience. After my purchase of a stale and bland meatball sandwich - their special du jour - their Square app sent me an e-mail receipt and asked me to rate my experience. I could choose between either a frown face or a smiley face. I chose the frown face on the basis of poor quality and gave the following reason: 

""I saw great reviews on Yelp for the sandwiches and paninis and was craving a Meatball hoagie and what a perfect coincidence, it was their Wednesday special! Unfortunately, the bread was stale and there were maybe about 2 or 3 meatballs. Overall, a pretty boring sandwich, especially for the price. Would have preferred Subway's meatball footlong for half the cost :(""

I shortly got a response via their Square app:

""A hoagie? Says it all. I recommend you continue eating at Subway.""

SERIOUSLY? Seriously. I paid for an overpriced, less than mediocre sandwich, and when the business asked me to rate my experience, the business makes fun of me? Why? Is Sanpanino trying to be elitist by assuming that because I said ""hoagie"", I am obviously not a New Yorker and nor do I have tastebuds? Just make fun of me and yell, ""YOU CAN'T SIT WITH US!"" while you're at it....oh wait, you did."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2017-08-22,5.0,"This was a small place with very limited seating - everything was delicious. The paninis were excellent, according to my family, the bread was fresh, and the marble cake was good, too!! We tried a salad as well, the dressing was very flavorful and for having no meat, cheese, or bread, was very satisfying! Sanpaninos reminded me of a small sandwich shop in Florence, Italy we visited this past spring. 

Very authentic feel!"
183,sanpanino-new-york,2018-04-30,4.0,Great sandwiches but smaller portion than the usual size. Delicious and fresh sandwiches. I highly recommend this neighborhood spot!
183,sanpanino-new-york,2013-07-04,4.0,"3.5 stars...

It's a Hispanic run Italian sandwich shop. It's a small place, mostly take out but they do have a long bench and some tables to accommodate about 5 people. They have 14 signature sandwiches (15 if you count the meatball only available on Wednesday), all are about $10 and a couple soup options. They make the sandwiches to order and you can get them cold or hot (grilled in a pannini press). I got the prosciutto di parma (prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, sliced plum tomatoes, fresh basil, and balsamic) minus the tomatoes. It was a fine sandwich with good flavors, I just think the price is a tad high for what you get, especially considering you can get a better version of this for approximately the same price at Sergimmo Salumeria (on 9th Ave and 36th st). If you're looking for a solid sandwich in the neighborhood you can't go wrong with Sanpanino but it's not worth a special trip for."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2018-10-17,4.0,Very yummy sandwiches to go if you are looking for a quick and light lunch. The staff are really nice and served me at my table even though it mainly a takeout place. The sandwiches are lightly toasted and ingredients are fresh!!
183,sanpanino-new-york,2015-08-12,4.0,"Sandiwches... what is it about a bunch of fillings squished between two slices of fresh wholewheat bread? Heaven.
The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is Faccios pork store which tops my sandwich list. Having said that order any sandwich on this menu and you won't be disappointed. Minimal seating inside so grab a toastie, sit on the random bench outside, get your people watching on and enjoy."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2014-08-06,3.0,"Tasty Italian sandwiches from a quaint cafe in the West Village. The sandwiches are a bit expensive ($8-$10) and moderately sized, but they are quite tasty.

The service is hit or miss. I asked for no tomatoes one time and they gave me tomatoes. I asked for a #2 another time and they gave me a #3. Everyone makes mistakes.

Best plan of attack: Grab a sandwich and head across the street to St. Luke and eat in the garden."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2016-10-18,5.0,"This is my favorite sandwich shop in the city! I stumbled upon this place while working in the West Village area and was not disappointed! I got the prosciutto, arugula, tomato, and mozzarella sandwich. They did not skimp on any of the toppings. The thing was LOADED with prosciutto! With how expensive prosciutto is, this was a super deal. All the mozzarella is homemade and definitely tastes like it. And the bread - Mmmm! There are only a few seats, but I was able to get one each time I've been there. And the music on inside the place was country - very surprising and totally up my alley!"
183,sanpanino-new-york,2016-07-18,4.0,"What a delicious shop. We could smell the goodness before even stepping inside and once I feasted my eyes on the gigantic and shiny mozzarella balls I knew this would be a satisfying lunch.

I sampled the last sandwich on the menu, I believe the #14 and was tempted to tweak their recommendation to add hot peppers or something else yummy. I held back and it was perfectly balanced just the way it was designed. Love that they offer Arnold Palmers. We were in and out with our hunks of bread, meat and cheese love in less than seven minutes."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2017-01-23,5.0,"Sitting here munching on a Forte E Dolce and sipping a lovely Chicken Barley soup, I have to say this may be my new favorite sandwich shop in town. Would always recommend popping by for a sandwich whether you need it fast or not. 

The Forte has great meats and a nice crunch of lettuce that was particularly good served hot on the cold day it is outside right now. 

Great staff, very clean, super quick."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2017-11-23,5.0,It was my first time coming here and right away I received excellent and friendly staff! Tasteful and fresh sandwiches and I can tell the mozzarella is really homemade. Definitely the San Classico is my favorite but a lot of their sandwiches are packed with deliciousness. Definitely a spot to pass by to get a quick bite! I Will be coming back.
183,sanpanino-new-york,2017-06-03,5.0,"My husband and I were visiting from San Jose, California just needing something good to eat at the pier. HOLY MOLEY, the food was amazing. Get it toasted if you can because the bread they use tastes so good. The amount of meat and cheese were even with the bread. However, the flavors were so yummy. I would definitely come back in the future."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2016-07-03,4.0,Cute Italian deli.  Fresh sandwiches and soup.  They have 14 specialty sandwiches or they will make it you way.  There is limited seating so you might want to come off hours.  Staff is nice.  Prices are reasonable.
183,sanpanino-new-york,2017-11-09,5.0,Ordered in a work lunch from here and everything was delicious.  I had the #14 and OMG I did not want it to end.  We'll be back.  Well done Sanpanino
183,sanpanino-new-york,2016-07-28,3.0,"Food was good, tasty and good portions. 

Staff wasn't very friendly, in fact they were quite impatient. Mumbled and acted annoyed if you couldn't understand them. 

Overall fine, but probably won't go back."
183,sanpanino-new-york,2017-10-13,5.0,"Stopped in for panini to go. Very tasty, lots of choices, friendly staff, quick counter service. Cash only! Some kids from a nearby school were grabbing sandwiches, which was kind of cute."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2020-02-20,5.0,"Five and dime is a great little morning coffee house very convenient to City Hall offices. This is a sit down spot with takeout rather than a takeout spot with a couple of seats. It is a perfect place to sit and read and meet/be early for a meeting. It's less pretentious than Temple Court, which I also like but more for ""power"" meetings. 

It looks like it evolves in the afternoon/happy hour to a cafe/bar."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2020-05-20,4.0,"This review is overdue (rhyme unplanned ), but this was one of the last public establishments I went to before the bar and restaurant shutdown. My sister was in town who I hadn't seen in years, and we came here to catch up. 

Pros: unique & high-quality cocktails, very nice bartenders, fun and buzzing atmosphere, cozy, dimmed lighting, vintage & old-timey vibe, movies played on the projector, open late, huge variety in beverage options to please everyone (coffees, teas, wines, liquors, etc.) 

Cons: gets crowded quickly and limited seating, only one restroom & long line, overpriced"
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2020-02-19,2.0,"More like 5 and Grime.
Please as bartenders specify how much more you are going to charge if and when someone would ask before making the cocktail and charing a fictitious number. 
a $26 Plymouth unbalanced Negroni is not, this not being a place like The Aviary.
Seems to be more razzle-dazzle.
this is an easy adjustment.
also, what's up with the projector?"
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2020-06-10,1.0,"I ordered some products on April 6, 2020 paid $44.24. When I ordered them it said available. And all of a sudden  not available out of stock! I still haven't received my refund! I feel like I got scammed and ripped off! I just want my refund back. Thank you"
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-06-19,4.0,"Loved the old-timey Wall Street vibe going on here. It's a great place to meet someone, especially for professional reasons, because it's quiet and some of the tables feel private. There are tons of outlets and password-protected WiFi. The regular lattes were delicious, and they have almond, soy, and oat milk available, so mad points in my book for that. They don't have any food, but have tons of pastries options. 

The service is a little bland and moody, especially the lady, but they made the drinks pretty fast. I appreciated the low-key vibe and the spaciousness in a super professional, fast-paced area of the city."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-09-16,1.0,"I would give them 0 if I could. I dont understand all the positive reviews. Staff were unfriendly and cold. I stood for 5 minutes in front of the counter asking if I could order until the server finally gave me the time of day. The restaurant was virtually empty, so I do not understand her delay. She wasnt doing anything either. 

We ordered the Early grey blueflower tea - get this - no flavor! Horribly disappointed. The tea must be so old, because we steeped it for 20 min (way too long) and there was no taste of tea. And, this is coming from a person that likes a light tea. 

Save your money and go elsewhere. Too much hype and a waste of time and energy"
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-03-24,5.0,"I've been back here several times and I have to say I really enjoy this coffee shop! Their lattees are great and very delicious! Also, the baristas are very friendly. 

A few coworkers and I have also been in for happy hour when they serve cocktails and they're also very delicious. I've tried a few on the menu and they're all great! It gets a bit crowded at happy hour but its worth the wait."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2020-01-27,5.0,"Stopped by on a rainy Saturday for a coffee. The ambiance in here is just to die for, its so swanky!  We enjoyed a nice latte while gawking at the decor (including the very cool espresso machine) before exiting into the woolworth building lobby which is simply magical.  Would love to see the jazz here"
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-07-27,5.0,Stopped in on a Saturday at 8pm. Super chill vibe! Beautiful classic cocktail bar. Bartender is so nice. She mentioned Thursday has happy hour all night. I'll be back cause I love Manhattans.
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2020-03-03,2.0,Bad Happy Hour drinks. Had an old fashioned that didn't taste good and a glass of Malbec that was sub par as well.
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-03-29,4.0,"Really like this place; the room is lovely, the staff are great, and the happy hour drinks are a bargain. It'd be 5 stars but for:
* tho the happy hour manhattans are great, the old fashioneds are not, they're too sweet;
* sometimes, like last night, you can't get a seat, and it's not got a huge amount of standing room...."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-10-11,4.0,"Initially I came into this place with an emergency situation with a customers dry reception. But I left with a great impression of friendly employees and unique beverage options and a classic NYC speakeasy. I wanted something cool and tasty, yet relaxing so I tried the oatmilk turmeric golden latte.  I usually opt for a super spicy variety, but the Golda brand premixed one they use was must lighter (the nice barista added more for good measure). Though it was kinda tasty, the amount of ice in the average sized cup was a bit much for $5.75 plus a tip. All in all, I would come back.  The selection of whiskeys with likely be the draw for my return."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-12-18,5.0,"Coffee shop by day, cocktail bar by night. Classy and elegant Great Gatsby style ambience and beautiful gem in the lobby of the iconic Woolworth Building. Perfect for a quick cup of coffee before or during work (for fun or for corporate meetings) or a happy hour cocktail after work with bar and table seating in an intimate setting. I usually pop by for a delicious hot chocolate with whipped cream or cappuccino with fanciful latte art designs and a sweet chocolate chip cookie treat to snack on at the office."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-10-22,5.0,"Coffee or cocktails? Yes please! Had a great Old Fashioned... it was perfect she added their in house cherries upon request... maybe best cherry I've had . Our Bartender was a super sweet brunette from Ireland she was engaging and helpful. Oh and you can get the happy hour Old fashioned for a good price ... also cute cocktails the have ....Jack O Lantern cocktail, Poison  Apple,Stormy In Brazil... love it"
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2020-02-19,5.0,"My office just moved to this area from Williamsburg. I was honestly worried about finding a great happy hour spot in FiDi, but within two days, I found THE joint! Came in on a Wednesday and was served by Erin and Dan, who were an absolute delight and kept everything in check despite a pretty big crowd. Also, there's an opera singer who performs every Wednesday. Like. Yes."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2018-10-30,4.0,"Awesome spot, I love the 1920's theme, the bartenders are hospitable and friendly, and the happy hour is awesome, as is the coffee. 

The first time I came here my gf told me to come as close to 5 pm as possible as their happy hour was awesome. I have to say, their $8 Old Fashioneds and Manhattans were excellent. They also let me pick my bourbon, awesome. The bar is on the smaller side, and never got too rowdy which I liked. I kept thinking I would definitely come back for some coffee during the day. 

The next time I came here was the weekend before Halloween for a 'Gatsby Party' and we had a ton of fun. The bartenders were all dressed up in 1920s gear, and made some unique punch cocktails for the evening. They also had the Great Gatsby movie playing on the large projector style tv screen. Then at 9:30 pm opera singers came in and belted some spectacular songs, I was transfixed. I later asked the one bartender, Dennis, if he could make me an espresso martini with the coffee machine contraption he had behind the bar and he made one excellent martini, I was very happy. (Side note, Dennis is amazing, he's super upbeat, friendly, positive, and very charming, hopefully he is there if and when you check this spot out!)

I'm reading other people's reviews and many people mention how it's not crowded on weekends...I always thought most of FiDi was dead on the weekends!"
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-01-29,5.0,I went to Five & Dime on a day off from work and it was a very pleasant experience. I ordered tea which was good and I really liked the vibe. It wasn't that crowded because most people were at work and it's a nice place to read.
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-11-13,2.0,"I could not dislike Wednesday ""Opera Night"" more. Yes, the ceiling is vaulted tiles, and the acoustics are advantageous, but it's a small space for a lot of vibrato. Following the opera music, they moved on to massacring Frank Sinatra in operatic style. I'd give this place another chance, but not on a Weds. evening!"
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-04-20,1.0,"Morning coffee review only.

Horribly unfriendly service. What a great way to start the day! The employees looked like they hated working there. I get it.

Coffee: 

Cold brew - way too acidic and not smooth at all. Not the type of cold brew experience I'm looking for.

Latte: Almost undrinkable, but cute latte art."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-09-06,4.0,"Great little bar--excellent cocktails. Have done multiple events for coworkers here. It's practically a well-kept secret, since it's never as busy as it feels like it could be, given the location and the good drinks."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2018-07-22,2.0,"I will likely need to return during the week to figure this place out, but when I went this past Saturday at 1:00pm, the place was empty save the barista.  Late 90's music (Mariah Carey's Fantasy, followed by some Destiny's Child) and the projection screens showing Kubo & the Two Strings clashed with the otherwise admittedly impressive art deco architecture and decor. I agree with every other reviewer that this cafe is located in a cool space in a cool building, but the 90's pop and off-brand 3-d animation just wouldn't allow for mental transportation to the Roaring 20's.  

I was instantly greeted when I walked in the door, and have no complaints whatsoever about service.  The barista was quick, polite, and efficient, making a flat white and cold brew, and grabbing an almond croissant from its glass cover on the counter per my last minute munchies craving. I grabbed a seat near the windows (which are unfortunately obscured by scaffolding and construction as of this date).  The tables and chairs felt cheap relative to the buildings awesome facade, and had little succulents adorning each tabletop.  Again, there was plenty of room to sit, as it was completely empty for my entire visit.  This would likely be a positive aspect for someone looking to work/study unbothered by any kind of human activity whatsoever.

The coffees I ordered were coffees; caffeinated and bitter, but not rising to the level of notable.  The almond croissant however, was a complete disaster.  Now, Five & Dime does not list pastries on its menu.  It does not highlight the fact it has them, beyond displaying them.  When a restaurant does this, it usually means ""we have to offer these because we're a coffee shop and the market demands it, but we're not proud of them.""  This statement was apparently the case in this instance (or should have been) as the croissant was already partially flattened when I ordered it (there was only one, so no I couldn't have ""sent it back"").  The outside was almost too tough to rip apart, and the consistency in some areas would be comparable to bread-based beef jerky.  Needless to say, the aggressiveness needed to actually tear apart this croissant, combined with the delicately balanced almonds and powdered sugar, as well as my affinity for black clothes left me both culinarily unsatisfied and messy.  Order the coffee, but skip the pastries.  My suggestion to the cafe would be to partner with a serious neighborhood bakery and make sure quality controls are rigorously in place.  If that's not feasible, just ditch the pastry offerings.

Regardless of the above, I will likely need to figure out what the ""good hours"" are of this place, as it certainly is not Saturday afternoon.  There is nothing that will purposefully bring me back to Five & Dime, as my emotions while there ranged from awkward, to jarring, to nonplussed, to disappointed, but that isn't to say I will never come back.   If I'm in the area again, I might give it a final shot, but until then, I think there are other places that should be sought out first."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-11-11,4.0,"I wished there were more food options on the menu, but I was hoping to find a quiet coffee shop in Manhattan and to my surprise - it exists, and it is here! Unfortunately, the only electrical outlets appeared to be at the bar rather than the tables, but the plentiful seating and friendly staff made up for it!"
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-02-17,5.0,"Go to place for a weekend coffee with a friend. It's usually very quiet inside, and feels refreshing from all the manhattan noise. Friendly staff, very clean inside"
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-04-16,4.0,"Who can resist an $8 old fashioned happy hour deal? Not this person. We ended up staying for two rounds and enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. It wasn't super crowded and the staff was friendly. I wish I noticed earlier that they served snacks, like a cheese board. Would certainly come back for drinks and will add to my list of coffee spots to try."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-07-14,1.0,"I happily went for happy hour. had 2 margaritas on a tab. I asked for 'non-well' and 'whatever the next up from well tequila is'.

When I got the bill my 2 drinks alone came out to $50!!

This isn't a particularly posh bar. 

Why didn't the bartender warn me? I told him that i was working class and thet $50 is a lot of money to me. The 2 other bartenders working simply said ""well now you know how much it is""

Is this a scam they pull on people? On queer people specifically?  

No one told me, nobody warned me what the cost was. I have never ever paid that much for any drink. 

Other's i've told about this experience were shocked. 

Also this bar doesn't accept cash as payment. at all. Unless that was a rule they made up for me?

This place is prohibitively expensive .

I wrote something about it on their instagram and rather than respond, they blocked me.

Also, they are called FIVE AND DIME! That name suggests affordability. or at least a fairly reasonable rate. 

What in the...?


Edit: They have not replied at all to this. I guess  they're ok with it.

184,five-and-dime-new-york,2018-06-21,5.0,"Wowser! We randomly popped in on a Sunday afternoon and was greeted by Dennis, who is probably the most awesome bartender/mixologist I ever met! The bar was slow, but Dennis kept the energy alive by recommending different drinks off the menu and we just had a great time chatting with him. The cocktail menu was delicious! Although it was happy hour, I opted to get stuff off the regular drink menu and they did not disappoint! Got the Bee's Knee and Lex in the City. The Bee's Knee was def my fav drink - sweet but mildly tart with the lemon, and the gin complimented it so well! Lex in the City was equally as good but def a little stronger. We stayed at the bar for a solid 3 hours, and saw how Dennis charmed other patrons and it was just an overall good vibe! I truly cannot wait to go back (and we live in Midtown East) and I highly recommend to anyone in the area!!"

I have to say that I am thrilled to have it in the neighborhood! The tall guy that works in the morning is polite, chatty and awesome and the group of evening staff knows their stuff too. F&D has one of the best cups of coffee in the neighborhood, and hands down the best up-scale happy hour south of City Hall. I only wish happy hour went a bit longer into the evening."

When it comes to the ambiance I would say 7/10. It has a charm about it that is undeniable but unfortunately when I was their the outside noise from the busy hustle outside could not be ignored."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2018-12-07,4.0,Great little bar in the Financial District.  It's quiet and dark and perfect for conversation.

184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-12-30,2.0,Came here for happy hour to catch up with a friend but the place was so loud that we lost our voices shouting to be heard. The bartenders also seemed overwhelmed with the volume (no servers - have to go to bar for all drinks) and it was a free-for-all to get their attention. Get here early if you want a seat!
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-05-24,2.0,"I am really just uninspired by the overpriced drinks here, though the vibe after dark is very nice. It's kind of romantic and dark. It's just a little weird that it's off Broadway and in the Woolworth. I would expect this vibe in somewhere cozier like West Village. This is a fine place to meet someone if you absolutely have to, but I wouldn't opt to go here on my own."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2019-05-09,5.0,"Compact/cosy little spot with great food and lovely staff. Try the grilled cheese with the tomato and kale soup. Or the Brick Chicken. If I had to fault it, the espresso martini is best avoided - a little watery for my taste."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2017-12-26,5.0,"A nice surprise on the side of the Woolworth building in otherwise an area where I wouldn't expect. Amazing new bar in the area. I'll definitely be back and especially to try their coffee out of their fantastic machine.

A quaint space with the matching cocktails to boot. I'll be back for the coffee and am very glad I checked this out. If you're in the area definitely come back for some fantastic beverages."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2017-10-16,5.0,"Stopped at this place the other night for a cocktail and ended up coming back in the morning for a coffee. The space is nestled inside the Woolworth building and the atmosphere is sleek and sexy in the evening. The attention to detail everywhere is impressive -- from the wallpaper to the lamps to the marble table and countertops, the style is authentic and on point. Cocktails are inventive and delicious -- modern day retro at its best. 

The atmosphere transforms to a bright and vibrant coffee shop in the morning where the star of the show is a shiny silver Elektra espresso machine. My latte was rich and smooth and if you want the latest rare vegan milk product, they have it. They also have some parfaits and bakery items which I didn't try but my friend said the pumpkin bread was delicious. 

TL;DR: go here for the perfect drinks and to experience the genuine atmosphere of Woolworths in its heyday."
184,five-and-dime-new-york,2018-08-15,5.0,Really nice vibe and unique look. Bartenders even gave us a sneak peak of their upcoming Fall menu - they really take their drink craft seriously.

It's a perfect place for #Tinder dates too"

I got a plain bagel with scallion cream cheese. The bagel was the perfect size and perfectly toasted. There was A LOT of cream cheese, which I like. 
The staff was exceptionally friendly and made me feel like I was a regular there. 
I'm planning on going back to try the sandwiches!"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2019-11-27,2.0,"This place has a nice ambiance. The value though is just not there. First, how do you START a breakfast wrap at $10.99 without protein? There's a deli down the street who does a perfectly good bacon egg and cheese for $5. Also if my total price for this wrap is going to be almost $15, how do you mess up the order and not only forget the spinach but also skimp on the cheese. If nothing else the insane prices here should at least buy some attention to detail from the staff. Likely to avoid this place in the future."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2019-02-25,5.0,"This was the perfect little place for an informal solo breakfast when I was recently staying nearby.  The pastries I had were on point - an apricot walnut scone was slightly savory and just the right texture, and a zucchini muffin was moist and a bit citrusy.  Cappuccini two days in a row hit the mark, and the staff was friendly.  An extremely ample choice of breakfast pastries.  Cups to stay.  Bustling locals stopping in on the way to work.  This would be my go-to place if I lived nearby."

185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2019-09-17,3.0,Its a very small place. Barely any seating. The food is good but basic. No bathroom or wifi. It's a to go place if you need a coffee or some sandwich while around the area

185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2019-09-09,5.0,"Love this place. Good food. Good coffee. Awesome, attentive, friendly staff! I have been a regular here now for almost 10 years+ and will continue to be."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2017-08-05,4.0,"Delicious oatmeal. The oatmeal came with banana slices, walnuts, and raisins. I don't eat banana so I asked for all the toppings on the side. It would be great if they could carry blueberries or a berry for the oatmeal. Good coffee. Friendly staff. 

I really like the feel of sitting at one of the round tables at a small cafe. 

The music kept me entertained. 

The pastry options were endless!"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2016-08-19,4.0,"First time deviating away from my normal routine skinny cappu and turning to almond cappu, and it was a inflection point for sure. While skim milk carried a more light and smooth flavor, almond milk had a balanced taste with a slight sweet tilt, and I loved both! 

Tucked just around the corner of Broadway and Bleecker street, Cafe Angelique also carried a selection of sandwich, cookie and donuts, all looked really tasty to me that I would have to grab a bite next time running into this neighborhood. Super friendly barista as well!"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2017-11-18,1.0,"Ordered a coffee and granola, which should be a standard, can't mess up thing to get. I should have retreated when the person working at the counter told me to grab a pre-made one from the fridge. The ""granola"" was actually crushed up nature valley bars, unbelievably sweet and soggy from sitting with the yogurt and unripe fruit for who knows how long. I'm not usually one to send back what I order but this was literally inedible. 

There a le pain quotidien right across the street, which I avoided to give a smaller business a chance. Big mistake in the end. And the price would have been the same."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2018-12-07,5.0,"I love this place. I've been going regularly for the last 4 months. The staff are genuinely friendly and extremely efficient. I've primarily had their sandwiches, salads, and soups, and they've all been fresh and flavorful."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2018-06-30,2.0,"I waited a generous amount of time for the California Green smoothie, which was wildly overpriced considering it tasted like watery peanut butter with a kick. Disappointed, experiencing immediate buyers remorse and not wanting to waste it I struggled through each sip. And when every last drop of this displeasing smoothie was finished I was overcome with great joy knowing I never have to taste it again ! honestly tho, i hear they have dank paninis but i'm not sure i'm ready to face cafe angelique again any time soon..."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2018-04-08,3.0,"Veers on the side of 3.5 stars - so the current rating is very accurate. Cafe Angelique is definitely quaint and somewhat European, not really suited to the trendy neighborhoods it borders. I stopped in to get a quick bite between errands and ordered an omelette and latte. The omelette came with a side salad and toast, which was decent for $11.99, but wasn't anything special. The latte was also nothing to write home about. It's an okayish choice for if you're wandering around Soho and don't have anything else in mind, but I'd probably opt for another place next time."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2019-03-25,5.0,"Oh wow loooove this place. Not only is the coffee and pastries amazing, but the staff is so friendly. One of the guys that was bagging up food for deliveries (wearing a black cap) saw I needed a napkin and came out and to where I was sitting and handed me a napkin without me asking. When does this happen in New York?? Never!! Definitely coming back to place!!"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2018-08-29,5.0,Cute little cafe tucked away in the East Village. They staff is so nice they will quickly dispel any stereotypes you had about New Yorkers being rude. The food is excellent as well!
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2014-10-20,4.0,"Love the fruit, yogurt, granola bowl for a filling breakfast to power through the day, or the salmon bagel stick with cucumber for a light lunch on the go.  The dill scallion cream cheese is the BEST version of this cream cheese I've had anywhere.  SO packed with flavors including dill and garlic- if you like strong flavors- this is the cream cheese for you.  The only thing is that they run out of regular bagels fairly early in the day- but they may still have a bagel stick for you in the afternoon.

Sometimes the servers can seem disorganized, but they've always managed to get my order right.  The roast on the coffee is dark but not too dark or overroasted- I've always been happy with my drinks whether they've been coffee or espresso.

Cafe Angelique opens before a lot of other places in the area open up, so they get bonus points for me, who's an early riser and doesn't want to eat from a donut cart on the street."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2016-07-12,5.0,"ordered a mocha favor with crushed almond donut.
(the middle one in 2nd row in the photo)

already excited when i entered the bakery, was just passing by for lunch.

the donut is fresh, flour, sugar, oil r at right balance.

icing was delicious.

it's a excellent choice of good treat to your hard working day. :p"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2016-11-03,2.0,"Disappointing. Has so much character and potential but falls so short. Some sandwiches are pre-made, some are custom made. The roast beef was disgusting, not only was the meat rubbery, it was served with cooked pickles, onions, asparagus, and ... Hard boiled eggs!!! What the ....?!?!! 
While waiting for the buzz are roast beef sandwich (took 15 minutes) they managed to get 80% of the orders wrong. They charged a guy for his meal and the lady behind him in line. 
Manhattan has to have better options. Step up your game because your cute decor and location won't save your bad food and poor service."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2019-01-17,5.0,"It is good. Petite tables for two or one, Mahogany panelling, decent cappuccino. The sort of place two old friends meet to show one another photographs of their families, the sort of place one can sit with herself and pretend to be in another city. The music could be better."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2017-02-06,5.0,"This cafe is quaint and comforting.   I came here after church at Hope Hill to get a quick bite before my next meeting.  I ordered my sandwich and to may utter dismay and embarrassment realized I didn't have my wallet.  I told my cashier and was prepared to leave but they kindly told me not to worry about it and that I should come back when I can to pay for it.  They were like angels for me that day because I was quite truly hungry and had a long day ahead of me.  I came back days later to pay for the sandwich and they were so gracious.   The spirit of hospitality at its finest.  Thank you, beautiful people at Cafe Angelique!  

Side note:  I've always wanted to name my daughter Angelique.  When I was younger I used to write the name in cursive over and over again in my notebook lol.  

Side note II: The sandwich was yummy!!!"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2017-04-10,5.0,"Cafe Angelique is amazing. Their food is always delicious and fresh. But what makes me love them is how amazing their customer service is. They have helped me get out numerous times with quick deliveries to my office. Whenever I need something that the caterer neglected, Cafe Angelique steps up and delivers everything perfectly!! 
I will continue to use them for a long time!"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2015-06-09,4.0,"With a love for coffee and experience working at Caribou Coffee for a little while I started out 2014 with the mission to visit all of the coffee shops in my area. After visiting a few, I thought why not write reviews and share my thoughts on each of them. So here we are... without any further ado let's dive right in to my unbiased review of Café Angelique.

Location and Ambiance:
Location was solid, and ambiance average. 

Coffee:
I recall the coffee being pretty good, but nothing fantastic. 

Food:
This was actually a nice surprise. They were very willing to accommodate us by adding chicken to a sandwich w/o chicken. The food was really good as well! 
 
Staff:
Very nice and flexible!

In summary, its probably worth a stop. :)

Thanks,
Connor Brady"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2017-12-14,5.0,"I have been coming to Cafe Angelique for almost a decade now whether it's for a quick cup of coffee, to rest my feet after walking around soho, or to eat lunch. My most favorite things to eat here is their lentil soup and energy cookies. Hands down best veggie lentil soup I've had in New York City. They serve it with crustinis that I crumble and put into the soup. Perfect on a winter or fall day!"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2016-03-04,3.0,"I usually forget about this place since I'm not in Nolita all that often. The times that I have been there, it's not too hard to grab an empty table if it's a weekday morning or even between the 12-1 hour. Some people come in to sit but a lot of people just get orders to go.

Their muffins and scones are very good and the Cafe Au Lait is decent. It does always seem freezing in there in the winter, though. I know it's a small place and they're probably getting draft from the door but it also feels like they're not turning any heat on inside the cafe. 

Overall, charming atmosphere, but a little too chilly."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2018-09-09,5.0,Delicious delicious delicious! Great service!! Great food!! The french toast has an amazing flavor. Great ambiance.
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2015-12-20,1.0,"Stopped in to grab something quick to go. Somehow a small coffee and a pretty subpar ""Cobb"" (not to mention it was pre made) salad set me back $20.  The salad was partially frozen (???) and came with a couple of browning avocado slices and some tiny tasteless bits of chicken.  Got the balsamic vinaigrette which was also flavorless and strangly lumpy.

Could have gone to the crappy deli around the corner and gotten a better number made to order for half the price. At least at the guy at the bodega gives me a smile once in a while, unlike the scowling, monosyllabic counter help at this place.

On a positive, the coffee was pretty good.

Totally lame. Totally over priced."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2017-11-26,4.0,Pretty good. Very delicious cappuccino. Friendly barista. Nice atmosphere. Just a tad on the pricey side for me but probably will return. :)
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2018-08-15,5.0,"I love Cafe Angelique! It is a great neighborhood spot with delicious coffee and yummy food. Uma is the best! He's so friendly and helpful. We order from there for work weekly , and it's always quick, accurate, and delicious. Thanks for everything, Uma!"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2014-11-21,4.0,"Excellent coffee! The bites from the bakery are also pretty darn good.

I had a decaf almond mil mocha and a vegetarian pesto-mozzarella sandwich.

The service is very polite and I even noticed they had pretty rad music at the time (RIDE, although not very loud).

I will be back for more."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2016-01-19,3.0,I popped in to grab a cheese and scallion scone. The scone was super crumbly and literally disintegrated in my hands. What I was able to scoop into my mouth wasn't that great. The scallions were really over-powering. Can't say I'd come back.
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2017-01-07,1.0,"How you can open a COFFEE SHOP with no BATHROOM is inconceivable to me. When one sits and drinks coffee for hours, one will inevitably have to pee. It's just how it works. And when my girlfriend and I stumbled in during a frigid blizzard, paying patrons who ordered $20 worth of snacks and beverages, the meek employee refused to let us even use the employee bathroom. If you're going to rob paying customers of ever being able to use a bathroom, at least have mercy on them in severe weather, rather than force them back out into the cold to the 2nd floor of a Crate & Barrel 3 blocks away. We will not be returning ever again. Plus the food is mediocre and the patrons are squeezed together like miserable sardines. Bye!"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2015-04-14,1.0,"I passed by this place today while walking towards the train station and decided to grab a drink--the donut menu was really what captured my attention.  The first thing I saw was the drink menu (obviously) and some guy behind the counter came over to ask what I wanted.  I asked for a chai tea latte and he motioned me to the barista standing near the cash register (well, okay...)  I asked for my drink again and the barista quickly took out a carton of chai tea mix.  Since it was a little warm today, I asked for a cold drink instead.  He turned around and asked ""WHAT?""  I repeated it again and he finally heard me.  Well, okay...maybe I was speaking too softly.  

The total came out to be $4.03.  I handed him a $10 and was searching for the extra 3 cents in my purse so he wouldn't have to give me the coins.  I told him, ""Wait, here are 3 cents.""  ""What?"" he asked.  I responded, ""The total is $4.03?"" And right when I was about to hand him my coins, he yelled at me ""I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.""  I had to repeat ""$4.03"" three times (pretty much yelling back after the first time) before he finally understood me.  Wow, I've never had a cashier yell at me before for giving money!

HORRIBLE SERVICE and the drink tasted like something I can make at home in 2 minutes-- not worth it.  Do not recommend this place."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2013-12-26,4.0,"A nice little Euro-style cafe, Cafe Angelique offers a sweet array of pastries, sandwiches, and soups.

Highly recommended: the lentil soup. Hot, flavorful, and filling, this is among the best items on the menu. You won't be disappointed!"
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2015-05-12,4.0,"This review is for their pastries! I have never tried their drinks, but their patries are delicious! Cool combinations of fruity muffins, super yummy scones and other selections.
Service is pretty standard, nothing special."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2012-12-26,4.0,"A bit tucked away to become a regular stop, but when tourist-avoiding and walking via Bleecker rather than Houston to the west side, I occasionally pop in here. 

The staff has always been really nice; like, when Pantalones dropped her Santalones cookie, she barely had to make a sad face and they offered her a new one gratis. 

The coffee/cappuccino is decent and the prices standard for the area. I really enjoyed my little tea sandwich and I have had some of their gluten free cookies, which are good as well.

The ambiance is like a little sliver of cafe, with the tile floors, cafe tables and skinny shape of the room. Always good for a drop in."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2015-09-03,4.0,"I just loved their fruit cup with yogurt. I had it twice during my visit to Manhattan. Their donuts are crazy amazing. Who else do you know carries hibiscus donuts? We brought several home for our family in Austin to try, they all approved."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2015-03-07,1.0,"Been in here and the second time was no better than the first. Its the city so you would expect it to be over priced, but damn. You would hope you get what you pay for and this is place is mos def a no no. Im a coffee fiend and i can honestly say that it isnt that great (cinna..whateva the hell..yeah...totally not worth it). What could be just as bad as horrible coffee? Terrible service. The barista just was not friendly at all...then i rememeber that the first encounter was the same thing...bad coffee, bad service. Only reason i came in was because i needed a place to wait and stay warm. The barista and the atmosphere are just as cold as the weather. Ive learned my lesson. Never again."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2013-08-21,3.0,"It's a small place - about 4-5 teeny tiny tables. 
Got an iced cafe latte; was a bit too bitter for my taste. Had to put in 4 packets of sugar.. I usually only take two packs. 

Meh experience.. Nothing special."
185,café-angelique-new-york-3,2014-09-23,1.0,"The service was disgraceful, as I was waiting for my coffee I notice a waiter back of house, imitating me to his fellow chefs, when I caught his eye he was embarrassed and resumed his work, trying to hide his rude behavior. 
To make matters worst, as I was filling up my water at the self service desk, I saw a rat run from under the coffee machine to the food counter, it caught the Barista's eye also, but he chose to pretend it didn't happen. 
I highly recommend choosing another West Village cafe next time"
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2020-02-09,5.0,I got a great oat cap here the other day. The shot was well-balanced and perfectly-pulled. The milk was the perfect temperature and nice and foamy. Coffees made with love in the neighborhood.
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2019-11-09,4.0,"My father-in-law is a diehard espresso drinker and has a high bar for his espressos. During a 3-month stay in NYC, he scoured the coffee shops in East Village and this was by far the best spot he found.

I enjoy the cozy vibe here, and we also got a raspberry granola bar that was crumbly, soft, and not overly sweet (3.5 stars).

While I'm not an espresso drinker, I did get a Turmeric latte and enjoyed that (4 stars)!"
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2019-06-04,5.0,"When I stop in random cafes and feel let down by the atmosphere, and the coffee fails to hit, I think I'd rather be Elsewhere. 

Elsewhere sets the standard, for me, in what I look for in a coffee shop. Their coffee is strong, their prices are affordable, and there's plenty of seats. Also the music is always fairly good! Sometimes I wonder if they took my playlist off of Spotify, to be honest. 

I don't come nearly as often as if I'd like, but every time I do it's a real treat. Have never been let down at Elsewhere. And honestly, there's nowhere I'd rather be. 

I recommend getting their oat milk latte with some banana bread or pumpkin bread. It's a great way to spend a sleepy morning or early afternoon and would make a great coffee date spot if that's what you're looking for. And remember, friends don't let friends drink Starbucks."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2018-05-18,4.0,"This is the kind of the kind of coffeeshop you can depend on for consistently good coffee. I've been here a number of times and have always had a good cup here. They use a medium roast, good for people who don't like overly bitter or strong tasting coffee. 
We had two coffees today, for $6.50, which I also find comparably cheaper than other places in the area. 
The service is friendly. 
Only drawback of this place is that it is small, with seating that doesn't look overly inviting. However, it is a good grab and go place."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2019-05-26,5.0,"I have pretty high expectation for cafes as most cafes are just like any cafes to me.

But perhaps it was that much needed thick iced matcha latte & iced coffee after a long hot day of apartments hunting, and I needed something to quench my thirst badly.

Perhaps it was that the drinks and cookie were served in real utensils vs plastic cups that made it tastier + I know that I'm not contributing more waste to the earth.

Perhaps it was that delicious double fudge yet not too sweet cookie so that I don't feel too sinful.

Perhaps it was that bench outside the cafe to rest my tired feet in the cool weather that was about to bring on the summer rain.

Perhaps it was the peaceful street, which make it the perfect spot to chill.

Perhaps it was the extra mile that the barista went, when she gave ice cubes to my puppy.

Overall, it's good. 
(Which in Singapore, means absolutely great.)

186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2019-04-29,2.0,"Be warned: the owner is a vocal Trump supporter. So that's where your money is going. 
Pros: very strong coffee, good internet, not super busy. 
Other cons: bad lighting, bad acoustics."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2017-02-16,3.0,"Stumbled upon here because another coffee shop I really wanted to go in the area was really packed and didn't feel like waiting for my caffeine. Came here with a friend to catch up and the first thing we noticed was how quiet it was, there was no music playing in the background. Probably not the best spot to talk but ideal for those who want to get some work done especially since it's super bright in here. But FYI it can get a little cramped in between tables. 

I ordered a machiatto and thought that it wasn't that strong, didn't quite spot for me.  I thought it was okay, nothing to rave about. However, service was great even though there was only one barista. The coffee shop is pretty cute with some greenery. There are some stools against the wall, about 4 small tables for 2 and a bench inside the shop looking out the window. I would come back but I'll try something different next time."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2019-01-17,5.0,"If you are looking for a cafe to work in, this is by far the best option in the East Village. Elsewhere Espresso:

- is cozy, clean, comfortable, spacious, bright
- is never, ever crowded
- has wifi and plugs everywhere
- has acceptable coffee to drink and acceptable snacks to eat
- has a friendly and unobtrusive staff, who are nothing but smiles even if you occupy a seat for six hours while having just a couple of coffees
- which you can count on doing since, again, it is never crowded.

I mean it about the coffee and treats. If you want a really great cup of cofee, this isn't the place. (It's still way better than Starbucks!) And if you want to eat it definitely isn't the place. But if you want a clean, comfortable public space to type on your laptop or read a book or meet a colleague, places come no better."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2019-03-13,4.0,Really cool spot in the neighborhood! I've come here a couple times to get some work done. Good espresso to go with a solid working space. Kinda similar to a few other cafes between 1st and A but they're like that for a reason. Definitely worth it!
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2017-04-30,2.0,"I stopped by because this is one of the few cafes in the East Village that I haven't tried yet - also because Yelpers mentioned some bomb ass cookies would be available here. I was sorely underwhelmed with the regular coffee I ordered. It tasted a bit sour...like under roasted beans or over brewed coffee. Either way, I was not a huge fan. There were also no cookies for sale at 7:30AM, only croissants. Unfortunately, my croissant didn't taste all that fresh.

Also, the barista had a pretty stinky look on her face each time I interacted with her. Not so with the other customers, so maybe it was just me?

There is a bathroom and free wifi available, so you might find this to be a decent study spot. Not sure I would choose this over the many other cafes in the vicinity though."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2019-09-16,1.0,"The coffee was good, but then my friend went to eat a macaroon we had bought nearby and the barista came out from behind the bar to tell her off about the ""no outside food or drink"" policy. It was really weird and off-putting"
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2016-09-23,5.0,"Chilled vibe, great coffee - elsewhere espresso has everything I was longing for after a short run for end of week celebration. 

My barista was super nice and quickly served my iced latte. Though it was a bit on the intense side after the first sip, it turned out to be well balanced - just like going through the tough week before enjoying the weekend, loved it!"
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2017-10-23,4.0,"Good quality coffee at a quiet spot. Sat outside on the bench watching squirrel broke into someone's apartment. If you're going to Raku and they have a line outside, this is a perfect place."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2018-03-07,5.0,"Awesome find! Super cute cafe with great coffee, served in mugs if you order ""for here"", which is always a homie touch. I came here to study and found the cafe to be a nice study/work environment. There isn't a ton of seating, but if you can snag a seat, it's a great spot. They play jazz over the speakers, which sets the mood perfectly for an east village cafe.

Another huge plus is their drip coffee is only $2.00!! That's cheaper than the commercial chains for coffee (Dunkin, Starbucks, etc.)

A great find, would highly recommend a stop in!"
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2018-09-22,5.0,Perfect cozy ambiance and good espresso /scones. They have both half and half and almond milk which is great. Friendly knowledgeable staff and a crowd that feels mostly local.
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2016-08-20,4.0,"A nice, laid back vibe in here with, what I could tell from my 2 hours there, a killer soundtrack for your background music pleasure.  

Awesome assortment of iced teas to choose from, too.  A big plus for this non-coffee drinker who loves coffee shops.  

Not much seating, but a cozy spot to chill if you manage to snag a table or a stool.  Or you can get the bench in the front window for ultimate people watching! 

Bonus points for their witty chalk sign out front, which I've oft-admired long before having paid them a visit :)"
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2018-11-10,2.0,"My coffee (latte) was just alright - not noticeably strong or hot - so that was mildly disappointing. Not much ambiance to the place, poor/uncomfortable seating, and barely anyone there. They didn't do anything wrong and were perfectly nice but not a place I will return to with the number of other high quality cafes in the area."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2016-05-16,4.0,"LOVE THEIR AMERICANO!!

Location: East village, I am here exploring you, starting from coffee shops. Elsewhere espresso is a great traditional coffee shop. Not fancy like coffee project, not commercial like beans, Elsewhere espresso is just being a legit place for a coffee break. They have wifi inside, and some tables for people to sit and chat and simply drink good coffee.

they also offer pastries for customers to have a quick bite.
Why not!

Coffee: love their americano, very strong, very delicious, very wanna try twice in a day.

Service: the girl is definily moaning against Monday since she's not smiling to anyone and gives me a feeling of this-is-monday-and-i-am-angry face.

it's okay.
I feel ya

Price: compared to west village, east village coffee shop is cheap, cheap in a good way.

Thanks

overall: I forgot to mention that their chairs are extremely uncomfy but I will be back. The americano is too good to not come back.

4 solid stars"

I should have known that at 5pm there would be no pastries, so I got a Cortado with Almond milk. Smooth, bold and creamy, it was super tasty. Plus soy and almond milk only costs 25 cents extra so I didn't feel ripped off like I would have felt at fourbucks.

Will be back."

Signage: Witty
Barista: Friendly and efficient
Crowd: Hipster
Menu: Somewhat hidden in placement
Coffee: Average
Rating: 3 stars for the coffee, 5 stars for all else

I always enjoy seeing nice wooden furniture in NYC as I feel it gives us a nice break from the urban jungle. It also plays well against the exposed brick walls and small paintings on top. I feel like a decor is an essential for a coffeehouse, especially for people who want to spend hours in there. Yes, I'm referring to the crowd inside donning beanies, typing away on macbooks, and sporting shirts buttoned up all the way to the top. Hipster fashion?

The signage outside the shop is witty and what attracted us in for a mid-afternoon coffee break. There was someone before us in line and I wanted to check out the menu so I would know what to order by the time it was my turn. I glanced around and it was nowhere to be seen until we stepped up the counter where the menu is taped next to the pastry showcase. My suggestion is to have the menu listed somewhere more visible to help expedite a line, if one is ever formed.

I ordered a cortado and the friendly barista even cut my milk into a heart shape on top of my coffee. The others with me had an iced coffee. What's lacking here was a decent coffee. It tasted generic yet slightly harsh to me and the iced coffee drinkers agreed. I'm by no means a coffee expert but to me the beans used in my opinion lacked depth but was full bodied."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2018-02-19,4.0,"Great coffee shop. 2 dollar drip coffee cannot be beat, served in cute hand made mugs. The little snacks were pretty good too, not something that would blow your mind but still tasty. The ambiance is great, it is a quiet place made for people who want to get work done. Not much else needs to be said, this is a coffee shop that I forsee myself coming back to many times over but I can see why it would not be for everyone, with its quiet music and small seating arrangments."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2016-03-05,5.0,"Very excellent. I came on a saturday afternoon and it was beyond silent. The music is on super low and everyone seemed deep in...checking emails and answering iMessages: so seems to be okay for studying, at least at the time. 

all this aside, very good coffee. I am pleased."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2015-02-12,5.0,"Really really like this coffeeshop.  It just so happens that it's across the street from my guitar teacher.  How convenient!  Of late, I've taken to stopping in here for an hour before a lesson, to have a sip of cold brew & flip some pages of my latest volume.

What to expect?  Super duper calafragalistically excellent coffee.  What else?  Really really friendly people.  I don't know if it's cause it's so small or out of the way, but i feel almost like I'm in Brooklyn!  Dogs under the tables, friendly staff smiling, and asking you how you're doing... 

I just love it everytime I stop in.  :)"
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2016-11-27,5.0,Fantastic local spot where the coffee is bold and strong!  The staff is very friendly and it's an unrushed shop.  You can bring in your laptop for a bit of work without getting the evil eye.  Just make sure to freshen up your order every so often to respectfully keep the biz flowing. They're also dog friendly which is a big plus!
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2018-01-01,1.0,"I stopped in since i live on the street. Firstly, the service is not great. The single barista looked agitated and spoke to me like I was annoying her. She wasn't very good in handling the coffee and espresso as well. 

I had a latte- she just splashed the overly heated milk into the cup. It's still too hot to drink right now. Overall- not a pleasant experience and I won't go back again."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2018-06-09,5.0,The best lattes ever! I love both the hot and iced lattes. The coffee takes so creamy and rich and no bitterness in it . Pricey but 100 times better than Starbucks

Their coffee is STRONG and not for the weak hearted. I really enjoy it but just don't drink 2 large coffees at once :) The baristas are really nice and there are a lot of locals that come in, the music and the vibe are relaxing, and they always have fresh almond croissants. Lucky this place is right next to me. Oh, and the store chalkboard sign always has something witty drawn on it."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2018-03-27,3.0,"Decent coffee, but the barista was unfriendly and rude. Wouldn't return because of that."
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2016-10-06,5.0,"Vibe: super quaint (on the smaller side), plays cute old-fashioned background music that's lively - a mix of folky and more soothing music. 

Seating: a small counter of 4 bar stools, then about 4 small tables that fit 2 people each. They also have a really cute bench that is right in front and faces the window, so you can do some serious people watching. 

The drip coffee was so good! And super affordable - only $3 and didn't even have to pay extra for almond milk. I had a Sumatra, which the barista recommended. It was so delicious and unique - sweet bell pepper, light malt, and dark chocolate. I wanted to try the cookies as well but they were out. The barista was also super friendly. 

Great place to work solo or with another person - I came here to do some work and there are a few outlets, one set near the leftmost bar stools and one set near the backmost corner table. 

What I'd come back for: more drip coffee - they had 2 other types with really interesting fruity mixtures. Also, the lattes seemed really great (if you're into more milky coffees) and so did the pastries!"
186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2016-02-18,3.0,"They no longer seem to serve Cake Thieves Bakery products, and my early morning visit was met with just a sad display of pedestrian baked goods and no one at the counter, so I wish I didn't opt for the really weak croissant.

186,elsewhere-espresso-new-york,2015-09-01,5.0,"I found this place in a quest to find the closest place to my apartment, and it turns out it's WONDERFUL. 

I got an espresso (the most important quality test) and it was short pulled and perfect. Hot, black as night, with the slightest crema. Tastes like purity and sin at the same time. Sexually good. Soy cappucino and decaf espresso are just as good.

The only issue is the pastries. I had the blueberry scone which was quite weak and the banana chocolate chip muffin which was OK. Maybe skip the pastries unless they improve them.

So--lovely espresso, mediocre pastries. Should be four stars, by my book. But the SERVICE and the lovely LACK OF PRETENTION is so important. I feel so comfortable here and the team is small and confident and knowledgable.

An atypical place for its location. No chic attitudes, but definitely a chic place. And uhhh, that espresso."

187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2020-01-13,5.0,"A really nice, intimate place for a date (probs not a first one tho). My boyfriend and I ordered the oolong set and picked out a turtle tea pet which was fun. They give you so much tea for just the minimal order (3 refills), so expect to stay a while -- we probably stayed here for a few hours. If that's the kind of experience you want, it doesn't get much better than this!"
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2020-02-13,2.0,"I've always wanted to check this place out, but my first time walk-in experience was horrible--I don't feel like I am welcomed.

I was searching around the neighborhood for some tea leaf/tea-ware. And as I entered the this store I was genuinely hoping to get a better idea of the cute-looking place--the environment, the tea service/product/price, etc. So I told the staff that I am just ""looking around"", with a big smile. Her response was ""Well this is a tea house, it's not for look-arounds"". Honestly for me it was very shocking and unfriendly. ""Hi welcome"", ""What can I do for you"" & ""First-time customer? Let me show you our menu"". NOPE. NONE OF THAT. :)

That was the third tea house I visited today and it's the only place that treated me that way and she pretty much tells me I am not even allowed to come check it out unless I have made up my mind and ready to spend money. 

Two stars credit for the cute decor--at least viewing from what I am allowed to look at since ""looking-around"" is forbidden here.

Will not visit again."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2019-06-08,4.0,"Serenity now! This small tea house offers some limited and superior tea leaves to assist with unwinding or resetting oneself. You may feel like a tea connoisseur while enjoying the ritual offered here. This place begins or continues your education in the way of tea. They offer courses and tastings to further your journey as an enthusiast of fine tea. 

Not only are you able to have a steep or four but you may purchase for enjoyment elsewhere. The menu is filled with options specifically curated for individuals with an appreciation for quality tea. You won't find tisanes (herbal or blends) here. The focus is an educational approach to higher quality teas vs the traditional (USA) views of what is considered tea. Whether you are a beginner or savvy tea drinker, this place is worth its weight in tea. So start or continue your Tea Drunk path here."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2019-05-18,5.0,"I ADORE TEA DRUNK! The 老板娘的妈妈 is super cute and friendly! She just arrived from China and is supporting her daughter in this business venture. 

The ""tea sommelier"" was fabulous! She studied cultural anthropology and is essentially using her degree to understand the cultural nuances of tea and tea culture! She's extremely knowledgeable with such a authentic soul and energy. 

The tea tasting felt curated for us, with a price point that I think definitely translates into a solid value proposition! The teas were all very different, very unique and exactly as described by their tea sommelier. I would 100% recommend people checking them out!  

Wish yelp allowed me to post videos since I have a nice overview in video form of the experience :). If the owner sees this and you have the functionality to add videos to your page, let me know and I'll send it to you!"
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2019-11-11,4.0,"Given their price point and size, it's pretty amazing that this place has been apparently open for 6 years. Like the cheapest pot of tea you can get is $20 and most of them cost quite a bit more than that. But if you think about it, most places in Manhattan cost more than $10/pp to sit around and chat with a friend for an hour. And on this weekend's cold snap, it was pretty ideal."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2018-09-10,4.0,"We didn't do any research before stumbling in this adorably decorated Chinese tea house on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but I'm sure glad we did! Be prepared to spend some money because they serve fine and rare hand-picked teas but it was a worth while experience. The man working was very kind & knowledgeable. You get to pick your own tea pet which is fun and we ended up ordering the Bai Ye - Xi Chun - 2017 (Pao - Tea House Service Only) which was a rich and highly caffeinated oolong. (I would have done a tea flight but my companions weren't tea drinkers.)

Complaints: They were playing modern music - I think I would have preferred traditional Chinese music to go with the theme, but it wasn't too loud. The bathroom was also pretty run down and not decorated cute like the rest of the place but oh well."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2020-01-18,2.0,"Expected warmth and welcomeness from a tea house but was met with a cold and inhospitable hostess who barked at us to close the door (no please). She stared at us while we asked for a menu and made us feel like we made a mistake walking in.

Super expensive tea, and I get that, but they need to work on service and some basic manners if they want to prevent customers from walking right out the door."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2020-01-13,3.0,"Vibe is very zen like, but you can tell it is for a VERY niche customer who appreciates tea to a level they will spend $50 on strictly tea for two, no food, no alcohol, just tea. If I was part of that crowd, I may have given em 4 stars, but I just didn't see the value or left feeling great about visiting."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2020-02-08,1.0,"This place has potential, and all the right  ingredients. High quality product, great location, welcoming ambiance. The owners must have puT a lot of thought and attention to this business. Except, as you can tell from some other reviews, there's a landmine in the store, that, if you step on it, will destroy your whole experience. It's the infamous tea snob lady, extremely unhelpful, staring at you as if she was blessed with inaccessible Tea secrets that make you, the uninitiated, not completely worth as a human being. Asking for basic information only returns an entitled and judgmental stare. Walking around the  store results in an incomprehensibly, almost comically  rude remark 'don't wonder around'. Pointing out that she should probably not treat customers in such a way, results in clearly explaining that you, after all, are not a customer because you  haven't bought anything yet, reversing any possible commercial logic or common sense. Friendly advice to you as a potential customer: it's just not worth it, no mattter how good the product could be (if you are brave enough to accept the abuse to get tthroigh the finish line). Friendly advice to the owners: face your customer with grace and friendliness, and flush rudeness out of your system."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2017-08-02,4.0,"""Have you ever had tea before?""

I thought that was a weird question to get from the girl manning the tea house upon walking in. Maybe:

""What can I do for you?""
""What kind of tea do you like?""
""Welcome to Tea Drunk.""

Or even,

""Hello.""

But I suppose I just look like a guy who walks into tea rooms having never had a sip. Also, who has never had a sip of tea before?

I feel as though I've gotten off topic. I suppose I was just confused by the question, and the continuously odd service from the tea house girl. 

I've had tea before. As a non-coffee drinker, I've actually had a lot of tea. I'd even had Tea Drunk tea at their residency at The Met. And let me tell you, Tea Drunk tea is fantastic. 

They don't serve bags full of generic, stale garbage. They have canisters full of meticulously hand-crafted leaves sourced from secret locations in the mountains of China. They have only the finest Green, Yellow, White, Wu Long, Red and Black teas hand-picked by heritage farmers who have dedicated their entire lives to getting you this tea. And it's delicious. Delicious, and very, very expensive.

Did you know there are teas that would cost you $1200 for 28 grams? The finest China White.* Or maybe it was the Jun Shan Yin Zhen #1 (2016, a very good year for Yin Zhens). A yellow tea. 

There are also far more reasonable teas that are still much more expensive than you are used to teas being, but still quite delicious. If you care about tea, this place may just blow your mind. Get some of the less expensive varieties for drinking in or preparing yourself at home, and you'll taste the difference.

187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2019-11-01,3.0,"Nice looking tea house with attentive staff. There's a ceramic ""tea pet"" that you pick out before working your way at through the pot of specialty tea. It is way overpriced, though."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2017-04-21,5.0,"A traditional throw back tea joint just as if you were in china. This place prides itself on serving only Chinese tea and has a vast selection.  

We ordered a pot of red tea and you're ask to choose a tea spirit animal to accompany you on the taste journey.  The monkey was summoned.  I flashed back to a Mulan scene. 

The staff properly washed the red tea leaves for the first steep (you're not suppose to drink the first steep). I was pleasantly surprised of their knowledge. 

The first real steep was poured and quickly transferred to a pot without the leaves. At this point I was happy they knew all this (red tea is a flash steep and you must transfer the solution to another containment Quickly).

The staff informed they'll be back for two more steeps. The second steep they informed me this pour will become stronger.  I became giddy at their knowledge and yes it's true with red tea. The middle steeps become stronger than the previous.

I enjoyed coming here for the experience and glad a place like this exists.  It is on the pricey side for tea, but the experience is great if you never been to a tea house."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2018-09-03,5.0,"A great spot for purist and anyone who wants to learn about tea. Also a place to catch up with a friend or have some laughs with a small group of friends. The ambience is relaxing, however it can also be lively depending on your company. Also an awesome spot to go alone, sit at the bar and chat with the experts. It was a pleasure to meet Joe today who suggested the Gua Pian mid Spring 2018 for our afternoon tasting. The depth and range of this particular tea was exactly what we were looking. We left feeling relaxed and full of info. We are definitely planning a return next weekend for some subtle progression and more learning. 

I am beginning to realize that the tea experience is a deep rabbit hole! A lot of similarities to wine. Everyone has a preferred path and likely the owner of Tea Drunk and her knowledgeable team can provide some professional guidance and expert suggestions. Thank You Tea Drunk for an exceptional tasting experience! 

From your new loyal drinker~"
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2017-01-15,1.0,"Firstly, I want to say that I'm so beyond disappointed by what could've been an amazing experience - I've never felt so disrespected or unwelcome in an establishment. 

The short: cool concept, good tea, but literally the worst, rudest service I've ever experienced in my life. 

The longer: we get in, sit at a table, and look at a menu. The owner comes over.

""Is it your first time here?""
""Yes... if it was your first time would you do a tasting or a single pot to share?""
""It's not my first time here..."" 

Literally at that moment, we should've left, but I really wanted to experience the positives some fellow Yelpers wrote about in their reviews.

But, we stayed and ordered the regular green tea tasting ($49). She set us up, poured the tea, but was totally uninterested in interacting with us or answering any of our questions. 

We have NO idea what teas we tasted (she didn't explain or answer any of questions in detail - literally got quiet, one word answers), she didn't give us a drinking buddy sculpture for the table (she'd given it to everyone else who she laughed, interacted and provided suggestions for), and overall we felt so totally unwelcome and uncomfortable. 

When I was leaving, I paid at the bill on her iPad, and was thumbing though a photo album. I asked a question about the photo and she said: ""if you want to learn about tea, you can find more information on our website.""

I'm not sure why I paid $50 to be directed to google..."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2019-11-06,5.0,"Such a fun time! Wandering in it was such a pleasant surprise. Not your average tea shop, this is a full on experience. Starting with the tea pet, to the multiple brews with staff thoughtfully explaining the differences in each brew of the tea, we learned a lot and had a blast. And the tea was so tasty! Dee was also such a great host and a delight. Definitely coming back."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2018-10-14,5.0,"The Tea Drunk visit for me was some part tasting, some part meditational, some part educational, and all good.  This Chinese Tea House is wholly backed-up by the owner's deep passion and true understanding of the origin, harvesting and development techniques of the tea as well as their effect on your senses.  Once you understand the very historical methods and the owner's hands-on process for bringing these scarce teas to NYC, you should not argue with the price.
Tea Drunk is a great place to meet your group before dinner, after dinner, or to catch up with good friends on a lazy weekend afternoon."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2019-04-06,5.0,"Short review. BEST PLACE EVER! Amazing energy, very relaxing and refreshing! The price can pull you away but then you hear all about the process and where it grown which pulls you back and want to come again."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2017-07-14,5.0,"Some people have noted here that the owner and her staff have a tendency to being a little curt. I have experienced that myself here but only the briefly for the first time I was here. Shunan (the owner) opened this shop all by herself and worked insane hours before to keep it open and I imagine that can be quite draining. After talking to her a bit more, she opens up and has a lot of knowledge to offer. 

This is not a place that you would find your traditional ""western"" teas (English breakfast, Darjeeling, etc) since they specialise Chinese teas. The menu itself has expanded a lot since I first came almost a year ago but it's still chinese focused. 

I've come here alone a couple times and brought friends along the way. I'd suggest a tasting for two people (like green tea tasting, especially if you've never had chinese tea) or a single tea for one person. It's a lot of liquid to drink at once if you're not used to doing these sort of things. 

A bit about my experience. Every time I've come here, Shunan has served me herself and explained the differences of the teas and what each pour brings out and why she's pouring them in specific ways. She also gives a history of the teas and what makes them distinct. If you're interested in the process of making tea, she also has a lot of experience roasting tea herself so ask her about it! 

This is the sort of place where you should come for a learning experience. You're able to escape from the craziness of east village for a bit and just be calm for an hour."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2019-02-10,5.0,"My friends and I reserved tickets for the ""Regular Guided Tea Tasting"" and found the entire experience to be beautiful. The space was well designed and felt open yet cozy. We were greeted warmly even though we showed up 15 minutes early. (I don't recommend doing this as they then have to rush to set up but they were kind in their approach.)
Onto the tea experience! Our guide was kind, helpful, knowledgeable, and a really great person to talk to. She answered all of our questions and really explained the significance of each step in the process. It was lovely to experience something that came so naturally to her out of passion and appreciation. The selection of teas for our tasting were complimentary with each other and allowed you to really notice the difference between the them. 
This guided tasting was made to feel welcome for all people with any level of tea experience.
The only downside, as with most buildings in this area is that I'm not sure if it's walker/ wheelchair/ or power chair accessible."

Great big story

Searching for china's anciejt tea leaves"
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2018-05-08,4.0,"My boyfriend and I really enjoy tea -- it's been a great way to drink something different without resorting to alcohol or coffee all the time (I mean, let's be honest, we don't need that _every_ single day). So one day, hungover as we were, after a quick yelp search, we headed to Tea Drunk. 

There was a Caucasian man minding the store (odd, I mean I expected the full Asian experience) but he was knowledgeable enough. While customer service wasn't exactly what I would consider his strengths (hence the four stars), the tea was tasty and the ambiance was relaxing. You could really taste the difference between the different tea leaves and the overall experience was exactly what we needed to cure our hungover selves. 

Note: Don't come here expecting any fancy flavored tea, but you will get some great traditional green, oolong and other blends of tea. Definitely worth swinging by if you're up for trying something different!"
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2018-05-13,5.0,"The art of tea presented to you in a cozy Chinese interpretation of a tea room. Great for a small group or an individial meditation with tea.  Their tea pets, or little animal statues you get to choose each time you go is very cute. I love the yellow and green teas here, and quiet soothing atmosphere. I like that the owners go to Asia to hand pick their teas, and the people working there are definitely passionate about tea. I frequent this place as it is very calming and relaxing."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2015-03-11,4.0,"Cute, low-key spot for some traditional Chinese regional teas. They specifically serve Chinese teas, and it is a fairly good list. This is a great place for conversation. We easily spent about two hours here over a pot.

In terms of decor, very casual, homely and welcoming, almost like you are stepping into someone's house and preparing yourself for some homemade tea. The menu is vast in high-quality Chinese teas, and they provide a nice short description for each tea available. We chose a Green Tea, the Bi Luo Chun - East Mountain, Dong Ting (The First Pluck 2014) -- Sharp, floral and fruity with notes of toasted rice. They come served in 'Pao' ($30/Pao for Bi Luo Chun), or a serving of tea. A pao of tea can yield more than ten steeps depending and can be shared with up to four people. Between the two of us, it lasted a good two hours, though you will note more bitterness towards the end of the serving. A server will come by to refill the pot with hot water as it reaches the end.

Tea Drunk provides a very calming, soothing atmosphere. If you are a fan of teas, regional Chinese specifically, you will additionally appreciate what Tea Drunk has to offer."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2016-11-11,5.0,"Definitely a one of a kind experience! 

My best friend and I came here to celebrate her birthday. Both of us love tea and we wanted to expand our palettes. 

The tea room was empty and we were greeted by the owner. I asked her to recommend a tasting menu for us and she pointed us to the wu long tasting due to wu long's variety of flavors. 

While waiting for the owner to assemble the cups and get the tea leaves, my best friend and I each chose a tea pet. (They drink the tea with you :) )

The owner prepared wu long tea in three categories. The tie guan yin, pheonix tea, and cliff tea. She was very knowledgable about each tea and was eager to teach us. She was also very friendly and we ended up staying an extra hour to chat with the owner about tea and eventually we talked about other things as well ^_^ . 

The owner even brewed us the green tea samples for free! (I think she wanted to make green tea for herself but ended up sharing with us) 

While the teas are a bit expensive, I think they are worth the price due to the quality of the tea in addition to the knowledge coming out of the experience. Each tea in the wu long category had its own distinct taste. The tie guan yin was a gentle aromatic tea. The pheonix tea had a subtle passionfruit flavoring and blended perfectly with the tea. The cliff tea was the strongest tea and had the most earthy flavor. I highly suggest ordering the wu long tasting! 

Also, come on a weekday when there are less people. My best friend and I came on a Friday and the place was empty. The owner will give you her full attention :) ."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2017-01-16,2.0,"Happy to found this place and disappointed after experiencing it! 

Happy to find this tea place which is exactly of my kind. I explored many places here in NY and finally happy with tea drunk. 
I could not understand why the menu is so overpriced. Because it's New York? Because there are no other competitor to serve tea this way? Because the tea is expensive? Don't know but it is not only overpriced but crazily overpriced. 
Not happy with the shopkeeper/tea person/staff. One of them, seems like owner, was talking a lot, explaining about tea but don't understand what she is talking! May be more informative than I need. Not friendly, welcoming and cozy though the teawares, and ambience is great. Only because of that your first visit will be worthy - I am damm sure nobody repeatedly go here without specific purpose."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2015-12-30,5.0,"It was such a unique experience in the city. 

We, a group of three, shared a pot of one of their ""real"" black teas. The tea pets were cute, the tiny cups were cute, the sieve holder was cute, and the tiny game sets they had out for people to play was cute... The server was very knowledgeable and personable. The clientele was very friendly as well. The owner lady took over at the end of the service and it did take a bit of work to catch her attention. I saw a lot of reviews complaining about the owner's attitude but I think she just cares more about her tea than getting money off of people. It can be a divisive factor for others, so I am mentioning it, but it wasn't so for me. 

It's a no-fuss Chinese tea service: just straight up steepings, no food. The menu was almost overwhelming, which is the one thing I can really pick on about the place. Some people may enjoy the museum - like collection of teas but frankly, I would have preferred smaller, more distinct selection. It would be hard for beginners to get to enjoy this place. 

Overall, it is a tad expensive but the experience can entertain you for many hours. Splitting a pot between. 3-4 people seems like the way to go, since it works down to about $5-10 per person, about an average amount you would spend at a cafe in the city. It's so unique and charming, though, so it was perfect for catching up with friends and hanging out for hours. I would visit again if I was in the city with tea - loving friends!"
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2017-11-08,5.0,"After gorging on delicious food all day, we decided we needed a pick me up/help digesting what we ate. We found this was nearby and decided to stop by. 

We were greeted by the tea host who advised first thing that all of their teas were caffeinated and that it was a traditional tea house. We acknowledged and proceeded to our seats. After looking at the intensive menu, we decided on a green tea (unfortunately my memory does not extend that far to remember the name) but it was the first one on the list. We were told that all green teas get four brews. She also asked us to pick a tea spirit animal; we chose marcel, who bubbles btw, it was the cutest thing ever. 

We spent a good hour here and it was relaxing. Felt much more digested and alert upon leaving. 

The tea host was very kind and explained everything in great detail. 

The only problem was the bathroom. My friend who used the bathroom mentioned that the window was almost see through/cracked open and she heard people rustling around, which made her uncomfortable. 

Besides that, if you need a place to relax in the city, make sure you come here!"
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2018-01-15,5.0,"A sacred place for real tea drinker.

My husband is a complete tea drinker - he drinks tea down to the specific flush and different names, the way you name Pokemon kind of naming system for the teas that he drinks.

He found out about this place from google search because we were at another tea place before it and had extra time to chill more.

This is a traditional Chinese tea house that serves only tea, and they do really well. They gave you everything you need to do tea right, and they do it for you.

The menu is extensive, and if you know tea, you know what you are reading. It is like reading the Chinese herbs from the Chinese medicine index book. 

The tea was prepared just right and the environment was conductive to pleasurable tea drinking activities.

Tea-drinking husband loved it, and I loved it too. I drink tea for pleasure, he drinks tea to savor. We both had a great time and will go back again."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2016-03-28,4.0,"Whoo hoo, another tea room located!  I happened upon this cute little tea room by accident in the East Village.  The name was intriguing so I had to stop by.  

Unlike my usual haunt in Berkeley, Tea Drunk has a bar made of wood that has a drainage system for tea like Teance does.  But they also have individual tables that has a slot underneath that also drains tea which is so cool!  They also have a variety of tea tools, tea pots, and cute little tea pets.  I drank with Abu, the monkey tea pet.

But onto the tea.  They have a good variety of different teas from oolong to red tea to green tea etc.  I also learned cliff tea is a varietal of oolong tea-- pretty cool.  Prices are about what I'm used to at Teance but I would say that their collection of tea seems smaller than Teance's.

In the end, I tried their tea that came from a monk.  This monk doesn't want his tea to be sold-- if you want to taste it, by all means do so.  Instead, you donate for that tasting, whatever you want.  Other teas were around 9 bucks.  But this monk's tea is an amazing red tea.  Not too sweet or bold, just mellow.  

The server was knowledgeable and efficient in getting the teas brewed and he also seemed very personable.  I can't wait to come back on my next trip to NY."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2014-01-20,4.0,"Tea Drunk is a great little teahouse in the East Village.  My two friends and I came on a Saturday afternoon and though most of the tables were taken, we managed to get a table for three in the back.

The woman who seated us told us that each pot is meant to be shared between 2-4 people. We took a look at the extensive tea menu and had absolutely no idea what to order. Each tea comes with a description, typically detailing the region it comes from and the season during which the leaves were harvested - but unless you actually know this stuff about tea, the descriptions won't be very helpful in actually choosing one. We ended up asking about the differences between the different green teas, and the woman there was extremely helpful in describing the differences in taste and flavor. She said that in general, tea leaves harvested earlier in the season are better.

We started off with the Bi Luo Chun, one of the green teas. Watching the woman pour the tea was mesmerizing... she put the leaves into some kind of glass with knobs on the side (which I'm sure has an official name; I just don't know it) and explained that the leaves' corkscrew shape lets them sink to the bottom to steep. After a few minutes, she poured the tea from the glass into a teapot, and then into our tiny teacups. The tea itself was very light and fragrant. We got about three brews out of the Bi Luo Chun.

We also ordered one of the Half Cliff teas (not sure which one because my friend ordered it while I wasn't there). The woman prepared it for us once again, this time pouring out the first brew, which she said is typical of most teas besides green tea. This tea had a much stronger flavor than the Bi Luo Chun. 

We ended up sitting there for about two hours enjoying our two pots of tea. The ambiance is very zen, and the noise level sometimes became very quiet. There's a big table in the back that can fit six people, but Tea Drunk is best suited for groups of four or less. Overall, it's a great place to spend a lazy afternoon with a few friends."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2018-07-28,5.0,"A friend and I had a flight of tea while chatting away an afternoon. The server explained the teas we were drinking, showed us how to pour it (including rinsing the so cool tea pet - if only those were for purchase!) and was nonetheless unintrusive. It was a relaxing, relaxed afternoon and I look forward to going back."

187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2017-04-01,1.0,"For purchase, limited selection (compared with Palais Des Thés or Mariage  Frères​). For tasting, very rude and mincing staff. And they make you feel ridiculous if you want something they don't have.  We went all the way from UWS to this tea shop. Upon arrival, we said we are here to buy tea. We wanted to use the bathroom but the staff was like ""it's for customer only!"". So I should assure my purchase before borrowing the bathroom? I told her we did not enter her boutique for the bathroom but for the tea. She did not say anything.

I asked for a specific tea, the answer was that this tea is not that special, it's just one of a family. Of course I know that: after all, they are all from tea tree which grows in soil! Anyone from service industry would say : that is a good choice, but unfortunately we don't have that. We do have something similar. Here at Tea Drunk they just make you feel ignorant and ridiculous.

At this small place, Chinese tea first-timer would be easily amazed to learn something  more original than boba tea and Earl Grey. But why choose here when there are plenty other places you get tea as well as good service!"
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2017-06-04,5.0,"This is a store for people who are looking to get into tea. Compared to David's tea, it's like the specialty coffee shop to your usual Starbucks. The owner is extremely knowledgable and her assistants are really well versed in tea knowledge as well.

The prices are quite high, some teas could cost upwards of $40 per set. What you get are the cream of the crop teas with some great background stories where the teas were grown, how they were harvested, etc if you wish to know.

The prices are well justified because of the amount of leaves they provide in the ceremony. Most places give a tiny of leaves while Tea Drunk does the proper pot for the ceremony.

The tea selection isn't very large because they focus on traditional Chinese teas so you won't find Earl Grey or hibiscus teas here but if there's a tea category you can think of, they probably have a wide selection of it in their menu. Most teas are about $25 sharable between two people and should last about 3 pours, or 45 mins for the full ceremony depending on how fast you drink."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2017-04-19,3.0,"Being raised on good Chinese teas and having fond tearoom experiences, I was really excited to find a traditional Chinese teahouse on the LES. Unfortunately, my experience at Tea Drunk wasn't as memorable as some of the other tea houses I've been to.

The tea itself was OK, my friend and I went for one of the lower priced selections (at around ~$20), and since we sat at the bar the owner brewed for us. Thinking back to it I can hardly remember the taste of the tea at all, and I'm not sure if the price paid justified the quality of the leaves. No traditional tea snacks on the menu which I found disappointing since I consider it part of the teahouse experience. 

Beyond that, I was surprised at how little information was given to us on the brewing process by the owner. This was my friend's first experience with Chinese Tea ceremony and she was bursting with questions for the staff. Most of the time she was provided with curt answers, if any at all. I think it's a shame the staff didn't put more time in explaining the process and traditions behind the tea ceremony.

THE SKINNY: A good place to park on a rainy day for a no-frills cup of tea. Best if you're not a first Chinese tea-timer. Avoid if you're looking for a true Chinese tea room experience."
187,tea-drunk-new-york-2,2015-12-03,5.0,"I truly love this place! I stumbled upon it one rainy day when I was trying to avoid the rain and I have been back many times since. The owner travels to China to get her teas directly from farmers who specialize in growing tea.  Each time I have been here I sampled one to three teas depending upon how much time I had. All of our servers were very knowledgable about the teas we tried. 
They have a few games available to play, we have played two games of chess. There are smalle tables in the front and the back of the place and bar seating in the middle.  

There are also a bunch of clay animals on the chelves and you cna bring one to your table as a tea pet/drinking buddy.  I chose a bird and eggs one time which you can see in one of my photos. This is strictly a tea room, there is no food served and there is no herbal nor flavored tea."

Me and my friend walked in, very excited to try this place but was immediately met with a horrible greeting. We had a paper cup in our hands and the lady at the counter said we couldn't bring drinks inside, which is completely understandable. My friend politely asked her if they had a garbage can and the lady replied saying we could not throw out our cups inside the establishment..
..... So we walked outside to throw our cups out at big gay ice cream's garbage can but we were so turned off by her immediate animosity and decided to take our business elsewhere. Whoever this lady is, was a terrible host."

My girlfriend and I live nearby and the selection here is constantly rotating. Our faves are: Key lime pie, Chocolate chess pie, ANY of the cookies, the pizzas...forget it, literally everything is amazing--and made with so much heart. They're now offering grain bowls, lunch deals ($15 for a drink, pizza or sandwich and a pastry) If they'd let me, i'd just camp out in the shop! 

p.s check out the wallpaper--I love the ode to the neighborhood F train, the small details everyone is where it's at!"
188,partybus-bakeshop-new-york,2019-12-17,5.0,"Partybus is a welcoming, campy little nook slinging buttery and flavorful wares to tempt any sugar-crazed flamingo-flecked heart.

The LES is CROWDED with incredible baked goods and Partybus stands up to the legends with confidence. If you need a destination pastry, it's the rose-pistacchio croissant. The filling is delightfully sticky (like an excellent baklavah) & fragrant of rosewater without being soapy. It's satisfyingly flaky and has a forward butter flavor that's heavenly. Yes, i understand all croissants are made with butter, but something about the quality of the ingredients really shine on the butter taste. It's like spending your whole life eating KeyFood presalted butter then someone butters your rolls with organic grass fed freshly churned upgrade. The RPC has been irresistible, I've ordered it every visit & it's been a consistent delight.

Once they had a sammich named, ""This Is MY Sandwich"" & i implore you to order this if it ever returns to the menu. Moist carved turkey, stuffing, fresh cranberry relish, shaved brussel sprouts & a firm white cheese that yields to a gooey stretch after the masterpiece on a mini baguette is toasted; i hope i remember the full kinetic experience of luxuriating in that sandwich until i die.

My favorite time to visit a business is in their early days during their experimental phase. Partybus puts out seasonal treats so stop by & order with your eyes. The goods taste even better than they look. 

For any grinch who wants to gripe about prices ($5 for the RPC, $3 per palm-sized choc chip cookie) I'd point out the obvious quality of the ingredients and high skill level in the kitchen. Even still, there's a combo offer for a sandwich, dessert & beverage for $15 which is super."

This one is also instantly one of my favorites, as the cookies and croissants I just tried were incredible. They are some of the best cookies in the city, of the non-giant Chip/Levain variety.

Get the flaky little croissant too, which is exceptionally good. The chocolate croissant is too, made with buckwheat flour.

It was stuffed with almond paste and chocolate and the croissant was so flaky and delicious! I also got the peanut chocolate cookie which was good as well.

$12 later for a bowl half the size I get in LA, I got watery, subpar açaí bowl. They blend it with frozen strawberries and had chunks in it that weren't blended well. There were barely any toppings and was an overall disappointment. I've been to Brazil half a dozen times and had açaí everywhere in the states and was never this disappointed. Not coming back."

I ordered their special green juice, which was a dollar more expensive than most of the other drinks on the menu. After tax, my 16oz juice was close to $8 - which seemed a reasonable price to pay for all of the veggies it included. I chose this particular juice because I wanted more greens and less fruits. The juice itself tasted really healthy, but was a little too heavy on the ginger for me. Unfortunately, the veggies and fruits they use are room temperature, so the juices come out lukewarm, which I didn't really like. I had some juice leftover that I put in the fridge overnight and actually thought it tasted much better cold.

Their recipes were pretty decent though; I just would've liked their ingredients to be fresher.

Also sells a variety of individually wrapped snacks and baked goods"

Lotsss of smoothie and other drink options with your choice of base (juices, milk,etc)

Vegan/vegetarian snacks

a small juice will only cost you about $4 which is less than half of what you would pay at juice press, organic ave, etc. The bottled cold press juice is $9 but the fresh juice is so much better. 

This place offers other items such as coffee, tea, smoothies, cupcakes/muffins/cookies and soup. I have only tried one soup here which was the broccoli cheddar and it was good.

I got the peanut butter acai bowl and it was beyond what I imagined in terms of peanut butter.  It tasted like I'm eating sweetened peanut butter the whole time.  It was over whelming and gross.  If it didn't cost me 12+$ since I sub almond milk for Apple juice I would have tossed it after the 1st bite. Halfway after force feeding myself, I felt sick and my stomach knotted.  

In addition to the acai bowl I got their double banana chai.  It's shake my head bad.... Aside from banana the other ingredients included whole milk and some type of syrupy sauce. I tasted nothing fresh about it."

I think everything is relatively priced well for the freshness. They take cards now but charge a fee if it's under a certain amount so I'd suggest bringing cash. They make everything on the spot so it can be a 5-10 minutes wait easily. They have a bench outside to stay (the inside is easy too small) or its only a block away from Tompkins square park.

189,juicy-lucy-juice-bar-new-york,2015-03-12,5.0,"I love it so much. I get a smoothie here almost every day. Their orange juice is to die for. The prices are reasonable you can get an entire gallon of pressed juice for half the cost of something from the juice chains that are all the rage. They're always pleasant - they make it quickly. There is never really a line. Highly recommended! Also, my boyfriend loves their gluten free breads (he's not gluten free, I think that says alot).

Cash only!"
189,juicy-lucy-juice-bar-new-york,2017-02-08,1.0,"What they serve here can hardly be called a smoothie? If you want a 7 dollar slushee handed over with an attitude, come here. Majority ice and doesn't taste healthy or fresh probably because everything they use is frozen.

Tasteless, guy at the counter seemed annoyed I was there seeing as I interrupted him on his phone. Not helpful at all with what's in the smoothies and just plain snarky and rude."

189,juicy-lucy-juice-bar-new-york,2012-01-16,3.0,"I am having a mixed feeling on Juicy Lucy. After I completed a juice cleansing  program, I have been on a lookout for a closer-to-reality price for natural organic pressed juice. I heard Juicy Lucy is cheaper than major players out there so I stopped by to pick up a bottle of All Green. It is $6.5 a bottle, expensive but about $2 cheaper than other places. I was so excited about that I took a big sip and thought it would be a great movie theater beverage and God was I wrong. It had an odd after taste, possibly from cucumber or celery. The ginger or juice inside did not seem to help either. I am sure it is probably the healthiest juice out there since I don't even taste any bit of sweetness. However, I would rather eat salad in this case. I did pick up a slice of banana bread and it was nutty, soft and sweet. 

I might still return to try other ""juices"" that do not contain so much vegetables. I hope it will taste better."

189,juicy-lucy-juice-bar-new-york,2011-08-14,2.0,"I'm sad to say this because I LOVE smoothie/juice bars and it's such an endearing hole-in-the-wall local business, but I had a puke-worthy experience here. 

The first time I tried Juicy Lucy, it was alright. Not very memorable because I can't remember what I had--maybe carrot/papaya? It was lukewarm and the texture was a little chunky for my taste. The second time, I was feeling a bit low on my veggie intake so I chose this drink with lots of greens. The guy said in a subtly warning tone, ""Just so you know, this has ginger in it."" I nodded, not understanding at the time. 

Now, I normally like green beverages and they don't gross me out at all! I love me some Naked Green Machine and I've tried wheatgrass shots and it ain't no thang. But when I had this particular Juicy Lucy green drink...

Oh my Lord.

It was disgusting. The ginger was more than a ""kick,"" it was like a punch in the gut. The taste of the vegetables was not offset enough by apple juice or whatever else would make it more bearable. All I could think to myself was, keep it together, finish this thing you just paid 5+ bucks for. But I couldn't. The combination of the lukewarm temperature, the sharp ginger combined with the assorted greens was too much for me.

Now I just stick to Lite Delights on Houston for my smoothies, but if I ever return to Juicy Lucy I will be sure to try something fruity."
189,juicy-lucy-juice-bar-new-york,2015-10-13,1.0,They don't use actually mango for the smoothies it's just like a syrup flavoring which sucks. But off to find another place.
190,rebel-coffee-new-york,2020-01-02,5.0,"I really love this place. I first discovered it about a year and a half ago, when I was studying for the bar exam. I used to come here every day, because it's a great place to sit down and focus. I appreciate the chill vibe, the good quality of the drinks (I've had their teas and their hot chocolate), the ambient ""NYC coffee shop"" music that plays in the background, and the friendliness of the staff. 

I particularly appreciate that if you get a point card, they've started holding on to them for you at the shop, so you don't have to worry about looking for it every time you visit. 

I also really appreciate the effort they put into creating the ideal coffee shop ambiance. Besides the music, there are cute and quirky pillows in the windows, two heated windowside seating/reading nooks, and excellent interior decor that makes the place feel warm and welcoming. 

Be warned that there is no bathroom here (If I'm there for a while, I use the one at a nearby tavern), and that the place is pretty small. But they do serve beverages (and pastries) to go."

Small and causal around the corner coffee and tea place. There are a few tables with seating; a very simple place. It also offers a few basic pastries, nothing fancy and doesn't seems like they were made in house. Free WiFi and charging station, if you want to get out of the house and do some work.

- they open at 7am on the weekends, when nowhere else good is open, which is great when you're woken up by your dog at 6:15am each day

- great oat cappuccino 

5 stars!!!!!"

Barista said dogs aren't allowed, which is fine, but then another employee harassed my friend by (falsely) claiming that emotional support dogs ""aren't a real thing according to the DOH.""

It's on the smaller side with about 5 tables and a few seats at the bar. They offer a good selection of coffee and tea drinks alongside yummy pastries. The space itself lets in a ton of natural light from the big windows in the front and the staff are very friendly. The only downside is that there is no public restroom here, but if you're looking for a relatively quiet coffee shop to read or get some work done in, I would recommend this place."

Seems like they could benefit from a no-laptop policy on weekends, as I watched a few people come in then change their minds and walk out again when they saw there was no seating."
190,rebel-coffee-new-york,2018-09-19,2.0,"A very no-frills coffee shop, the one upside is that Stumptown is used for the drip coffee here.

The decor is my favorite part (the photo taken in Chinatown against the exposed brick wall is a setup I want to have in my own bedroom!). 

The only downfall was the fact that there's no bathroom, which is important to know if you plan to find a cafe to stay for a while."

First impression was good - very chic ambience with a bunch of people working on their Macbooks and sipping on coffee. It was extremely quiet and no place to sit - that was the first negative, but you can't judge a place because it's popular. 

What really disappointed was the actual product they served. We had a coffee and a hot chocolate and both of them were extremely bland and watered down. The hot chocolate tasted like warm milk with a hint of chocolate buried somewhere. The coffee was pretty much the same. I hope this was an abberation and not the norm! So unfortunate."
190,rebel-coffee-new-york,2018-05-03,2.0,"I am on a crusade to try a new coffee shop every day on my way to work until I find one I can't live without. This is not the one.

There was one person, completed drink in hand, on line when I walked in. She and the barista were chatting. No biggie, I wanted to peruse the menu anyway to find the most tempting item on a day that was heating up. They continued to chat as I scanned the menu finding no iced options, panic beginning to itch at me. Decided that when I was acknowledged I'd ask if it were possible to get something black and iced. Waited a good 3-4min to be acknowledged at 820am on a weekday. When I was the only un-served guest in the place. ::upside down smiley face emoji:: 

Finally I asked about an iced coffee...perhaps a cold brew? Question was met with hesitation...turned my panic itch to an all over uneasy feeling. Apparently they ""can make"" iced coffee...and when I asked about a cold brew, they had stumptown bottles in the mini fridge behind the counter. I was warned it'll cost $1.50 more. I'll take it...over your hesitant to respond about iced coffee.

Anyway, stumptown was good, but I already knew that. Aside from the lackadaisical service and the limited iced options, ambiance was cute and the location is nice for a sunny morning walk. But, nevertheless...moving on to the next coffee shop tomorrow..."
190,rebel-coffee-new-york,2016-11-08,4.0,"Rebel is a bit of a misnomer in this tranquil, homey yet upscale coffee den, unless you factor in the bunkered down woman who had turned the 4 person window seat, into her own personal bed with her mactop, snacks and books sprawled out on the full sized mattress.

You could hear a pin drop as hip and well healed customers, busy on laptops, took over the few sitting areas in similar fashion.

You could hear a pin drop, with maybe faint instrumental spa music, just off 12th @ 8th avenue, a Zen world away from the midtown fervor I had escaped from.  

A $3.25 Americano was clean with good flavor, which I took outside to a large wood bench with an unusually peaceful 8th avenue on a warm sunny November day.

Food inside consisted of a truly tempting designer donut case, where conscientious and calculating put together clerks doubled as attendants at a boutique hotel lobby in perhaps Portland Oregon. 

Rebel is cute and ultra hang outable even though space is limited especially with the self centered table hogs, that appeared quit at home.

You will too, if you can snag a table.  
If you want to do work here, just arrive early.

Coffee - real good.
Space - quiet and unusually relaxing as a yoga studio."

190,rebel-coffee-new-york,2019-04-24,4.0,Cute little place to work with chill music and a village feel. Donut was good and 100% natural organic granola bar was amazing. Iced coffee was above average (so many places can not get iced coffee right). But....really took issue with the place not having a bathroom. You know they have one but don't let patrons use it. Come on if you serve food you should allow customers to use bathroom...even in NYC! Guess they don't want people staying too long and they can get away with it.
190,rebel-coffee-new-york,2018-06-11,5.0,"Great coffee shop. 

Coffee here is well crafted and price isn't jacked up like most places. 

The space is modern yet rustic and the mood is laid back. Very calm environment in a crazy fast paced city. 

Most of the people here are on their laptops (they have wifi) keeping to themselves getting work done. My type of place (dont bother me). 

They have a selection of treats from local bakeries and donuts from underwest donuts, all are very good. 

The people who work here are friendly and know their coffee the asian guy with the lip ring makes the best coffee here and hes nice to look at too (wink wink). 

Definitely a coffee shop to visit."
190,rebel-coffee-new-york,2018-07-30,4.0,Good coffee and super cool atmosphere. Definitely understaffed (1 Guy running the counter) but that was to be expected on a Monday morning. Iced coffee was great. If you're in the area definitely give Rebel Coffee a try!
190,rebel-coffee-new-york,2016-06-05,3.0,"Pretty cute place in the West Village. The woman at the counter was bubbly and humorous as she recommended donuts to try. She joked it's the best and worst thing since we might get addicted. My friend got the honey lavender and I took a bite, interesting herby flavor. 

It was about 1 PM and I hadn't had coffee yet, so got a 16 oz drip which did the job and gave me a second wind. They brew Stumptown beans, it was pretty standard, mild tasting good coffee. Brew strength was a little watery and not as strong concentration as I like, but then again I'm used to Philz which is about 2x your regular coffee strength."

190,rebel-coffee-new-york,2018-12-28,2.0,"The place is a bit small so if you are planning on doing work there you may not be able to find a seat. The interior is trendy and they played chill music, which gave a good vibe. My huge issue was with the person behind the counter, he was dismal. Didn't say hello, how are you, what can I get you, do you know what you want, any questions.....literally nothing! He just stood at the register looking at me. Not only that, but after he made my espresso I said ""have a good day,"" and he just looked at me not responding.

The espresso was good, but after not feeling welcome, I don't think it's worth it one bit. There's plenty of other places out there that are better and have a nicer staff. 

Also....no Apple Pay, only Samsung pay.....definitely a little odd."

Only draw backs...it's kind of small so there is not a ton of seating. Speaking of seating...they have a great window seat, just wish it was a bit more cozy.

Two issues:
- if you want a snack, you really only have a sweet option (they do have oatmeal though) - wish they had some fruit or something
- no bathroom! This is my biggest issue. 

Plan accordingly!"

191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2019-12-06,4.0,This place is very understated and does not feel corporate at all.  What it does do well is the coffee.  I had a latte and the barista knew what he was doing.  The one on University has a cozy feel almost like you are in someone's living room.  Nice place to grab a brew.
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2019-09-20,4.0,"Tiny spot. Maybe seats 6 tops. Great vibe. Very friendly/chatty. Felt very welcomed and instantly comfortable. They also are always very chill with me bringing my dog inside, which is nice (he's little and I keep him in a bag).
I get a black iced coffee and it is solid- smooth and no heartburn after:D"
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2020-03-27,5.0,Get a coffee and don't forget the banana bread! I the staff is always so nice and helpful and the coffee is great!
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2020-02-01,5.0,Madman is  awesome! I really like their plain coffee but I LOVE their americanos. The prices are really good and they give discounts to students which is  nice.
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2018-02-26,2.0,"Weak coffee, certainly not mad.  Don't get previous reviews.  The Americano had little flavor tasting like water.  Hey, were is the body.   Need to put a little Seattle into NYC.  2* because Motown was playing."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2019-12-28,5.0,Good little find away from the busy rush of the area. Warm and cosy interior with delicious coffee and some pastries.
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2018-03-05,5.0,"I love getting my daily coffee here because the staff are always friendly and warm, buy 7 drinks and you get the 8th free and the coffee is strong and smells great. 

I got some free cake today cos they're celebrating their 3rd year here! Happy anniversary madman!!!"
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2017-08-10,5.0,"Ground breaking espresso. Perfectly pulled; rich, full, sweet, yet bold. 

Mika and Michael are absolute gems. Third wave coffee needs more welcoming baristas like them. 

I'm definitely coming back, and y'all should definitely pay this place a visit. I promise you that you won't regret it."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2017-07-09,5.0,"My favorite coffee/espresso spot. I love all the locations I have been to. I'm a huge fan of the latte and the cold brew. But even more, I appreciate the great, friendly service.  in just a short time after I started making stops at Madman, I got to know the owners and staff as they got to know and welcome me. Even to the point where I can wave sleepily and be greeted by name and asked ""latte with regular milk?"" 

Also, my mom declares Madman the ""absolutely best mocha I have ever had!Absolute best ever."""
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2019-08-17,2.0,"I have been here so many times just coz I don't have a choice since another coffee shop opens at 11am, the lady who makes the coffee is on a power trip and just doesn't get the business sense. I have met the owner and he's super nice but when I go in it's usually the lady. I am so upset I won't be going there again."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2018-12-04,5.0,"Every time I come in I get more attached to this place. The Italian guy always keeps the space joyful. I really really feel more like home here, only that they close at 7. Just love this place sooo much!!!"
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2015-07-10,4.0,"Good coffee and Madmancino . A combo of chocolate chai and cinnamon with coffee.  This would be good as a dessert or if I were in a ski slope.  They should open in ski slopes.

A good rest stop from Washington Square Park."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2016-10-15,5.0,Really like their coffee. I had the pour-over this morning and it was silky smooth. So I had to go back during my lunch hour ... but they ran out of filters... guess it's really popular (and super cheap @ $2.75)... tried the almond croissant... thought it was not sweet enough and rather doughy
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2016-06-14,2.0,"Like all other students, I needed a quick coffee to wake me up prior to class. The service at Madmen was wonderful, but my drink today was awful. I ordered at small dirty chai latte with almond milk, my daily drink. So, when I took the first sip of my ""dirty chai latte"" I was shocked that my first reaction was to spit it out. It tasted like coffee infused water (the coffee flavor was more of an undertone compared to the water) with a spoonful of cinnamon to mask the unused almond milk. I threw my drink away after 3 sips. I had never been disappointed with Madmen in the past, but now it's unlikely that I'll return.
-S"
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2019-02-25,5.0,Great espresso. Stop here whenever I am in the neighborhood.  Introduced a friend to this location and he also liked.
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2016-08-07,5.0,Great vibe at this small coffee shop on University Pl and 10th St in the village. Collette made me a mean and great double espresso. Just $2.50!! Really great double espresso!!! So happy I stopped while driving up north on University Place!!
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2017-11-15,4.0,I ordered the cappuccino.Everything is perfect except the milk foam is not thick enough. Perhaps it is my problem because I chose the skim milk. Whole milk is the best for the cappuccino. Next time I will try the espresso. Recommend!
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2016-03-30,3.0,"Tiny place in a super cute part of Greenwich Village. I've never been to this particular location before (let alone University Place!), but they are a partner of the cups app so I decided to stop by. I wanted to try something new rather than the ol' latte, so I decided to order the Sarahbella, even though the Madmancino looked equally appealing. It's pretty much a spruced up latte with honey and cinnamon! 

They squeeze quite a bit of seating in here for such a tiny place, which means that it isn't necessarily comfortable and probably not somewhere you'd want to meet up with friends for an afternoon.

PS. They do have free wifi which is a plus, just ask the baristas for the password! 

PPS. There's a plaque on the door that says NO PETS, but they are very dog friendly. They even have a fish bowl of dog treats inside near the door."

Four Stars

Everything about this place is hilarious. The signage just makes you happy.  I had a cold brew from the Cups App. The classic plastic cup housed some decent coffee. The ice was imitation cold draft. The service was friendly. All in all a very good experience."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2016-01-04,5.0,"Madman Espresso is a fantastic little coffee shop, and I highly recommend it for anyone that needs their coffee fix. They have a great rewards system, where you can earn a free drink, and if you're a NYU student, you also get a nice discount.

The drinks are priced pretty fairly for a New York coffee shop, and their specialty drinks are especially delicious. The baristas are also super friendly and welcoming. The store itself is a little cramped, so it can result in some uncomfortable situations squeezing through people to order, but it isn't a huge problem. 

Madman has become one of my go-to places for a quick caffeine boost; shame it didn't come until my junior year."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2017-02-11,5.0,Great little spot! Normally don't get a latte but had some time to kill. Reminds of me coffee shops in Melbourne. Service was friendly!
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2018-01-23,4.0,"Cute little coffee shop, with a super authentic vibe that makes you feel like it's possible that they even grow the beans in the back. Not much room in the spot so I would not recommend bringing a laptop to sit down and do work. The cold brew I had though was just a really good cup of coffee, plain and simple, which in my experience is not that easy to find."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2018-05-24,5.0,"Definitely stop in this adorable shop. The owner is so cute and remembers everything about his regulars. I walked in and he was all how's your baby this, how's your cat that...it reminded me of old school New York. They don't make them like this anymore"
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2017-07-09,4.0,Nice small coffee place! Sunday afternoon was very quite and the neighborhood is perfect. If you need a coffee and you want to support local business this is the place!
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2016-10-06,3.0,"The iced coffee I got was pretty good. 

It's a very small shop like a hole in a wall. I missed it the first time I was looking for it and had to walk back to find it. 

Decor is pretty nice. Staff didn't seem like he wanted to be there."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2016-12-01,5.0,"Slightly pricier than their 14th St location (real estate, real estate), this Madman packs in even more charm and hominess into its tiny space. With tables to work and charming baristas, it's an ideal place to catch up on reading or work, surrounded by the smell of coffee beans and the whirring of espresso machines. People are constantly in and out, and it can be sometimes be hard to find a seat during peak hours. 

The brew never disappoints, and their original creations are worth a try if you're craving something sweeter/more complicated than a normal brew! I still prefer the other location because it's quieter and usually less crowded, though it's a smaller space, but I'm forever a Madman fan."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2015-06-26,4.0,"Madman Espresso uses the Cups App, which lets you save money on coffee while supporting local businesses (I think the plan that I'm currently using equates to about $2/cup). I can honestly say that $2.00 is a steal for any coffee in NYC, but is an especially great deal for Madman Espresso's delicious cold brew! I'm not sure if they sweeten it, but it was so good that I drank it as is, without milk or sugar. The pastries on display also looked good, and they have some interesting items on the menu, including a Dirty Chai and Red Eye. 

The place itself is a little small with only a couple of tables, and when I was there, either the AC wasn't working or they didn't have it. That's the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because I think it's nice when you can sit and hang out for a bit. However, if you just want to grab a coffee on your way to work or one of the many schools in the area, Madman Espresso seems like an excellent new option."

In one word: shakerato.  In two words: student discount.  In four words: thank you madman espresso."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2016-04-28,4.0,Small but nice.  On the route of my walk to Washington Square.  Nice expresso too.  There are a few seats by the window.
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2017-12-14,5.0,"Just about as good as it gets. 
Real espresso, friendly people, charming little (very little) place on an otherwise charmless section of University Place."
191,madman-espresso-new-york-5,2015-11-10,4.0,"This is my new favorite coffee shop north of Washington Square Park and around Union Square. Madman Espresso is a cute, tiny coffee shop in the middle of busy University Place. It's a great place to stop by for a cup of coffee on your way to the park, or up to the farmer's market at Union Square on the weekends. 

Get the Madmancino. It's a cappuccino with chai and chocolate - SUCH a treat! I'm usually the drip coffee kinda gal (gotta get that caffeine), but I was hooked on the first sip."
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2020-02-09,5.0,"We happen to find this place just walking and the $10 combo (coffee and sandwich) caught our eye.  It was also listed as one of the best egg sandwiches in NY. 

It is a tiny place but gives you real French vibes and is very cute inside.  We tried the breakfast sandwich with egg and serano and the basque sandwich that came with serano, arugula, cheese, and a sun dried tomato aioli.  The coffee was delicious, not bitter at all and I always appreciate coffee more when it's served in a cute cup and saucer.  The breakfast sandwich was so good, the soft scrambled eggs were delicious and the baguette was perfect.  The other sandwich was good to but definitely the egg sandwich was the real winner.  

Definitely pop by between 10am-3pm for their $10 combo, you will not be disappointed!"
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2020-03-16,4.0,"This is a quaint spot to pop in for a drink/food! There's a great $10 combo for coffee/espresso and a sandwich, and there's a pretty sizable list of sandwiches you can choose from. The lady working there speaks French and was very friendly. 

Unfortunately, there's not too much space, so probably wouldn't recommend sitting and eating if you are a 2+ party. Also, the drinks are a little bit on the pricier side (paid ~$6 for a chai latte), so just a heads up!"
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-09-26,4.0,Very cute hole in the wall coffee shop with organic le Colombe coffee. The pour could've been meager but the place itself and people working were kind and charming. Note: I didn't see any vegan pastries in their shelf when there!
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-09-11,3.0,"Was board of getting Starbucks all the time so decided to try one of the independent coffee shops doting NYC.

Lena is small, with a few tables scattered around the premise. The coffee shop sells an extensive amount of breakfast food. 

The coffee itself however is nothing to rave about. The quality of the beans seem average. I got a non fat latte and I felt the temperature was not hot enough. In addition the shop had no seasonings to put on your coffee. 

Overall an average coffee shop."
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-06-17,3.0,"The service was curt and unfriendly. Staffs were chatting even when I was standing in front of them ready to order. The sandwich was a sad affair. It was cold. It came with scrambled eggs, unmelted cheese, and ham. It was made easily from what I saw....just not worth the price. Latte was good but would be great if it came with a latte art since it's a coffee shop. Cute shop but overall it was a disappointment."
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-06-09,5.0,Cute little coffee shop in West Village! Service is quick and a very cozy intimate place. Highly recommend for a quick bite or coffee!
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2020-04-04,1.0,"Do not order from this place! It totally sucks and you don't get what you ordered. My wine spilled in the bag and ruined everything. Seamless
Is a PoS when dealing with issues. Called the cafe directly and told there was nothing they could do. Wouldn't even give me the manager probably because who i spoke to WAS the manager. $32 was basically stolen from me."
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-11-13,5.0,This place is the bees knees. I had my best coffee in NY here. And great almond croissant. And the staff are the nicest!!!! Adam rocks. The chef rocks. There was a nice European woman with blond hair that helped me too. She rocks. Love the heart here.

The had lots of milk alternatives including OAT MILK which is my fav! And their breakfast sandwiches are delicious (Serrano egg & cheese is amazing!) Friendly staff, quick service and delicious everything. I'm so glad we found this new spot in West Village!"
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2018-03-03,3.0,"Eh, wasn't impressed. There's almost no seating in here, first of all, so you're likely to lose out unless you get lucky or come super early. My friend and I did get lucky, but it's not really a comfy place to hang. 

As for the product - the drip coffee I had was good but not anything too special. The egg sandwich had an odd spice to it that was just overbearing. I wasn't a fan but I was starving so I wolfed it down anyhow. Finally, I asked for some tap water and was directed to the bottled water for sale in the cooler.

Next!"
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2018-12-01,5.0,They have the best chocolate croissant in the city!! It's THE best. I want to know who their vendor is.
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2018-02-08,2.0,"I was drawn by the rave reviews and also the claim that they have the 'best sandwiches' in NYC. Sadly, neither the reviews nor that claim lived up to my expectations. 

I ordered a flat white and the egg, cheese, and ham sandwich. The bread was only half toasted, so the other half was cold. The scrambled eggs in the sandwich were sad and soggy...my sandwich literally dripped the entire time I was eating it. The only redeeming part about the sandwich was the cheese. It was nice and sharp and added great flavor. Otherwise the sandwich was a disappointment overall. 

The flat white was also quite disappointing - it had way more foam than would be expected, and it tasted watered down. I try not to throw away expensive espresso drinks, but this was one that I could not finish."
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2020-01-04,5.0,This place is fantastic. Amazing drinks. Wonderful staff. Great pastries and egg sandwiches. And all just steps from Washington Square. I live in the neighborhood and go there regularly. At night it turns into a great little wine bar.
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-05-31,1.0,6 dollars for a latte with one shot of espresso and 20 ounces of milk. Felt like I was just drinking milk. I asked for a second shot and this was apparently baffling. Doesn't even taste much better with the 2nd shot. Don't bother. There's better coffee places around.
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-04-06,4.0,"Very small and quaint, but overall, I had a good experience coming here. The baristas were kind and joked around with me, which was nice to see. I ordered a latte with oat milk, which was on the average side of coffee for me. But! I was really impressed with their pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant), so unexpected, but so buttery and flaky, and the chocolate was so rich. I'll definitely be coming back for their pastries!"
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2018-01-06,5.0,"I visited NY back in August and checked out Yelp for some coffee shops around me. My name is Lena, so when I saw this coffee shop on Yelp, I knew I wanted to visit! 

I went with my friend and it was both of our first time at Lena. We asked the owner for recommendations and he gave us a lot of suggestions. He chatted with us while we ate breakfast. He was very friendly. 

The interior was very cute. It was cozy and inviting. I think this would be a good spot to meet up a friend for coffee or to quietly read while sipping on a cup of coffee. Check it out if you're around the area!"
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2017-10-15,4.0,"Despite being the tiniest little shop ever, Lena brews the best coffee and espresso drinks in my neighborhood. While there are a whole host of good coffee shops within walking distance of me, Lena is always my go to. Using Le Colombe beans and steaming the best milk makes the difference here so noticeable. Coffee is their strong suit.

The food, while very fresh and tasty, isn't the most unique. I will sometimes go for one of the sandwiches, but the coffee is the main pull. 

The service can be hot or miss. The one barista woman that works the most is very friendly and makes the best lattes. If you are looking for solid espresso and a little spot to relax for 30 minutes, this place is a good option."
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2019-08-26,1.0,"Not sure if it was the owner working the counter, but at the first sign of his pompous attitude I should have just left. He served me lukewarm coffee, pretended not to hear me as I asked for milk, although I was the only one in the cafe, and then took the milk out and didn't allow me to pour for myself, pouring literally two drops of milk into my coffee. I normally would not even bother to leave a review for a $3 cup of coffee but this man really just put a damper in my day. Needs a serious attitude adjustment or a new job."

192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2017-10-08,4.0,"Stopped by just to grab a sandwich for lunch and was surprised by how good it was. I've never been a fan of les sandwiches francaises because they're always so dishearteningly basic - white bread, butter, ham, maybe some cheese or other add ins. But my egg/ham/cheese breakfast sandwich merited its price somewhat with the awesome egg. Seriously - it looked like the kind of square egg sponge you get in places like Dunkin, but tasted like freshly made scrambled eggs seasoned with black pepper. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich wasn't gourmet fare or anything, but it was simple and filling and surprisingly good regardless."
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2018-03-30,5.0,Best cappuccinos and jambon buerre sandwiches!  Pierre makes like they do in France.  Crusty and chewy banquette.  Neighborhood gem. And he also has a wine bar nearby. Have been here everyday during our stay in the Village.
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2016-08-10,5.0,"Definitely a place exceeded my expectation - a combination of low-key ambience, well-balanced coffee and super nice barista; also 20% off Yelp check-in offer. It opened at 6:30am in the morning, so not crowded at all when I stopped by. Cannot think of something better!

It is just next to Le Pain, so keep going a little bit further until you see the small sign of Lena."

Lena is on the pricier side (for example, $5-$6 for the chai latte I like to get), but the quality is good. Their banana bread comes in a huge slice, and though it's a tiny bit dry sometimes it's homemade and a wonderful way to start the day. Their croissant is also fresh and tasty!"

I was feeling a flavored drink like caramel but they only offered regular lattes with chocolate flavoring? I thought that was a bit strange to only carry chocolate as your only option...considering its a coffee shop I expected a little bit more variety than that. I showed the cashier my yelp check-in for the % discount and then when he rung me up, the discount was missing. I JUST showed it to you and you already forgot? He seemed distracted/carefree-ish but I was still missing the customer service along with the lack of options for the drinks. The latte was just okay. Based on this one experience I can only provide two stars."

Now they also have croissants.  But the star is the almond cookies or almond macaron. 

Nice gift as well.  You may purchase it in tin cans as a good gift.  I know I would be delighted to receive any size tin can of those delectable cookies."
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2016-05-18,4.0,"Lena is a really adorable little coffee shop located near Washington Square Park. It is perfect for NYU students and coffee enthusiasts who just so happen to be in the area. 

I've been to Lena a few times and have gotten both their latte and their cappuccino. Both of them have been quite good, and are great options for those that desire something else that just a regular drip coffee. Their prices are pretty fair for the city, around 4-5 for a medium; I would highly recommend checking in here and taking advantage of their Yelp offer. It helps those who are trying to stay on a tight budget (like me!) 

They also have a nice rewards card, so make sure to use that! 
Baristas are also pretty friendly! Overall, Lena seems to stick to its motto (the art of coffee) quite well."
192,lēna-coffee-bar-new-york,2016-07-02,5.0,"The espresso is very, very, very good! 
(I am half Italian.. I know good espresso!)
This small coffee place has an excellent coffee.
And they are always very very nice."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-11-19,5.0,"Kodawari is a trendy, aesthetically-pleasing coffee shop and is a great place to get some work done. It's kinda small so it might be hard to snag a table on a busy day, but I went on a Saturday afternoon and was the only one sitting so it was fine. They have big windows in the front which really illuminate the space. It had a very peaceful atmosphere and the music was nice and calm and conducive to studying.

The barista was very friendly and was happy to answer my questions. (I feel like I annoy every barista with my inquiries about how sweet the chai latte is--I just hate an overly sweet chai!) I went with a simple iced coffee. The pastries looked really good too but I passed them up--they were a bit on the expensive side and I was feeling frugal, though judging by looks they're probably worth the price. 

The iced coffee tasted great--it was smooth and not too acidic, just the way I like it. They use big ice orbs instead of normal ice cubes--according to other yelpers this is so that it melts slower and doesn't water down your drink--and I'd say it worked pretty well! I drank my coffee slowly and it didn't get watery at all."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2020-03-09,4.0,"I was lucky to get a spot here as there's only 3 tables that sit two people on each. But it was nice to sit at the window and gaze outside. 

I got an oat latte and a scone, both were delicious, the price was cheaper than where I usually go. 

The barista was super friendly (& very handsome!). Didn't get his name but he was there on a Friday afternoon - noted some of the reviews said a couple of the baristas were rude, but not this guy. 

It's not the type of spot to work from all day but I would go back when I'm in the area."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2019-06-01,4.0,"A bunch of new/hipster coffee shops opening around Chinatown. Kodawari offers a pretty good selection of drinks and pastries. I stopped by for breakfast and coffee. The café is rather small, pretty much 3 small tables, seating for 8 people max. 

The coffee is flavorful, rich but not bitter. The only downside is that the establishment does not use dishes meaning that all drinks/food are served in single use plastics. Overall nice place to stop for coffee."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2019-07-19,3.0,"It really depends on which person is making your coffee. This is what I got this morning: (and did she ask me what is a flat white??)

3 stars because i always go to this place in the morning and they did pretty good job but this person is the one you'd better avoid to let her make your coffee."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2019-07-28,5.0,"This is a very small, cute place by the Grand Street D  train. It's literally a block away. I got an iced latte for 4.90! I really appreciated that it came with a ball of ice that kept the drink cold but not saturated by an over abundance of ice! The iced latte comes with whole milk! So if you're not a fan, ask for no milk and they have other milk including oat milk on the counter top! I got my drink to go, but there are three small tables with chairs and a huge window looking out the store. If I lived around here, I would love to come have coffee and read a book or do work."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2019-07-28,3.0,"Just stopped by here on Sunday to grab a super quick iced oat latte to rush to the train. The tall female barista worked there was a bit cold.. she didn't even tell me my latte was ready and just left it on the counter. I asked if she had a straw, I said thank you when she left it on the table, and got a ""mhm"" from her. OK meh.

The latte was ok, nothing too fancy. Would I come here again? I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if it's on the way, then maybe."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2019-11-07,5.0,The coffee here is phenomenal! If you get iced coffee they'll give you a huge ball of ice which is pretty funny.
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-07-02,5.0,"Very cute little cafe with exactly three two seater round tables. Extremely minimalist design with a limited menu of coffee drinks and pastries. I had the almond croissant which was quite good.

I would not recommend this place as an alternative to working from home because of its small size. There was one girl here attempting this and she was talking very loudly on conference calls for an hour+ and really killed the mood of the entire place. I'd suggest for the cafe to have a no laptop policy because it'd be best marketed as a stop and get a casual cup of coffee and snack, have a chat, and go."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-05-21,4.0,"I forgot to buy my wife coffee. 

Caffeine deprivation, pregnancy, and yours truly are the three things that make my wife the angriest, and they assembled like Voltron in this instance to create a perfect storm of rage.

Luckily, when this happened I was both (1) out of the house and (2) next to Kodawari. 

The nice staff of this adorable little shop didn't seem to understand my panic, but they happily ground some Kobi Trading Co. beans (fresh roasted by Unity*) and handed them to me along with a tasty mini-pastry to calm my nerves ($2-$4 depending on the selection), unknowingly saving my life. 

I do think $16 is a lot to pay for a pound of coffee, let alone 12 oz (the only size they offer I guess), but when I raced home and French pressed the shit out of it for the queen of my life, she nodded and said, ""It's good."" 

High praise.

193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-10-15,5.0,"I really enjoyed this place! I caught up on life with a good friend earlier and this was just the cozy place to do it on a gloomy day like today. 

When we arrived, there was a guy on his laptop. I felt like we were being rude just chatting, but hey, it's a coffee shop, not the library, right? 

We stayed for two hours chatting (even after we finished our drinks). We weren't forced to leave or anything- they have three 2-seat tables and it was a dull, windy Monday, so it wasn't crowded. 

The chai latte was tasty- thumbs up!! The interior is simple and aesthetically pleasing. It was so funny when the shop owners left the shop a few times for a while, just leaving us two in the shop. A few times, people stopped in, I would say they just stepped out- the guy would walk back in upon seeing a customer (I wonder where they went...).

Plus, maybe you'd get lucky and meet a very cute pup like I did. I met a doggo named Peanut and he was the sweetest boy ever :')"
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2020-02-23,1.0,"My friends and I were looking for a cafe in the area to do some some reading and homework on a Sunday afternoon and all the cafes that we usually go to were super packed. So we found this cafe, it's a pretty small cafe with 3 round tables. When we arrived at the cafe, the barista was staring at us with a annoyed face. There was a couple and a baby sitting in the cafe, chatting with the barista. The baby was just running around the cafe screaming, and even running into the kitchen where hot drinks were being made. Before we even ordered anything, the barista informed us that they close at 6pm in a rude tone (it was barely 5 when we got there). We ordered 2 matcha latte and a mocha, and it was pretty bad. The matcha lattes were very powdery and extremely foamy on the top,  and the mocha tasted like chocolate powder. The service was really bad, the barista had an attitude when he told us to pick up the drinks. He just yelled ""HEY"" and waited for us to grab the drinks so he can go back to chatting with his friends. It was also very hard to concentrate and do our work cause the baby was running around screaming the whole time, and the barista was singing random songs in the loudest possible tone as if the cafe was his own room."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-09-22,5.0,"Found this cute little cafe on yelp and decided to go. It's a small cafe with a minimal vibe. They serve they coffee with one big sphere cube instead of using a bunch of ice cubes, I thought it was pretty cool. However, they charge you an extra 50¢ for an iced drink. They don't tell you that they're going to charge extra, but I think they should put it on their menu so customer would know."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2020-02-23,1.0,"Came to this cafe on 2/23, Sunday 5pm. The moment we enter the guy barista already showed a sight of annoyance at us. When we tried to order he informed us that they're closing at 6pm with a really rude tone. I got a Mocha Latte which was really foamy on top, I barely able to finish it. As my friends and I was doing homework, all I heard is the barista singing some rock song super loudly and not to mentioned his attitude when he gave us the drinks, just a rude ""HEY"". I've been to many cafe and so far this is this worst one. If you don't want customers to come in while you're chatting with your friends on shift, simply flip the sign to CLOSE."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2019-05-13,4.0,"The cold brew was my order and boy did I choose a winner! The golf ball sized ice cube was a nice touch. THe coffee was so smooth and slightly chocolately not a hint of bitterness.

4 stars was because my wife's coffee was stale and she ended up ditching it. I knew she should have had a pour over but she can be impatient."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-12-17,1.0,"I was in New York for several events and always make it a point to support small businesses. I read some reviews about this spot and decided to give it a try. Great minimalist decor, decent coffee but awful, disrespectful customer service. 

I ordered a cortado and the guy behind the counter mentioned a sale on their pastries. Naturally, I also ordered a Kouign Amann which is one of my favorite pastries and I order it anytime I see it on the menu in a cafe. 

To my utter disappointment and surprise, the guy taking my order, without hesitating says, ""Nice pronunciation."" I glared at him, shocked, and to be honest disgusted at his backhanded compliment of my ""pronunciation"" as if I was not expected to know how to order from the menu. It is insulting to me that (1) you assumed I would not have the knowledge to read the menu and (2) that I don't read/speak French. 

I typically do not like to leave negative reviews but was compelled to bring this situation to light. If I make the effort to support a business, I expect to be treated with common decency and respect. I will not be returning to this place ever again."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2019-05-24,5.0,"Try the Bulletproof: coffee with ghee and coconut milk, aka my new fave. Counter guy is funny and I love the sphere ice cubes. Space is also super cute, but alas there isn't enough comfy seating for those kind of lounge-y coffee breaks."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-07-16,5.0,"I stopped by here during my lunch break in desperate need of a pick me up. I chatted with the barista working there and he was so kind and patient while I figured out what I wanted to drink. He even let me sample the cold brew. I settled on a chai since he said it'll satisfy my sweet tooth. It tastes better than my go to chai latte from Starbucks. Also I absolutely love the little handmade ice-burg they drop into your drink. Be advised the the seating is limited and the space is small but it's very bright and inviting. Note: I took my own cup (as I usually do) and they were happy to fill it up for me. 

This place is definitely worth checking out!"
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2019-07-02,5.0,"The cold brew is fantastic, and the service on multiple occasions has been personable. A hidden gem worth going out of the way to get your fix."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-09-27,3.0,"On 9/26 I went here a third time and I ordered a chai latte and a matcha latte. The chai latte this time was a bit sweeter than usual and the matcha was just terrible. It would've been better if the person could have mixed and broken apart the matcha more. Like literally there were huge clumps of matcha. A bit disappointed that some of the employees take no elegance in their job, even though they have all the supplies there."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-08-25,5.0,"Craving for coffee, my boyfriend & I decided to yelp and see what was in our area and I'm so happy we found this place. It's a cute spot, the barista was very friendly and not only is the coffee amazing but for iced/cold drinks they use a giant ice ball ! I loved the idea , we will definitely be coming back"
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2019-11-17,1.0,"rude baristas, very cramped, and seems to attract an obnoxious clientele"
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-12-29,5.0,Such a cute coffee shop. The manager is super friendly. The vibe is great and the decor is on point. I had the oat latte and it was one of the best lattes I've ever had. Thanks Kodawari for introducing me to oat lattes.
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2019-04-29,4.0,"I'm no coffee expert and I don't drink it on a normal basis, but I went here with some family and everyone enjoyed it. I ordered the latte, and to my surprise it was very pleasant, with a very nice smooth texture from the steamed milk. The taste was so nice, I was thinking about it soon after I left."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-10-13,5.0,"With all the little coffee shops in the city it's easy to find a decent cup to satisfy your cravings. What's not easy to find is a delicious pour over that is rich and complex and did I mention delicious??  Yes it's small. Yes it's in an old building on a street that maybe you don't frequent often, but it's totally worth the trip."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-04-14,5.0,Great coffee in a nice & neat slot right in the middle of Chinatown. I've noticed more and more hipstery shops opening up on the fringes of Chinatown and this spot is def a welcome addition. Staff is friendly and capable.
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-04-15,5.0,"Great coffee spot to come after a dumplings at Vanessa's and before hotpot at 99 favors.  Yummy coffee, especially the iced oat milk latte.  Very friendly baristas and they serve coffee from Indonesia!  Pretty cool."
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-04-15,5.0,Strong coffee. Cute environment. Nice baristas! I left thinking about the next opportunity I would have to go back and that is about as high a compliment I can give. Go try it for yourself and enjoy the specialty coffee made to perfection!
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-04-19,5.0,Cold brew on whiskey ice balls = genius.  A perfect stop to get your caffeine on if you're in this hood.
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-04-15,5.0,Came by here after some suspicious looking Chinese food - perfect kicker to end the day
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-09-17,5.0,Hidden gem in Chinatown. They make the best iced latte I've had in New York! They also have great pastries that change up every day. I've been back many times!
193,kodawari-coffee-new-york,2018-04-14,5.0,"Delicious cold brew -- and they were kind enough to give it away during their ""soft open."" Cute, sunlit space with wifi, too."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2020-05-05,5.0,"Bean & Bean is such a magnificent place!! I loved the atmosphere of this coffee shop though I was just stopping in to grab a honey latte I admired how great the vibes were. The latte was everything I could've asked for and more, super delicious! Next time I'm in the area I will definitely stay a little longer and appreciate this gem more! I highly recommend:)"
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-12-19,2.0,"Had a bad experience in this location today. I gave 2  stars because the products were good. The service, however left a really bad taste in my mouth.

I got coffee and a pastry. Then, I decided I wanted another pastry and asked the lady at the register to do an exchange. So far, so good. Here is the problem. Instead of doing an exchange, she took the pastry I got, gave me another one - charged me for the new one and never refunded the difference. I saw the transaction on my phone and asked her about it. First, she pretended to be busy with another customer and didn't answer my question. When the customer left, she lied and said she gave me a refund. I checked my account and saw that I paid $13 for a small coffee and a cookie. NY is expensive- but this is insane. I was mainly upset because the server lied about the refund, failed to address my question and I ended up over paying for something I didn't want. 

The coffee and the cookie were good - but the experience was not. I felt like she was ""stealing"" knowingly from me and I would have preferred if she just acknowledged and corrected her mistake. 

It's less about the money and more about the principle. If someone overcharged you and lied about it - would you go to the place again? 

Could this be an isolated experience? Maybe... but I do not want to see if it happens again."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-08-30,5.0,"The first time I came, I got a chai latte, which I thought was quite flavorful but was not a fan of how spongey the foam was. The second time I came, I got their honey latte and it was phenomenal! It was super creamy and subtley sweet per their description. Really enjoyed the blend of sweetness, cream, and roasted flavors."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-11-03,3.0,"A small local coffee shop with seating area. I ordered two latte, which the froth milk was the same batch. I sensed a no no already. The latte was over frothed, which was often a problem whenever I visit the city. Stainless searing were modern but very uncomfortable, but you can always expect friendly staff here."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-10-09,5.0,Great coffee hop to pop into for a coffee. The ricotta toast was to die for. It went well with their honey latte. Quick service and good prices for  NYC
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-05-07,3.0,"Bean and Bean. B&B. Coffee.

I work in the same building as this coffee shop and it holds a special significance to my coworkers and me. Over the past year, the B&B has gone through changes. My feelings about those changes (more metal, brighter lights) are mixed. I wrestle internally about where to get my morning coffee, and this place may win 30% of the time depending on which coworker I'm going with.

Chronically burnt bagels and snippy comments by the cashiers make this place special for some reason. The iced green tea is basically water with yellow food coloring in it. Coffee itself is good but not astronomical. Still, I kinda love this place and keep ordering this stuff.

Pour overs are indeed excellent if you're in the mood for something special and expensive. You used to be able to save 10% by using the cups app. This time has come and gone. 

I am straight terrified of the revolving door in this establishment.

Don't drink the coffee after 4PM. You'll start shaking and having nightmares. It's the most consistent thing about the place.

3/5 solid."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2020-01-06,5.0,Quick service and there coffee is amazing! Avocado toast and there bars are also a great quick option for on the go! The staff is very nice and get you in and out or if you wanted to stay there is that option as well! Nice environment if you wanted to get some work done !
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-12-28,4.0,"Love love love this spot. I can't drink strong caffeine but love the taste of coffee, which means I get yucky, watery decaf. This place has the most amazing Honey Latte and they make it in decaf.  It tastes kind of peanut-y and I don't get the jitters after. Also really like their avocado toast, plus the staff has always been really pleasant. There's a Starbucks nearby on Broad with such a ratchet staff, I prefer this coffee-house's laid back vibe."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-10-20,4.0,"The coffee here is really good, location is a bit tricky and the staff seemed overwhelmed even for a slow Friday morning, I don't think it's their fault they just need more training and the place needs to be more organized"
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-04-11,4.0,"Some organic and kosher items here! Way better than the Starbucks down the road. Avocado toast is a bit oily for my liking, but it's pretty good. There are a variety of breakfast bars that are excellent and not too sweet. Espresso is strong and they have oat, soy and almond milk. Matcha latte had a burnt taste, but it was still drinkable."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2017-10-04,3.0,"This is a nice interior coffee shop! I felt the customer service was a 3 because the server seemed really hasty to take order and not really communicate with the customer.
She asked me what I would like twice when I was trying to decide and when she made my drink, there was no latte art. 
Beside that it's nice there is WiFi and bathroom. There is some space/seating to do work and meet with friend.
My matcha hot latte was 5.40$ ish and that's pretty $$ but it did give me a lot of energy.
It is near battery park and Nyack college so convenient. 
The mood is definitely rustic and it's above UPS store so it's easy to miss it! 
Their ice chai tea is great but also 4.90$ for such a small cup. #NYC haha 
I would come back for their pastries, and to work there."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2017-07-20,4.0,"Their brew is on the strong side. I find their selection of various organic skim/soy/half and half amusing but this is Manhattan after all so that's expected. A small coffee is $2.50. Pastries are around $3-4. Plenty of cute tables and seating inside. A bit dim but I like the rustic feel for when Starbucks gets to feel too corporate. The location is easily overlooked but seems like the place always has a decent crowd. Not too loud either:)
I highly recommend coffee with a generous serving of the soy milk:) Yum."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-06-25,5.0,"Sat down with: cold brew with almond milk. Came at 4pm on a Monday and there was a lot of space available. Good space to do work or chat with friends, with free WiFi & restroom. The staff was friendly and the music was enjoyable.

Lighting was a bit dark if you are looking to do work."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2017-02-22,5.0,"I continue to love Bean & Bean, so I'm updating this to 5 stars! I stay in the 71 Broadway building when I'm in town for work, and it's so great to have a coffee shop in the building. I've tried a variety of their coffee beverages at this point, and all are solid to great. I had the honey latte for the first time recently and it was a pleasant change. 
The little cups of  cold oatmeal (with milk) and berries they have is amazing. And the employees are wonderful. If you haven't BEAN here, stop on by! ;)"
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-08-13,4.0,"Came on a Sunday afternoon and there was plenty of space. Good coffee, good avocado toast. It was a bit pricey but within expectation of coffee shop prices. It's a bit dark outside and I personally prefer coffee shop with a lot of natural lighting. That being said, I got a lot of work done in the 4 hours I was there and was not distracted at all."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-03-20,4.0,I've been working next door to this place for over a year and today is the first time I've ever been in. This place is just like Starbucks but with fewer drink options and varieties. It's expensive like Starbucks too. There are seats which is great. The workers were quick. They do have more pastries than Starbucks. Overall it's nice that it's pretty close.
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-02-09,3.0,I wanted coffee on a cold winter day.  The Yelp reviews were great for this place so I took the short walk from my hotel in 25 degree temps and honestly my coffee was nothing to brag about.  I got a honey latte but the flavor of the coffee wasn't dynamic to me.  I probably won't return here on future visits or recommend.  My 3 stars may be generous for my experience.
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2017-03-08,3.0,"FREE WIFI!

Around $5 for a medium iced honey latte, which was fine in my books (considering how it's NYC and everything). But, the coffee itself wasn't anything special. For a coffee shop that boasts about its organic nature and all that fanciness, I honestly did notice anything more robust or different about their coffee. Interior-wise, the industrial-like interior felt quite cold and uninviting. But on the plus side, I stayed for around 3 hours just to do some work and wasn't kicked out or anything. So that was nice!"
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2017-08-14,3.0,"Contrary to what other yelpers said I found the espresso to be not on the strong side. Ordered a Soy Cappuccino here and expected it to be have a strong coffee flavor like other shops in the area...i was a bit disappointed. To be honest, i'm not sure if it was something to do with the ground they used, but i really wanted to like this place as it's got a lot of other pro's (Plenty of seating, great baristas, free wifi, moody lighting) 

maybe I will come by another day and see how it is. But so far not so happy with the coffee. If you guys like all the other menu items this place offers, feel free to check it out.. better luck next time for me!


(CUPS friendly coffee shop btw)"
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-10-30,5.0,"I ordered a chai latte and a butter scone and it tastes really good, especially the chai latte. I've been trying out chai lattes here and there and what I like about this one is that even though it is foamy, it is very aromatic and I can still taste it through the foam which is interesting. In most places, the foam would have the least flavor, or no flavor in most cases. It tastes really good and even the employees are amazing! Watching them work and compensate for any mistakes they've done is very fulfilling because it just means that they really care about customer satisfaction. Just know that this place will be one of the friendliest places (probably) and also a nice place to do work in."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-12-15,3.0,We stopped here for breakfast on a Saturday . It's a cold stainless steel place. I suppose very urban and I guess based upon its location is good for those who work nearby. Very limited menu including coffee. You'd get more out of a Starbucks. Not impressive in any way. It's fine but I'd look somewhere else unless you just want to stop in and leave with a basic coffee maybe a bagel with a pot of Philadelphia cream cheese
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-08-03,3.0,"Coffee was pretty good! The food selection was pretty poor. Was looking for a bagel selection and the style was similar to Starbucks, they can toast for you but you have to add cream cheese yourself. Recommend for coffee however don't recommend for breakfast unless you like a simple pastry!"

Almond croissant"
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-05-16,5.0,"Super cute place! I stopped here to get a quick bite after missing my subway stop, and it was the perfect place to get a pastry + coffee. My only gripe is that it is definitely overpriced, but I find that this is true for most coffee shops here. Anyway, the interior is very chill and relaxing, and the service is good. 

I ordered the chia seed pudding and honey latte, both of which were good!"
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2017-05-30,4.0,"Fast service, no frills coffee shop. It's somewhat dimly lit, but plenty of seating available, whether you're staying for hours or just a bit.

I thought my latte was going to have a design in the froth, but sadly did not. The person ahead of me had a different server who did do it though.

Otherwise, my matcha latte was well made and not overly sweet.

Price is expensive, but it's the city so you'd better expect that.

Standard coffee shop overall. Clean with upbeat music. Bathroom was clean, but they could use a baby changing station for those rare instances it would be useful."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2019-06-20,1.0,"I just went here for the first time to grab a coffee and an avocado toast. The coffee is actually decent but the customer service is horrendous! Two people ordered the same thing as me right when I came in, and the girl making them, rather than working the orders into each other or doing them one at a time, made each individual piece of toast, put avocado on each piece of toast, and then put each topping on each of them. So what I'm saying is that I ended up having to wait for 10 full minutes and 2 other people's orders to get done before I got mine. I politely asked how much longer it was going to be at one point but otherwise kept my mouth shut. Then, as this the girl gave me my order, she goes ""Ma'am, if you were in a rush, you shouldn't have come in!"" Like, how dare I expect to not have to wait for 2 more people's orders! I am obviously insane for not thinking this should have taken 10 minutes when I walked into a shop without a line.

So I guess I'm going to take her advice. I won't be back and I won't spend money here again. It's not like there's a shortage of avocado toast in NYC anyway"
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2016-10-17,4.0,"Good-quality beverages and fast but smile-less service. Does it hurt to smile?

Very limited baked goods selection and extremely bare-bones industrial feel to the interior. No art. No warmth. Connected to an office building and has entrances from the street and from the lobby."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-02-25,5.0,"Downstairs from my apartment so probably the most convenient for me. Good prices for food and coffee. Limited food selection, only bagels and some pastries. In the weekday morning it can get very crowded, resulting in long ish (10 min) wait times and sometimes people forgetting your order. But that happens rare enough that I won't deduct a point. 

Pet friendly, good seating, good outlets, friendly crowd."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-12-22,5.0,"I was very happy with bean and bean when i went there. They had extremely friendly and helpful staff, everything was organic, they did amazing coffee, amazing music and even the vegan options tasted like heaven in a cup. Bean and bean could fit lots of people and still wasn't cramped. I loved it here and would recommend to all."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2016-08-28,5.0,"Incredibly perfect coffee. I can't drink dairy and the mocha inhad was complimented by the almond taste. I almost ordered a second cup but my partner stopped me. 

The atmosphere is really chill and this is a great place to recharge your batteries after walking around nyc all day."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2017-05-25,4.0,"I was around the area when it started to rain so I wanted to find a nearby cafe to sit down. This cafe was relatively easy to find near the Trinity church and Wall Street 4/5 train exit. There are about 10 small sitting tables and 2 standing ones. Surprisingly, we were able to get seats right away even though it was raining. The music was old school RnB and the decor is modern. The staff was very friendly. I ordered iced latte with low fat marble cake, both of which was decently made."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2015-10-06,4.0,"If you are all about the organic foods and environmental sustainability, this is the place for you. Sort of out of place in the financial district, I'd think, but a nice addition nonetheless.

My friend and I shared two muffins: the chocolate chip and the non-fat 3 berry, I got a regular coffee, and he got a small iced coffee. All of this rang up to $12 and change, which wasn't bad. 

The chocolate chip muffin was a bit dry, and the berry muffin was a tad bit too tangy for me. Otherwise, they brew a mean cup of joe! Tbh, the muffins all sounded way too healthy for me. When I go for a muffin, I go for the one that is chock full of chocolate chips and glistening with a slight sheen of oil (who knows what kind). So, as I was going through the different choices in the display case, I remember being super excited about one muffin that I though was non-fat free...well it actually read non-fat THree...berry..but I got it anyway. 

The seating area was quite spacious. We were able to get a whole long table to ourselves, which was great because my friend had a carry-on bag that would have gotten in everyone's way if we had to share a table with others.

I work just a little ways down the street, so I will definitely be back if I'm in need of a mid-workday pick-me-up!"
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2015-06-16,4.0,"Bean and Bean has become my afternoon pick me up coffee spot. Small cozy little coffee spot in FIDI with great customer service. The staff are always super sweet when I come in. My new addiction is there ice coffee with vanilla syrup and soy milk. Yummy! 

With so many coffee spots in FIDI, this place is one of my favorites along side Starbucks of course. On the plus side there coffee is organic. I feel there prices are cheap which is great!!! When you drink as much coffee as I do and being able to paying under $4 for a large ice coffee makes me a very happy camper. 

The only con to this place is the lighting it's really dull would be nice if it was brighter inside. All in all I will continue to return here and enjoy there yummy coffee and great customer service."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2017-08-24,2.0,"Incredibly rude service and I have been to a lot of coffee shops around the country. I have never had such a rude service as this place. 

I bought a coffee and was not impressed. I will hang out at another coffee shop instead."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-07-20,1.0,I work in the building next door so I frequently go in for a Chai latte iced with Oat milk & I always say light ice because for $7 bucks I'm paying for the Latte not ice & I stress this all the time & I still get a cup full of ice. Think I'll go back to Starbucks at least they know how to follow instructions.
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-05-03,4.0,"Nice little spot in FIDI, it's a bit hidden there and you get inside through revolving doors. Staff makes a nice coffee, I personally enjoy their cortados."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2018-06-13,5.0,"They have good matcha lattes. It's my new favorite place to study after work. I love sitting at the high table in front of the bar. Dim lighting, chill atmosphere, friendly staff."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2016-08-26,5.0,"I LOVE Bean & Bean. I walked by it every day for 5 months, and finally ventured in once I realized they served matcha lattes. It's in a discreet little building right by the 4/5 Wall St station, and there's usually a sign outside for cold brew. 

The baristas are incredibly friendly, and so efficient. Even during rush hour, I can place my order and be out of the door within 5 minutes. For those who like to stay and hang out, there are a few tables and I've seen people taking advantage of the wifi and working there. 

The menu is pretty extensive, but admittedly, I don't drink much coffee. I'm more of a macchiato / latte / tea kind of girl. I do have to say that this may be the best matcha latte I've found in NYC so far. The flavor is always consistent, and they have perfected the matcha powder - milk - simple syrup ratio. I might be slightly addicted so it's my go to drink whenever I'm at Bean & Bean. I've also tried the honey latte, which is pretty darn good. They have almond and soy milk options, which is perfect since I'm lactose intolerant.

Bean & Bean participates in CUPS, so I'd highly recommend downloading the CUPS app if you consistently drink coffee."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2016-07-20,4.0,"Man, I remember when the financial district had nothing. It was basically open for 12 hours from 6:30am to 6:30pm. What a great change to see it come alive. Now, just like the rest of Manhattan, it has coffee shops that aren't Starbucks or Irish bars. 

Bean & Bean is a big place with lots of two-person tables and a couple long family-style tables too. Coffee was decent, bagel was ok."
194,bean-and-bean-new-york,2014-09-17,3.0,"I originally wanted to go to Bluestone Lane, but as they didn't seem to have wifi, I chose Bean & Bean instead.

Right on broadway, it's really easy to find.  As you step out of the Wall Street 4/5 it's right across the street.  

You'll walk through a revolving door to get in, which is kinda funny & unique.  

Inside my first impression was, is this a starbucks?  The layout is very similar.  It does have a touch of style with the walls & table designs, so it's not bad all around.

I stepped up to the counter to order a cold brew, but found they didn't offer them.  My thinking: in the world of coffee, cold brew is truly the hardest to screw up.  You just soak the beans.  Sadly that option wasn't available, so not wanting to go the iced coffee route, I went with an espresso.  

I wasn't honestly very impressed.  The shot was pretty watered down, and tasted slightly on the burned side.  This is usually an indication of water temperature being too high, or if they used a blade versus burr grinder.

On the other hand, the wifi was indeed in good working order, and ethiopian got me past the security guards.  :)"
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2020-02-02,5.0,First time here. I ordered a spinach and feta croissant. Simply delicious. This is a nice quiet place to just hangout on your lap top and drink some coffee.
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2020-01-06,4.0,"I'm not a coffee person, I'm more of a tea kinda gal, but I was jet lagged and needed a pick me up for a long day at work. After reading the reviews I decided to stop in and try a draft latte. I'm so glad I did!

The draft latte was so creamy and smooth. I couldn't believe that it was not bitter at all! 

This is definitely my new go-to spot when I visit NY."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2019-09-02,5.0,"Anytime I travel to a new city, I look to see if they have a La Colombe for one reason: the draft oat milk latte. It is truly the lightest and creamiest thing I've ever tasted and I can't get enough of it. Sadly, it hasn't reached can status yet, so for now I will just have to travel far and away to fill the void.

This specific location is great. Plenty of space, friendly service, and great coffee. Although no WiFi...?"
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2019-05-06,5.0,"This is probably my favorite coffee shop in nyc. The service is great and the drinks are all consistent across locations every single time I'm in. 

I frequent the noho location a lot but this was my first time at this location! I loved finding that their drinks and service stay consistent across locations as we all know this is definitely not the case with other chains. We hopped in for a quick coffee between our workout and brunch res, and this is probably what saved my intensely hungover soul."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2019-05-10,5.0,"La Colombe is one of my favorite spots in New York for coffee because of the quality of coffee and speed of service. This location is very calm, quite, and spacious, given its location in Tribeca. There is plenty of space to work here, anytime of the week. 

You can't go wrong with an oat latte. I'd highly recommend getting a draft latte. They literally have lattes...on draft! You can also get my personal favorite, the black and tan, which is 1/2 draft latte and 1/2 draft cold brew. The draft latte tastes a little different than your typical latte, in a good way!

The cold brew and mocha drinks are also delicious. I'd also highly recommend all of the baked goods, which are all consistently good. If you're not a coffee drinking, they also sell Liquiteria juices as well."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2019-03-25,5.0,Their coffee and croissants are to die for !!!! This is probably one of the best lattes I've ever had. Super foamy and creamy with a dark roast flavor. Their powdered sugar almond croissant was a last minute choice I honestly DON'T REGRET. Super fresh and delicious ! Honestly writing this post is making me want this breakfast all over again!
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2019-12-29,5.0,"Hudson Square is an interesting little neighborhood. The juxtaposition of 19th century row houses and huge industrial warehouse-like buildings that house media company offices and probably Russian oligarchs to me just feels so New York. It's no surprise then that La Colombe, which, while not quite a New York institution, has pretty successfully woven itself into the fabric of Lower Manhattan, would have a branch here. I've always liked their coffee but their different locations can have very different vibes. Tribeca seems to always be a madhouse and is tiny so seating is hard to come by. NoHo is mobbed by NYU students who are always on their laptops but never seem to be working. The Hudson Square location is nice - airy space, plenty of seating, a diverse mix of clientele. It's a good place to while away a Sunday afternoon or grab something to go while you're between errands. For me, I'd rather sit down and enjoy my drink slowly and this is perfect for that."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-12-06,5.0,"La Colombe is a relaxing cafe with ample sitting space and excellent coffee and pastries. I've had both iced coffee and the iced draft latte, which I highly recommend. The croissants are delicious, the pretzel croissant is probably the most unique thing I've ever tasted and it took every bit of will power for me to save some to bring home for my roommates to try. So good with the draft latte !!"
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-10-28,3.0,My boyfriend and I stopped by for iced coffee on the way to Trader Joe's but I found the brew a little weak/watery. Definitely not up to the usual La Colombe standard. Hopefully was just an off day!
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-10-10,5.0,"This spot is my go-to cafe for getting work done. I love how sunny and airy it is, the fact that there's zero wifi so I actually do my work instead of browsing the internet, and how it gets busy yet there's somehow always a table. I'm not even a coffee drinker but I've somehow gotten a bit hooked on their draft lattes--not even a hint of bitterness in it and super creamy. 

Staff have been really nice every time I go, even with odd demands like foamed milk on top of tea to make a pseudo tea latte without batting an eye. I'm not in love with their regular latte since it's more bitter, but that's just me. The chocolate chip cookies are huge and tasty. They don't have the most robust pastry selection but it's totally fine if you just want a small snack with your coffee or tea. I really have to give this spot 5 stars since a large, not crazy-crowded cafe in NYC is hard to find!"
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-06-14,4.0,"Gave La Colombe a go. Upon walking in, it looks like THE place to go for your morning coffee. The line was wrapped around the counter at 10:30 am but it was quick. First time ordering a Draft Latte and wasn't sure what to expect. It's much creamier and smoother than a normal latte and it's tasty. I'd try it again."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2019-06-04,5.0,I fell in love with this place on a recent work trip. Amazing drinks!
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2017-12-04,4.0,"This part of town has a relative shortage of quality coffee spots and as luck would have it on Sunday at 6pm, that shortage is even greater.  I stopped in here for an espresso and found myself in a large, open and airy space, with relaxing, yet upbeat ambient music playing.  Definitely not the drab and somewhat sad, ""serious"" coffee shop stereotype.   

Even though they were about 10 minutes from closing and were in the process of cleaning up, etc., they were as nice and welcoming to me as if I was their first customer of the day.  

Oh and the espresso was excellent as well."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-09-03,5.0,"We have had La Colombe coffee at many fine restaurants in Vegas and New York so we were happy that we finally got to come to one of their locations here in New York. I had a macchiato today and a cappuccino on another occasion. Their coffee is so good and drinks are smooth. This location is pretty spacious and has room for doing work, if needed."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2017-09-19,4.0,"La Colombe Coffee is a nice addition to this particular small section of NYC which I find to be a bit...sterile and characterless. Granted, this area of Hudson Square is full of business offices, fast-casual restaurants to feed said office workers, and storage spaces, but once you walk inside of La Colombe, you get that cozy neighborhoody vibe that doesn't quite exist outside of its doors.

What's nice about this spot is that the space is ample; I went here for an Instagram meetup - don't chuckle at me yet, only I can chuckle at myself, haha - and the six of us there were able to talk comfortably as one of the communal tables near the front door. Also, a lovely wrapping marble counter surrounds the drink preparation area. Very sleek! Service was quick; not a coffee drinker, I always go to La Colombe for their awesome tea selection - I love their loose mint cardamom tea - but being a particularly hot and sticky mid-September afternoon, I wanted something iced. My barista's suggestion of their simple black iced tea hit the spot. My new acquaintances got various iced lattes and nitro drafts, and they loved them! I did not partake in any pastries - which I should have done since I had virtually no food that day, haaa - but what they had was ample and looked delicious! 

I can't say this is a destination cafe, but if I ever find myself in the Hudson Square area for whatever reason in desperate need of sa cafe, I know I've got this place now."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2017-05-20,5.0,Awesome draft latte! I can't have enough of them. My husband and I needed to go to Chinatown today and we had to walk pass by this place! The latte was extremely fluffy and lite. And love their simple decor and the cactus were very cute  :) I felt that I could easily spend a whole day here.
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-10-17,5.0,"The most finest coffee of all time =) amazing taste , feelings similar to experiencing orgasm ) also love how they make a foam !"
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-09-17,5.0,"High quality coffee that justifies the price!

I've only tried the oat milk draft latte here but it's so good, I've returned specifically for it. It's so foamy, smooth and of course dairy-free, for all my lactose intolerant folks out there.

This location in particular has so much seating! It's great to stop by to do work or catch up with a friend."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2019-01-14,4.0,Great location with lots of seating! A great place to come and get some work done with a great cup of coffee. La Colombe is some of my favorite coffee and they pay attention to dietary restrictions. They even have oat milk!
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2019-02-13,3.0,"Great coffee and great space! The only drawback is no WiFi and no working outlets. So if you're coming to work on emails or on your laptop, consider another cafe (or come fully charged with your personal hotspot)!"
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2017-01-27,5.0,"This is the second time I've been in a La Colombe and it is so much bigger than the one in SoHo. It has lots of space for people to work and feels very airy. We stopped by on a whim because my fiance wanted me to try the draft latte. We had just finished lunch and were walking around when he realized we were really close so we went in and placed an order. 

While there were a few people ahead of us, the line moved quickly. As soon as we placed our order, the cashier shouted it to the back and it was ready for us right after we paid.

Draft latte... what can I say about it? It's ready at the flick of a wrist. At first I thought it was alcoholic, but it just means it came from the tap. This differs from other lattes in that it is much creamier than a normal latte. It still has some foam, but the creaminess is so powerful. I'm a sucker for creamy drinks so this was right up my ally. It was strong in flavor and probably a new favorite twist on my caffeinated beverage. They also sell canned versions if you want something with flavor or for a later date."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-07-13,2.0,"Tasty coffee but didn't have any kick at all.. 4 dollar cookie was just fine (not worth 4) and they don't have wifi.

Great interior tho"
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2016-11-13,5.0,"A nice, clean, spacious area and they serve good coffee. Try their Colombian pour over. They also have some croissants and cookies etc"
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2019-06-14,1.0,"The server was SO RUDE TO ME, for absolutely no reason. I wanted a oat milk draft latte black and tan. Which I have ordered numerous times. She almost started a scene because she didn't understand what I wanted. Instead of being polite and asking me to explain it. She gave me SERIOUS attitude. I look forward to getting one coffee on a Friday and I have attitude for absolutely no reason. Good thing I like there coffee, because that cashier had some nerve to be so rude"
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-09-22,5.0,I work close by and this is my go to coffee spot to wake me up. I always get the black and tan. It's just right and exactly what I need.
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2014-10-03,5.0,"Okay I came back - I'm not sure if it's because of the first week phase or lack of menu, but now my Iced Latte was ($4). An extremely reasonable price.

Again great service, and now more people are showing up."

195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-06-28,4.0,"This is a huge and very clean La Colombe. I love their black iced tea which is infused with fruit (but no added sugar !!) it's really refreshing on a hot summer day !

195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2017-05-10,5.0,"Forget Starbucks, La Colombe is the HOT spot for coffee, tea and other specialty drinks. The store itself is more spacious than most coffee spots and offers plenty of work space in case you need to do some work while sipping your cappuccino.

Best of all, the staff is amazing. Super knowledgeable and extremely friendly!"
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2014-11-15,5.0,"Excellent space for meeting and work. I needed a coffee shop to meet with a client and La Colombe Hudson exceeded my expectations. It's quiet, spacious and has adequate seating for solo sippers and group socials. 

The atmosphere, ambiance and product are quality. I ordered hot cocoa and to my delightful surprise, it came with a feather decorated in the froth. 

The people are kind and have a very graceful demeanor. It feels good to be here and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to get together and get work done."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2017-07-06,5.0,BEST latte ever. very smooth and strong. they are always busy and packed on the weekends but short lines compare to other La Colombe coffee shops. I love coming here first thing in the morning on the weekends.
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2016-11-28,4.0,"Really awesome coffee shop that is expanding down the east coast.

PROS:
- Delicious fair trade, responsibly sourced coffee; roasted on site and nearby.
- Ample seating and very comfortable environment
- Super friendly staff
- Awesome coffee available for sale by the bag

CONS:
- No WIFI. Definitely a business model that focuses on getting people in and out. Not really looking to have folks ""WFH"" here."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2017-12-24,5.0,"The coffee here is awesome! Always fresh..I've tried the pastries, the almond croissant is addictive! Pastries always fresh.Very busy Monday thru Friday around 9am, you will wait on a long line( moves fast), and well worth the wait..The staff are all very friendly and will guide you if your not sure what you want.. The turmeric tea is very delicious as well.."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2015-11-25,5.0,"Ok I love this place so much! 

- The coffee drinks have all been amazing. Specifically they make the best Americanos and I definitely indulge in an almond latte now and then 

- There's usually a barista who runs the register in the weekday mornings who is amazing. My first time there, I was carrying a yoga mat and she mentioned that she was in training to become a yoga teacher. Super quick chat but definitely appreciated a little friendly interaction on a cold Monday morning

- Though some would disagree, the lack of wifi is refreshing. It definitely impacts the environment. If you need it, there are at least three coffee shops in the vicinity with access to the interwebs."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2018-03-25,5.0,To go Black and Tan place in the morning before work. They do offer one dollar refills for their drip. Also might see jake gyllenhaal from time to time

195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2016-01-17,4.0,"I'm so surprised this location of La Colombe has so little reviews. It's actually my favorite location of La Colombe, for a variety of reasons. It's closer to my office than the Soho branch, it's huge - so you never have to worry about finding a spot to sit and do some work, and there's never a long line for coffee. 

I'd say the coffee quality is the same as the other locations, but I think there is a bit more variety in snacks and noms. I highly recommend La Colombe if you're in the area and need a quick coffee fix. It's definitely better than the other places that I like to call the Coffee Wasteland that is the neighborhood around my office."
195,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-5,2015-12-04,3.0,"Only three stars for lacking in customer service and size/cost. Descriptions below:

- Employee at the register seemed annoyed that he had to interact to other humans, barely said anything. Sorry, I just wanted a cup of Joe. 

- Not being a regular, I asked for a large. Didn't know they didn't have a large. Found out after I paid & was given a small cup. Wouldn't been nice to know they don't have a large. This size is almost the same price as a ""Venti"" 20oz coffee at coffee competitors. 

- Didn't know if what they had out by the sugar was milk, half & half, skim, soy? These things should be labeled! Just poured some and got the hell out in irritation. 

- line seems to formulate very quickly.


Pluses:
- great tasting roasts 
- good pastry selection 
- they place your beverage on a nicely presented bar with a silver spoon, saucer, and assortment of sugars (not milks) to alter to your satisfaction. 

Probably won't return that often LaColombe. I can be in and out of Starbucks in 60 seconds. Time, cost efficiency and convenience are precious."

Really good coffee and I love the design of the café, very clean looking and simple.  I also love that they have pastries for my morning fix, plus the café is pretty big with lots of seating, which is important in this area!  My plain croissant was buttery goodness and yummy for $2.50."

.
BLT - the biggest BLT I have ever had. 2 fat slabs of bacon, lettuce and tomatoes on Texas toast- Felt as if I was at Peter Lugers making a sandwich with their bacon and tomatoes.  It was very good 

Ham Sandwich - an open-faced baguette with prosciutto cotto, dill pickle, and strings of onions. - baguette wasn't as crusty, it was soft, almost like a toasted hot dog bun - it was also very good 

Green Tea Mousse -  Bittersweet green tea sponge and mousse with Dainagon red beans covered with fresh whipped cream - ultra light, not too sweet, also very good .

Chocolate Mousse - Layers of quality chocolate sponge, cream and walnuts
with a hint of Brandy - light and airy, smooth, didnt taste brandy though- and of course, very good 

One of the best values I've ever had and in NYC. How is this even possible? The sandwiches alone are $18 each, coffee at $6 each and cake (the set limits to certain cakes, so it's not any cake listed on the menu for the set lunch) about half the size of their standard serving, so I'm gonna to guess $5 each, this would have been $58 (more or less), but we paid $44 and there's refills upon request... 

So guys, check this place out for brunch if youre around any of their 3 locations. I'm blown away with the value, but more importantly, the food was delicious and the servic"
196,harbs-new-york-13,2020-02-08,5.0,"One of my favorite cake shops in the city. It's a great place to enjoy tea and amazing Japanese cakes while shopping in SoHo. The location is great and it's usually not too loud so definitely a perfect spot to relax and enjoy some tea time.

Ambience is great. Inside is surprisingly huge and decorated in modern style. Staff are really friendly and courteous. Only downside is that each cake slice is averaged around $10 a piece and with coffee, the check price goes up a lot but you don't enjoy Harbs everyday so to me, it's worth the tea break and paying for the ambience. Banana crea pie and green tea mousse are my favorites. I'd like to be back to try the king chocolate cake next time. They also serve pasta and sandwiches and also offer set menus for lunch at a reasonable price. Definitely check the place out when in SoHo."
196,harbs-new-york-13,2020-01-29,4.0,"HARBS continues to churn out delicious cakes like always. My favorite still remains the mocha ($9) and the lemon yogurt mousse ($9). I recently sampled their tart cheesecake ($10) which was aptly described--unconsciously puckering as I write this-- and had a lighter consistency than Lady M's version of a cheesecake (gâteau nuage). 

Although the menu rotates every season, there are some cakes that are available year-round including the strawberry shortcake ($11), the marron cake ($10), the green tea mousse cake ($10), and the mille-crêpe cake ($11). I personally quite enjoy the marron cake as the combination of chestnut and sweet potato is unique and not found elsewhere."
196,harbs-new-york-13,2020-01-17,5.0,"This is a great Japanese bakery/cafe/lunch spot!  

+ Chocolate Cake is decadent...a pure chocolate dream with rich dark flavors and forgiving layers of cream and sponge cake.  You could tell lots of thought went into the creation of this otherwise simple concept.

+ Irish cream cheesecake hits back surprisingly tart...a different take on your classic sweet New York cheesecake.

What I love about cakes here is that the flavors are thoughtful and intricate, and never overwhelmingly sweet like some cakes are, which border on lines of being offensive.

I haven't tried the lunch set yet but it is very economical (~$20 with choice of pasta/salad/sandwich, tea or coffee, and a slice of cake).  The service is wonderful and polite in typical Japanese manner, and the space is huge with lots of seating and modern decor.  I will be back!!

Bonus fun fact: HARBS is named after the word ""herbs.""  The owners wanted to customers to feel relaxed and happy here (I definitely was).  How cute is that! :-]"
196,harbs-new-york-13,2020-03-08,5.0,"Love love love this cute Japanese cafe. They have the best slices of cake but warning it will give your wallet a dent. A slice of cake is about $10 and a whole cake is around $100. This time I tried the queen of cakes which had strawberries and some blueberries. They do have some alcohol in the cakes but you can barely taste it in the queen of cake. I really liked the cream because it was so soft and fluffy. The cake was also a decent slice and it was just so good. The iced coffee was also made well and they provided liquid sugar and milk so you can pour it in yourself. They also have the Japanese toilets. It's also very spacious inside. They offer lunch specials where they have sandwiches, omelettes, and pasta. I will definitely come back to try the other slices of cake. Omg they also have banana cream pie!"
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-11-28,5.0,"We were a group of four on Saturday, so the wait was obviously there. It wasn't long though, and we were seated at the back. The table wasn't large enough for what we ordered, but we made it work. 

We ordered a pasta and four slices of cake: fruit mille crepe, pear mille-feuille, green tea red bean, and the cheesecake. The fruit crepe cake really did live up to its name, as I loved the light and airiness of every single bite. I also thoroughly enjoyed the cheesecake, but all of the slices of cake tasted amazing. All four flavors were great though. 

We also had their tea, which was pricey but also it was free refills so the value wasn't too bad. HARBS is a wonderful dessert place and I would definitely return."
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-10-27,3.0,"For paying an arm and a leg for a slice of cake, you would think they would hire a more organized wait staff to tend to their patrons. I stopped by this location on a Friday at 5PM and it was a disaster. The man behind the cashier taking care of the take out orders was sweating profusely and so flustered. It was chaos.

I purchased a $110 fruit mille crepe cake for my husband and asked them to write a Happy Birthday message on a chocolate disc. Firstly, they left the cake sitting outside of the fridge for 15 minutes and secondly, they kept taking other orders and not completing my order even though I was waiting. I'm sure if I didn't speak up after the 15 minutes, it would've been sitting there even longer. While I was sitting there, patrons came up to the man behind the cashier complaining about not given a menu and not having a server come by their table.

They really need to get their act together. It really ruins the entire experience."
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-10-20,4.0,"A good place to eat and rest from a noisy world with delicious delicate pastries and good tea.

They have savory dishes as well - like their own grilled ham and cheese or delicate pasta.

A little pricey but good service with clean nice atmosphere.

Great lunch specials which I will try very soon."

OVERALL: 6.5/10

I got to say this place is fancy for a cake spot. But at around $10 a slice I expected WAY more than what I put into this precious mouth of mine. 

The cake is very basic, the coffee was good though. Very strong cappuccino I got, and tasted different than another coffee shops I been to. 

The two cakes we got one was a walnut cake with fruits in it... BASIC like hardcore basic. I mean it looked basic but I expected non basic. 

The other one was like a fruit cake, like super basic fruit cake. 

I will not come again, but if you coming here for coffee, I'd say it's quite alright. 

Expect to spend around $25-30 for 2 cake slices and a drink"
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-07-12,4.0,"HARBS is a Japanese cafe / bakery serving up sweet and savory eats in SoHo. 

the space is super large is open, airy and warm. super clean design aesthetic: brightly lit, organized modern cafe has seating options that stretch from the front to back. the cakes and pies are displayed artfully in glass refrigerated displays. the vibe is very relaxed and uncluttered. as soon as you walk in, you're greeted by a showcase of beautifully baked sweet eats. the right side of the space has desserts on display, order counter, and coffee bar. the rest of the space is dedicated to the cafe-style seating. 

the dessert options are pretty amazing. the portions are big and shareable.  the cakes and pies are light, air, fluffy, and pleasing to the eye. 

current fave is the Irish cream cheesecake. the blend of flavors was quite delightful. you get the whisky flavor and smooth cream touch without overpowering it overpowering the actual cheesecake. the cheesecake is fairly silky and light-- definitely isn't super-dense or thick. definitely it dates that sugartooth desire without being too sweet. 

cake and pie slices range in price from $9-$11--a bit steep--but the desserts here are more of an indulgence than an everyday habit. 

i've only done takeout at this location. it was cool that they have packed my dessert purchases with a cooling gel packets so the sweet eats don't get warm and mushy. it's a nice touch especially as the temperatures go up in the summer. 

the coffee is just okay. specifically the iced coffee is  pretty meh. maybe the other caffeinated options are better but I was not impressed by the iced coffee at HARBS. it tasted fairly burnt and acidic.

Tried fruit Mille crepe, chocolate mousse, queen of cake, strawberry cake, and many more. The chocolate ones are always my favorite. If you are first time here and blinded by all the wonderful options in front of you, choose anything with chocolate or fresh fruit. You will thank me.
A place of many happy memories with my besties ‍"
196,harbs-new-york-13,2020-01-19,5.0,"By far one of the nicest little cake and tea shops I've been to in the city! Elegantly styled with beautiful white, yet rustic decor and high ceilings, this cake shop is a breath of fresh air away from the business of SoHo.

My friend and I came to this place around 3PM on a snowy Saturday, when it was quite full. Luckily, the large cafe immediately accommodated us, and as we walked by, I noticed the beautiful displays of all the cakes. Definitely got me hungry for cake when I originally wasn't planning on eating any at all!

We ordered two items: the mint tea and Irish cream cheesecake. 

Mint tea:
- Surprisingly so delicious and refreshing! 
- They use fresh mint sprigs and just fill the teapot up full of them. Such a nice herbal flavor (though understandably not for everyone) 
- Only provides one tea cup, but we just used the water cup for a second cup

Irish cream cheesecake ($9):
- Not super sweet, but perfectly balanced with a butter cookie-like crust and dense cheesecake 
- Reminded me of a cross between apple pie (crust) and cream cheese!
- We spread the cream on top across the entire cake, and I highly recommend this to distribute the fluffy whipped cream!

All in all, it was such a beautiful location with kind staff members, perfect for catching up with a close friend and relaxing in a warm environment away from the snowy cold weather outdoors. I will definitely be back (and bring all my friends)."
196,harbs-new-york-13,2020-01-09,4.0,"I've visited HARBS in a mall when I was Japan & I was so happy when I heard there's branches of it in NY. 
My friend told me about them that the cakes were great but the service wasn't that good because they constantly forget your cake orders but I still went because I wanted to see for myself.
There's usually plenty of seating even around during noon so that's great.

I thought the cake of the day on the lunch set was only one type of cake selected from their selection but it's causally three types of cakes for today's cake. 
The cake slice for the lunch set is smaller than when you usually only order the cake
The waiter asked if I'd like my cake to be served with my lunch meal or after. I chose after but the guy forgot it. I brushed it off & thought maybe he noticed there wasn't enough room on our table.
I had the Chicken & Mushroom pasta, with a side salad & Irish Cream Cheesecake. 
The pasta was tasty, light, wasn't too rich & it was a large amount than I originally expected. 

My friend ordered the French Toast & it was amazing!! The French toast is definitely custardy, soft & also slightly crisp on the edges. I really appreciate how it wasn't too sweet but still delish. There's 3 condiments that comes along- jam, syrup & butter. I like how the french toast itself was easy on the sweetness so it doesn't become too sweet if you add the jam or syrup  

We also ordered the Marron Cake & Strawberry Mousse. 

After that, we waited for our cakes for quite some time & it didn't come until I reminded them. They weren't busy & there wasn't much customers but it was hard to get their attention when we needed to wait for the bill, other orders & etc.

The Marron cake was my fave!! It had a great chestnut flavor but still light! I'm not too fond of strawberry flavors but it was okay  

Besides the forgetfulness, I loved it! I'll come back with my sister next time"
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-12-05,5.0,"My favorite cake place in the city - and I'm a self-identified cake connoisseur! I love this location (Harbs' newest location in NYC) because it is a lot larger and airier than the two other locations (Chelsea, UES). Same cakes options,  but just a lot more roomy.

Note that Harbs is known for their Japanese-style cakes, which are *less sweet* and *less heavy* than American-style cakes. They are more airy and won't make you feel like you hate yourself after eating a whole slice. The flavors are much more subtle, with Harbs highlighting the unique characteristics of the ingredients in the cakes rather than overpowering the senses with too much sugar or heavy fats.

Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5
Overall: 4.5/5

---

The good:
- Great variety of cakes to suit a variety of preferences - from spongey fruit-based cakes, to mille-crepe cakes, to cheesecakes
- Great balance of flavors in each cake - see above
- Large variety of teas for sit-down conversations
- Sales staff package and cut cakes perfectly for transport - they really do pay attention to detail here

---

The meh:
- Definitely on the pricier side (~$11 per slice // ~$110 per whole cake)
- The last time I checked, they don't do pre-orders of whole cakes. The way they explained it to me is that you need to just walk in and see what whole cakes they have available for the day, if you are to buy a whole cake.

---

The verdict:
- Definitely go and enjoy cake time!
- Great for dates"
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-05-06,4.0,"Harbs is the first place I think of for tea and cake. The place is spacious, clean, well-lit, and the noise level isn't loud so that you have to raise your voice over other people or the music. This would make such a great date place. The tables are spaced out so that you aren't on top of the people next to you and the waiters let you choose the table you want with no pressure. 

The cakes aren't too sugary or dense. I feel like some of them could use a bit more flavor, but I'm aware that Asian bakeries and cafes tend to air on the light and fluffy side which I don't mind at all. They also have a great selection of tea served in pots to share and a good lunch deal that includes a sandwich, slice of cake, and cup of tea or coffee. The slice of cake that they give with this deal is much smaller than what you would be normally getting if ordered without the deal. 

I got the steak sandwich and sakura cake. When I ordered, I didn't indicate how I wanted the steak cooked and it came out more on the rare side. There is tomato and onion on top of it over a thin, long piece of bread. Now that I think about it, it basically looked like a savory eclair. The sandwich was a miss for me. I think all the water from the tomato spread on top affected the taste of the steak and just watered it down. Interestingly enough, each location has a different selection of savory items. I know in the Chelsea location they have pasta. This location has toast, sandwiches, and salads. 

The sakura cake on the other hand was a nice finish to the meal. I normally don't like floral flavors very much, but the waitress said it was very popular at the moment so I thought I'd give it a try.

Overall, I would come here for the cake and tea, but some of the savory items still need improvement and adjustment."
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-11-09,5.0,Had their Mille cake slice and honestly it was sooooo light and airy that with a cup of coffee it revitalized me during the cold night! Must go to!
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-10-21,1.0,"I don't usually write a review but this experience tonight really pissed me off! I had a really good dinner and decided to get myself some dessert. i walked for 30 mins to get to this place aiming for the best Japanese came in town. The lady recommended me the creme mille ad showed me a sample with several layers of colorful fruits and including strawberry, kiwi, banana, etc. I took her advice and she cutted a piece from a whole cake for me. I took a look at the cake in the box and see no red or green, then asked the lady whether it's the same one as she showed me. She said yes yes they're the same! And ... Look at the picture, this is what I got. Pear only. 

The environment was good, and they packed the cake nicely with an ice bag to keep it cooled. But I didn't get the cake that the lady shown to me. It's not a big amount of money, but I feel disappointed that the lady lied to me just to sell the incomplete cake. Waste of money. Will never return and let my friends know as well."
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-02-20,1.0,"I walked in here to take a look at the cakes.  I used to be a big fan of a place back home which had a similar style.  These cost a pretty penny and knowing that I don't mind shelling out for Japanese desserts that are lighter and fluffier.  

I've read all the reviews of this location and the UES and it seems my experience was typical.  I might try going to the UES to give it a chance.  So I was inquiring about a business card for events.  I had to ask the lady straight out three times if I could get one.  It was as if I was talking to a mute marionette.  

""Can I get a business card please"", I inquired to the young lady.   Long period of silence.....  My second attempt brought a another stare with a flinch of an eye. My third attempt resulted in her saying, "" Just come to store."" Um OK.....  I had to prod from her that they can't make custom cakes for events as they are limited. Why the fuck did you just waste my time and not articulate that earlier?  

Bad service really dissuades me from trying places. At this rate I'd rather order from an Italian bakery or anywhere else that receives me with open arms."

The items we tried was the strawberry cake, fruit mille-crepe, the fruit cocktail & earl grey tea. The strawberry cake was light, fluffy and delicious & the fruit mille-crepe was good but not my most favorite. The fruit cocktail was ok, I wouldn't order it again.

Great decor w/ tons of seating. Clean bathroom. Nice and friendly staff."

196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-09-15,5.0,"Beautiful and delicious food? Sign me up!

HARBS really feels like a unique dessert place amidst the countless dessert spots in NYC. It's a very clean and minimal decor indoors with white and woodwork surrounding you. Of course, the moment you walk in, you're greeted by your cake options and your server. 

Both times I've been here, I've gotten the strawberry cake and orange mint tea. As someone who is a certified sweets junkie, I love how delicate and not too sweet these items were! The orange mint tea is totally relaxing and totally adorable in its single serving glass pot. The strawberry cake is light, creamy, and depends on all of its sweetness to come from the fresh fruit itself!

Really just a beautiful place to have a conversation with a friend, or just unwind by yourself with a treat. Will definitely be back to try the other offerings."
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-01-13,5.0,"Ah.. another great meal at HARBS. We are UES location regulars. Thought we would check out this new location. The interior is beautiful, clean, nice choice of colors and materials. Just gives you a general clean and calm feeling. 

Menu items are a bit different than the UES location, more beverage choices, including alcoholic beverages. They will soon be rolling out more menu items as they complete the gas and kitchen set up. 

Thank you HARBS, for never letting us down! We look forward to coming back, esp when you have high chairs for children!"
196,harbs-new-york-13,2019-11-09,3.0,"More accurately 3.5 stars. The ambiance is 5/5 but the cakes are not that amazing. We ordered 5 different ones and only the Berry Berry Cake lived up to the hype. The chocolate one was a big disappointment. It didn't taste very rich and was more walnut and Brandy heavy than chocolate centered. For a chocolate fan, this was underwhelming.

Update: the bathroom is really cool!!"

196,harbs-new-york-13,2018-12-04,3.0,"In a spur of the moment decision, I decided to walk into this $$$ bakery, prepared to spend more than $7 on a slice of cake. Well, it ended up being $11. 

I'm not a big fan of chocolate flavored food and I love fruit, so with that, the girl behind the cashier recommended the Mille Fruits Crepe to me, as it was the most popular one.

It was...okay. The slice was messy to cut into and the cream, kiwi, banana, and strawberries all tasted as expected. It looked special, but at the end, there was nothing that screamed ""exciting"" to me and hence, I would think twice about buying this again--with that price tag. 

Talked to one of my friends who had once worked at HARBS (different location, because this one opened in November). She had never gotten any employee discounts and benefits when she worked here, and to me, that's just sad."

They have a pretty decently priced lunch special ($25 for a pasta of your choice + a cake slice + a coffee or tea), but if you visit, you absolutely HAVE to get their Royal Milk Tea Cake. It's so light and fluffy that it's hard to believe you're actually eating cake.

I also love that this location is a lot more spacious. The Chelsea one seemed a little cramped and you also have to enter through a door to get to their back room for seating.

And don't forget to check out the toilets when you're there. They have bidets!"

We got the Queen Cake to go (which is only available when the sweetest strawberries are in season). It was decent (without the strawberries). Nothing to rave about. 
1 star for the hospitality."

My friend and I got the Strawberry short cake. Although it was quite pricey ($11) for slice, I can say that this was worth it. I've had strawberry short cake in Japan and it tastes like heaven. The slice I had at HARBS was light, fluffy, and fresh yet creamy and sweet at the same time. It definitely reminded me of that the strawberry shortcake from Japan.
Also, the place itself is really cute! I love the overall aesthetic of the cafe. The display of cakes you see right out the front window is so intriguing in itself as well."

Even with Starbucks on practically every corner, we will seek places like this out every time. 
I love that they have their own family owned coffee farm in Puerto Rico where they plant, grow, and roast their beans before shipping them here. 
They also have oat milk for the Vegans of the world. 
Wish they had vegan pastries too, I guess a girl can dream. 
Very good coffee."

The coffee they serve here is from Puerto Rico. It was my first time having coffee from Puerto Rico aside from Café Bustelo; I found it to be really good.

This is also a good coffee shop to work in and there's swings for the seating by the window which I thought was cute. 

They also have a loyalty program and people that live in the area can keep their loyalty card in a little organizer that they have on the wall so they don't always have to remember to bring it or keep it in your wallet. Otherwise you can keep track of your points via your phone number. 

I will definitely be returning to this place next time I'm in the area."

If you stay here long enough, you will see the new ways the improve the experience, including purchasing the highest quality milk to get the best lattes available, and hand painting the walls with images inspired from Puerto Rico. 

Plus, the service is exceptional. It is really something out of the ordinary!"

Saturday morning, bustling with cool east village crowd, cool and collected baristas taking orders and making coffee in an orderly fashion. I loved every single bit of this little coffee shop. I tried decaf oat latte and it was quite terrible but hey, decaf sucks most places anyway so it's forgivable. If I am in the area I'm definitely coming back! Maybe regular espresso or hot cocoa next time. Also the music is on point."

Staff was friendly and being as patient as I was, made my order, got the wifi pass, and sat down. Once I got that caffeine boost, it was full on. When that cookie hit me though, man did I crank.

The best part was that Wifi was super, not like every other spotty wifi connection you get at coffee shops in the city, this was that good good. I felt comfortable because I wasn't limited by the connection, had caffeine, and a nice corner to crank it.

It does get traffic, and since its small it can get loud or noticeable, if you can work past that, highly recommend.

I'll be back at 787."

197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-05,5.0,If you're  looking for a taste of Puerto Rican only a few steps from home. Head over to 787 in the east village to enjoy the finest cafesito straight from Puerto Rico. From the simplicity of the decor to the boldness in the first sip you won't regret it.
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-25,5.0,"Absolutely the best coffee in the East Village. Try the rum-infused coffee. It's like having rum without the hangover. 

The best thing about 787 is the chillax vibe. Huge open South facing windows. Everyone who works there is a super star barista."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-18,5.0,"My favorite cup of coffee in NYC.  The rum infused americano is my go too at every opportunity.  Awesome service at every location.  I actually feel sorry for the people drinking coffee at Starbucks, they don't know what they are missing.  Keep it up guys, you rock."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-23,5.0,"Stumbled upon this shop one morning after the gym. This iced drink has by far been the best tasting coffee drink I have ever had! I opted for the ""Oatka,"" made with rum infused coffee beans, oat milk, and chocolate mocha flavor. I also got a spinach/cheese empanada that came with a distinct hot sauce on the side.. absolutely incredible! It was so light, airy, and flaky.. the freshest empanada around. You will not regret a trip to this unique coffee shop."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-30,5.0,"Great coffee, great baristas, vertically integrated. The special drinks are amazing - banana foam, what?? Um. Did you need anything else?"
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-10,5.0,"My daughter and I decided to try 787 Coffee Shop at 66 Pearl Street based on the Yelp reviews, and were not disappointed.  The ambiance was very cool.  Despite five people ahead of us, we were warmly greeted by the Barista, who had the ability to multi-task in an efficient manner.  I had one of the  best cappuccino's and my daughter on the recommendation of the Barista, had the Mallorca bread, which she said was scrumptious.

I like the concept of farm to cup, and locally owned entrepreneurship rather than corporate chains.  Would definitely recommend stopping by 787 Coffee."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-29,4.0,Coffee was good. The only place I know that sources it's beans from Puerto Rico which as a coffee nerd is interesting. Had a Cortado which wasn't perfect but was good. Small place so I'd imagine during a busy time you won't be able to get a seat.
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-03,5.0,"small space but lovely. had a great iced latte as well! There weren't any air conditioning but it is nice to people watch. If I had my book and time to stay, it would have been perfect"
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-01,5.0,"Great coffee, none of that intense cold brew bitter shit (I mean maybe they have that too, I don't know).
Nice and well balanced and sourced directly from their farm in beautiful Puerto Rico. And they have oat milk which I love as a creamy dairy alternative without the weird or watery taste of others.

The empanadas are moist and yummy!
They could source better croissants though, they are whatever.

Nice people and a clean and open design makes it easy to pop in and out. Great neighborhood spot to send those suburban kooks that go to the random Starbucks in a neighborhood of so many great places to get coffee."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-17,5.0,"Tried the cappuccino with rum infused espresso. It was amazing! Very cute, cozy space with friendly baristas who actually suggested the rum espresso. I loved it! Came here after being turned down from two other coffee spots that were card only (happened to walk out of my house with no cards. GASP!!!). But it was all for the best. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'll be sure to stop by!"
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-04,5.0,"Being Puerto Rican, I expected alot from this place and my expectations were MET! The best coffee I've had while living in NYC. The customer service is fantastic and it's a great spot to get work done while sip on fantastic coffee"
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-09,3.0,"The staff is super friendly! 

When I went the guy didn't know how to make coffee (he was probably new and learning) and the other guy was teaching him but not really. I ended up being the victim of amateur coffee hour, and not the best cup. Also, the beans tasted burnt. That's not even on the barista. Cmon guys I know it was a Wednesday morning but get your act together."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-11,5.0,"Great little spot for coffee! It was a hot week in NY so I did the mint iced coffee the first day, an empanada, and a pastry. No bitterness and great refreshing flavor with the mint. Empanadas were the best we had while in town. Came back 2 mornings later and we sat inside and caught up on emails with traditional coffee and cream. Enjoyed sitting in side, staff were friendly and helpful, and most importantly the coffee tasted like coffee."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-21,5.0,"Best Puerto Rican coffee in the East Village...
Attitude: friendly plus ultra! Try the Pepita Special, a cappuccino and a chicken empanada followed by a guava quesito! And if you are decadent go for the rum infused beans."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-25,5.0,Best coffee in the neighborhood! Amazing staff that is always with a nice smile. I love the quesitos!!!!! This is a good place to come and work on your computer while enjoying the amazing coffee.
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-10,5.0,"I have never written a review before, but I had to download this app to write about how incredibly kind the staff here are. For real they are the best, so hospitable & truly desire to make sure they serve their customers well! + there is great seating & wifi, so that's always nice. Everyone should definitely make a trip here!!!"
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-31,5.0,"Really amazing yummy coffee, and I am not a big coffee person. The cafe is really cute and cozy. The staff is very nice and professional, especially Karina. She is great! And Karina makes my coffee perfectly; a perfect start to my mornings. I will always choose a fresh coffee cafe over a name brand like Starbucks with their mediocre coffee. Glad I can support the local cafe. P.S. try the turkey bacon quesito. Perfect combo or sweet and salty treat!"
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-31,4.0,This is a great way to wake up! Strong yet smooth coffee from one single source farm to cup. Friendly caring staff with a simple yet welcoming environment.
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-03-10,5.0,"Love this place. I live around the corner and I walk in here a couple times a week. 

Delicious regular coffee. I hit my 10 purchased drinks reward today and got a free drink. Asked the barista for something fancy. He hooked me up with a quad shot oat-mocha or ""Oatka"". It was, I'm quite sure, the best coffee drink I've ever had! 

Bravo 787."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-08,5.0,"possibly the best cortado I've ever had.. yum. I like feeling like I'm supporting Puerto Rico, even if in a very small way.. but even more, I like this cortado!"
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-02,1.0,"Coffee was fine. However 1 star review is solely based on how long I got my drip coffee which took about 18 minutes. The cashier quoted 3 minutes but i think he probably didn't care much and possibly forgot about. That would have been fine if it was busy but the cafe was fairly quiet. Having so many coffee shops around the area, this is my first and last visit here as first impressions always count."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-09,5.0,"Great espresso coffee, friendly staff . Pastries too!
They went out of their way to help me there.
Would definitely come back."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-15,5.0,"Pretty dope coffee shop in the area. I love that it's run by Puerto Ricans and the decor gives it a homey feel. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming. I had an iced latte with oat milk, pretty good. Their pastries look amazing too. Stop by!"
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-10,5.0,Had an iced latte it was delightful. Staff very friendly. Overall chill vibe. Delicious quesitos.
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-05,5.0,"Hands down best cappuccino in alphabet city. Can not wait to return. Cool staff. Clean, fresh vibe. Small space so don't plan on camping out but truly perfect cup of caffeine."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-31,5.0,"I LOVE this place. It has some of the friendliest and most welcoming customer service that I have ever experienced. Ariel was so friendly! I have been to many coffee shops in NYC but this is one of the best in many ways. 
Not only was the coffee great and flavorful, but they have really good empanadas too. They also have sweet food if you prefer that. Unlike many other artisan coffee shops, they are reasonably priced and have flavor syrups that you can add. 
787 has WiFi, and a really great space to sit and work. I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-19,5.0,Five stars for 787 for the service alone. The whole staff was super friendly and welcoming. I was in there working for a while and they offered me a few refills of water as I sat around which I really appreciated. It wasn't an overbearing or annoying level so it was great. The space was clean and comfortable so it was easy to work in. I had a cap with their rum and cinnamon espresso. I'm not one for cinnamon so I'll probably just get the regular one next time but they asked if I wanted to try their special roast so why not give it a go?
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-03,5.0,Best matcha latte I've ever had. Very friendly staff and they have great quality matcha and coffee. Also they have gluten free cinnamon bread and lemon poppy bread that pairs well with a coffee. I always make a stop here when I'm in the area
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-07,5.0,"Nice little joint coffee was good and strong
I needed warming up it's 26 degrees 
The barista was nice and quickly served me with a smile 
And gave me a brief description of their company 
Nice place to drink a hearty cup of coffee"
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-11,5.0,Cute little cafe I stumbled upon in Nolita. I had no clue this coffee corner was inside The Market. A little pricey but coffee was decent.
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-25,5.0,"Farm to cup. No middle man. Straight from their hacienda (Lluminada) in Maricao, Puerto Rico. Their coffee is delicious and a must try for those who appreciate a good cup of coffee/espresso. I make it a priority to visit on the weekends, in the east village, to treat myself to their delicious selection of organic and farm-fresh coffee beans."
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-12,5.0,"Delicious Puerto Rican coffee produced farm to cup! Welcoming open store front and good vibes in here. You can tell how much love the team puts into the coffee, and it's single origin and from their farm in PR. Socially and economically responsible, too. Mmmm!"
197,787-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-12,5.0,Coffee is the best and loved the chicken empandas!  Very friendly staff.  Tried the rum-infused coffee and also liked it.
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-03-05,5.0,"Amazing coffee! Its hard to find a good coffee spot in new york but they know how to do it, they really care about having a good espresso.
The quinoa bowl is my favourite and the ranchero.
Good selection in pastries and fresh cookies."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-11-26,3.0,Yea their drinks are decent and made with care [i.e. don't expect it quick] but expect to pay a premium at this hipster-y joint. A hot chocolate is almost $6 for a tiny cup which is decently good but isn't quite a match for its price tag. I would probably even just hop over to Blue Spoon for their version instead. The small bar area with lids and sleeves doesn't have enough available space and I have almost spilled my drink more than once trying to finangle a lid onto my cup. They also offer a small selection of Supermoon Bakehouse goodies. So you can get an $8 croissant to go with your $6 drink :)
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-07-26,4.0,I was meeting a friend for a quick coffee in town and stumbled across this gem as I desperately didn't want to do Starbucks. Great find! I grabbed my coffee from their little coffee shop section and was allowed to take a seat inside in the main room which had a good feel and was quite spacious. Our server was polite but not very friendly however she did her job. I don't think she smiled once! Can't really tell anything about the food they serve there but it looked decent so I shall be back to sample for sure!
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-03-26,5.0,"This is a charming spot.  Great coffee, cute decor with a throwback vibe, and friendly staff.  In the mornings, they open up the front of the adjacent bar for seating which is really nice."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-04-08,3.0,"I came in today since I was in the area with a colleague and had heard good things about it. It's a tiny postcard stamp of a coffee shop with about 2 bar stools to sit at. They had some pastries when I went and obviously coffee and tea selections. I got an iced chai latte with oat milk, and it was okay. I've definitely had better so I don't know that I would return."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2018-10-05,4.0,"Update: deducting a star because they're losing consistency. The milk in the cappuccino is still good, but the coffee has a more burnt taste."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-03-03,4.0,"My usual coffee spot in the morning. They have short waits, great espresso drinks and YUMMY avocado toast. They also have oatmilk which is a big check plus!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2018-08-30,4.0,This place is very small and there is no seating. Good if you want a quick cup of coffee and a pastry. The cookie i got was fresh and tasted yummy! It was $3. The guy working there was very nice and asked how my day was going. Overall I had a good expreince here.
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-03-05,5.0,"I work nearby and have tried all the coffee shops in the area and the wooly daily is by fat the best one. Staff is always friendly, the pastries are delicious (looking at you, giant cookie) and the coffee is exceptional. Their ""shaker"" is the perfect drink for a summer day (iced cortado with maple) and their cappuccinos are always foamy and rich. Not to mention they have a rewards card so you get every tenth cup for free. Highly recommend."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-10-11,3.0,"I really enjoy their latte. I'm a coffee lover. The coffee is the best in NYC. I take off 2 stars only because their rude employees. I thought they were only cold to me, and I looked at their attitudes to others, the same cold look. Please put a little smiles!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2018-02-01,5.0,"Charming coffee shop in the financial district. My chai latte had a nice spicy-sweet flavor and came up quickly. The chicken biscuit was FANTASTIC! Oven fresh slightly sweet biscuit with fresh fried chicken and high-quality cheese. In the mornings, they offer seating in the adjacent restaurant, so you can grab a table and have a proper breakfast get together. Service was excellent, and the guy at the counter was helpful and brought my sandwich right to my table. I'll definitely be back for more breakfasts when I'm in the area!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-10-22,3.0,"A quaint coffee shop in the iconic Woolworth Building with very minimal seating of a vintage postcard setting.  Friendly and welcoming baristas without the corporate or chain coffee shop cookie cutter apathetic appeal.  Floor tiles are vintage black and white circular.

Pastries are MEH.  I ordered one savory muffin which contain sun-dried tomato, olives, and I think cranberries $3.75 as my breakfast on-the-go.  It was extremely dry and very bland.  The Wooly Daily have a loyalty punch card to obtain ten stamps."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2017-09-21,5.0,"Iced latte... with the first sip I could tell the quality is definitely there. Worth the $4.50 for sure. Will come back!

This location also has a public siting area close by. Grab yourself a coffee and enjoy the nice weather!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2018-10-26,2.0,"This is a nice place with a bar that has professional staff. 

But the coffee shop was manned by two grumpy teenagers that were incapable of forming any sentence. L

Coffee was ok, but Not with having again. 

If you just want a paper cup with something black to go. Then it's a great place."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-03-22,5.0,"Stumbled upon this place when I needed my morning chai latte. They had oat milk and made my chai per my specific order: not too sweet, not too hot and it was just right! Cute little place with room for 5 people (3 by the window and 2 in the corner)."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-03-01,5.0,"The baristas are amazing, so sweet! The coffee is amazing and they always have all kinds of milk substitutes. The breakfast all day is pretty good, I could eat the Quinoa bowl everyday!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-03-24,4.0,"Sleep and dreams may pull the wool over my eyes, but The Wooly Daily delivers a mammoth kick of caffeine to wake me up. The steamed milk warms up my frigid bones and its cold brethren brings me back to the ice age. The barista is efficient, friendly, and crafts a perfect latte. This coffee shop is tiny and is probably meant for the New Yorker on the go. Cheers that my favorite stop in the Financial District also takes the CupsApp. Use my code ""r4esu"" for $10 off a plan!

edit: 4/1/16 - CupsApp is no longer accepted and a star is deleted."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-09-19,5.0,Delicious coffee! A little pricey but worth it for a treat. There's also more room to sit and relax in the bar right next door.

Five Stars

First stop on free coffee Monday using the Cups App. Enter my Promo Code: 25pn5 for $10 off a purchase plan.  I had a cappuccino to stay. The place is around the corner from the famed Woolworth Building. It's pretty small shop. There is a back bar for cream, sugar, and other coffee accessories.  The main counter has a tiny pasty case. There are three stools by the window. That's pretty much it. The space has a cool theme - newspaper and Elephants. The coffee was expertly prepared even though there was a huge influx of people wanting free coffee."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-12-30,4.0,"The Wooly Daily is a magical place where I found some rare species in New York CIty --awesome baristas who are genuinely friendly and skilled at the same time! No matter how packed this place is, they always greet customers nicely and involve you in a light conversation.

Although the space is smaller than a hole-in-the-wall places, it felt comfortable and roomier than that! Great interior especially the paintings on the wall and the tiles with ""Wooly"" at the entrance--you know a place this thoughtful wont disappoint you with what they are serving.

Tried the Matcha Latte with almond milk today (I highly recommend getting Matcha Latte with almond milk. the nutty flavor of almond and the silk-like texture go really well with matcha). It is foamy, rich in almond and matcha flavor, fragrant, and sweet--a perfect cup to warm me up in the late afternoon.

This is my type of place and will see myself become a saturday frequenter soon : ) Also, the baristas were kind enough to give me cookies as New Year gifts! Happy New Year the Wooly Daily and Happy 1y Anniversary!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-02-09,1.0,"I used to love the Wooly and the old team of barista. My colleagues and I had made it a daily ritual to go to get a coffee there everyday. I'm so put off by the new team and the terrible service. The new staff if so grumpy and SO RUDE to customers... never smiling, makes you feel like you are bothering them asking for something... just AWFUL. 

Nobody wants to go back and it's really a shame.... we all used to love this place... I hope the owners will wake up."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-10-01,5.0,"This place is fantastic! And I was fortunate enough to come down here as this is the third week they are opening for Saturday (while Sunday will remains closed). Little as it is, the Wooly Daily somehow carried a chilled vibe and did not seem at all to be narrow.

Had a skinny latte myself but was super excited to try their daily baked goods as well as fruit salad bowls next time. Definitely an add-on in the financial district!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2019-07-09,2.0,"The quality of their drinks has gone down significantly in the past year. Please teach your new baristas especially those working  in the morning and afternoon how to make drinks (iced matchas, lattes etc) properly!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-09-23,5.0,"If you're a coffee lover and you're in Lower Manhattan, The Wooly Daily (named after its location in the Woolworth Building) should, most definitely, be on your list. The coffee is excellent, prepared by very friendly baristas (whose latte-decorating skills are quite impressive), and the pastries and baked goodies are top-notch. It's a small, grab-and-go place, but there's a few stools for you to just hang out and enjoy a break from the day. Bookmark it!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-10-19,5.0,"It's ironic this place sits next door to Starbucks because the juxtaposition is massive. This is the best coffee I've had for my 3 days in NYC. 

Great friendly service. Nuff said. 

Had some of the baked goods - I tried a blueberry muffin which was jam packed with real blueberries and it was moist and delicious. 

Yelp wants me to write more but I don't need to. Go here."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2018-10-22,3.0,Okay if you're in the hood and need coffee. Nothing special and nothing horrible. We had 2 cappuccinos.
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2018-02-05,4.0,"This place was a lot smaller than I was expecting but I was in the area looking for a bakery that had chocolate chip cookies and this was the first place that was recommended. Upon arrival, I was thinking ""wow this does not resemble a bakery at all."" The lighting was dark and the decor was very vintage. 

There is a glass case that has all the pastry options. I will say, in terms of options, there weren't that many and I probably would have left until I saw the chocolate chip cookies which were SO GOOD. One of the best I've had actually. I was won over as soon as I took one bite and can't wait to be back for more. It's a little out of way for me but so worth the trip!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2017-03-27,5.0,"Really like the place. So cool. Tiny but detailed. Have some posters hanging there, all topic in The Wooly Daily. Their latte was so good, at least lightened up my Monday morning (rainy especially!!!). It is a bit hard to find by the way, a small store just around the Wooly Public, you could easily get to another side via Google Map, but don't give up, as I found it really worth a try. I really like the cup design, very cute!!!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2017-04-27,5.0,"Found this little gem as I was walking by with some friends. Great coffee and even better service. I got a delicious cappuccino with a cookie that balanced perfectly. It was light and buttery with coconut, orange and other good stuff. Definitely recommend!"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-03-01,4.0,"A cute little coffee stand in the FiDi area, and definitely a great alternative to the Starbucks on the corner if you want to avoid lines and would prefer a carefully made latte instead of a factory line one. 

After finding out that the Wooly Daily was only a few hundred feet from the building where I work, I got another 15 cups plan on my Cups app! 

Get $10 off your first Cups plan with code: dmmrk. :)"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2018-12-18,5.0,"Love, love, love. I don't use my Nespresso machine anymore, because I love to get my coffee from here. Ham and cheese sandwich is really good as well as quinoa bowl. Super friendly and accommodating stuff."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-10-24,5.0,"At The Wooly Daily, you'll find fresh brewed Californian drip coffee that's bright, tangy, and crisp with a clean finish. Very different from the coffee you might find at Starbucks or other general coffee shops."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-10-28,5.0,"Some of the greatest baristas in the city. Friendly and skilled at what they do. One of the first few times I was here, I saw the barista pull something like 20 shots of espresso in a couple of minutes during the lunchtime rush. And busy as they are, they're always quick with a smile and some light conversation.

Now, on to the coffee. I usually get an espresso or Americano, so this will be about their espresso bean. It's not too sour and bright like where a lot of shops seem to be headed. There's depth and texture to it. Wooly's bean really hits the sweet spot for me. And it's great alone or paired with some milk.

The space is small but even with their lunchtime crowd, they're always brisk. Maybe not great to meet a few friends to catch up inside, but I recommend grabbing the coffees to go and seeking out a bench in City Hall Park if the weather's nice.

I could go on gushing, but then I'd miss out on grabbing another coffee from here. Seek this place out if you're in the area."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2017-07-16,3.0,"Went this past week for the first time.

Small and quaint with no seating.  Good drink selection (strong, good coffee) and decent selection of pastries.  I arrived around 8:30 and was told the breakfast sandwiches would not be ready until 9.  Strange.  

On another note, they keep sugar and sugar substitutes behind the register and hand them out sparingly. No idea what that's about.  

Only one barista who is also the cashier so the line can get long and if you are in a rush, go elsewhere."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2017-10-07,5.0,"This place is one of my faves in my work hood. They serve Sightglass coffee now and it's still good. And they have really stepped up their pastry game, so it's hard to say no. Finally, I heart the baristas."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2017-07-12,5.0,A quaint place with welcoming staff and delightful  cortado...even on a hot NYC day! Thank you!!
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-05-20,5.0,Came here for the first time today and ordered a chocolate chip cookie.  This will definitely become one of New York City's top chocolate cookies.  I can't wait to try their coffee!  Jonathan who works there is so kind and wonderful to chat with.  A great addition to the neighborhood - thank you!

They got rid of the in-house baker (amazing homemade english muffins, the best biscuit I've ever eaten - bacon, onions, cheese...it was unreal) and replaced the baked goods with generic, commercial croissants that you can get at Starbucks down the street or the Pret around the corner. 

Still a great cup of coffee, and friendly staff, but the disappearing english muffins (really all the homemade baked goods) are a BIG loss."
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-06-29,4.0,"It's one of those friend of a friend New York stories. I was attracted to the retro design of this tiny coffee shop. Of course I expressed my charm by taking pictures. The guy who walks in, to buy his favorite cookie, happens to know the woman who opened this coffee shop. She baked the cookies in his friend's kitchen in Greenpoint. It's a Brooklyn dream come true; and can happen to you. The poppy seeds in the peanut butter cooking were interesting. Truly, the conversation with the architect heightened this gluten free cookie's unexpected spices. This is a quiet coffee shop in an otherwise busy part of town. The baker happened to have won best new bakery not too long ago ... My personal Woolworth tour guide did let me know that the cookies can be better. Normally, I might knock down a review to three stars for that. But really, the coffee shop is a charmer. And, you really should take a tour of the Woolworth Building. It's impressive.

P.S. Cobble Hill is named after cobblers. Is that TMI? ;-)"
198,the-wooly-daily-new-york,2016-02-04,5.0,Small spot to grab coffee to-go but their service is really great and the coffee is delicious! Their cups are cute and the barista was very nice. I will definitely come back!
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2020-04-05,5.0,"This coffee shop is great for working in! Awesome lighting -- they have very big windows that create a great atmosphere. Their drinks are good! I've never had anything that's been mind-blowing, but nor have I ever been disappointed. The space is always very clean.

They have: 
--WiFi
--Restrooms Downstairs (Ask for the key)
--No outlets for your phone/laptop. Which, is fine if you get there with a full battery -- and, as an optimist, it can kind of be a nice way of limiting how long you work for.

I think getting there right when they open is the most optimal time.

Staff has always been friendly and courteous."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2020-03-28,3.0,I used to come by when it was Toby's coffee and often enjoyed grabbing a latte or cappuccino. There was always friendly service and the coffee always hit the spot.  I visited under the rebranding of Partners coffee and I would say the coffee is still solid but the vibe and service are not quite the same.  I will still come by if I am in the area for a coffee to go.
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-06-19,4.0,"I've been coming to this cafe every few months since it was Toby's Estate. They always had solid coffee, space to lounge and work, and a bathroom. Coffee shops with bathrooms are my favorite thing in the world! 

The other day, I was in the area trying to find Tobys and couldn't find it on the map. I had no idea it had changed names! The coffee bags in the store say same staff and same coffee, just a different name. I'm down with that! 

I had a cold brew and BF had a masala chai latte. Both were good. We were just really glad to be out of the rain! Plus, we wanted a place to chill for an hour or so before it was time for our plans. Throw in a bathroom and we were set for the next hour or so. 

Staff were nice and bathroom was clean. They're down the stairs though, so not disability friendly - for those who need an accessible bathrooms"
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-04-01,5.0,"I really loved it in here today. 

The options between the coconut oatmeal, egg sandwiches, pastries, lattes, coffee, milk options (huge fan of oat milk!) 

The matcha latte was lovely with oat milk. 

The people that work here were very friendly, kind, hospitable. It was also nice and a personal touch to ask what my name is for my drink (outside of Starbucks). 

The seating inside is cozy and I really liked this."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-20,4.0,"I've been here multiple times and it's one of my favorite coffee shops to stop into when I'm in the area. It's pretty small, but has some tables and little stools to sit on. There are big windows that let in a lot of natural light, which is nice. They have a great selection of coffee/tea and pastries as well as some more savory items. If you're looking for a coffee shop with a cozy ambience, I would recommend this place!"
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-03-17,5.0,"This coffee shop has great coffee and a hip atmosphere. The quality of espresso seems high. It's a great place to read or chat with friends, too.

The only downside is that it's a very busy location and the seating can be limited due to how busy it is."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-03-08,4.0,"Cute little spot in West Village for coffee. Stopped in for a cappuccino. Great flavor, coffee comes from Brooklyn. Barista was extremely friendly (cute!), and informative as it visiting from out of state."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-06-23,2.0,"This place used to be Toby's Estate and is now renamed to Partners Coffee. There is relatively ample seating, all little tables and stools. The worst part about this place is that there is no bathroom, so you gotta hold in your pee and take it elsewhere after you finish the diuretic you purchased. They have oat milk woo. They were out of matcha when I came though :("
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2020-02-19,3.0,"Love the coffee, but the baristas are always a little rude. Not blatantly rude, just a little cold like you're wasting their time. Is this part of the schtick? If so, well done! If not, work on customer service training."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2020-01-23,5.0,"Partners Coffee is a real gem. 

The food is delightful, the shop is cozy & the coffee is good. 

Order the yogurt parfait, a side of bacon or the eggs! It is a treat!"
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-12-27,4.0,Stopped in with my boyfriend for a quick breakfast one day and had a good experience. The egg on a roll is a bit pricey (almost $10 I believe) but delicious. Drip coffee is also great.
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-04-01,4.0,Nice staff & drip coffee but overall I wasn't so impressed! I think there are better coffee shops in the area. Would go again if I am passing by but wont go out of my way for it..
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-03-06,4.0,"Popped into Toby's on a blustery NYC day to get out of the cold, have a hot drink, and use the bathroom.  The space was packed out; we had to wait a few minutes before a table opened up for us to squeeze in.  The staff was incredibly friendly.  Public bathrooms in NYC can be difficult to come by, and the barista not only took our orders but made sure the bathroom key went to the next person who had asked.  My almond milk latte was a bit on the bitter side, but all in all the place has a cute vibe that I would be interested in trying again."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-09-20,4.0,"We had a wonderful little pit stop here for coffee, açaí bowls, & a matcha strawberry lemonade. Not much seating but everything we had was wonderful! They have gluten free cookies as well."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2020-03-10,1.0,So I just went to go get coffee and who I believe is the manager seemed very sick coughing everywhere not covering his mouth and I didn't even see him washing his hands or wearing a mask. This is not safe and is not ok with everything that's going on he should have respect for the customers and the employees who seemed very worried. PLEASE STAY HOME IF YOUR GOING TO BE SICK AND STOP SPREADING THE CORONAVIRUS THINK ABOUT OTHERS
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-07-21,5.0,"Toby's Estate is probably my favorite coffee shop in the area so far. Having to work remotely, this location has plentiful seating and a very chill environment. I visited this location about 3 days in a row because it was just that great and even when it was really busy--there was always seating! Also--the wifi is really reliable if you're looking for a good place to do work! 

I've tried the cold brew here which I enjoyed and is a great morning pick me up. If you're looking for something more refreshing and are not in the mood for coffee, try the Arnold Palmer!"
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-07-04,5.0,"I arrived a bit earlier than my boyfriend and asked if I could wait inside. The workers were patient and I sat myself down in the meantime. When he arrived, we ordered an avocado toast w/ eggs and acai bowl. We were given a card that they used to locate us once the food was ready. The toast dish was seasoned well and the acai bowl was refreshing. I'm loved the meal and will probably be back again to try the other things on their menu."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-06-25,5.0,"Awesome place to get your coffee fix. Strong, delicious coffee with a unique, delicious taste. I was feeling so sleepy but a few sips of this coffee woke me right up! Love how this coffee shop has a bathroom as well. Always a plus as obviously most people need to go potty after drinking coffee. Unique flavors available too like matcha latte. Good snacks available for eating too. I loved the gluten free cookie they had available. Staff was so nice and welcoming. Pleasant atmosphere.  Thank you guys! Keep up the great work!"
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-09-15,5.0,"Came here multiple days to do work. Fantastic ambience...an adorable little place. Bathroom available and line is never too long. 
I got a chai latte with almond milk which was very satisfying.
Only downside is that they close at 6, otherwise it is a great place to do work.
Staff was friendly and service was efficient. Definitely recommend for work, meeting up with some friends, or just coming for a morning cup of joe."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-07-14,2.0,"Yikes, I used to love Toby's and after the rebrand, I don't think I'll come back. The decor is off - the counter looks messy, there's coffee bags used as decor by the windows, the coffee was not that good, and the service was not good."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-09-16,5.0,Best breakfast sandwich in Manhattan!  Avacado toast. Coffee and atmosphere are great. Superb staff. Wonderful.
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2017-04-27,3.0,"I had a pretty good cup of coffee here. There wasn't much seating in the place but their Brazil pour over was pretty solid for those who, like me, love dark and bitter black coffee. It wasn't as strong as it could have been but it was enough to give me my caffeine fix while tasting decent.

The atmosphere of Toby's is very quiet. There isn't much seating but it wasn't very crowded when I got there, so it was a perfect place to get some work done or have a subdued conversation with friends. The location is incredibly convenient.

I didn't try the food but they had some interesting options that I might try in the future if I were in the area. They were out of acai bowls though, so make note if you are coming for that, you might want to check in advance if they have them that day."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2017-03-11,4.0,"For the full experience:
- get there early morning, before 10am
- grab a newspaper and a sunny window seat
- get a CINNAMON OR BLUEBERRY MEGPIE (a homemade poptart that's the best morsel of the food in the place)
- you can't stay at the coffeeshop, WARM the megpie in your home microwave for a cinnamon roll-blueberry cobbler mind-trick
- avoid the pricey coffee and get a tea, where they'll give you a fanciful full pot and whimsical cup and saucer

The price/taste of coffee here is four stars, but the MEGPIE is five stars!!!"
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-11-03,4.0,"Very good almond latte, didn't need sugar, taste was smooth. They unfortunately ran out of to stay mugs when I was there so had to use a to go cup. Fairly clean bathroom."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2017-12-10,4.0,"Really solid coffee, baked goods, pastries, and light bites served in a gorgeous venue where some modern décor here and there blends into the vintage brick-walled surroundings.

Service was prompt and friendly, and the pour over that I got was exactly the bold kick I needed for those mid-afternoon doldrums, and enjoying it all curled up, Carrie Bradshaw style, on the outside bench was an invigorating way to recharge and soak in the scenery on a beautiful fall weekend. 

There is a modest amount of seating inside, but it isn't really the kind of place for day-long laptop loiterers. Quiet conversation and a newspaper read, yes. Overall, a very nice experience."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-10-28,4.0,"I got the pancetta, egg fritata, provolone cheese, jalapeno mayo on a pretzel roll and it was delicious. Perfect neat serving for only $6. It's better when it's hot. I also tried the almond croissant which has a yummy filling inside. It is a very small space though and popular amongst coffee drinkers so you may find yourself having to wait a good bit depending on what time you get there."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-11-22,5.0,"Really nice vibe here.  Warm and cozy, but spacious at the same time.  Nice place with big windows and a cozy couch.

I got a chai latte and it was really great.  I didn't use the wifi, but there have it.  Barista was really nice and worked fast to get my drink."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-08-11,4.0,"Capacity: about 25
Free wifi
No electric plugs
Bathroom
Large windows, well-lit
One couch
Ok decoration, baristas, coffee"
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-01,4.0,"Great coffee, tea, breakfast and lunch food, great location, excellent customer service, super nice management, and one of the best parts: they have good WiFi! Also, they have benches outside which is a plus if you want to work inside and take a phone call outside. Great place to work on your computer EXCEPT - this is why I couldn't give it 5 stars - it is SUPER COLD inside! So, it's hard to work on your computer at the same time. The A/C vent hits certain tables HARD, so I always sit by the window on the left side (the right side is cold). I've asked staff if there is anyway they could not make it so cold, but some say they are hot in the kitchen (basement) and some of the staff say they are freezing as well. And btw it's not like I'm coming in dressed in a mini skirt or sun dress and no jacket! I prepare myself for this particular coffee shop to come in wearing a long sleeve shirt, long pants, and a jacket or sweater, but I've still been super cold every time. It's so cold that I've had to think twice about visiting this coffee shop to work but I'm torn because the rest is so good - It's even crossed my mind that MAYBE they crank the A/C super cold on purpose so people won't stay in there as long?? I even had to ask for a blanket once to sorta hint to them that it's just way too cold, but in reality I think if they did offer blankets like they do in certain places In cold Denmark, then I'd give it a solid five stars."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-08-15,4.0,"Hats off to this place for featuring decaf cold brew, perfect for a summer afternoon. Friendly staff and good coffee, only one star left off for inconsistent WiFi. Will return here aoon"
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2017-09-20,4.0,"My first time here and I'm a fan!
I had a iced mocha and their raspberry tart. I had an iced mocha for the first time and I ask myself why I haven't ordered it before this day! It is a really good alternative to coffee if you can't deal with the strong, sometimes nauseating effects of coffee. The iced mocha is perfect for a hot 70-80 degree day in New York and it's sweet, but not too sweet to make you feel unhealthy. The tart was okay, nothing special, similar to a poptart.
The space here is great, however, it is quite small and hard to move around. There are several work spaces from tables to counters to bars by the window."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2017-06-25,5.0,"Really friendly and quick service - their cold brew and iced tea is a little pricy but so worth it. 

It's in a great location and has plenty of seating for the space."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-07-06,4.0,"A very cozy West Village coffee shop - a perfect break from a crazy NY world. On top of that the coffee is really good, their selection of pastries is wide and almost all of them are delicious. They also serve  breakfast and lunch - I tried almost everything on the manu and not once was I  disappointed. Even though the place stays busy I was always able to find a place to sit and work from there. One star off for the toiley situation."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2017-04-08,5.0,"Originally planned on going into Bluestone Lane Collective Cafe which is a few blocks away but, as expected on a Saturday afternoon, there was a wait. Being short on time, my friend and I decided to pop into Toby's. It was about 12pm and there was room to sit which was kind of shocking to find in the West Village at that time. The place itself is very cozy and they offer stool sitting as well as a couch to sit on (if not occupied already). 
The drink selection is great, i ordered a chai latte with almond milk and my friend got the mint tea. The presentation of the tea was adorable!
While we didn't get anything to munch on, Toby's offers a variety of food. There is everything from avocado toast to gluten free AND vegan peanut butter cookies. 
I believe they offer pastries from Ovenly (in Brooklyn, which is a great spot as well) and from Balthazar.
If you have certain allergies (as i do) definitely stop by for a light munch and a warm drink, as Toby's can accommodate!"
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2016-12-26,4.0,"If you're looking for a cozy and comfortable coffee shop to study, work, or socialize then I'd highly recommend stopping by this Toby's location in West Village.

I came here on a Friday morning in December at around 9:00 am and it wasn't too crowded. There is limited seating here, but I think it's more cozy than cramped. Fortunately, I was able to find a seat at one of the white tables, which is one of the main reasons I wanted to come here since I could take an overhead coffee shot (hahaha, judge me). I ended up getting a cappuccino and thought it was one of the best cups I've had in New York. I forgot to ask what coffee beans the baristas used, but I will definitely ask when I go back.

It always amazes me when coffee shops don't have wifi available for the public, but luckily, there's wifi here. This Toby's location also has restrooms on the bottom floor - you just have to ask one of the baristas for a key, which is actually a huge pet peeve of mine. I've never been a fan of using a key to unlock a public restroom... it just seems so unsanitary. I'm almost certain there are a plethora of people who don't wash their hands after using the restroom.

Regardless of the bathroom situation, I will definitely be coming back to get some work done."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-03-26,5.0,"Coffee spot that serves delicious food!  I've been wanting to check it out because of the beautiful Yelpers' food pics.  It's right around the corner from Equinox -- post workout treat-to-self right?!  This is a big-windowed, bright, calm, little sanctuary on 6th Ave.  The shop is small with only ~20 seats total, including 3 4-top tables, but was surprisingly not crowded at all.  It felt airy and like a place you can go to, buy a coffee and an avocado toast, and read your NYT in peace in the morning.  As opposed to coffee shops that are purely foot traffic, always loud with meetings, etc.  I hope it stays this type of Cali-vibe calm.  The two women working at the counter were also calm, pacific and relaxed."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-02-24,4.0,"Another great Australian coffee stop in the west village. Speedy service, not scandalous pricing and decent brew. Recommended."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2017-11-20,4.0,"Cute place, but limited seating. Ended up having to eat my acai bowl on the outside bench."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2016-06-22,3.0,"Good coffee, fun vibe.

This would make a great people-watching spot in the West Village. 

Stopped here after brunch for an iced americano to go. They use the tablet cashier system which is always a little weird since they spin the stand and your receipt and tip are right there in their face as they begin to take your order.

The coffee was quickly made, the barista was a little hesitant when I asked for the almond milk. Simple syrup was available at the sidebar. Self-served.

There were also quite a few patrons looking for barista-like jobs in the establishment."
199,partners-coffee-new-york-3,2018-09-21,3.0,"Coffee is very good, service not so much.  Most employees move at a snails pace.  Today I requested the beans I purchases to be ground for pour-over.  The guy behind the counter I guess didn't hear me and with a bit of attitude goes, ""what?"".  What about ""excuse me?"".  Simple manners go a long way.  Doesn't cost one anything to be nice.  It was extremely off-putting and I will likely not be back."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2020-01-22,5.0,"Adorable cafe with reasonably priced yet tasty coffee and pastries, the perfect level (and choice) of music, lush plants and a peaceful ambiance in the presence of newspapers and books. Will definitely return to this artsy and creative neighborhood cafe."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2020-01-01,5.0,New Year's Day drop in was super cozy + friendly. We had such a nice time siting by the windows eating our pastries + drinking coffees. Highly recommend.
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2018-11-16,5.0,"I was in the neighborhood for a work event and stumbled upon this great little cafe. I love trying no coffee shops when I'm not being a basic Starbucks B*tch lol. 

Came in and was greeted warmly by the barista. When I inquired about non dairy milk options I learned they offer soy, almond and oat which is a plus! Got a large Cold Brew with soy and it was delicious. At the recommendation of the barista I also tried the Almond Chocolate Croissant which was a huge win !"
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2019-06-08,4.0,"This coffee shop is beautifully surrounded by exotic plants. I love their coffee cup and saucer. The service is great and fast. Not a lot of people during my visit there. 

I liked the vibes and the service there. The espresso itself was just okay, I had better. I think Stumptown coffee bean tastes way better, more fragrant not too over roasted. 

But not a bad place to have a coffee time with friends."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2018-11-06,5.0,"I find this cafe to be really comfortable and cozy. I enjoy sitting inside and sipping on a cappuccino or even just taking coffee to go. The service is quite friendly and warm. It's also very convenient to have a cafe with a bathroom. There is some comfy seating inside as well as 2 metal benches outside of the store front. You've got newspapers for your reading pleasure, but I think it's best to come with a friend to chat and sip warm java on a cold day."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2020-02-04,2.0,Decent cafe but service can be better. Think the staff is pushy and abrasive when you sit down and don't immediately place an order.
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2019-08-12,4.0,"Decent coffee shop. Cute aesthetic quiet and warm. The service is just ok, not super friendly when I stopped in. Cool seating options and the bakery items were nice as well. Wish the service was better and it would have been a 5! Maybe next time."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2019-08-26,5.0,"Amazingly cozy space and terrific coffee and pastry. Strongly recommend! The people working there are very friendly, great place to relax in the community."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2019-11-18,5.0,"Quiet little cafe tucked away in a relatively unexplored side of Grand St. Flat white was actually a flat white (barista made it 3x to perfect the latte art). Surrounded by exotic plants and friendly vibes, I would definitely come here again."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2018-03-09,5.0,"This is my favorite cafe. 

I can never get into doing computer work at home, so I have to force myself outside to become productive.

Seeking a quiet coffee shop in lower Manhattan is impossible, so discovering this middle-of-nowhere gem almost feels like a mirage... but its real and so perfect and charming. 

Barista/owner is so nice. You don't feel rushed to leave.

The only type of customers that come in and out of this place appear to be neighborhood residents. Perfect. No tourists. No hollering large groups. 

Anyway, I got plenty done since the cafe was quiet enough for me to focus. 

Want to read your next novel, but get distracted easily by noise? Come here. You'll actually be able to get through a couple of pages."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2018-01-20,5.0,"I don't know why, but I did not expect this little gem to be in this area. 

The coffee is good and the aesthetics are on point! It's so cute! 

Not to mention the owner is fabulous. I asked him if I could tip using my card (because he didn't turn the Square around for me to sign) and he said something along the lines of, ""no, your tip is the joy I get from seeing your healthy faces."" (I was with someone and we had just gotten done with a run). We need more people like this! 

If you're running in East River Park, make this your finish line! 

Go to get caffeinated, go for the winsome interior, go because the owner is a gem, whatever you do, go!"
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2019-03-27,5.0,"This is a friendly little neighborhood spot, has a warm cozy fireplace kinda feel (without the fireplace), and friendly service.  Reasonable coffee prices (there's not much else to order), and a decent amount of seating for the space.  It's off the beaten path of LES and yet close to my apt, I'm very grateful they exist."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2017-04-22,5.0,"Great quiet place in a quiet part of town. Could have the best Cortado I've ever had. Relaxing atmosphere and they gave out free cookies before closing! 

Definitely coming back here more often."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2016-11-20,5.0,"I used to live right around the corner from the original Ost on Avenue A, now I'm a homeowner on Grand Street, and wouldn't you know there's a familiar face to welcome me to the block here on Grand Street.

I'd argue that this Ost has a friendlier staff than the Ave A location, but they don't have wine here like they do in East Village (maybe someday?). That's a bit of a hit, but I was always more of an Ost coffee drinker than an Ost wine drinker anyway. 

It's a true neighborhood spot, so you'll see a lot of familiar faces when you start coming here regularly."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2019-01-28,4.0,"Nice place to have a cup of coffee or Expresso and muffins. You can relax ,read or just bring your laptop to do your research. Staff is friendly and  professional."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2018-03-18,5.0,"Great neighborhood cafe serving good drinks and atmosphere. Perfect for a quick drink, catch up with friends (quiet conversation) or working. I love spending hours working here as they've good drinks, WiFi, and bathroom. It's close to perfect  my only wish is that they have more outlet spots (there is only one by the window table seat)."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2016-08-05,5.0,"I have been going to different coffee shops for the past month because I am taking an online class, and I have to say this is by far my favorite one!!!

The main reasons why this place is my favorite so far is because: (In no particular order)
1. It is quiet with soft music 
2. Open space and natural lighting (big windows)
3. Not crowded (compared to the one in east village)
4. Coffee and tea were both really good
5. Interior design is very chic and comforting

Overall, this place is amazing and I would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to find a cute cafe to study and do work. I will be coming back here for sure!"
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2016-12-12,4.0,"Ost Café is simply charming. The latte wasn't the best but at least the shot of espresso packed a punch. The flavors themselves were not pronounced but the drink was still well made. What I like about Ost that I sometimes take issue with at places further west is that it's non-pretentious and cozy. The staff is incredibly friendly and the seating is both ample and diverse. In addition, I enjoyed the option of glassware to-stay, which you'd be surprised is becoming too sparse in the area. I will be back to work here and try their drip coffee!"
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2018-03-06,5.0,Great little community spot. Definitely the best coffee in this area and a chill place to hang out or do work. The owner is really welcoming and seems to know everyone that comes in.  Will be back!
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2017-08-06,5.0,"This place is charming, cozy, and clean. Great atmosphere, very good coffee, nice interior, friendly staff.
Way to go! 5+ stars!"
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2015-06-04,4.0,"I (finally) went there today - with a friend, in the late morning - and fortunately we had no problem getting seating, as it's a tiny place.  It's attractive, with exposed brick walls.  There was music playing continually, but it wasn't too terribly loud.  The young woman working there was very pleasant.

I got a small regular coffee ($1.75), but it was just ""fair"".  However; all other aspects were fine, including an ""A"" rating from the Health Department (also, my friend told me the restroom was very clean) and I'm grateful to have a coffee house in our neighborhood."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2018-04-20,5.0,"LOVED this coffee shop. Coffee is balanced in acidity, pastries are not dried out or stale like at chains. Atmosphere is unique and decor a lovely throwback to the neighborhood's beginnings in history. Baristas/owners super friendly and engaged with customers. Will probably move here and will consider this an asset to the area for sure!"
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2017-01-01,5.0,"Happy to have stumbled upon this tiny gem of a cafe on the lower east side. Perfect place to get warm, have a fantastic cup of coffee and listen to some good tasteful music. I really enjoyed the wooden bench and old school floor heater in the front window. Perfect for warming up your feet and watching the world go by."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2017-11-25,4.0,"Cute place. I feel the wait staff is generally not that friendly but the coffee is pretty stellar. :) they also have almond milk is always a plus. Smile more people, it makes a big difference for the customer."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2018-01-26,5.0,"OST Cafe is an awesome spot to grab a cup of coffee, chai latte, or delicious pastry. This cozy and soothing atmosphere is a great place to unwind and relax or grab a quick cup on your way to work. Luke the manager is a personable and friendly guy who brightens your day when it is most hectic. I highly recommend OST"
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2016-11-17,5.0,The best coffee! I use to go when I was living in the east village the employees are always different every time I go but always really nice and talkative.
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2017-10-02,3.0,"This place is adorable, classy, with reasonable and respectable selection of high-quality drinks and bakery items. Not crowded and clearly a favorite among wide range of locals, young and older, who pop in and out. Unfortunately, the waft of cigarette fumes from just outside the entrance is nauseating, constant, and will keep me away."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2015-10-06,4.0,"It's a really nice addition to the neighborhood. A quiet and friendly spot. The coffee is not the best but decent. Love to have a place like this in this neighborhood. The people who work here are extremely nice. 

Love their cortado! 

Definitely a place to visit for coffee."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2015-03-18,5.0,"Another brilliant addition to my hood!

This place is absolutely adorable. The decor is warm and the exposed brick is a nice touch. There's always, ALWAYS good music on in the background which really does matter to me. You're setting a mood and they do it well.

It's clean and the staff is kind and efficient.
I appreciate that they carry both soy and almond milk. My go-to beverage is their iced cappuccino. Excellent flavor and a fair dose of caffeine for this addict.

Nice job guys!
Thanks for bringing some life to my end of Grand Street."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2017-07-21,4.0,"This cafe is very beautiful with dangling lights and has a homey vibe. It's a good place to study since there is minimal noise, but it's hard to grab a slightly larger table that you may prefer when you're studying since there are only 3 of them. Still, I drank the ice chai tea and it was great (similar to the Starbucks Chai Tea Latte, but less sweet and strong). I would definitely go again!"
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2017-07-11,1.0,"I read some of these reviews and I'm aghast. This place, Ost, has the worst coffee I've ever tasted in my life. I've tried more than a few times -- thinking maybe on any given day it may be a bad batch -- but every time, every order is foul tasting. Foul coffee, foul cappuccino, foul latte. I've had better burned coffee from a bodega, seriously. 
Ost is the only place on the lower east side that serves ""upscale"" coffee (except Doughnut Plant) and it's always empty -- that has to tell you something in a heavily residential neighborhood. Better to walk a few blocks to Doughnut Plant, or just get a plain coffee from the deli."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2016-08-07,5.0,I live super close to this place and am very impressed by how layed back and chill the environment is. Drinks are standard price and it's a very nice setting with open lights and a lot of space. Great place to be if you need to get work done or read a book

200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2016-12-05,5.0,"Watching the barista patiently help an older man understand how wifi works. Earlier, she stepped away from the register to help a man with a stroller. She is the NICEST person. And she makes excellent coffee. Great neighborhood spot."
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2018-01-21,4.0,"Although this place screams gentrification hipster cafe, I've come here twice and it's a pretty relaxed place. I really enjoy their hot chocolates and their pastries taste very fresh. I just wish they toasted them! It's weird for me to eat a muffin or croissant cold, but unfortunately for some reason they don't do that. Still would recommend for a quiet place to grab a coffee/hot tea"
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2018-02-18,5.0,"So friendly, good coffee, lots of magazines to read. Ost is a welcome part of the eastern Grand St. neighborhood, and it's become an important community hangout in this remote corner of Manhattan. Hooray for Ost!"
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2016-12-26,5.0,Best place. I live on Grand Street with my mom  so it's a fun place for me to be at and my mom loves Ost.
200,ost-cafe-new-york-3,2014-03-30,5.0,"I love this place! The coffee is great, the ambiance is relaxing, and the service is good. It's a much needed addition to the area and I hope they stay put for a long long time. 
It's worth the walk over here to get a delicious cappuccino. Go get a donut a Doughnut Plant then head east for a great cup of coffee."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2020-05-15,5.0,"Omg. I just stopped here for a quick coffee. However, once approached and given the best service, I added a breakfast sandwich. 

All I can say is wow. When you are used to be treated so under valued by the big coffee guys, this was such a positive to start my day. 

The young man and woman were so polite and made me feel like I was not just a customer grabbing a coffee and get out here, they treated me like family. 

This is how small business will grow and hope to shut down these over rated establishments. 

I wanted to say thank you to them again!!!!!"
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2020-03-05,5.0,Me and my children were visiting the Statue of Liberty I was looking for a warm cup of coffee when we stumbled upon this quiet corner in the middle of the financial district. My children were impressed with there latte art in their hot cocoa where as I found myself indulging in my light but strong and still hot cup of coffee. The barista went out of his wya to make sure my cup of coffee was hot just the way I like it. I would come back here again with my family. Even though my 2 year old made a mess they made it no trouble at all to help me clean up his mess.

201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2020-03-25,4.0,"Very good coffee and a clean place if you can grab a spot to sit.  All the way downtown, but a good place to grab a latte if you're in the area!"
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2019-10-29,5.0,Nice people and really nice design. I spend an hour when I realized. I'm big fan of Gregorys and I'm always go to flatiron branch which also very n
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2019-03-30,5.0,"Gregory's is a reliable coffee shop and its Financial District/ Bowling Green location is no exception. While the rest of FiDi eerily grinds to a halt on weekends, this location was reliably open even on a sleepy Saturday morning. We grabbed an oat milk latte and a Hall and Oats (honey, cinnamon, oatmilk iced latte) for the road and kickstarted a fabulous weekend in NYC."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2020-03-05,5.0,Saw they had a maple latte drink option and since then it's been my go to spot. The best part of this location is it's in the heart of where I work. Service is great and the drinks are always on point. The manager and staff never fails to make you feel at home
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2020-02-28,5.0,I really love the vibe of this location! The coffee is incredible and staff are super helpful and accommodating! I only have good things to say about this Greg's!

Didn't get a 5 star from me because their coffee and espresso is too citrus-y for me, I like mine earthy and nutty. So all the cold brews has a tangy taste to it."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-01,5.0,Was in NYC on vacation and while walking to Battery Park I went by Gregorys Coffee. I was hot and desperately in need of an ice coffee so I went in. The service was quick and the baked goods looked delicious. I was not disappointed the ice coffee was excellent and so was the Banana Bread. I have been there a few times this week and found it very good every time.
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2019-02-13,4.0,"Very cute little spot ! I've got ""Whole lotta love "" and my friend had Matcha , both drinks were very tasty , good thing that there was no sugar in Matcha and it was delicious . Fast service. 4 stars because the tables weren't clean ."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2020-03-05,1.0,"Generally talking customer service is horrible in all these coffee shops chain , too pricey and specially in the locations in Jersey City,? I have been in both but unfortunately it was a bad experience and one of the worst I have ever had . Lack of cleanness and cluttered stores, I will never ever recommend them to anyone."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2019-02-08,5.0,"Great service and the desserts are really great.
Also very clean and spacious.

2] Banana chocolate chip muffin was burnt
3] Cashier struggled HARD to ring up my entire order, so I had to keep getting money out during a busy line
4] The entire ""to go"" coffee processing area is so messy and tight. Even when it's not crowded. 

Unfortunate that this was the closest coffee shop to my job, but definitely not worth coming back to"
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2017-07-24,4.0,"Standard coffee joint, with latte art. Flavors aren't noted anywhere in the shop, so just ask!!

Ordered the hazelnut latte with almond milk. They don't have coconut or soy milk. 

Perfect balance of milk and espresso. A medium ran a bit high at 6.50$.

Not a lot of space for seating either."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-05,5.0,"Visiting NYC for a week, was in a desperate need for a caffeine fix after seeing the Statue of Liberty. Didn't want to go to any chains while I was here, so we were going to food places that were only native to NY. This is a short walk away from where the ferry docks, and not only is the ambience amazing, the employees are super friendly, and the coffee is to DIE for! Starbucks who? I ordered the Quick Fix, and I've never had anything that amazing."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2018-04-06,4.0,"Service was fast and friendly. The coffee was great and so was the food. I had a peanut filler smoothie (or something close to that) and loved it. There are plenty of options for food which was nice to have- both baked goods and fresh foods (think avocado breakfast toast, smoothies, etc.). 

The only downfall was the lack of seating. My word was it windy when we visited! Of course that is nothing the cafe could control, but it was a bummer standing by the door and being blasted by the wind every few seconds. On one hand though, that does attest to their quality of food and following! But in all seriousness more options for sitting would have made the visit perfect."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-11,5.0,Perfect little coffee shop with juices and smoothies. Great selection for dairy-free or vegan finds. Delicious coffee!

201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2019-06-24,4.0,Still the goto coffee place for me in the area. Felt the coffee was a little uneven a few times but great people and good place to stop for a coffee break.
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2019-06-20,1.0,"This location is close to my office so sometimes I'll duck in for a coffee or breakfast sandwich. And then I remember: they are the worst! The counter people are generally nice, but they screw up--or completely forget about--my order every single time, and then the convenience becomes a moot point because I'm left waiting for 20 minutes for what should be a 5-minute transaction. They are never apologetic about it. Their grab-n-go stuff is so overpriced it's ridiculous. And last but not least, their coffee tastes weird."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2018-03-02,5.0,"Mmmmmm turmeric latte was my first and very delicious; I've heard they can be made poorly. Very cool spot. Staff were friendly and patient with us, explaining the aeropress as she made it. The branding is perfect hipster material. Will seek these out next time I'm in NYC."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2018-01-15,5.0,"Great coffee place close to everything! My daughter and I stopped in on a cold day while walking around NYC. I had a ""normal"" coffee and she had got chocolate. Both were great!  Service and friendliness were spot on!"
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2017-08-16,5.0,"I came here one morning for coffee and was wowed by the customer service. It was a total contrast to the rude exchange I had at a particular Starbucks location the day before. I thought maybe this was a fluke so I gave it a try another day. Still very impressed! 

Coffee is also consistently good :D!"

She also chose to purposely only greet everyone else in line after me and had an attitude when I requested to not receive a receipt. Coffee and quality customer service go hand in hand, rectify this ASAP. I chose to submit this review before leaving out. I will be attaching a photo of the barista."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2018-05-05,3.0,"Meh. A bit overpriced and just ok. The muffin was fine but not worth the calories to eat the whole thing. The toast took forever to come out, and was pretty overpriced in my opinion. 3 stars because there are several other better coffee options within a 5 minute walk of here."

201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2018-07-18,3.0,"Service is fast. Used to be friendlier, but efficiency is good too. Coffee is consistent but don't order the pastries. 

I find the coffee pretty good. The hot coffee and espresso are better and more consistently good than the cold brew. Do not get the pastries or food there. Consistently overpriced and poorly done. Muffins tend to be overcooked, burnt and flavorless. I specifically asked about what looked like a burnt muffin, and was told that it's just the chocolate making it dark. So I ordered it...and, well, I was right - inedible, burnt and overdone muffin. Which has been par for the course with any of the food I've purchased from there."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2018-05-02,5.0,"I came to Gregory's Coffee right before I came back home, I felt like Gregory's was everywhere and I had to try it before I left New York. To me, Gregory's in New York was like a Starbucks in Virginia so I had to try it. I was so not disappointed. They were better than Starbucks. Starbucks charges me a lot and doesn't even make it look as pretty as Gregory's. I wish I had a Gregory's right by me because then I would go everyday. And I love the Gregory icon. It's on everything and I love it."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2019-01-09,3.0,Good service and timely but coffee seemed watery. Good prices but wish they had more flavor options on the menu.
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2018-05-17,1.0,"I really want to like this place, but they forgot about my order at 7am (before the mad rush). They seem to specialize in making coffee/ lattes so I would stick to that. If you try ordering food you might get the same deer in the headlights look that I got. 

Also, I didn't get an apology when they finally gave my order after 20 minutes! Like geeeze last time I checked apologies are free."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2017-02-02,4.0,"Great coffee, super friendly staff, fast moving line, perks if you use the Gregory's Coffee app. It can be a bit pricey (a small almond milk latte is $5.11, though they do use califia farms barista grade almond milk) but there are plenty of vegan options such as nut/fruit/seed energy bars, chia pudding, fresh pressed juices, etc."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2016-10-15,5.0,"I discovered this coffee shop by walking by it one day. NYC is filled with Starbucks in every neighborhood. They don't have a Peet's Coffee shop here. I would go out of my way to find any  coffee other than Starbucks. 

Gregorys Coffee serves pretty good strong coffee. And they have a nice selection of pastries. It's different from other coffee shops. I think it is kind of fancy. I got the carrot cake loaf. It was huge and moist, not dry like some pastries. I liked it so much I went back to this location twice."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2018-03-30,4.0,"First time here. No line, quick in-out getting a cappuccino to-go. $4.25 and it's tasty. It has a kind of mild, chocolatey taste to it and a very pretty latte-art design in the froth. Free sample at the register of a kind of donut hole bites but I passed on that. Clean, pleasant shop and courteous staff. Seating available. Nice place."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2016-10-21,4.0,"Went in last Thursday, and I gotta say, the cappuccino was AMAZING!!! I cannot stop raving on about this. The only reason I am not giving them five stars is because:
1. My drink wasn't filled to the top. Half of it was foam and the rest, liquid. I'm all for foam but it was just too much, I could of gulped my drink down in 2 minutes but because it was just so damn good, I was forced to take baby sips. 
2. The food options were kind of lackluster. I was expecting different kinds of food considering that it's like a trendy coffee shop but just your average donuts and croissants. 
But these reasons do not keep me away from their coffee. These are just minor things that I can brush off. (Unless it's one of those days when you just need lots and lots of caffeine) 
Nonetheless, I recommend them to anyone and everyone!"
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2017-08-31,3.0,"The service here is nice, but more run of the mill. Kind of like a Starbucks experience. The store is laid out that way for the most part, as well. The coffee is better than Starbucks, but not a gourmet coffee. They do have custom coffee that is strong and varied flavors, but I am not much of a fan of it. I did try it once. Its a good spot as an alternative to Starbucks."
201,gregorys-coffee-new-york-8,2017-08-31,4.0,"I came here for a cappuccino the other morning around 7am. There were only 2 people ahead of me and I only waited a minute to order. I also picked up a yogurt with granola while waiting. The cappuccino was ready in 2 minutes and I added some sugar at the station where you pick up your drinks. The cappuccino was delicious, perfectly frothy. The yogurt was also very good but a little expensive at $6. I will definitely return to try some other drinks and some of the baked goods."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-12-11,5.0,"My cousin and I were looking for a matcha tea place and we are so glad we found this place on the map. It's a small window that you walk up to. I ordered the apple ginger matcha and my cousin ordered the horchata matcha, both hot. On a cold day like today, it hit the spot perfectly. We both enjoyed teas and I would love to be able to make it at home so I could have it all the time. I wish they had a storefront so that we could have sat and enjoyed our teas. The person taking our order was also the same person who made our drinks, so if the line backs up it could take a while to get your drink. But overall, we both loved our drinks and we would come back here again."

202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-09-16,4.0,"Walked past this place so decided to grab a matcha drink. I got the Rose Matcha Latte. The drink is pretty but to be honest it was quite weird on my first sip. The rose flavor is just so natural (as in it tasted like flowers - not easy on the palette). But slowly I got used to the taste (also probably the ice watered it down) and was able to enjoy my drink. While enjoying my drink sitting outside, I realized a lot of people got in line. I'm probably going to try another matcha drink next time and hopefully will like it a lot more!"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-07-28,4.0,"Obsessed with the specialty matcha drinks here -- MatchaBar is a great alternative when the lines at Cha Cha Matcha are too insane to bear. They had a sea salt, maple matcha latte last year that I still think about, but I recently tried their dragonfruit matcha latte, which was also very good (and pretty). They also have a well stocked selection of baked goods -- I got a slice of their lemon poppyseed raspberry loaf, which was really moist and not too sweet. Have to come back to try their banana bread, which was sold out by the time I got there."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-08-24,5.0,"At first, I was going to give a 4 star based on pastry quality + location. But... then I had my warm rose matcha tea macadamia milk latte...... and dang, I'm so glad I live in a city where these words go together to make such a decadent afternoon delightful.

The store is teeny and makes the most of the space available. If you pretend you are visiting a bank drive up atm, the experience is much more enjoyable. Instead of green bills, your transaction includes multiple green goodies. Despite the limited store space, the brick wall is well decorated and there is an awkwardly tiny (but accessible!) square bench encircling a solitary soho neighborhood tree. The wall greenery is festive and you can might even spot some cool new bug friends!

Pastry options range from mildly sweet to very sweet. Not a great option for food sensitive pastry tea lovers... honestly, you aren't missing much. It's good but I've had better. Inventive offerings but execution could be improved. My matcha whoopie was dry, thick, and chewy. Still unique and worthwhile, just not orgasmic...

BUT! The real gem is the matcha and the awesome variety of milk options. I was pleasantly surprised to have rose petals in my latte. Even better than rose petals was the fresh, clean, subtly bitter flavor of the matcha. This is the real stuff. Upon first sip I was whisked away to my Japanese tea ceremony & seasonal pastry class... 

Maybe it's the feeling of the cool summer breeze or the dancing sunlight between the shadows... or the happiness of a successful day of doctor visits??? Regardless, this place felt like the perfect medicine for a day off from work."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-06-13,4.0,"One of my friends instagrammed a beautiful drink from matcha, and I just knew I had to visit! It's a teeny, tiny walk up window, and they tend to have a decent sized line. 

Because I'm currently on a rose kick, I ordered an iced matcha rose latte with macadamia milk (no extra charge... GET IT!) and was in heaven. You can see the rose petals floating on top, and it was a beautifully layered drink. I felt like a princess drinking it. 

The guy taking orders wasn't really friendly at all, and the price tag of almost $7 is steep, but I felt like it was worth the visit for sure!"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-12-26,2.0,"Very disappointing... i ordered hot matcha latte with whole milk. It's very light and I feel like I was just drinking hot water... it was lighter than usucha (= small amount of matcha + hot water). It's not worth stopping here. 
Only Plus is you can rest at dig inn and there is a bathroom at upstair."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-08-07,5.0,"I stopped by this small place while walking in SoHo. It's a tiny window, but they have a lot of different matcha drinks as well as different milks. My friend and I both got an iced matcha latte and they were delicious! The drink is authentic with no added sweeteners that take away from the flavor. The employees are also very nice and quick to make your order. A great place to stop for a minute and get a drink!"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-12-19,3.0,"I absolutely love matcha anything which this hole in the wall offers quite well, and it all taste all freaking amazing!

What I don't love are the kinda high prices for the drinks and the additional extra charges for non-dairy milk alternatives, it's like your punishing people for being lactose intolerance. 

Also the workers are usually engrossed on their own conversations and it seems they forget they are working so you may have to wait a while to receive you drinks.

While I would recommend here to get your matcha fix, you been warned about the costs and wait times."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-07-13,3.0,Saw this cute little window serving matcha drinks and decided to give it a try. I ordered the matcha latte which was a little on the bland side. Service was quick despite there being a short line. Menu had a lot of different varieties of matcha drinks.
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-11-12,4.0,"I am a big matcha drinker and usually find that most western places, and even some Asian cafes do not contain good quality matcha. I had read some mediocre reviews of MatchaBar previously so I didn't have high hopes for this place, but was in desperate need of a matcha fix one day, and was in the area, so I stopped by. 
The Soho outlet doesn't have seating, and only consists of a window where you can place your order and take it away. There is a tree with a corner of seating, that probably would be nice to sit on during the summer. 
Both times I have been here, the service has been very friendly. The matchas have a good, strong flavor, and are mixed well. I also like that they have a good variety of creative mixes. Overall, would recommend this place as one of the best matcha places in New York if not the best, but indoor seating would greatly improve this place."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-08-28,4.0,Best price for a plain iced matcha & friendly customer service!  Literally a hole in the wall.
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-10-18,4.0,"Awesome little side street bar serving some creative low calorie matcha drinks and an assortment of cookies/pastries. Simple, but delicious. Workers are very efficient. Wait times are minimal."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-11-25,4.0,"Craving something matcha? This place will fulfill that for you as an all things matcha bar. I enjoyed a Honey Pot Matcha Latte which is a matcha latte with CBD infused honey. But it just tasted like a good ol' matcha latte and the honey was a faint flavor. My husband got Rose Matcha Latte which was topped with rose petals. His had a stronger floral flavor of course. 

If I'm to come here again, I'd like to try a tea with no milk and some of the pastries. Overall the place seems good but it's a lil too matcha for me :P"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2017-12-10,4.0,"I almost missed this cute little window serving matcha-filled goodies. I went for a straight flat green, which came with more milk options than I've ever heard of. (With tax, it was $4.)

My drink was ready in a jiffy and had a pure matcha taste. 

Look below the window! There were a handful of pastry options. There's also a short breakfast menu as well.

This location does not take cash."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-06-04,5.0,A little​ hole in the wall and the perfect matcha spot! They offer a variety of matcha drinks and milk variations. Very good place for a customized and new drink. The employees are awesome and I've never had a bad experience here! They also have little pastries in the same window you order from and they're always fresh! Definitely something good to try and you'll always find something tempting here. (:
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-09-19,3.0,"I expected to be blown away, but the Matcha Latte (with oat milk) tasted pretty standard - perhaps because I've had ""Ceremonial Grade"" matcha before, or maybe MatchaBar is known for their craft matcha drinks. 

I would've given them 4 stars, but then I saw the transaction on my credit card statement. They charged me $5.72 for a $4.50 drink - even after tax, where did the rest come from? Another Yelp review said that they don't charge extra for non-dairy milk, so did they decide to tip themselves without letting me know? No thanks."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-12-17,3.0,"Yes it's a good Matcha fix. Someone should have figured it out by now! But for a hole-in-the-wall place, I was not that impressed by my $6 matcha cocoa drink. Friend got the matcha brownie and the flat green. I can't say it's anything to write home about but if you want the caffeine jolt without the coffee, there's something for everyone in New York!"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-02-08,3.0,Was pretty disappointed with the Matcha Latte (with almond milk) I had from here. It was extremely bitter and had a lingering aftertaste. I went back and added simple syrup which helped a bit but overall was almost too bitter to drink. Liked that it was a walk up order window and my order was ready fast. I've had much better matcha lattes for the same price from other places so don't think I would come back here unfortunately.
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2020-01-05,3.0,"Have always been a big fan of their drinks in Whole Foods. Decided to try their store and got the Golden Matcha Latte, and unfortunately, it was underwhelming. Tasted very watered down and lacked the flavor you'd hope a matcha store could deliver. You're better off walking ten minutes to Matchaful - they use high quality matcha and blend it in very well to their lattes (albeit for a price)."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2017-12-25,4.0,"Easy to miss little window. They have a bunch of different variations of matcha available. Lattes, shots, etc. 

I got the rose matcha latte with macadamia milk. They have a selection of types of milk you can choose from: coconut, almond, macadamia, all the other traditional types of milk. My barista recommended macadamia so I went for it, and I was a fan! The macadamia flavor wasn't overpowering, which is what I was worried about. 

The rose latte came with tiny rose petals - so cute! This is one of the better matcha lattes I've had in the city, and I'll definitely grab another the next time I pass by this area."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-11-11,5.0,Come check out this gem in SoHo! Got the Rose matcha iced and the vanilla almond matcha which were both outstanding. I've also had all their bottled matcha drinks which I live on now that I gave up coffee. You gotta go check this place out!
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-06-24,1.0,"Not good quality matcha! I was excited as I live on the area and know how popping this place can be, there was no wait and no line, the woman gave me a nasty look for me wanting my drink in my reusable mug which took me back a bit. They did have some fancier drinks on the menu but I just wanted a basic iced oat latte, and it was both clumpy and tasted super bitter (I love and drink unsweetened matcha daily, so i'm used to bitter), but this was just not good. I don't know if it was the type of matcha or if it had been sitting there awhile, the woman did just pour the matcha shot from a cup that was sitting there before I got there so they don't make it fresh every time which was a bummer! Go to the other better matcha spots in the area (honestly starbucks culinary matcha lattes are better than this)! This is a cute idea but awful product! Go somewhere else or waste your money!"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-11-24,5.0,"The best matcha is here!! Also, love the location in LA. Nice customer service, friendly atmosphere and real matcha"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-09-03,5.0,So enjoyed this accidental find. I just started drinking matcha tea. This was with macadamia nut milk and splash of vanilla.
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-06-20,4.0,"This MatchaBar location takes hole-in-the-wall quite literally.  But that is actually a great thing. Without having to suffer through long lines for the likes of Cha Cha Matcha, this no-frills location offering a comprehensive menu MatchaBar products with high efficiency and minimal wait time. While I enjoy keeping matcha drinks simple and basic, the assortment of lattes and milk choices are exhaustive. Lastly, it is a tad ironic to see that that served drinks under the MatchaBar brand are actually more enjoyable than the bottled drinks sold in stores. More locations like these might not be a bad idea!"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2019-05-02,5.0,Honey Pot CBD + Rose Milk with Oat is my go to. Amazing Non dairy alternatives and great mix. Ask for a double shot of matcha if you want the matcha to pack a punch.
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-08-26,5.0,"Solid to-go matcha place with fast service, great for a pick me up! I got the matcha latte with oat milk - great flavor, not too strong, and the oat milk was a nice creamy complement to the matcha."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-05-06,4.0,"I got a matcha latte with cashew milk. I thought this is very good, I love the atmosphere of the store, and the servers were very friendly and fun. I really like the variety as well. I would not say this was the best Mantra I have ever had in my life, but it was worth the walk from work."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-06-25,4.0,"A small matcha place with a walk-up window! Got an iced matcha latte with coconut milk and the lemon rasperberry loaf - they have a ton of milk options. The matcha latte was pretty good, just wish I had gotten it a bit sweetened. The lemon rasperberry loaf... nice flavor with some tartness from the raspberry jam, but it made the bottom of the bread pretty soggy, and it fell apart when I was eating it. Will come back to try the other matcha flavors/other pastries!"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2017-12-24,2.0,"A very cute small shop tucked away. However the customer service was just terrible! From the time I walked up to the time I got my drink, not a hello, smile or thank you. She slammed my drink on the table and had a pissed off face. I get ppl all have their days but please step aside, take a breather and get your shit together bc you're at work! 
The drink was nothing special for a premium price. They just added a bunch of dried rose petals into the drink and called it rose match green tea. So your eating chunks of dried rose petals. I was really excited for this but such a disappointment. Maybe if the service was better it would change things a little."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-09-29,3.0,"I was so excited to go here after hearing a lot about this place, but was disappointed. The employee was more focused on her conversation with a friend than taking orders for customers. I ordered the rose water matcha latte, but you could barely even taste any matcha flavor, and was not worth the $7 price tag. Will not be going back, there are plenty of other places with great matcha and better service."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-01-29,4.0,"I got a Matcha with coconut water and my wife got an iced Matcha latte. Both were good, it could've been a bit stronger matcha wise, but I would prefer it on the strong side myself. I just barely caught the window passing by and I am glad I stopped."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-06-19,4.0,Cute matcha stop. You order on the street with some seating next door. I had the iced matcha almond latte which was pretty good.
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-06-24,3.0,"3.5

Pretty drinks at a decent price point, topped with countless milk options including macadamia milk (what?)

But drinks themselves were okay in my opinion. I'm not a big matcha person like some of my friends (ceremony grade, etc), so my review definitely isn't an educated one. 

But the 0.5 goes because they seem to be teaming up with a lot of different vendors to provide variety of flavors as well as baked goods (roberta's is always a plus in my books)"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2017-11-10,5.0,"The best Matcha in the game. Period, end of story. 

And in a neighborhood that desperately needs it, the staff is actually personable... feels like home (maybe I am?). 
 
Morning routine perfected."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-08-31,5.0,"Quick service, delicious matcha. Though they were out of what I had planned to order, ended up with a Rose Milk Latte w/macadamia milk for me and a one with Coconut milk for my boss (liked the latter the most). So yummy!"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-05-30,5.0,"Iced rose matcha latte with macadamia nut milk is fantastic. The rose syrup tastes real, pure, but the scent is not overpowering. It also has the perfect level of sweetness (not fatteningly sweet). I also had the green and white cookie which was just meh. Can't go wrong with an iced matcha latte!"
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-07-01,2.0,"Drink is good. Nothing special than any other matcha drinks. Lady at the cashier was rude. I showed her a picture of a drink and asked what it was and she says ""I don't know"" like she doesn't care. You should at least know what you are selling. There's only a few drinks on your menu and really should've known what it was. Or at least care to figure it out for a customer."
202,matchabar-soho-new-york,2018-07-13,5.0,This place may be tiny but the matcha and the employees were so amazing. I highly recommend the Macadamia milk with any matcha latte you decide on. Definitely going to visit this place regularly
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2018-04-27,5.0,"I am a big fan of the Marie Antoinette and the Gainsbourg!

I generally get one of each and eat half and half over two days--the sandwiches hold up surprisingly well in the refrigerator overnight. :-)"
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2019-12-15,4.0,"Le Petit Parisien serves some of the best chocolate croissants - if you go at the right time in the morning, they'll be warm and freshly baked (think chocolate oozing). 

An easy pick up for coffee drinks or a snack / pastry. I've tried both a sandwich on a baguette and a breakfast sandwich and felt a bit underwhelmed. The sandwich I got was one fo the signatures so some sliced meat with cheese in a foot long baguette. The breakfast sandwich was a ham, cheese and egg on brioche bun. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be but both were essentially 75% bread... the breakfast sandwich was probably the larger disappointment / unexpected and for a steep $7.50... 

Overall though, I'd still go back!! The workers there are very friendly and feels like a neighborhood spot. Definitely stop in"
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2019-05-09,4.0,"I was in a daze wandering around Bowery, and in real need of a decent coffee and a small bite. 

Enter le petit Parisien. 

I swear, there are some places in this city that just nail what it means to server ""Parisien"" style bites. This place is one of them. What does it take? good bread, quality meat, good coffee. this place does all three very very well. Starting with the bread; omg it was perfect, crusty, flaky, held up cheese and meat perfectly. Speaking of which the ham and gruyere that came piled on top was superb. No cold cuts here, this ham was prepared fresh in house or nearby. Finally, the coffee was perfect, we had an Americano and a Nutella Americano (because why not that's why).

Come here, cozy up to the small space they have to sit, and split a sandwich with a friend. You'll be happy you did."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2019-04-06,5.0,Le Petit Parisien Exceeded my expectations. This is a very small homey little deli like sandwich shop located in the heart of the East Village. Came here with my girlfriend and left with a sandwich on French bread.  The bread man was there delivering the bread as we ordered our sandwiches so you know it's legit. The only downside was that the sandwiches are over $10 and they're not that large but overall the quality was there and you're getting very good ingredients ingredients for the price in my eyes. Definitely give it a try if you do you are in the East Village area and want something different hope this helps.
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2018-08-15,4.0,"I was in search of a burger after visiting McSorley's across the street, but I stumbled upon this quaint little sandwich shop.

Awesome, crusty baguettes with various meats and cheeses.
I opted for the standard ham sandwich with butter, and only finished half of it.  For $9 I was very happy.

They have a small assortment of quiches and croissants, which are not made in house but look great.

The gentleman that waited on me was friendly and helpful.

Nice small space for indoor seating and a bench out front.

Overall, this is a nice little sandwich oasis."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2018-05-02,4.0,"The sandwiches are simple, but much better than your regular deli sandwiches. The shop is super cute with limited seating, but it's great for a quick to-go place.

I have tried the Gainsbourg with comté. I think it could have used more ham, but it was still a tasty ham and cheese baguette. I also tried Brigitte Bardot which is their vegetarian offering of artichoke, kale, tomatoes, and extra virgin olive oil. It is typically ordered with goat cheese, but I was able to sub the goat cheese for comté. It actually tasted like the Gainsbourg because of the comté. I couldn't taste too much of the artichoke though. Add cornichons for an extra $0.50.

Add-ons range from $0.50-$1.00 and only the mustard is free. The baguettes are fresh, but they are a bit hard to chew and might hurt your mouth a little. None of the sandwiches are pre-made, but they assemble them pretty fast. They also have interesting flavored Spanish chips like jamon iberico, truffle, and cavier. The jamon iberico flavor tastes super weird."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"So any review comparing this place to subway makes me angry - obviously that person has never been out of the city, and likely only eats subway daily.  The bread is crunchy, yes, but exactly like in France.  And exactly like in France, the sandwich is more about the bread and butter than even the meat.  But even the jambon (bone in ham) is spot on!  My wife got the saussicon (Napoleon) and it was spot on as well.  Excellent ingredients.  Bread 5 stars, butter 5 stars, staff 5 stars.  Perfect.  Best French sandwich outside of France."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2019-12-02,4.0,Needed something quick and they definitely are quick! A little pricey for what you get but the bread is soooo good. Unsure if I'd come back due to the high volume of other places in the immediate area
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2019-09-15,5.0,"Le Petit Parisien! The most authentic French sandwiches I've found in a long time outside of France. The Cured Ham. WOW. The bread. WOW. Get the Marie Antoinette as a gift to your tastebuds. Ham. Goat Cheese. Honey. Oh My! I added arugula for some greens and it was a lovely complement to my already delicious sandwich. The server, with a French accent made the whole experience feel all the more authentic, was so friendly and sweet that I want to go back just to enjoy his company. 

Excited to go back and try a cappuccino and the other pastries Le Petit Parisien has to offer, and trust me... I will be back very soon!"
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2019-04-30,4.0,"The other day, we decided to take a subway into the city and walk around a while before ultimately heading to brunch. I had not had anything for breakfast so we stopped for a coffee and a bite to eat here at le petit parisien. The two guys behind the counter were very friendly and took our order for two lattes and a ham and cheese sandwich to stay. We decided that we just wanted to split one and I am glad we did. It was a hefty size and filled with a generous portion of ham and camembert. The bread was great. Super crusty outside while the inside was nice and soft. The lattes were very tasty. We were able to sit easily in the rather tiny shop. Most of the others coming in were all just taking coffee or sandwiches to go. It was just over 20 for our coffees and sandwich. I was well satiated for a few hours before brunch but I would definitely devour a full sandwich there if I was very hungry!"
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2019-06-30,4.0,"Great jamon beurre spot (they refer to it as 'the parisien'). One of the best/only in the city after Kaffe 1668 stopped serving it. Small shop that specializes in french baguette based sandwiches. They opened a second location on 53rd street in Midtown East for your work week lunch/dinner bites. 

Sadly they close early around 7pm and their butter doesn't match true Bordier butter, but a good replacement for those days you just need a good jamon beurre. Add hard cheese slices (comte not camembert) for extra oomph. Feel free to skip the duck rillette and pate based sandwiches."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2018-10-11,2.0,"This is probably a place I'll never return to. My friends and I ordered three different sandwiches and while the meat and cheeses tasted the bare minimum of ""good"", the baguettes were the hardest, crustiest motherfuckers we've ever had. They were TINY and skinny too - equal to the amount of maybe a 6 inch sub from Subway but double the price and not even as good. By the time I struggled to finish half of it, it felt like I was eating all of my teeth and had no more appetite or jaw mobility to consume the rest. 

The customer service was also notably just ok. The lady stared at us looking SUPER conspicuously disgusted and angry. 

Le Petit's atmosphere was perfect though - shame. Comfy and cute and *quiet* with soft music and the low hum of the AC would be the perfect place to sit and enjoy coffee and study. Too bad the workers freak me out a bit"
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2018-09-07,1.0,"Terrible place and even worse owner. I had a dentist appt in the area and decided to place an order on mealpal to pick up. After picking it up I brought it back to work with me. After opening it up I realized it was not the correct order but rather a completely different sandwich with ingredients I don't actually eat.

When I called and spoke to the owner he started yelling and saying mealpal doesn't pay him anything. Deal with mealpal. Ok clearly this guy has some issues with mealpal but in all fairness, this wasn't mealpal's fault. This was solely on them yet the owner ranted furiously about mealpal for about 3 minutes.

This review is simply about the customer service and not about the food. Owner needs some anger management."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2017-03-09,5.0,"I am such a fan of the Brigitte Bardot sandwich, which is the only vegetarian option on the current menu, and it's so good I don't think they need another option. Although I wouldn't complain if they added a Brie sandwich without meat. Back to the Bardot, the sandwich has kale, goat cheese, tomato, and artichokes. The artichokes are the kind marinated in olive oil, so there is no vinegar to overpower the other flavors. Served on a hard baguette in true Parisian fashion, I love this sandwich so much I have no qualms paying the $4.99 Uber Eats delivery fee to enjoy it. Bien joue Le Petit Parisian."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2019-02-07,5.0,"My favorite sandwich place in the city. I must order from here 3 times a week sometimes. The Gainsbourg with Cornichons is where it's at. French style is a nice break from other heavy sandwich types, and that's what makes it so good. Love this place!!"
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2017-01-19,5.0,"The sandwiches here are simple and delicious! When you get your sandwich, it just looks like a plain sandwich but what makes the sandwiches here special are the little things they add inside like honey(?) that gives the sandwiches their character.

Keep it up! Et MERCI!!!"
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2019-01-29,5.0,This place it too perfect. I read a review about a hard crust baguette...um that is how they are supposed to be. And they are amazing. Don't change a thing.

Having experienced the simplest and most delicious ham baguette sandwiches from both Paris and St. Barth, I was excited to see what Le Petit Parisien had to offer.  Thankfully there is some seating in this small sandwich shop.  The BF & I both got the Gainsbourg (ham, compte, butter and requested whole grain mustard).  All the components of the sandwich were on point except the most important part - the baguette!  It was way too chewy/doughy.  Our jaws were hurting halfway through the sandwich!  A true french baguette should be much flakier and lighter.  They also over charge for their Evian - $2.50 a bottle!"
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2018-09-22,2.0,The sandwiches are overpriced and the staff comically dismissive. If you go - go to watch a surly man express pain at the agony of making a sandwich. Certainly don't go for the food.
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2016-06-18,4.0,"When I lived in France, I ate at least one jambon et beurre sandwich a day (don't judge). So if there's a chance in New York to try new French places, I'll do it any time and day!

Le Petit Parisien is a cute little sandwicherie tucked away in East Village. They have quality ingredients for the food, like Camembert and whole-grain mustard.

I had the Gainsbourg, which has bone-in cooked ham and compte (able to substitute Camembert). I added arugula and a bit of mustard as an addition and the flavor was delicious!

The only thing was that the baguette was a bit hard the other reviews mostly say the bread was very fresh, but it felt a bit stale. Maybe because it's the weekend? Not sure, but it was disappointing.

Otherwise, it's worth checking out."

Great baguette, piled with artichoke, kale, tomato and a nice smear of goat cheese. And you're not doing it right if you leave off the cornichons (50 cents extra). Topped it off with a yummy cucumber water. Delicious! By the way, I went to the brand new location on 53rd Street."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2015-11-24,4.0,"New place. I quite like it actually. I decided to order the Louis XIV and I loved it! For the amount you pay, they are definitely very generous with the foie gras (not complaining). The bread was very fresh nice and soft with a little crunch!
I'm excited to try the other sandwiches. However, I only gave them 4 starts because I can only order 3 things on the menu. This is because I don't eat pork, so I'm a little sad that my choice are limited."

203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2017-09-06,3.0,"It's solid---no complaints on their sandwiches: fresh bread, good tasty ingredients, speedy and friendly service. I'd prefer a lighter baguette---this is the kind that has a hard crust that can do some damage to the roof of your mouth.  But at least it was fresh, and aside from Kayser, I'm not sure you can find proper baguettes in NYC.  Not really a standout though, and not a bargain either (understandably so, given their ingredients, but nevertheless)."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2016-08-22,4.0,"Really good sandwich.
Baguette is great and ingredients were fresh and tasty. I had the Marie-Antoinette with bresaola (instead of ham) and I added arugula and tomatoes.
My only complaint is the price $14.50 for a sandwich is very expensive.
I would still order though!"
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2016-05-04,5.0,Great find on a sleepy block in the East Village. Extremely personable staff and yummy sandwiches. Will certainly return and am spreading the word to my friends.
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2015-11-11,4.0,"Really friendly staffers dishing up baguettes with a variety of fillings. Apparently named after a French newspaper (see the wallpaper), it's a bright, small space with some drinks and pastries to add to the sandwich roster. The Napoleon (Sandwich) (saucisson sec, pickles, butter) was a tasty $10.89 ; an extra star if I felt a bit fuller after dropped ~$11. Few stools at an L-shaped counter near the door on this quieter stretch of 7th."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2017-07-06,5.0,"The Marie Antoinette was great but the meat was a bit tough. Iced tea flavors are nice. Customer service could be better, I ordered a small tea and they charged me for a large then didn't offer to change it, so I found that a bit odd."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2017-07-30,5.0,Small cute place with tasty sandwiches on fresh baguettes. The croissant was warm and fresh too. It's charming and the food is delicious.
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2017-09-01,5.0,Excellent sandwiches! Finally a place that clearly uses freshly made bread and high quality ingrdients - a rarity in Manhattan. Really wonderful baguettes and small but great selection of sandwiches. Big enough that I often get two meals out of these. Highly recommend.
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2016-04-22,5.0,"I stumbled upon this place while exploring the East Village.  I had the Gainsbourg sandwich and it was terrific!!  Delicious French bread, perfectly cooked ham, and slices of yummy cheese.  They have some cool French lemonades to try, too.  The workers were welcoming and friendly, and the service was fast.  I am already looking forward to getting back there to try more sandwiches from the menu.  Highly recommend!"
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2016-08-13,2.0,"Complete bitch at the counter. Unbelievably rude.
I walked in to order a sandwich and got a complete attitude. Note to owner: hire people that look customers in the eye and want to be there. I won't enter again if she's there..."
203,le-petit-parisien-new-york,2017-04-12,4.0,"I finally came here for the first time today, although I live right across the street. First, the best part is the customer service. They are super kind & friendly. I got a sandwich that I believe was a special...but I'm not positive. It was smoked salmon & arugula, tomatoes, some capers and some sort of sauce. To be honest, I've looked at the menu before and nothing jumped out at me. It all sounded great, but nothing was super appealing to me, personally. But this sandwich was fantastic! It was fresh and all of the ingredients were high quality. I also tried one of their Palmier cookies because I love them and they aren't easy to find in this hood. It, too, was delicious! I think I will go back and try some of their menu items."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-03-16,5.0,This is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. It's a great place to sit with a book and a cappuccino and soup. I've gotten Sunburst delivered many times and it's always delicious and on time. I recommend their special wraps for delivery. They are well above average for a small quaint cafe!
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-04-24,4.0,"Quick delivery! Well packaged and the food was delicious. Ordered a wrap to order...pasta bolognese, hamburger and fries and pasta Alfredo. Very happy with the food. Delicious and would definitely order again. Local restaurant. They have brunch and other breakfast items."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,"This place is totally delicious. Friendly staff - low prices - huge menu. You will not be disappointed. 

I had a create your own omelette with salmon/mozzarella/avocado/sun dried tomato and it was cheaper than an omelette with just one of those things somewhere else. 

Free coffee before 11:30!"
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-12-23,4.0,Nice little coffee shop. Stopped in from the cold to get some hot chocolate. Real chocolate in the hot chocolate. Nice and rich.
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-02-09,2.0,Cappuccino was the worst I've ever had! Tasted like regular black coffee with milk foam....
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-10-27,5.0,"This is probably my favorite casual breakfast, lunch, and dinner spot in Gramercy. Sunburst Cafe is a mom & pop gem in the neighborhood where they serve the classics of every meal. (Please stay forever!!) Prices are also very just to make this neighborhood favorite your usual spot especially if you live in the area! The service is also great every time. 

Breakfast favorites: pancakes, french toast, omelettes
Lunch/ dinner: their soups, paninis, burger with sweet potato fries!"
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-04-21,1.0,Ordered for delivery. By the time it arrived the bagel was soggy and cold and the pancakes were raw in the middle
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-09-11,3.0,"Not the fanciest place in the city but nothing wrong with that. I came for a quick lunch and overall it was a solid time. It is kind of tight in here but they do have wifi which is awesome.

As for the food it wasn't anything special. The Chicken caesar salad was as straightforward as it gets. It wasn't bad but nothing memorable.  My guests salad looked ok and he shared the same sentiment I did. It was good not great. 

The service was prompt and friendly. Idk if I would come out of my way to come back here.  However, if I needed to catch up on work and grab a quick meal I would come back."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-01-18,4.0,"Cozy atmosphere, has an abundance of pastries that look delicious. The coffee is good. Overall a nice place to seek refuge from the snow!"
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-09-09,5.0,"Consistent and Good. Great coffee. Nice service. I come here when I need a pancake and egg treat. They are very neighborhoody and I see the same crowd often. So they must be doing something right! I bought my friend one of the croissants and she was in heaven. 
Nothing but praise."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-01-27,5.0,"This was the perfect cafe to study at during a cold January Monday. I got hot chicken noodle soup and prosciutto mozzarella sundries tomato panini. All very good! Lovely, warm vibes here."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-12-21,5.0,"A beautiful, relaxed breakfast on a late Friday morning. I had a small latte, which had the perfect foam and came in a nice ceramic mug, as well as eggs over easy, turkey sausages, fruit, and toast. My server was very nice and offered to substitute fruit for potatoes when I mentioned I did not want any potatoes. Will definitely visit again if I'm in the neighborhood and am in the mood for a pleasant, quiet breakfast spot."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-12-10,5.0,"The decor caught my eye. This cute place is full of surprises... like the Greek Salad (side) and great breakfast options. The people are like the best of family: nice and warm and kind. Great little spot for any occasion. PLUS THEY HAVE PLUGINS! Highly recommend. :) 

Also, the CUPCAKES are the BEST. OMG. Red velvet is out of this world moist and tasty."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-11-30,5.0,"This place is really a burst of sunshine!!  Wonderful atmosphere. Small and cozy. Went with my family of four for breakfast. Delicious food. Would come back everyday for breakfast like we did back in the day, but unfortunately we don't anymore. But we will be back!!"
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-04-05,1.0,Ordered a breakfast sandwich via delivery and the crossaint was hard and stale. At least 2 days old. I won't be a returning customer.
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-11-07,5.0,I have been here many times. Great food and nice ambiance. This little gem has great soups and coffee. Warm and inviting.
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-11-07,5.0,"Just stopped in to have coffee and ordered eggs Florentine. Coffee was A+. The eggs were A++. Perfectly cooked and nicely presented with perfectly cooked spinach. 
Will 100% return to try lunch."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-03-06,5.0,This place is my go to for coffee and breakfast! Awesome lineup of pastries and super friendly service. Can't go wrong here!
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-03-05,5.0,"I've been coming here for a while as it's right in my new neighborhood. The mocha almond iced coffee is amazing, I just ask them to lessen the syrup for me because I prefer a lighter flavor. Great selection of tea also. I've gotten the salads in the past and they've all been pretty good. The sandwiches are also pretty good. Will make fries well done if you ask."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-12-07,1.0,Im very sad that i came in to work wanting french toast and got the  worst french toast of my life from  Sunburst Espresso Bar!!! lol.. sorry french toast is not something you should order from here.
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,This place is so sweet! Fresh bakery is offered even late at night (we sat around 11pm and the counter was full of tasty goods). Great service. Great vibe - warm and home. Highly recommended for a sweet bite.
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-10-02,5.0,"Good food, service and atmosphere. We got a chicken wrap and Greek salad. Enjoyed it all."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-06-11,4.0,"Great little cafe with A LOT of options! Food tasted good and was hot and fresh! The menu is expansive so if you have people with different tastes this place will work! Great espresso drinks and the atmosphere was nice! Only 4 stars because not very original, basic breakfast options and drinks for the most part!"
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-10-16,5.0,Why didn't I stop by sooner? Where has this place been all my life? Delicious food and coffee. Comfy ambiance. Friendly staff. You could consider me a regular now.
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-04-19,5.0,"I was walking on third ave on Good Friday and I peered into Sunburnt because I was feeling like an afternoon café. And as soon as I started to peruse the menu posted on the door, I was warmly greeted by a woman asking me what O was looking for. She invited me inside to look at the coffee menu and within minutes I was sitting at the window people watching sipping on a perfectly balanced coconut iced latte. At the counter they had scrumptious looking baked goods-- red velvet, carrot cake, and oreo cupcakes, chocolate bread pudding. I'm definitely returning to try the other goodies."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-04-09,5.0,"I've written in 500 or so coffee shops in my life. This ranks No. 1, across the board. The ambiance, the food, huge drink menu. The owner is a cool guy whose parents came from Russia long ago and started Sunburst. He's worth rooting for. Music, outlets, pastries. Top to bottom, America's best cafe, and the spot where I've written most of my books"
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-10-13,4.0,"Great drinks, especially the cocoa hazelnut cooler. (Longtime favorite of mine, particularly as a dessert after spicy foods)

The service was quick and friendly. Great neighborhood joint in Gramercy."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-08-22,5.0,"I'm so glad to see you guys are still open and running. I haven't lived in the city for a few years now, and it's been even longer since I lived on 22nd St. in Gramercy. When I did, though, I always came to your place. Loved the menu, the people, the food and the coffee!"
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-01-11,4.0,"Not just an espresso bar but also a restaurant with wraps, pasta and burger. I've tried a sunburst burger and it was awesome would come again!"
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-09-28,5.0,"Love this place! Had breakfast outside and it made for a really nice morning. We did not get bothered to leave and got to spend the morning sipping on coffee and catching up with a friend. 

I have been here before and know the soups are amazing so ordered that to go! I wish I lived closer so I could stop by more often."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-02-23,5.0,We've walked passed this place for years and decided to have breakfast a few weeks ago. We were pleasantly surprised. The food was quality and freshly prepared. We ordered sandwiches to go the following week. Also very good. Happy to report this mornings breakfast was also excellent. I should state that I have a very sensitive stomach and food that's fresh and not greasy is for me. Finding a place where I can eat without hours of indigestion afterward is golden to me. This is our new go to place!
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-09-01,4.0,Food was good and quick. I got the French onion soup. Biscuits were fantastic. Service was great. Bathroom could use some cleaning.
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-09-18,5.0,"This place has awesome coffee and apple fritters, and very friendly staff.  Try the apple fritters!"
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-01-24,5.0,"the sweet potato fries are amazing!
so good. after a long day of traveling this was the perfect dinner."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-09-07,1.0,"Used to order from here a lot and was always on time according to estimate (under 40mins usually 20mins as we live VERY close).  Last weekend the food came cold.  Today we ordered and waited until about 70mins to call. They said delivery guy was only a couple blocks away. 35 mins later, I call the restaurant and they tell me the delivery person is just leaving now. All we ordered was a breakfast sandwich and an omelette. Will go to a different deli. 2hrs is too long for barely any food. WE HAD PLANS TODAY.  

Ps tried to be nice on the phone but IM HUNGRY AS I WAITED 2 HRS. And they were rude on the phone to ME. The customer."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-12-16,4.0,"The Verdict: Nice cozy spot on the corner to pop into.

The Food: Bought hot chocolate and mud pie. Great warm drinks with kind service.

The Extras: There are a few outdoor tables and even a few on the side sheltered from the cold. They offer breakfast food all day, so I'll definitely come back someday to try it! The staff was super sweet!"
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-06-01,4.0,"Very solid, affordable breakfast/brunch/lunch option. Wide variety of items on the menu (came around late lunch time, they were still serving breakfast menu plus the lunch/dinner menu). Waiter was very nice, service was good. We sat outside and it was fun to people watch! I got a tuna melt which was okay. I wish the cheese was more melty or I should've requested pepper jack cheese. The fries were very yummy though. My bf got penne with vodka sauce and it was quite good. It looked so delicious that someone walking by asked us what it was! Both entrees came with a salad option, we got caesar salad and it was very good. great prices too, very affordable. I also got a latte (yum) and he got a smoothie."
204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-12-23,4.0,"I like Sunburst for several reasons: 

--Pleasant staff
--Reasonable cost
--Quiet atmosphere 
--Comfortable setting 
--Great cupcakes & cookies
--Bright-light corner location
--Good food morning to midnight
--Best oatmeal with fruit on the side
--Stone's throw away from where I live

Try it. You'll like it.

204,sunburst-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-08-04,5.0,Great spot for lunch or brunch! They have a great selection of salads and sandwiches. Great outdoor seating on the sidewalk - a real neighborhood gem!
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-26,5.0,"Came by for coffee the other day and it was excellent! Ordered a mocha and it came out the perfect temperature. Espresso was smooth and the chocolate was rich without being too sweet!

Staff was friendly behind the counter too!"
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-11,5.0,"Office Coffee is in the Canal Street Market in Chinatown, but not on the side with all the other food / drink vendors. They're on the non-food side and have a couple seats/tables for customers. 

Came here this past weekend to try their Matcha #FreezeBowl with Sweet Nova's nice cream and the two bowls I tried were DELICIOUS.

My friend and I got the Pitaya Blueberry Antioxidants with a shot of matcha and that Matcha Kale Energy with a shot of espresso. I honestly loved them both, but the espresso shot is probably one of the best espressso flavors I've ever had. It wasn't burnt at all and I don't know what beans they use.. but it tasted so good. 

Each bowl's superfood freeze is dairy-free and made with different ingredients and they all come with coconut flakes, fruit (berries), chia seeds, and granola. 

Can't wait to come back to get more of their drinks and try the third Sunflower Cacao Protein Freeze Bowl!!

P.S. They also offer Supermoon Bakehouse pastries here!"
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-06,2.0,"Good coffee shops are everywhere in NYC, but this is not one of them. It's fine, but in a city with the world's best coffee shops, don't waste your time.

It's in the Canal Street Market in Chinatown and requires climbing stairs to even order your coffee. The staff are NOT friendly at all and will serve your subpar latte and pastry with a frown. My chocolate croissant was not good or fresh and put me off of my favorite pastry for a long time.

The one selling point is that the space is beautiful. Not at all practical with little seating, but it does look nice. If you want a better experience, go to nearby Kaigo Coffee Room literally around the corner on Lafayette."
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-18,5.0,They definitely know what they're doing here! It's a small shop located inside the market so there's no storefront on the street. For those of you getting lost- it's on the retail side of the market not the food side. I ordered a matcha latte here and it is one of the best matcha lattes I have had. The baristas here know what they're doing !
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-21,5.0,My first stop in NY! Decided to get the Louis Vuitton coffee for giggles but it's actually really good! And the original croissant is only $3.5 and very tasty. I'm gonna plant myself here and get a bunch of work done!
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-01,5.0,"Awesome people, coffee, and located in amazing food central. 

They have really innovative, trendy and fun drink options."
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-31,5.0,"This place is hard to find. It took me forever to realize I was inside the Canal St Market. I guess that's the reason it's hardly ever packed. 

Office Coffee takes up a part of the market. There's enough seats for only about 6-8 people but I always manage to get a seat at any given time.

The coffee here is Stumptown and the baristas know their stuff. I have yet to receive a beverage short of excellent.

I really like the theme/vibe here too. I think the Office branded cups look sick."
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-26,5.0,"I was very pleased with my experience with Office Coffee. The barista knew what she was doing, and was super friendly. I went with their cold brew coffee and it came up to around 4.00! I drank the cold brew completely black and was impressed with the robust flavor. It was well balanced and well brewed. The coffee was also smooth and not acidic at all! Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the Canal St. Market!"
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-20,5.0,"If all office coffee tasted as good as this does, the world would be a better place.

The tongue-in-cheek name of this stand notwithstanding, this is is some seriously good coffee and espresso. I got a simple americano with oat milk, and it was an exceptional cup of hot caffeine. Prepared by some friendly faces, it was an ideal midday pick me up.

If you live or work in the area, you should be stoked this exists. When I lived in the area, all we had was the Starbucks on Centre/Canal. This is a bit of a game changer."
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2017-05-12,4.0,"A modern coffee house that lies in peripheral area of Chinatown Manhattan NYC.  In hopes to attain one solid pastry as breakfast the next day- my hope became a reality for one solid almond croissant $4.00.  Steep in price for one croissant, minus one star, but it was quite large with fresh almond paste center filling.  Service is attentive and friendly.  Sales receipts can only be either emailed or texted to one's cell phone.  A relatively new business.

Their business card also serves as a loyalty card where the tenth punch the card holder attains one free incentive.  This business sits inside Canal Street Market."

205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-26,5.0,Office has such great coffee but an even greater staff. The people on bar are very skilled and will make a great drink no matter your order. They're also all extremely friendly and sweet
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-16,3.0,"This small coffee counter is located inside the Canal Street Market in Chinatown. To be honest, I almost missed it because I almost did not go in the second room of the Market! It was a pretty brisk day when I visited the City, so I wanted something hot to walk with. I got a Jasmine Tea, and was quite pleased that it was made with Jasmine pearls. I would not say that one would need to go out of their way to come here, but if you are in the market or shopping in the area, it is a relatively convenient stop for a quick cup of coffee or tea to go!"
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-25,2.0,"I've been coming to this spot for the last month. Pretty much every single morning (and sometimes afternoons), spending at the very least - $30 a week. Today was my last day going. I get a brevé Mocha every single time. I'm never really charged the same. Some days it's $5.75, some days it's $6. They aren't the friendliest baristas but I decided to still give them a chance. I'd always tell the guy (maybe his name is Manny) to have a nice day and he'd always mumble a response, as if I'm bothering him by even saying it. What started to get to me was the fact that after going there every single morning Mon-Fri for two weeks, he still didn't know my order. It's the little things. Make me as a customer feel like you care and/or pay attention. Today, there was a customer in front of me that he was chatting up for a while, while i waited for him to make my Mocha. As always, he doesn't talk to me at all, but what was jarring today was that as soon as he put my beverage on the bar, he greeted the customer behind me with a loud and vibrant good morning.
I'm happy spending my money elsewhere, at least somewhere I can be greeted when I come in."

205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-09,5.0,I love this shop! I work near by but I always pick this place over the other shops in the neighborhood because the coffee is good and the baristas aren't just coffee-making-robots. They really make you feel comfortable while you wait for your drink. Usually I end up hanging out after I get my coffee and before I know it I'm late for work!
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-08,5.0,"Good coffee, freshly roasted, good selections of pastries!  I go here before my work almost everyday and all staff are friendly and highly skilled (not one of those you see at Starbucks!!) I think the main barista name was Manny and he for sure knows his coffee! I even requested to play Drake music for the market and he played for me all morning. Cool spot!"
205,office-coffee-new-york-2,2018-02-10,4.0,"This coffee shop is located inside the entrance of Canal Market (on the side where the little pop up stores are). I got a drip coffee to have while I browsed around. The coffee is high quality, no line at the counter, and there is a small selection of pastries. The barista was nice but took her time conversing with the her friend before taking my order even though I was standing there waiting. Overall net positive experience though and I'd grab coffee from here again."
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-05-01,5.0,"I can't find enough good things to say about this place!!! Absolutely delicious food and coffee, and the kindest staff I've ever come across. I highly recommend the iced coffee and the breakfast wraps. The owners get to know every single customer and remember my order by heart. This is my favorite neighborhood spot and I highly recommend it to anyone passing through or living nearby!"
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-07-16,5.0,"My friend and his roommate love this place, and I wasn't too sure why until I went there the other day. 
It's a small deli nestled in the west village. The people running the store are extremely kind and they try to get to know every customer that comes in. 
The store itself was small, but very neat and clean. The had many options which I loved. The prices were decent and the food was delicious.
I ended up getting the everything bagel with cream cheese and the cinnamon bun! Both very good!"

11:35 pm  in Georgia 2/3  - went to a private party.

3:15 am 2/4 - got a ride to the airport.

5:25 am - loved hopping on a cool Jet with some new friends.

6:47 am - Landed in Newark, NJ. 

8:10 am - found Blackstone Coffee on Hudson St in the West Village in NYC via a Yelp search. 

8:12 am - got the warmest greeting and welcome from Sammy( the owner) as I walked in with no sleep and famished.

8:15-8:22 am - I browsed through and basically was getting some ideas for Wednesday and next week as I saw the freshly baked scones: Choc chip and a bunch of other unique flavors. They just looked delicious and appetizing. 

The freshly made salads- egg and tuna amongst them, looked really good. Fresh again! 

The coffee was delicious. Hot, strong and Sammy was very kind as he offered me all dairy and other options. 

8:23 am - SUPER MONDAY commenced in Manhattan with the awesome # 3 breakfast special- egg whites, avocado and kale served on toasted while wheat with their lovely house made salsa. I have never had this combo and it was just perfect. The eggs were cooked just right. The kale was not bitter, harsh or overpowering. Tasty actually in this form. The avocados added a nice and creamy compliment to this special. The salsa was beautiful: fresh and bursting with flavor. 

Loved their list of specials. Loved Sammy's energy and interaction with the regulars who also responded in kind. Loved it! 

Loved that you can park on Hudson St  ( $1 for every 15 minutes) starting at 8:00 am with easy access to this great coffee, breakfast and lunch spot. 

Loved the prices for this quality and quantity. 

Love that they open at 5:00 am M-F and at 6:00 am on the weekends. That is huge for Manhattan! This early bird would love to get his Joe at that hour!!

Loved the staff - the chef was a happy guy who obviously put a lot of love into his beautiful fare. There was another very sweet employee who was stocking and actually held the garbage lid open for me and my mess after I had devoured my breakfast. I mean, who does that! Really cool and considerate!! 

Loved Sammy! He told me his son's name also was Ray and he would not forget me. I think it is definitely the other way around: this truly was a memorable experience. Thank you so much Sammy! This was a wonderful welcome back to NY. See you soon!!"

Warm staff and impeccable service. This has been a great and much needed addition to the area with the amount of options available and quality.

Our go to is always the Everything Bagel with homemade Jalapeno cream cheese. Ince you try that, there is no going back :)"

Family owned, everyone is super friendly, and the food is fresh and tasty. (Love the paninis and breakfast sandwiches)

Delightful salad, friendly company, and fun community-oriented environment kick this place up."
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-01-20,3.0,"I love the convenience, the tea, and the food. The bagels are honestly some of the best I have ever tasted. The location is ideal. However I go there as a LAST resort because the proprietor insists on addressing women as ""honey"", ""sugar,"" ""love"", and so on.  It's 2020. Gendered expressions like these in a simple transaction for a coffee and a bagel are way out of line. In fact, they make my skin crawl."
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-02-18,5.0,"This couldn't be a better ""ma & pa"" coffee house (deli) if it tried. They have everything on their menu, and some, as you will see. The staff, and I think it was the owner, are extremely friendly. You can tell they truly enjoy being at work and love providing great customer service/interaction. Very welcoming and friendly, and who doesn't love that? I walked in right at the knick of time as he was sampling a spinach ricotta stuffed croissant that he sliced up to let customers try. It was awesome and I would have gotten it, if I didn't have my heart set on the cheese danish. 

Berry smoothie, good, but too much almond milk for my liking, which is fine because I knew it was in there, I would just ask them for something other than A.Milk next time. Still enjoyed it. Sesame Bagel/plain smear = delicious. Cheese danish/croissant = one the best I've had. Wife = veggie omelette wrap and liked it and said she'd order again. 

Will be back and looking forward to trying more of their stuff!"
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-06-19,2.0,"Pretty disappointed with my breakfast this morning.

I ordered one of their special wraps on the board. Suppose to have eggs, avocado, turkey bacon, red beans and salsa....my wrap was missing the avocado and the salsa. Spent 9 dollars for a wrap with eggs, turkey bacon and beans. Come on now. Thats rather ridiculous. 9 bucks for that? Got the wrap and brought it to work. I'm not going to walk back for avocado and salsa. Not a good way to start the day!"
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-01-01,5.0,"Had to come back only a couple weeks later for a deja by experience with their crumb cake!!!! .....

In search of a caffeine fix after getting off from the Christopher St. PATH Station, saw this little coffee shop on the corner of Hudson.  Stopped in for a latte and cappuccino and saw this piece of crumb cake and could not resist - the best ever I have had!!   Dense crumbs that didn't fall off - a hint of cinnamon - and a buttery not too dense and not to airy cake - how can you go wrong.   Along with the super pleasant and friendly barista and very smooth coffees, we will certainly be coming back to this little gem!"
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-10-09,5.0,Always met with a smile and the food is always made with love. I also appreciate the vegan options and how accommodating they are.
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2017-11-10,4.0,"New coffee place out near the Christopher Street stop and Citibike station. Large selection of baked goods as well as sandwiches/wraps/etc, which is surprising considering the cramped interior. Friday morning, surveyed the pastries behind the glass while waiting in the moderate line.

Ordered the large ""Stone Coffee"" and a Pumpkin Raisin Scone ($5ish altogether). Items come out fast, and as I get things ready at the station, realize there's no milk to be found. ad to go back to the counter for them to add the necessary milk/sugar (don't forget to ask when ordering!). The scone itself is gigantic; a not-too-overwhelming pumpkin flavor that didn't really go with the raisins, but nonetheless easy to eat. Coffee is strong, pairing with the scone just fine.

Service here is fantastic (the guys behind the counter are friendly) and the value is way better than their gourmet-coffee counterparts. I see this as an option somewhere between the food cart coffee guys and the higher end ones. Good to have around."
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-09-01,5.0,"I live one block away from Blackstone and always enjoy my experience here. The owner is extremely kind and knows everyone who comes in more than once by name. Even when it's packed inside, you are cared for and service is quick. Food/coffee are also perfect for the price."
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-09-10,5.0,"The owner really does an amazing job of making this place feel like a NEIGHBORHOOD place. He is super friendly, has an incredible memory and makes it a point to remember customers' names and regular orders. I really, really enjoy the breakfast wraps and bagels here. These kinds of spots make the West Village what it is"
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-01-09,5.0,"I got the #1 breakfast sandwich - egg whites, spinach, and turkey on 7 grain toast. I had it a few hours later as I wanted it for my flight and it was still very good, which makes me think it must have been amazing fresh as well ! 

Even before ordering I was greeted warmly and the man working there was so kind to both regulars when he knew their orders and to new customers like me ! I loved the vibe and definitely want to come back to try other options here !"
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-07-14,3.0,Terrible iced coffee. It takes like water. I get that people leave good reviews but their actual business name has coffee in it - so you would think their coffee is actually decent. Sigh
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-03-17,5.0,"I work around the corner from them, and ordered via Seamless my first time. Food was delicious and delivery was quicker than expected. I went in to order in person the next day because I liked the food so many AND THE GUY REMEMBERED MY ORDER after ONE order. I truly couldn't believe it. 

Went in yesterday morning for coffee, and spoke to a different gentleman but VERY personable and kind, in that way that's not like ""please stop talking"". I went in again this morning for coffee and yet again he remembered my face and my order. (I also went in without a coat and he showed concern it was very sweet). 

Food is great and there's a lot of options and they're so sweet. CLEAN area. LOTS of options when you go in (multiple brands of chips, cookies, protein bars, drinks, etc.)."

On our second visit, we - and our smoothie order - were remembered. Amazing food and old school customer service.  Even the other customers we met took an extra minute to say hello and offer a few kind words. We need more places like this."
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-11-17,5.0,This place on a chilled Sunday Winter morning is really a serene and sedate. Having a sip of splendid coffee while sitting around adds to this tranquility. I would recommend this as one of the best coffee hub to checkout in Lower Manhattan.
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-05-26,5.0,"Best coffee shop in the West Village, I can't say enough great things about this place. The owner is so friendly and kind and makes every one of his customers feel like family. The space is immaculate and has the freshest food. Their cinnamon buns are made from scratch loaded with frosting (not that lame thin coat of icing you see in most bakeries) and it's honestly the best cinnamon bun I've had in the city. Their smoothies are also amazing along with all of their breakfast items- their home fries are crisp potatoes cooked to perfection with so much flavor. A MUST if you are in the West Village and need to grab on the go or seamless!"
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-09-21,5.0,"Nice Greenwich Village location on a quiet corner.   Geek omelette wrap with their homemade salsa is yummy!   Coffee is really good.  Limited counter seating inside, but a bench outside."
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-03-29,5.0,"I was very impressed with Blackstone as we stopped in a few times during our recent visit to NYC. We ordered a wide variety of drinks including iced lattes and mocha. I was also impressed with their food selection. They offer a wide variety of salads, paninis, wraps, pastries and more. 

My wife ordered a Mexican breakfast wrap one morning and she said it was exceptional. I would probably eat there all the time if I lived close by!

The staff was also welcoming and very nice (I believe the owner waited on us both days). They obviously have a lot of regulars as they knew just about everyone that stopped in. 

If you live in the area or are looking for a great place for coffee and more, stop here for sure."

502 Hudson Street, NYC

The best thing to hit this Hudson/Christopher Streets neighborhood in years: Black Rock Coffee Roasters! Good cheer and tasty food on tap all day. It's guaranteed that you will feel better when you come back out with your coffee and hearty tuna wrap, tasty salade Niçoise, or crisp onion bagel with lox and cream cheese. 

Everything is fresh and of the highest quality at Black Stone/Hudson: hefty sandwiches, tasty salads, scrumptious wraps, bagels, fruit smoothies, fabulous coffee of course, and every juice/soft drink you can imagine (even hydrogenated water, whatever that is). Plus, an incredible array in the refrigerated display case: tuna salad perfection, chicken salad (made with sour cream!), fresh fruit salad, grilled chicken breasts, and so many other savory treats. Four window seats and 2 outside benches make for fun people-watching (strollers, dogs, dolled-up fashionistas, and brilliantly casual West Villagers). I absolutely love their fresh lemonade! It comes in blueberry and other flavors. Yum!

Above all, Sammy, Ray, and Alex are family and they make every visitor feel like family. After very few visits you've earned ""cousin"" status. You know they love their business. The foot traffic every day confirms it. It couldn't happen to nicer people. rand b"

My favorites include: Freshly roasted coffee, moist scones with berries that burst on your tongue, decadent hummus fudge, cozy and delectable soups, seafood salad that's a meal, handmade sandwiches with the perfect symphony of crisp, tangy toppings, and egg salad that has me getting up in the middle of night for spoonfuls. 

Black Stone has been claimed by all the locals as we stroll past the big chain storefront on the block and head for our morning greeting from these two sweet gentlemen. See you there!"

More pertinently: this place has fresh coffee and pastries, as well as courteous service -- much better than many others in the area. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in the area!"
206,blackstone-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-05-31,5.0,"Let me just start off by saying the owner of Blackstone is one of the sweetest, kindest, and funny guys! He really cares about his customers, tries to memorize your order if you're a regular, knows everyone's name, and will make you try samples of all his homemade goodies. This is what I look for in a coffee shop/local business, and sadly there aren't many left down here! He and his sons work very hard to keep the place going! 

On top of it, they have a very wide selection of healthy and fresh food, as well as your typical deli foods. I ordered a smoothie one time that just didn't taste right, and they gave me something else on the house the next day. I truly appreciated it. I come here at least 3 times a week for lunch and I enjoy it every time. I definitely recommend it!"

207,dripped-coffee-new-york,2019-07-26,4.0,"Dripped Coffee is a caffeinated spot with most of your favorite coffee and tea offerings as well as some signature caffeine draaanks on the Lower East Side. 

this is relatively small coffee joint. clean, modern, bright that is has casual and friendly vibe. there is a small amount of seating in the front. there's also a small bench out front. there's a small order counter with some soft drinks as well as small baked eats as well as coffee/tea condiments. this is a cashless establishment  credit, debit, and Apple Pay only.

FYI: there's no simple syrup. only raw sugar in packets and sometimes an agave bottle. 

coffee? the iced Americano is solidly good. $3.50. smooth and refreshing with a caffeine kick. 

the real winner is the Manhattan Special Coffee Soda: expresso + seltzer + cane sugar. the seltzer + coffee is a pretty amazing combo--caffeinated effervescence. throw in the touch of sweetness from sugar and you have a freaking great summer drink. $4-4.50

the service is efficient. it needs a bit more personality imo.

207,dripped-coffee-new-york,2020-02-28,5.0,I was honestly just looking for somewhere to eat my bagel and get a coffee when I stumbled on this spot. It was one of the only coffee places nearby open before 11am on a Friday and looked intimate but hip. I ordered the hot coffee with the cbd in it. It was pretty good. any friend got the iced chai which she also liked. Also the guy was super cool and after we sat down came and brought us some iced water. Very nice! Would recommend.
207,dripped-coffee-new-york,2020-02-10,5.0,Customer service + drink was amazing! Barista was so chill and very easy to talk to! I ordered the Matcha Latte and I did not regret it!

So today I went in during work hours really needing a coffee and as I look at the menu im like wait, there's a coffee soda?! And my mind went *caffeine* *caffeine* *caffeine* and im like heck yeah! 

I loved the fact that it was a chill ambiance and that the barista made everything step by step instead of just taking a bottle of the Manhattan special coffee soda and pouring it over ice. He also does everything where you can see him. 

Can I say the taste BLEW MY MIND just the hit of caffeine I needed for the rest of my work day! I loved it so much I have to come back!"

207,dripped-coffee-new-york,2018-10-06,5.0,"I was browsing through my Instagram and I came across a post shared by one of my followers. And I was thinking I'm going to be in the neighborhood today so let me try this out. See all my life I've never been into coffee or could even get with the taste of it. I've never been one of those people who  need coffee to start the day but as I approach the age of 29 I can't seem to truly be awake  without a little bit of assistance in the morning. Coffee has become my morning fix. So after visiting some galleries on this beautiful Saturday beautiful as in no rain I decided to stop by their grand opening. Let's start with the aesthetic modern black and white clean and cut straight to the point just how I like my coffee.I love the influence of hip-hop as creatives, as artists we need a push in the morning not only the every day working woman in heels and men in a suit and tie.  What about the people in air max and Jordans and a fitted cap every day the ambience is just so welcoming. This is the place for us creatives sending out invoices for late payments while sipping on a ice latte, the designer who's working on some tech packs, or the graphic artist who's working on a logo. I love that instead of tables and chairs they decided to go with a small set of bleachers. I see this being a staple in the neighborhood would definitely recommend you give it a try if you're in the area."
207,dripped-coffee-new-york,2018-09-17,5.0,"Cozy hidden gem in the Lower East Side. I popped by on Friday afternoon and ordered a latte with oat milk. The latte was smooth and comforting. It was the perfect spot to catch up with a friend! Great staff, Great music selection and delicious coffee!"
207,dripped-coffee-new-york,2018-12-01,5.0,Awesome coffee and friendly service :-) Definitely my go-to coffeeshop in the area! I typically get the black coffee and it's the best.

207,dripped-coffee-new-york,2019-03-20,3.0,"got the drip coffee. 
it's roasted dark so not very good. With specialty coffee pricing it seems to be a lower grade and quality coffee bean."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-05-15,5.0,"This place has been on my list for a while, but after some apparently effective productive placement in the the new k-drama ""The King,"" I felt compelled to make the trip. Thankfully they are open during COVID!

I went for the matcha brown sugar milk - I've had traditional brown sugar milk before at Tiger Sugar in Flushing, so figured I should push the envelope this time. It was quite good! Somehow the addition of the matcha prevented it from being overly sweet, which was my going-in concern."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-03-01,4.0,"Everyone reviews their crazy brown sugar deeroica drinks, but I went for a tea instead! I love that this place has rainbow jelly since it's not something I'd usually ever get / ever see, but I decided to get it with my peach oolong tea and it was a great addition. 3.5 rounded up since it's definitely really pricey for what it is but rounding it up since not a lot of places offer rainbow jelly. 

Not the most spacious boba shop, but enough space for you and a friend or two and a really convenient location near Cooper Square."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-02-23,4.0,"The brown sugar bubble tea drink here is less sweet compared to the ones from Tiger Sugar. I personally like tiger sugar more but I can understand the appeal of the Alley. The milk taste was stronger than the sugar taste but the sweetness come from the bubbles so you can't really customize it. 

The interior is beautiful, gives it a real cafe vibe. There were 6 or 7 two people tables and a communal table that sits around 8 people. 

PS. They have a restroom!!! Just ask for the keys. 

PPS. They also have chargers that you can rent if your phone battery is running low like mine was."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-06-04,5.0,"I've gone back multiple more times, and they have improved their level of the pearls. I think perhaps they were dealing with inconsistencies when they first opened"
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-01-20,3.0,"I honestly don't get this brown sugar boba fad. Brown sugar is so mild in flavor;; it must be the very instagramable way it melts in a drink like lava...

The space is very cute. Modern and actually cozy for a boba shop. Most are grab and go.

The drink can be pricey. I don't like sugar loaded drinks anymore (never really did but boba used to con me so bad).

I couldn't even try the boba as they were out so I had a Assam tea with jellies. The total was just  under $6. The drink was a-ok. 

If I had time to spend here I'd enjoy that. It's prob a good date spot. For a casual boba drinker like myself I'm not rushing to come back here."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-01-29,3.0,"I've seen a ton of ig posts of this place, mostly with their brown sugar drink which looks super cool! I think this place is pretty new and may have just opened up this location a few weeks / months ago. I decided to opt for their Royal No 9 milk tea on my first visit here. I asked them what their most unique / popular flavor was and they said it was the Royal No 9 milk tea which is similar to black milk tea but also has a hint of blueberries. It's true - it does have a very slight hint of blueberries which I enjoyed! In comparison to other boba places though, their boba wasn't nearly as good. It wasn't very flavorful (I think they use normal boba instead of honey boba, which a lot of places like YiFang do).

I will say that the interior is very cute though. They have a bunch of seating in the back of the shop and there's a table area that's surrounded by a fake tree that extends to the ceiling, which would be a great place to sip boba and study for a couple hours."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-12-30,3.0,"Everyone raves about this place so I had to check it out myself to see if it lived up to the expectations. Brown sugar bubble tea has been spreading across NYC and this spot is no exception to that. With its larger-than-norm seating selection and adorable rounded cups, it definitely sets itself apart from other boba shops. 

We came at around 9:20 -- close to closing time (10:00) so there was no line. Ordering process was fairly quick, menu is straight forward. 

I ordered the brown sugar deerioca with oat milk. It was good but nothing special. I thought it was nice that the tapioca came warm -- but quickly found that they got hard quickly after mixing with the cold milk. Even after mixing the drink, I felt that the brown sugar flavor wasn't distributed well. Had some sips there were too sweet and some that tasted purely like milk. Wasn't terrible (would probably visit again) but wasn't anything life changing."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-11-13,3.0,"The brown sugar pearl milk craze is upon us in New York City. Although I am not the biggest boba fan, I do find myself giving in to the brown sugar drinks, which uses Taiwanese brown cane sugar instead of artificial syrup. Its dark caramel flavor is distinct and captivating.

Having tried The Alley abroad before, I had a certain expectation when I stopped by the New York location. Perhaps it was because they are still fairly new and the employees are still getting used to standardizing the quality and production, but my experience was quite disappointing. I ordered the Brown Sugar Deerioca Milk, my usual go-to. While the tapioca pearls were warm and chewy, the drink lacked the balance between brown sugar syrup and the milk. As a result, my drink was rather bland - almost like drinking only milk. In addition, due to the design of the cups, I had difficulty ""fishing out"" all the tapioca pearls.

Overall, I am happy that The Alley opened up in Manhattan to add to the growing brown sugar milk tea scene. Hopefully, my lackluster experience was a one-time incident and I hope to see some improvements next time I visit."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-05-22,3.0,Only 11 bubble in 1 cup!  No good ! Don't you give little bit kindness to bubble tea lover at the hard time like convid 19 ? Huh???
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-11-24,3.0,"Ah, the famous Alley has finally moved to New York and I finally got the chance to try it. My girlfriend and I found ourselves here on a Tuesday evening before having dinner nearby in St. Marks. She recommended this spot and after doing some research on the company I discovered that it was not only popular in it's home country of Taiwan, but also at it's locations across the country. This one had also just opened so I was excited to see what all the fuss was about.

We walked in around 5:30 and there weren't that many people inside, maybe three or four parties. We got in line to order and I ended up choosing one of the classics, the brown sugar derrioca milk (with soy). For a $7 bubble tea it was smaller than I though it be. After the time it took to prepare it I was also surprised at how bland it was. Don't get me wrong, it was a GOOD drink, but I thought due to all the hype it was going to be a lot better. For me tiger heaven takes the cake over this.

The spot itself was really nice though. Lots of space and ample amounts of seating. You're definitely able to order your drink and enjoy it here too if it's not too packed. The staff kept the store (and the bathroom) really clean as well. Overall I'm happy we got the chance to try this place out. I'd recommend going here for yourselves to make your own opinions about the bubble tea too."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-03-10,5.0,"I was afraid this boba spot would be insanely crowded but praise be it wasn't on a Saturday afternoon. My friends and I were able to chill here for a few hours. I ordered a large unsweetened tea while my friends had the creme brûlée beverage and a passion fruit juice. I seriously wished I ordered a creme brûlée for myself because it was so damn good. I'll be back for that. 
I would say the drinks were somewhat pricey (at around 5$ something) each but it is to be expected at a place like this."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-10-20,4.0,"This place is huge for a bubble tea shop- with plenty of seating.  I love the decorations with the deer, hanging lights, and the giant tree. 

I came on a Friday night at 5pm and luckily there was no line. Maybe because it's a cold day, but no fret if you want something warm they have hot drinks as well as cold drinks.

I ordered the famous brown sugar cream brulee bubble tea and it was tasty. It was super creamy and not sickeningly sweet like lots of brown sugar bubble tea spots where I would have to ask for less sugar. I also tried the matcha brown sugar and the Trio assam black milk tea and they were both good as well and not too sweet. The trio assam was interesting because it had lychee jelly ,coconut jelly, and tapioca balls.

also if you are lactose intolerant they have options such as soymilk which I think is a nice touch."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-10-04,4.0,"I'm a little torn writing this review, because the bubble tea here is definitely good. But I'm not sure whether it's worth the hefty price tag. This is my first time trying The Alley, so I went in with big expectations. 

My honest review is a 3.5/5, rounded up to 4. 

I'd heard from friends that I should expect long lines at the Alley, but surprisingly there was no one in line when I got there. Granted, it was a Monday around noon, just after opening. 

After being indecisive about what to get I decided to go with their bestselling Brown Sugar Creme Brûlée Milk Tea. I was surprised that it wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be. I think the sweetness was just right, and the boba was really soft and chewy. 

The only thing that really gets me is the price: I think I would rather get Boba Guys, all things considered."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-25,3.0,"It seems The Alley's reputation precedes itself, as evidenced by the daily lines outside its doors. Having visited another location in Toronto before, I too was eagerly anticipating the chain's first NYC opening. 

However, this particular location is still finding its footing, which is understandable as it has not even been open for a month yet. The menu is pretty limited-- while there are some staples (ie: Brown Sugar Deerioca, Milk Tea Series, Assam Black Tea) I noticed there were were some offerings (not yet?) available including the Aurora Series, Winter Series, and Specialty Drinks. 

However, I did notice some new menu items that were not available in Toronto such as the Lulu and Snow Velvet Series. Perhaps they are doing a Shake Shack situation where different locations have special menu items.

This is not to say The Alley is not worth a visit. But it certainly isn't worth the insane hype or long lines. On a Saturday afternoon, the wait came out to around 20 minutes. Would I wait any longer than 30 minutes? Probably not."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-11-11,5.0,"I love The Alley and am so glad to have found one in NYC! The taste is so good, and the drinks are consistently high quality. It's quite pricey for boba but it's very distinct and better than the competition. We got the cheese foam and it's a must. 

This location is great too since it's not all the way in Chinatown, which I like. There aren't many other boba spots in the East Village so this was super convenient for me.

Highly recommend!"
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-07,5.0,"Jesus, it's my 400th review and I'm doing The Alley, another player in the NYC Brown Sugar milk tea rivalry.  I didn't expect to wait on line two hours just to try out their most popular drink the Brown Sugar Deerioca Creme Brûlée, Deerioca is the name of tapioca pearls made by The Alley along with their brown sugar formula. I also ordered The fruit drink Orange Lulu with pearls and rainbow Jelly.

Well the Brown Sugar Deerioca tastes good but what happen to the Creme Brûlée was it just favoring and no creme ?  I am new to the Brown Sugar drinks and can only say the the brown sugar taste different than Tiger Sugar's. But Tiger's Creme Mousse it creamer and I think is better all around, but that me and what I like.

The Orange Lulu was just tasty, but my straw was clogged after one sip. So I opened it and it had chunks of oranges inside I ate it with a spoon and enjoyed every bit of it this made the wait worth it forget about the brown sugar drinks, this will be my number one. If you are looking for something different which you can customize with the level sugar, ice, tapioca, and jelly, unlike the Brown Sugar drinks. And there is a good number of other drinks you can get here. 

The Layout of the shop is nice you have stand up counter tables, seats under a indoor artificial tree, along with public parks and plazas outside next to Cooper Union.

The size of the cup is about $6 and on the high side but The Alley give you a punch card where you get a free drink after getting 3 in the same month and a another card for $2 discount the following month which I think is good deal if you become a regular customer."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-12-24,5.0,"The Alley's boba were delicious. Not sure why there are such terrible reviews that blame the wait time. I went in December, a couple months after they opened and there was barely any wait. You have to consider the time and season duh. 

The creme brûlée milk tea is great. It is on the sweet side so it definitely will satiate those who have a sweet tooth.
The coconut taro milk tea has a nuttier, earthier flavour. You get pieces of real taro, which I enjoyed.

I will definitely be back for some more boba to try new flavours."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-05,4.0,"I was so excited to get to try their Brown Sugar series! I got here around 2:15PM and the line wasn't too bad. I waited for approximately 20 minutes. The staff was really friendly, especially the guy that stands outside and asks if anyone has any questions about the menu. The cashier was also very sweet. I love how there was so much space and seating at this place. I ordered the Brown Sugar Deerioca Creme Brûlée Milk and the Match milk one. 

I really enjoyed the matcha milk one. You can actually taste the matcha. The drink itself wasn't creamy. The brown sugar was subtle. Sweetness was perfect. Tapioca was chewy, not too soft and a good size. I do wish it was a bit colder but I think the ice melted due to the hot brown sugar. I was expecting the brown sugar to taste a bit more strong but I might just try the regular brown sugar one next time. 

The Creme Brûlée one does taste like creme Brûlée!  (LOL) I usually wouldn't get this flavor but I did get it for my boyfriend to try and it seems as this is also one of their more popular drink. I personally would prefer the matcha over the creme Brûlée but my boyfriend enjoyed it. 

Overall, I do want to try more of their drinks. It was good but also I feel that $6 for the given size is a tad pricey. Not horrible though! I still prefer Tiger Sugar as for my to-go brown sugar bubble tea place. Take advantage of the $5 voucher!!"
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-28,4.0,"My fiancé and I decided to try out The Alley, as we have finally heard of the notorious brown sugar boba tea from here. We came in on a Thursday around noon, and luckily for us, the line was about 5 people long but moved quickly. I ended up ordering the brown sugar milk tea as well as the brown sugar matcha drink. 

The brown sugar milk tea drink was very sweet - it tasted as if I ordered 100% sweetness/full sweetness even though I ordered about 70% sweetness. The brown sugar boba is very warm, making the overall drink taste cool as opposed to cold. The brown sugar boba is tasty and chewy, a pleasant experience. However, the milk tea itself tasted average. Sadly, I was overhyped for this drink, as its main selling point is the brown sugar boba, which tasted above average. The brown sugar matcha tea was more enjoyable, as the base had more flavor than the milk tea. The matcha tea itself is not as sweet as I anticipated, although this is offset by the brown sugar boba. Overall, still a pleasant drink. 

The interior looks lovely and modern with furniture consisting of mostly black, marble, and gold items/decorations. The bathroom is clean, which is always a plus in NY. The chairs and booths looked fancy, but they're quite uncomfortable to sit on for more than an hour at a time. 

Overall, I am glad we tried out The Alley. The drinks are small and about $6.50 each, so they are relatively expensive compared to what we are used to. A little overhyped, but this boba fad is a train I am ready to board for a little while. Make sure to come here close to the opening hour, as sometimes The Alley is so popular, the line is out the door and around the corner and/or runs out of brown sugar boba!"
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-10-24,4.0,"Great Bubble Tea shop that has delicious drinks and a cool interior to hang out. I really like the taste of their drinks, and the quality of the ingredients that they use.

My favorite drink here is the Brown Sugar Creme Brûlée. Unlike most of the other drinks, it cannot be modified in terms of sweetness, ice or toppings. It is super sweet, but I can't help to indulge every now and then. 

I'll definitely come back whenever I am around this area again!"
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-10-12,4.0,"TLDR: Another brown sugar boba specialist import from Asia. Very good.

I think the brown sugar tapioca has become a bit of a fad in New York lately. However, when I had a Taiwanese chain was opening a location here - I was curios to try it.

The interior is very chic, a good place to catch up with some friends. They have their best sellers on the large screen where you order, so that's helpful.

We have tried the Creme Brulee Deerioca, the Milk Deerioca and the Royal No. 9 Milk Tea.

Creme Brulee Deerioca - This is their top seller. It was a bit too rich for me, it's basically a brown sugar tapioca latte but with actual creme brulee in it. The richness you'll notice instantly, it is on the sweeter side because the of the pudding. This drink is around 1400 calories FYI.

Milk Deerioca - For their brown sugar beverages, I prefer this one. It's not too sweet, the tapioca was perfectly chewy.

Royal No. 9 Milk Tea - This was my personal favorite here. It's a milk tea but it has that richness from the creme but the tea has depth. I might want to try it with tapioca next time around. There is a subtle tone of berry in this, so it is definitely a unique drink.

Overall - I like The Alley. If you're in the area, worth checking it out. The drinks are on the smaller side but the ingredients are high quality."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-09,3.0,"Came here grand opening day and the line was pretty long.. we waited roughly 45 minutes for the drink. I ordered the popular brown sugar deerioca drink and honestly don't think it's that worth it! It tastes just like milk flavored lightly with brown sugar (which is the same syrup they used to sweeten the boba itself). They use Horizon's organic milk... so beware if you are lactose intolerant! 

The boba tasted chewy for the first few minutes and then hardened really quickly in the drink. For roughly $6, I think I can go elsewhere for a promising cup of brown sugar milk. 

One thing to also note is that they did add the calorie count on their menu.. their top seller brown sugar deerioca milk with creme brulee is a whopping 1366 calories.. just sayin! Might need to do some squats while waiting in that line.."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-20,3.0,"After trying the Alley in HK, I was excited to try the Apple Cider Vinegar & Honey Slush once again, however, I was a bit disappointed by the different menu options provided in this NYC location. But the Royal No.9 Black Milk Tea with bubbles gave this place 3 stars. This is a must try for the Alley. Not too hyped for the brown sugar milk series, but more so for their other drinks. Tried the Snow Strawberry Lulu also, which had a great taste of smashed fresh strawberries, slush, and creamy on top. 

The drinks are alright, I'm not sure how I feel about paying $6+ for a small drink though.

The line goes almost down the block, so be prepared to wait."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-19,3.0,"The decor in The Alley LuJiaoXiang is pretty hip and there are about 20 seats good for friends gathering. 
We ordered no.2 Brown Sugar Deerioca Milk, the taste of brown sugar with milk was decent and not too sweet. Their bubble was chewy and warm inside. 
However, it's not worth the price with price $6.53 (+tax) but only about 350ml and the wait was bad when I visited at 9:00pm on a Thursday."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-08,5.0,"I first tried the alley in Toronto and immediately marked it as my favorite bubble tea spot, so I was so excited when it was announced that we would be getting one in NYC. Turns out we're actually getting two because they're opening one In flushing in the next month or two! It seems as if their grand opening was yesterday for the Astor place location  and their full menu still isn't out yet though. 

Milk tea series - THE BEST. I really don't feel the need to go too in depth because I honestly think they make the best milk tea in the whole business. Get the no. 9 only if you're down for that blueberry hint which is a little sour. Not my cup of tea but my fiancé loved it. I usually opt for the original or the earl grey. 

Brown sugar deerioca - This is their signature drink and it competes with tiger sugar. Their brown sugar deerioca with creme brûlée is my absolute favorite and much much much more creamier than other bubble tea shops. However, that drink is 1366 calories and my body can not afford to drink that all the time, so then I opt for the one without creme brûlée which definitely isn't as good, but still good enough. The deerioca without creme brûlée is a lot less sweet and it works for me, but some might think it lacks flavor. I suggest mixing it VERY well and let your drink soak in with the boba for a few minutes. Their tapioca for the brown sugar has a beautiful hint of this roasted flavor and that's what distinguishes their drinks from others for me. I do have to put it out there and say their brown sugar boba is chewier and not as soft as tiger sugar though."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-14,4.0,"September 7, 2019 

Came here for the grand opening last week! The line was very long and it took around 45 minutes to get my drink. I heard about The Alley from my friends who have tried their drinks in Asia. I was very excited to hear that they were opening a spot in NYC! I ordered the Brown Sugar Deerioca Milk and it was really good. The drink was creamy and the bubbles were nice and chewy. It was not too sweet which was great. They accept debit/credit cards and they have a restroom. Would stop by again if I am in the area!

208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-11-07,5.0,"The prettiest and cutest little Boba spot! When I went around 4pm on a Saturday there was a small line out the door. It didn't take too long to get to the front and it didn't take too long for my drink to come out. Staff was friendly and helpful too!

Not only is the place pretty but the boba is GOOD! I got their classic brown sugar milk tea and it was really good! I love how chewy the bubbles are (it's perfect - not too soft as I don't like it too squishy but not hard). It was delicious and t didn't take too long!! 

I think this is my favorite Boba place in all of NYC 
I can't wait to go back!"
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-10-13,5.0,"The Milk tea at The Alley is phenomenal! The creme brûlée is the winner in my opinion. The tea is not made with tea leaves but rather with milk and slow cooked tapioca in brown sugar. The brown sugar is cooked down for several hours to create the syrupy sweetness. The tea is not overly sweet, it is perfectly balanced. 

The crowd gets pretty big here but the staff is very efficient and keep the cue moving quickly. 

The staff is very polities & the owners are very involved one, actually took the time to explain the creme brûlée sugar making process to us that I mentioned above. 

Go try some of this cozy yummy tea. I am sure you will find one that speaks to your taste."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-10-09,3.0,"We came here on opening weekend and realized it was just another over-hyped brown sugar bubble tea shop. I've heard about this place being famous before and even passed by one in London, but I never felt motivated enough to try it in case I would be disappointed by another $6 (pre-tax) drink. 

Though their most popular drink is the brown sugar creme brulee milk, I didn't order this because it was 1300 calories! After an hour wait, we ordered the brown sugar milk, which was their #2 item. I'm not sure about the other drinks, but for the brown sugar ones, you cannot choose the size nor adjust the sweetness and ice levels. 

3 stars because it wasn't bad, but definitely not as good as Tiger Sugar or YiFang. Also, they had a guy walking around line explaining the menu, which was good because we weren't sure if ""deerioca"" just meant tapioca or not (it's just tapioca, lol)."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-04,4.0,"Came here around 12:50pm for their soft opening. There were 4 people before me. But about 12:55pm, the line start to get little crazy.
The drink was pretty good. I order their brown sugar deerioca creme brûlée."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-03,5.0,"The address is actually 68 Cooper Sq, New York, NY 10003. There was a small line to order and to actually get the drink. The wait to get in was not too long when I went at around 1PM, but the wait for the tea drinks were a little longer. Since it's a soft opening, a lot of items on their menu are missing. One of the workers came out with a menu and asked if anyone had questions and was more than patient and kind when people had questions. The interior is really nice and modern. 

I got the trio milk tea because I was interested in the three toppings all in one drink so it's like you get a snack and a drink all in one. Not a lot of bubble tea places have that. The three toppings are konjac jelly, coconut jelly, and bubbles. I got zero sugar because the toppings have sugar in them or are soaked in sugar. The tea is good and is a good combination with the three toppings. Highly recommend checking it out!"
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-02-13,4.0,"First of all, it was nice revisiting a Milk Tea place that I had the pleasure of trying in both Taiwan (where it is a huge lifestyle/comfort drink) and Japan (where it is a huge trend).

Their milk tea is very rich and delicious. Make sure to add adjustments on both sugar and ice to your liking. I haven't gotten pearls itself in a while so did not opt for the brown sugar drink with pearls. This actually ran out by the time I got here, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. The interior is very spacious too; a good place to come and relax a bit after dinner in busy NYC.

Would recommend The Alley for anyone who likes the traditional taiwanese taste. Get a sip of Taiwan without actually visiting!"
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-04,5.0,"Since the Alley first announced its plans to open a store in NYC, I waited in anticipation. 

The first time I had it was in Hong Kong where there was always a line before doors even opened.  

Here in Astor Place, I stopped by in the afternoon and waited roughly 20 minutes on the line. The brown sugar craze is sweeping NYC and The Alley goes toe to toe with Tiger Sugar. 

The Alleys signature drink Creme Brûlée hits the spot. The tapioca is delicious but it was chewier in HK. The brown sugar taste is present but not overbearing. I did not customize any sweetness or ice but that is an available option. 

Take advantage of their soft opening promo: spend $10 to get a $5 voucher for your next visit!! 

Worth noting: This is one of the only bubble tea places I have seen in Manhattan with a bathroom."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-01-21,4.0,"I've been curious to try The Alley for a while, so dropped by when I was passing one day. Came in the early afternoon. There was no one else in the shop, which surprised me, since I knew it was fairly popular, so was expecting a wait. Maybe early afternoon is too early for boba? I drink boba at all times, though, and even without my boba-happy filters, I feel like that's definitely not the case.

The brown sugar drinks are definitely the ones that catch the eye in pictures, and next time I go, I'll order one of those. I didn't feel like anything too sugary at the moment, though, so I went with the earl grey milk tea.

The drink was good and the service was quick. No complaints there. I'll definitely be back when I'm walking the area!"
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-12-27,5.0,Absolutely love their drinks. I am not sure why they have such a low rating on yelp. we ordered #1. boba was chewy and drinks werent that sweet even though we ordered regular sweetness (I do not like sweet stuff). There are plenty of seats in the store. service was quick. will definitely come back!!
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2020-01-17,3.0,"Another popular boba chain has descended on NYC and is drawing large crowds. Their popular creme brulee brown sugar boba has a whopping 1k+ calories! Their brown sugar boba milks are decent but are not as good as Tiger Sugar. I prefer the royal milk tea here. They are extremely slow in preparing drinks, almost as slow as the day they opened. If you waited in line to order be prepared to wait even longer for your drink. The is well designed and has a very cozy ambiance with a decent amount of seats and tables."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-09-08,4.0,"Long line, as expected. If it's normally this long, the tea definitely wouldn't be worth the wait but this could be said for all bubble tea spots. The drinks come in one size and are $6 each. Kind of steep.

The best one I had was the creme brulee variety. It tasted like captain crunch cereal milk, which I like, so I didn't mind it. The tapioca is more on the chewy side (but not annoyingly so) with a hint of sweetness. 

Exterior is quite nice. Different kinds of chairs. Lighting is good enough for anyone who cares about Instagram-worthy photos. 

This is a great location for bubble tea though, with St. Marks a block away. I may go back every now and then after the crowds have fizzled out over time."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-12-29,4.0,"I ordered the little happiness, it had taro and red beans and tapioca in it with the milk, didn't have much flavor though until I got to the toppings. Overall tasted good but nothing stuck me as special, I've had better at other places. The toppings were in huge chunks though, it took a little bit to time to suck them up, would be a lot more convenient with a spoon; I don't like the fact that the sealed top is paper--I get it, it's sustainable; but it was difficult to get a straw in without spilling some out."
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-12-18,1.0,"When I ordered ""little happiness"" today, they said there was deerioca in it. The girl took about 20minutes to make my tea. And obviously she is new and not familiar with the process. It turned out she forgot to add deerioca and she decided to put extra ice in my tea. Little happiness is much sadness!

The Alley- could you train your team well before serving customers??"
208,the-alley-new-york-2,2019-10-15,3.0,"Man, I love The Alley so much, but the ones that I've been drinking for the past years in Toronto/Markham area.  I was so so excited when I saw they opened one right in St. Marks.  I figured that would be a perfect location, especially with the NYU dorms, Cooper Union and St. John's nearby.  

I got the Deerioca with creme brulee and it was a disappointment.  It tasted nothing like the ones I've drank countless times in Canada.  The bubbles were hard.  The entire cup is small enough as it is and it was 90% full of ice.  The drinks are not supposed to come this way and they certainly are not served like this in Canada.  I felt so cheated, especially since this was over $6.50 after tax per cup.  The drinks here are even more expensive than Tiger Sugar.  At least Tiger Sugar lets you customize the sweetness level.  I get why they don't let you do it here, but over $6.50 a cup after tax and a cup filled with ice?  

Something else I didn't like.  The people here are overwhelmed.  The lines don't stop and it just keeps growing.  The workers here can't manage making the bubble tea, taking orders, cleaning and also managing the lines.  

Managing the line is extremely important.  It was pure chaos because people that ordered didn't know where to stand and when new people come in to order, they didn't know where to stand either.  I don't have any affiliation with Tiger Sugar in Brooklyn, but I hope the owners here will take a look as to how Tiger Sugar manages their line.  The Tiger Sugar is like half the size and extremely narrow compared to this place.  Yet, they are very orderly.  There is someone managing the line outside, so as to not block the storefronts of the street.  There are 2 lines once you get inside.  One for ordering and one to pick up your drinks.  They even have a number system going on.  If that Tiger Sugar that is half the size of this The Alley can be orderly, I think this The Alley can also be orderly.  You don't want pure chaos walking in, which is what I walked into yesterday.  

If this location can fix their faults, they should have no problem thriving.  Fix the prices of your drinks for one.  I get it, you're in a high rent area, but that is no excuse, especially when Tiger Sugar is charging less.  Also, fix the amount of ice you put in the cup.  Never had I had a The Alley give me a cup that was 90% full of ice.  

I'll give you guys another try since I absolutely love The Alley, but I hope you listen to your constructive feedback.  You guys should also have an app like the stores in Canada.  That will keep your customers coming back.  The app is a wonderful thing and mainly why I keep going back to The Alley in Canada."
209,olives-new-york-3,2019-12-23,5.0,"Ran into this small take-out sandwich shop while strolling in Soho.
The space is small and only about 5  counter seats so it's more of a take-out place.
They have sandwiches,salads,dessert items and various beverages.
I had the Olive's hero which consisted of copacola,salami with aged provolone and olive tapenade. It was delicious with perfect proportions of ingredients on excellent crusty sourdough bread. 
The peanut butter and cowboy cookies were fantastic and tasted freshly baked. They were crispy style cookies.
The carrot cake sandwich stole the show and for only 4.50 could easily feed 2 people. It was two carrot cake cookies sandwich between cream cheese frosting. Very rich and decadent.
They serve outstanding coffee from Counter Culture roasters which is one of the best roasters in the nation.
There prices are decent considering the quality and location.
Service was cheerful and friendly.
Worth a visit for a quick bite on the go."
209,olives-new-york-3,2020-01-15,4.0,I've always been intrigued by this corner shop. It's located in the heart of Soho and the storefront looks very attractive. I tried the chocolate cranberry cookie and it was delightful. Pair it with a nice iced coffee and you are set to explore soho with fresh eyes.
209,olives-new-york-3,2018-11-05,3.0,"Stopped by here to pick up some breakfast to go. Small entrance, but more rim to sit in the back. Made my way up to the front where they have their pastries behind the glass and some more options to the right as well.

Decided on a large iced coffee ($4), Scone ($3.50), and the Granola with Yogurt+Fruit ($8). Scone is large, definitely on the dry end as the crumbs got everywhere. Yogurt cup contained mostly fruit, which was hard to balance with the granola - overall okay but probably not worth the price. Stumptown coffee is always a plus.

Fine enough option if walking by, probably would only get the coffee if I stop over again."

209,olives-new-york-3,2019-08-07,3.0,"Pretty decent grab and go sandwich spot. They have a wide variety of pre-made sandwiches stacked like pyramids under the counter. I appreciated the presentation and speediness of the employees, but the overall quality of the food was leaving much to be desired.

I ordered a chicken beast sandwich. It honestly tasted a bit like airplane food. But not bad airplane food. It was good tasting airplane food but it gave me that aeronautical texture. It was pretty hefty and had a lot of veggies and meat for the price but it was just overall very bland. The chicken was also extremely dry, but I'm not going to complain given the size, price, and speed."
209,olives-new-york-3,2018-04-26,2.0,"Bummed about the downslide on this place. Olives was always my favorite sandwich shop, by a mile. I looked forward to getting the steak sandwich, maybe also the tuna. I actually used to get two extra steak sandwiches to take back home to Cali. I haven't been in a few years and I was already surprised to see that they had moved. But.. I saw the red bench and knew I was there.
I got both the steak sandwich and the tuna. The tuna used to be more of a seared ahi than a standard tuna, but now it's just a regular tuna sandwich, and a little dry. The steak sandwich, also not as good. Not as much spice, not as juicy. 
The staff was nice, that wasn't a problem at all. Just the taste of the sandwiches wasn't what it once was. Not bad, mind you, just not memorable anymore. I left knowing that I would probably never return (cue sad music)."
209,olives-new-york-3,2019-11-27,1.0,Every time a disappointment but its convenient. Overpriced.  Totally unaccomdating.  Staff seems miserable.
209,olives-new-york-3,2019-06-15,5.0,"Sucks to see Olive's doesn't have a good rating. I love this place, been here for years - back when they were across from the Apple store. 

- Everyday breakfast sandwich is amazing 
- Any of all the lunch sandwiches are good 
- Staff is nice & I never have to wait long 
- On the expensive end compared to a few other places I go to but I'd say it's worth it 
- They occasional have daily specials which is always good & allow you to switch things up 
 - Small seating area inside & outside. When I say small I mean seats like 4 people"
209,olives-new-york-3,2017-07-20,4.0,"While walking around the colorful neighborhoods of New York, we stumbled upon Olive's. I spied the gourmet espresso machine and the old vinyl records in the window so I popped inside. This is a cute little corner coffee shop that offers food and coffee. I ordered a cappuccino and it was really tasty! Very high quality beans and perfectly frothed milk. 

There's not much seating (as is the case with most places in the city), but they have a few stools along big picture windows. If you are lucky enough to grab one, it makes for a wonderful people watching perch! 

This is the perfect spot for a quick afternoon pick-me-up coffee break."
209,olives-new-york-3,2019-08-11,5.0,I love their sandwiches here my absolute favorite is Olive's Hero. Delicious strong kick of flavors plus the copa and genoa salami taste great together. It is a bit on the pricier but I do think you get what you paid for.
209,olives-new-york-3,2019-07-02,1.0,I had food poisoning from the chicken salad sandwich today. I've really wanted to love this place because everyone's always friendly and I live in the neighborhood. But food poisoning is really not fun so... don't eat here. Unless you like living life on the edge and enjoy the risk of food poisoning.
209,olives-new-york-3,2019-09-05,4.0,"They're rude, and always take about 10 minutes for each sandwich, but damn if they don't make good food. I'd typically give a 3 but I'm in a blissful state after their breakfast sandwich"

209,olives-new-york-3,2017-01-11,2.0,"I've been here twice to pick up a quick sandwich for lunch. I didn't remember how much I liked it the first time since it was a few months ago so I decided to try it again last week. I ordered the grilled chicken on focaccia bread and was very disappointed with the sandwich overall. The bread was dry, the chicken was dry, and overall there wasn't very much flavor to the sandwich. I've never had dry focaccia bread before! If you walk in and order a sandwich, the food comes out super quick, you basically get your food by the time you finish signing your receipt which makes me think the sandwiches are most likely pre-made.

If you are in a super hurry to pick up any random sandwich to eat, then this is a place to go since they are super fast. But quality of the food is very poor and I would not recommend it if you are looking for a decent sandwich for lunch."

209,olives-new-york-3,2017-08-31,2.0,"Wanted a salad, and found Olive's in the food desert of SoHo. It's a small and casual takeout place. I got the smaller spinach salad, which had chickpeas and cheese, and I added chicken to it, which turned out to be an extra $6 for a few strips. Soooo overpriced. Not cool guys. It was a good salad, but not worth $16 total."
209,olives-new-york-3,2017-10-13,3.0,"Hypes:
- cute little sandwich shop in soho where the locals and people working come and grab a bite to eat on their lunch break. 
- A good variety of sandwiches, but standard. Nothing wow'ed me. 
- lunch special - not a bad deal for half a sandwich, a drink, and a cookie - but 12 bucks should give me a whole sandwich...no?
- I had the chicken sandwich - it was healthy, not overly heavy, easy to eat, and had good flava
- cookies- chocolate chip is good, but their peanut butter cup one is amazing!

Gripes:
- A little pricey for a sandwich that doesnt stand out 
- I really wanted salt and vinegar chips but all they had were plain, bbq, and jalepeno"
209,olives-new-york-3,2018-07-17,3.0,I had an iced tea.  It was good.  The place was a bit meh.  Coffee and tea shops usually have working wifi and cater to those who just want to get away from everything.  I'm usually all about the non-Sbux in any neighborhood.  But I'll go to another coffee shop next time.
209,olives-new-york-3,2018-06-07,4.0,"Olive's is a quaint corner coffee shop blending in with the streets of SoHo. They have coffee drinks, prepared foods, baked goods, and some hot foods to order. The coffee was great! The lemon cake was also great, with a smooth texture and the right amount of brightness from the lemon. The inside is small, with very limited seating. There is a counter to sit at with the windows open, which is perfect for crisp mornings like today. Pricey for coffee."
209,olives-new-york-3,2017-02-15,3.0,"Olives is a cool early morning sandwich shop that has a really yummy avocado toast. 

I come here often when I am in the city because of the closeness and convenience to the apartment I stay at on Prince. However, I don't think their prices justify their food on the menu."
209,olives-new-york-3,2017-05-10,4.0,"Delicious, nutritious, and overwhelmingly fast food. This is what fast food should be and why places like McDonald's are shaping up and expanding their flavor palate.  The grilled marinated chicken sandwich was perfectly balanced and along with the foccacia bread made for a wonderful hump day lunch."

209,olives-new-york-3,2018-11-01,1.0,The staff is not very friendly and it is laughably overpriced. I asked to add turkey to my sandwich and it was an extra $10?! yikes.
209,olives-new-york-3,2019-07-05,5.0,Everything they make is made in house. That's what gives this place a solid niche in my tummy and the west village. Love this place.

Really confused by Olive's. They seem to open & close locations in the SoHo area at a great clip, and not maintain their website or Yelp presence accordingly (I marked 3 listings closed just before writing this). I passed this one the day it opened (not realizing that because they have another location just up Prince), but didn't drop in, then tried finding it on Yelp with no luck (just the 120 Prince location), so on my return visit, they informed me of a promo with the 120 Prince predecessor (which is still open), where a $10 purchase at that one gets you a free cookie and/or coffee at this one just across Prince. I wasn't really into that, so I just made some conversation with the friendly staff and scored a small chocolate chip cookie that they'd made specifically for the promo. It was decent for $1.63, bbut definitely didn't convince me to try other offerings."

209,olives-new-york-3,2018-08-09,2.0,"I used to come to Olive's often since I work in the area, but after today, I don't think I'd come back.

I usually like to get their turkey club.  Today I asked if I could swap the bacon + tomato for avocado instead.  They still charged me for adding avocado...even though I took off bacon and tomato!?!  I asked the cashier about it and her reply was, ""I don't make the rules.""  So I basically just paid $12.75 for bread, turkey, lettuce, and avocado.  Adding a drink and chips my total was $18 and change.  

There are soooo many other options for lunch nearby, it's an easy to choice to never come to the over-priced Olive's again.  Pass."
209,olives-new-york-3,2017-07-20,4.0,"Here's the deal:

The Owner(forgot his name!) is one of the kindest souls I ever encountered. He whipped me up a HUGE sandwich since it was my first time coming. There are literally a million different combinations in terms of what you have for options to eat here (including Vegetarian). Everything tasted very fresh and flavorful (which confirms a lot of previous reviews). For some, this may seem pricey for a bite (which does have some merit) but my experience and pleasant surprise makes it all worth the while. 

In short, their sandwiches are spectacular. Their kind owner is generous and full of energy. The price is a bit on the higher end. 

Overall I recommend stopping by this place for a quick bite - not necessary to go out of your way to visit."
209,olives-new-york-3,2018-06-26,4.0,"Hard to beat if you're in a pinch in the area, both in terms of quality, and price. It's by no means cheap, but it's also by no means a run of the mill sandwich. The staff is real good at moving people thru without being rude, which is a true skill and does not go unnoticed by these eyes. Also, this might be the low key best breakfast sandwich in New York! 8O"
209,olives-new-york-3,2016-03-30,4.0,"Olive's never disappoints.

I hold a special place in my heart for Avotoast, and I'm always looking for new and exciting takes on the delicacy. Olive's sprinkles some Feta on each of the corners of the 7-Grain Bread and adds roasted tomatoes in the middle with some Chia Seeds throughout. The initial bite into this beautiful creation was flavorful and filled with hits of fresh lemon. I'm not particularly a citrus kind of person, but this truly enhanced the overall flavor. 

I generally bring my breakfast to work, but if your an Avotoast lover - add this to your bucketlist."
209,olives-new-york-3,2016-08-23,2.0,"It's a good place for a quick lunch or a salad. They aren't bad, they just are pricey for nothing special. I've had a few of their soups, a couple of the salads over lunch breaks, but really, they don't have a lot in the way of gluten free options. Additionally, their staff is a bit rude, even when during the times where there was no one in the store. 

If you have better options, go there."
209,olives-new-york-3,2018-02-03,4.0,"Love their mozzarella, basil and peppers sandwich! A really cute little spot for sandwiches and salads and beverages. I love the martinelli apple cider and I love how they have the tiny glass bottle version! This is my place to grab a bite before I get my nails done right down the block."
209,olives-new-york-3,2014-04-30,4.0,"In a rush I stopped in today to pick up a salad and my eye was drawn to the beautiful tomatoes in the  special Olive's Little Bites: Joe's Mozzarella, Red and Yellow Beefsteak Tomatoes, Fusilli Pesto, Roasted Vegetables, Mixed Greens, and Parmesan Crostini with Balsamic-Shallot Vinaigrette.  When the counter person rang me up and it was $15.50 + tax I almost told her she could keep the damn salad.  I'm glad I didn't, because this salad is absolutely wonderful and worth every penny.  The salad is massive and could easily serve for two meals.  All the components were great and well portioned; I especially liked the little bit of pesto pasta in the salad.  The only component which wasn't fantastic was the mozzarella, which is the same mozzarella they use in their sandwiches and I think is subpar."
209,olives-new-york-3,2012-02-21,4.0,"Let me just start off by saying - if you are looking to be lazy and order up some serious lunch delivery, look no further than Olive's. Especially if you work in the following neighborhoods:

Anywhere in (the)...
- West Village
- South Village
- Greenwich Village
- SoHo
- NoHo
- NoLita
- Little Italy

Most of (the)...
- Meatpacking District
- Chinatown
- TriBeCa

Some of the...
- East Village (sans Alphabet City)
- Lower East Side

Seriously. Count 'em - twelve hoods! The net they've cast over this huge chunk of Below-14th-St.-Manhattan (see photo) might just be the most expansive delivery jurisdiction for a tiny-ass sandwich place I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of sandwich places. Not to mention, their website is especially easy to navigate if you'd prefer to place an order online. Which also means you don't need to call and talk to anyone, a plus if you generally despise people.

Honestly, once I discovered their delivery prowess, I simply stopped visiting Olive's in person. Sure, it's quaint and cute and country-kitchen-esque on the inside, but it's also cramped as hell come mealtime.

Anyway, now that I've fully convinced you where to order lunch from today, let me give offer you a few sandwich suggestions.

The Ancho Chili Rubbed Steak is not for the faint of heart. Now, it ain't some sloppy sammy the size of your arm (um, but those can be delicious, too, please). Even when you start to unwrap it from the bag, it appears to be half the size of what you thought it was once that last layer of paper's been peeled back. But I warn you - do not underestimate this one due to its small, compact stature. With grilled onions tucked between tightly packed, thinly sliced, peppery steak and oozing jalapeno jack cheese and chipotle mayo, all on a white baguette perfect for palming, this one packs quite the punch. Think of it as the Manny Pacquiao of sandwiches. It'll knock you out before you know what hit you. And then win a Congressional election in the Philippines. This is just how the world of sandwiches (and boxing) works.

Although not quite the indulgent affair of the Ancho-sammy, the Grilled Marinated Chicken Breast is just as delicious. A hearty square of rosemary focaccia, gripping tender slices of anti-biotic and hormone-free chicken covered in that same chipotle mayo and a super fresh tomato, this number can sneak up on you all its own. Except this one's a little more seductive and Spanish about it, more like Don Flamenco from the original NES Punch-Out! than Manny. It'll be easier if you just pretend you know what I'm talkin' about.

Post-Thanksgiving (and other random days throughout the year), Olive's also offers a special sandwich with roasted turkey, gravy, and cranberry sauce. Now it's recommended all the same, however, sadly, I don't have a boxer (real-life or fictional) to assign to this one. It's Thanksgiving-themed. It's not gettin' in a ring of any kind. It's passing out on the couch with its jeans unzipped.

OK, so let's recap. I've decided on your lunch for three workdays out of five, pending specials, (not to mention, providing delightful boxer analogies along the way) and I've managed to find out how you can sit on your ass and not talk to anyone and still have food delivered to you (with good odds your 'hood is covered). Seriously, what else do you want from me? Go order yourself an Olive's sandwich already!"
209,olives-new-york-3,2018-01-22,5.0,"Quality and price is high but you do get what you pay for.  If you want better than average, it's worth it.  Very busy and convenient fast moving line for take out or sit at small counter for inspired tasty lunches and quality coffee.  Interesting fact: David Bowie was a regular at their previous location."
209,olives-new-york-3,2018-04-25,1.0,I have used this place for several years because the food is decent and it's convenient to where I work but I'm finally throwing in the towel. The folks who answer the phone and manage the place are downright rude.  There is no customer service whatsoever and I feel bad for the delivery guys as I've seen the way they are spoke to when I've visited the store.  The owners and managers of this place just don't seem to care about the culture they have created for both customers and employees.
209,olives-new-york-3,2014-12-09,3.0,"i have a bit of a love-hate relationship with Olive's. 
I love them because...THEY HAVE STUMPTOWN. 
I hate them because...they charge so much more for the Stumptown. A ""large"" here costs more than the actual large at Stumptown. 

I've been spoiled by working 2 avenues away from Stumptown for months and now that I'm not there anymore, I go through mornings where I just NEED a good cup of coffee (none of that Green Mountain KCup stuff!). Until I can get my fix somewhere else in the Soho area, Olive's it is."

True to the brand, the cappuccino and the almond butter toast were both excellent and served promptly."

My friend and I were looking at the glass window and I am sure we were just lucky that one of the people working heard us talk about wanting to try their pastries gave us what we wanted for free! I got the scones and they were delicious. She did mention that some of these pastries will just be discarded in the trash. How sweet of her regardless!

I am a big fan of their matcha latte and the little latte art that comes with it. I definitely like the seating area in this location as well. It is a great place to meet with a friend and talk over coffee. I also love their app and the random rewards.

Will come back!"

Will be definitely ordering again soon!!"
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2019-10-28,4.0,"I really enjoyed my lunch. Avocado toast ($8) and almond butter toast ($3). Really liked the thick wheat toasted bread. Great prices for location and quality, especially compared to the bluestone lane traditional cafes. This location is counter service, so no need to leave a tip. 
However, giving it 4 stars because they completely forgot to bring my friend her food. After waiting a few minutes after my food had arrived, she had to get up and ask the staff. Apparently there was a computer glitch so her order didn't go through. She had to repay and wait 10 more minutes. The cafe wasn't that busy, so I feel that the staff should've remembered her order. Or at least given her the food for free."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2019-08-01,4.0,"I actually had a sour impression of Bluestone Lane when I first tried it, as I shared some of my fiancé's matcha latte, and it was awful! It was so bitter and somewhat expensive! Bluestone Lane seemed like a waste of my time. 

But then I ended up coming here to wait for my fiancé to leave work. As I was getting hungry, I ended up ordering the salmon on wholegrain bread. The staff was friendly to me, and they brought out the salmon on toast in about 5 minutes. It cost about $9, and given Bluestone Lane's higher prices, this didn't seem too bad to me.

I tried the salmon toast, and it tasted great! The cream cheese and dill paired well with the fresh salmon. The toast was a bit too toasted for me, so some of the sides were a bit burnt. Overall a great dish!

I am glad I came back to Bluestone Lane, as I have more hope for this establishment. I would love to come back here for some quick salmon and toast again!"
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2020-05-05,3.0,The coffee was prepared very nicely but it wasn't my favorite blend. Personally for my tastes of coffee I don't think I clicked with this place as much as I wished I could. Overall the inside is very small so it's not typically a sit down place however my drink was out in no time and the staff was extremely nice.
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2019-09-18,4.0,"I'm a basic Californian who misses her avocado toast, so of course I stopped by Bluestone Lane in between my classes to grab a quick bite with a friend. For $8, the toast is quite expensive, but I have to say that it's VERY delicious. The avocado is chunky and has a light lemony taste, and with the red pepper and olive oil drizzle it is amazing. Not sure if I'll be back only because it's on the more expensive side, but pro tip: download their app to get $5 off your first purchase with the app. 

Also nice that the astor location has large windows, perfect for people watching. Would recommend if you need a quick pick-me-up."

210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2020-01-26,2.0,Blue stone lane has good quality creamers. The customer service here sucks though. The barista was really rude in his demeanor. Really ruins an experience!
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2018-07-07,4.0,"A great spot for high quality coffee and a wide variety of breakfast/snack pairings. They have a good selection of beans, from your standard espresso bean to an Ethiopian single origin coffee. They also have different snacks, including toasts, bowls, and sweets.

I tried the Chai Latte and Ricotta Berry Toast for breakfast, and boy did it hit the spot! The Chai Latte was sweet and delicious. Unlike cheaper, low quality Chai Latte, the one served here did not leave a funny aftertaste. The Ricotta Berry Toast sounded a little strange, but tasted amazing! The toast was thick and chewy, the berry jam was perfectly sweet with chunks of berry, and the ricotta was simply delicious. Combined, these created a filling semi-sweet breakfast.

Skip the Starbucks and come to Bluestone Lane for higher quality coffee and food the next time you find yourself in New York."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2019-03-11,5.0,"I had not had a decent coffee in weeks. Prior to my New York trip, I was in Mexico, where we only had filter coffee, which is fine, but I was really missing a flat white or cappuccino like I would have at home. Luckily, I found Bluestone Lane! 

This coffee shop is Australian-owned, with several branches around New York City. I enjoyed a delicious cappuccino from the branch by Astor Place Station which re-fueled me for a long day of sightseeing. The coffee was great, and reminded me of home. They also have free Wi-Fi - bonus."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2020-02-20,1.0,I ordered a keto bowl and the avocado is black and bad. It tastes gross. This might be a one time thing but blue stone lane should be consistent.
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2018-05-25,3.0,"Wanted to really like this place but it's just okay to me. Would give 3.5 stars if I could. Good coffee and overpriced avocado toast.

The location is very convenient. Its on Astor place and close to a lot of work places and big stores and it is also right next to the 6 train. 
The place itself is big and pretty spacious and the design is very minimalist and beachy fresh I would say. A modern surf vibe. You can come here to do work. 

I came here 3 times and every time it took a very long time to make coffee even though there was no line. The latte and cappuccino were good, but the assie iced latte was not, in my opinion. Its like an affogato, but larger. Even with the amount of ice cream they put inside, it was too bitter and heavy to drink. I do think generally the quality of coffee there is better than other places. Its worth coming here for the coffee. 

As for the food; I love a good avocado toast (I eat one every day) and I think it's hard to make one taste bad, but $8 for just bread and avocado is very over priced. Each topping would be at least $3 more. The avocado toasts taste good, but they are not exceptional or special to pay so much for it. The packaging is very nice."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2020-02-20,2.0,"This place used to be my absolute favorite spot to get coffee and good quality bites! 

However in the last few weeks the whole staff has been switched, and the quality of everything has been severely downgraded. Some of the breakfast foods are being made improperly and taste bad - like the chia seed one I had yesterday, the chia seeds were dry??? And someone forgot to add any kind of flavor? Plus the drip coffee has been weaker than it used to be. 

I get that there's a learning curve but good god the quality has SUFFERED."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2018-11-18,5.0,"This place has strong coffee. That's all I really have to say, but that's important. Y'all need to know that this coffee will have you wired. For a long time. It was my first time trying Australian coffee. Didn't expect it to keep me up for 17 days. But it did. And yet I have no regrets. Clean space. Fast and friendly service. And strong coffee. Enjoy!"

Space is limited!
Music is too loud.
Toasts are way overpriced! Little kids could make them... a piece of toast and a few slices of banana... are you serious?"

Bluestone lane coffee is one of my favorites in the city. The espresso used is so smooth and creamy on its own, which gives it a very unique flavor profile. My one caveat about bluestone lane is that their coffee is quite expensive, which makes coffee from here a 'treat yourself' treat for me. This particular location is very spacious with long bar height tables! I can easily see people coming in with their laptop to get work done, or a casual place to catch up with friends. They sell gluten free pastries here, which is different from the 47th and Madison location. The staff here is very friendly - their processing system was down and I had to wait about 10 minutes before I was able to be charged and the barista gave me a complimentary banana bread - it was delicious by the way."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2019-07-28,3.0,This location is insufferably slow and rarely gets the order right. I get the banana toast which is great when it hasn't been burnt to a crisp. At $8 you would at least expect it not to be burnt.
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2018-12-15,4.0,"More like 3.5 stars if I could give a half star. 
One strike because it's a little bit overpriced. But most importantly, there was a piece of hair in a cup of yogurt I was about to purchase. I'm glad I found it before buying or eating it. I was kind of turned off by it so decided not to get it but I still thought it was important to bring it up and told the cashier. She was very apologetic and offered me a new cup of yogurt for free, but I declined. Then she charged me a price for small for my medium coffee. That was very nice of her. And I understand that stuff like this happens but the staff was attentive and apologetic (I've seen a lot of restaurants/cafes that are so not apologetic!). And I could see that the staff behind the counter were all wearing gloves and hair nets, so hopefully, this was just one of those shit-happen moments."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2019-03-13,4.0,"A solid coffee choice in Astor Place w/generally ample seating (important in Manhattan where there often isn't, unfortunately!). Strong coffee for when you need a little caffeine boost, and very conveniently located off the 6 train for quick meetings in case you need to hop on the train elsewhere."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2019-03-27,4.0,Great place to relax and have yourself a flat white ( large with oat milk please)!   The Aussies have invaded and redefined the coffee game.   This located has a limited amount of space so be sure to get here early and get yourself a flat white with avocado toast!
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2020-01-25,3.0,"I come to this locations a few times before making a fair review. The atmosphere is by far one of the best among all there location, from design to be hands off and nice clientele. All their locations are clean, 4 stars for atmosphere. Drinks are so-so since we have so many options in NYC. Lattes are is what I suggest, all there other drinks are too weak for my liking. Customer service is also what bought down the stars. Maybe I am not cool or as jaded of a New Yorker as I feel. Staff memebers are not rude, they just not very in touch or friendly. They always acting like either they are being interrupted when ordering, rushing to take an order and not willing to go any extra miles or communicate. On this note some other locations are better. However while sitting there; they don't hurry off patrons or make you feel unwelcome or uncomfortable. Do I recommend this cafe in this area? Yes, one of the better ones but I also want to be honest on what to expect. Can't go around giving 4 stars or those establishments won't be worth its weight. Has potential because the owners are huge on charity giving and that says a lot about a business ethics. Five is like mind blowing, and a place you would want take a 13 hr plane ride to revisit."

210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2017-07-01,4.0,"You could say Bluestone Lane blue me away, but for a chain coffeeshop. There are multiple locations across the city and the company describes itself as Melbourne, Australia-style and having never been there I have zero clue what that means. The multiple times I've been to Bluestone Lane I've been impressed with the quality of the coffee and treats. 

Drink-wise I've had the cold brew and a flat white, both of which were solid. The flat white was super tasty. I personally prefer flat whites since there's more espresso and they tend to be harder to find. I've also tried their gluten-free zucchini bread and the avocado toast. The toast was okay; the bread was kind of dense and the avocado unexciting, but it satisfied my avocado craving. The zucchini bread was nice; I would recommend it, but not as a come here to get it type of deal. 

The store itself is truly stunning. There's long marbled tables with cacti terrariums in the center and the prime location right at Astor place makes Bluestone Lane a convenient and satisfying coffee break."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2017-04-13,4.0,"I'm so happy about this new addition to Astor place! It's nice to have options other than just Starbucks in the area. This location has a beautiful, inviting set-up with plenty of high top seating. 

I ordered the avocado smash ($8) and a small latte. The avocado toast was beautifully presented. However, the avocado smash was pre-made in a tub, which was kind of a turn off, although expected. I wish they had options to add on prosciutto or some sort of protein though! I wouldn't have minded paying a bit extra for a more filling breakfast. However, I also don't know if I would order it again.  They do have some interesting lattes (beet, tumeric, etc) that I would love to try at some point!  

I didn't notice a bathroom facility or wifi, but I found that most patrons stopped by on their way to work and no one really hung around for too long."

For the amount of food you get, the quality isn't high enough to justify prices. 

Mediterranean bowl: good but very basic, bowl of spinach with some toppings, seemed like it was made in someone's kitchen rather than sit down restaurant

Toasties are good, but small for $8"

This is the second Bluestone Lane I've been to, but I usually grab coffee to go. This time, I had a couple of hours to spare so I brought a book with me. This isn't a place I would want to do work in since it doesn't seem to have wifi, but there is plenty of natural light, making it a good reading spot. 

I ordered an iced latte. It wasn't bad, wasn't great either. Espresso-to-milk ratio was a little off and it tasted more like milk. Also ordered the avocado toast, which was simple and filling. The lemon juice, olive oil, and chili flakes added some flavor to an otherwise bland meal. They have a selection of toppings you can add to your meal if you want something extra. 

Servers and baristas are friendly and service was quite fast despite it being busy. Items on the menu are expensive for small portions."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2017-02-16,4.0,"This place is adorable, I'm so glad I came!
I love scoping out cute brunch places and this was definitely bookmarked for a visit.

I was really impressed with the service because I feel like in a place like NYC, even the quaint restaurants can be rude, but the server was really patient with me and my friends. We took forever to decide and drank tons of water because we were really hungover (lol)

Greenhead with a side of salmon: I got this and it was really good! The more I ate, the more bland...(?) it got. I really couldn't finish it because something about it was just too salty and the vegetables inside just got soggy and blegh. But if you're a fast eater, then go for it. I highly recommend getting something on the side like the salmon or bacon to help you finish the dish because the thing itself just has too much veggies (i'm a meat lover). the toast that it came with was really hard so I only took a couple bites and gave up because i don't like to abuse my teeth like that, but the center is definitely softer...

My friend got some kind of toast with salmon and avocado and that was definitely better! toast was still hard and chewy af but it didn't get bad the more you ate it. it was more refreshing with every bite!

the atmosphere was great, there was more seating than i had expected, but it still is definitely a bit cramped so I don't know if i would recommend parties larger than 4 at a time.

also they had no ketchup and it made me sad."
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2018-02-18,4.0,Avocado toast and all of their lattes are great! Very cute place and their baked goods always hit the spot. This is a favorite to go to when grabbing a quick bite with a friend or catching up (since you can linger around drinking teas and coffee).
210,bluestone-lane-new-york-9,2016-09-09,5.0,"What a beautiful, well-lite coffee spot! This new location of Bluestone Lane is my favorite so far in New York City. I was pretty shocked but delighted to see them open here in the East Village. By far, this is their biggest establishment in New York City and beautifully designed.

Cold Brew is my go-to drink at any coffee shop. It is amazing here! I drink all my coffee purely black except for some days I crave for the Flat White or Cappuccino. I tend to really like strong, bold flavors in coffee and this place was just spot on for my taste.

Food items that I usually get here are their Avocado Smash Toast and baked goods such as their softest Matcha Chocolate Chip cookies. Whether you are looking for a light meal or a snack, the Avocado Smash Toast is the way to go. Multigrain toast topped with a generous spread of smashed avocado topped with red pepper flakes, olive oil, and lemon juice. I add the cherry tomato topping at times and it never disappoints. Matcha Chocolate Chip; matcha powder and chocolate works great with one another - that bitter-sweetness tug of war in your tastebuds, yum! 

Overall, I love the design of the coffee shop and the wonderful products that they produce here. Great place for sipping coffee while catching up with friends!"

I saw they had hot milo notes on their menu so I inquired if it were really nestle's milo.  Turns out it was ovaltine so I passed.  Instead I got the Magic,  espresso with a double shot in 6 oz cup, a cappuccino for my friend and two croissants.  The croissants were sort of fresh but not warm....should've asked them to warm them.  The drinks were pretty with foam hearts but it took them forever to make.  Considering I was rushing to leave,  I didn't have an extra 15 mins to wait for my order.  But I did.  The drink was good but I'm actually tired...don't know what kind of shot that was.  Starbucks they're not."

One of my fave Boba shops in the whole country, and one of NYC's finest. Might be my fave shop in Manhattan for Boba - and definitely up there, both for consistency of excellent product, and lovely service.

Now that I've been to all of them, this is still my fave Moge location in New York City with some of the best service. Sadly, my favourite girl doesn't work here anymore, and had kind of an acrimonious departure for that matter, but they still make wonderful drinks and are willing to go off menu which is great - black tea instead of green, no upcharge as some Moge locations do (looking at you Long Island City), and no flat out refusal (looking at you Chinatown and Flushing).

The decor is spectacular and some of my fave in Manhattan, and Barbie loved it as her first ever experience of Moge, so this is the Moge I would come to when trying to introduce someone to the brand, and when in Manhattan, and will continue to come here, because it's just excellent and all the drinks are wonderful.

All in all, it's a truly amazing Moge, so much so that I came twice while I was here most recently. I like it significantly better than the ones in both Chinatown Manhattan, Midtown Manhattan, Long Island City, and Flushing's Chinatown Queens. Service and drinks are spectacular and without the questionable attitude that several the other Moge locations have.

Now I hope you all listen to me and try it, or at least moge of you anyway.

211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2019-07-17,4.0,"Came here after bbq at gyukaku as it was the closest location for boba!

It wasn't super packed when I went in which was great! A lot of the tables had little pieces of trash like tissues/wrappers/drips of drinks on it so they're not the greatest at keeping their tables clean.

I got a  medium matcha with cheese foam and bubbles- no ice. Price came out to be a little under $7 :/// pricyyyyyy

Even though the price was a little steep, I really enjoyed the drink! It came out super quickly- the cheese foam was sweet and slightly salty and cheesy, matcha was nice and creamy with good matcha flavor. The bubbles were nice and chewy.

I probably would not come again - as I could get similar boba right down the street at st.marks. Doesnt mean they have bad bubble tea- just that you could get the same thing elsewhere for cheaper:)"

It was scorching hot today, so I decided to stop in before the movie to grab a refresher - I desperately needed something iced and fruity to cool me off, and would much rather have a fruit tea than an overpriced soda @ the theater. 

I decided on the sharing cup / ""half & half"" to try two flavors - green tea and the fresh strawberry tea, with regular ice & sugar. The strawberry tea was a little bit of a slush and a little too sweet for me but the green tea was so fresh and delicious. Even though the drinks are a bit pricey as others have mentioned, I'd love to come back to try the milk shakes / milk teas!!"
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2019-10-28,5.0,"I like this Moge the most out of all the branches I've visited in Manhattan, Flushing and Brooklyn - It's larger with open floor plan - lots of booth seating, outlets for your laptop devices at each table and free wifi. Staff are nice and friendly. Moge franchise in general is one my top 3 boba spots I've ever had in the whole world! That says alot because I go to Taiwan a lot. 

My favorite drinks to order with all fresh fruit:
*strawberry green tea (75% sugar is v sweet)
*Black grape green tea (50- 75% sugar) 
*Watermelon oolong (100% sugar cause oolong is bitter) 

***PS ~ download the ritual phone app to get $5 off your first boba order and each time you re-order you get bonus points*** 

I frequently visit because this branch is so central to everything. It's in prime East Village, close to Washington Square Park and essential errand runs like CVS and Walgreens. It's also right next to 2 train station stops so it's convenient to visit :) They also have some small bites like savory jian bing , tiramisu, asian pancake etc

The only downside is there is no membership stamp card for loyal return clients like me - and there are no restrooms smh. Seems a lot of places in NY don't have but it's very inconvenient after drinking a big cup of tea lol - just hop over to the closest Starbucks at Astor place"
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2019-04-14,2.0,"It's a quiet, open shop with a lot of space between little chairs and tables.

The bubble tea here is known for the ""dirty"" of the sugar, caramelized around the bobba and slathered around the bottom of the cup as a sticky syrup. I tried the A4, Black Sugar Milk Tea and also tried the A4 Black Sugar Milk Shake (only milk), they use organic whole milk from Whole Foods, and the flavor is great for those who love caramel, for me I'll stick with other bubble teas.

And yes, it is more expensive than some of the shops down St. Marks - $5.89 + tax for one medium-sized drink. Will have to try the Flushing version (slightly cheaper) when I get out there."
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2019-10-08,2.0,"I'm going through sort of a revival with bubble tea. I used to drink it all the time back in college, when I got to the point of not being able to eat a meal without having bubble tea on the side (yup, super healthy), and then, to no one's surprise, fell so completely out of love with it that I didn't start drinking it until almost five years later.  Now the pendulum has swung back in the opposite direction and I'm working my way through all the many bubble tea shops in the East Village. 

I really liked the pineapple tea with boba and lychee jelly, though the syrup didn't manage to penetrate the bottom layer of slush and it was a little more expensive than the other bubble tea places on the same block. The cashier gave me a much appreciated heads-up that the drink would be super cold for early fall, in case I wanted to change my mind and order something else. Also, lots of seating and outlets, as well as some baked goods and Asian snacks if you're not feeling up for boba. 

But, why for the love of God do you not have a bathroom for customers? The product is liquids, for crying out loud! Maybe they don't want to incentivize people staying around for hours on end but I got about halfway through my drink and started itching to go somewhere else that did offer a bathroom. I didn't even realize a place could just ... not have a bathroom (is this really a thing? I get only having a bathroom for patrons but this is really the first time I've come across an employees-only one). I can't on principle rate Moge any higher because of this glaring omission."

Moge Tee offers all the drinks currently trending right now, such as Brown Sugar Milk Tea and Cheese Foam tops. I ordered myself the Taro Milk Shake ($5.99) 

A $6 drink is hella expensive, with their drinks all falling around that range too. Nonetheless, the drinks here are pretty good! 

The drinks came in cute round cups or tall sturdy cups. I wasn't too big a fan of my taro drink, but it did offer pieces of taro in there! It simply tasted like milk with taro bits and bubbles in it. 

I was actually surprised by the classic milk tea my friend ordered! The drink was really sweet but I definitely was a fan of their creamy tea taste!

Overall, cute, comfy spot to hang and take photos by that floral wall. I would go back if I don't mind paying $6 for a drink again!"
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2019-08-01,4.0,I got the boba milk tea for $5.72 and it tasted alright. The cup was nice and the straw but the drink was pretty average. The boba is a bit weird though.

If you are ordering the taro milk tea I would tell you to only expect the pieces of taro and no added artificial flavors. During the majority of my drinking experience, I HATED the bits of taro and plain milk and I told myself that I'm never coming again. However, in my last 5 sips, I finally began to appreciate it. I don't think many people will have this instant change in liking this but I just wanted to let you all know that the taro milk tea they give is not what other places give.

My friends ordered the fruity drinks with the cheese foam and the size of their drink was huge and they seemed to like it but it took them a while to finish it."

I got cold cheese tea with peachy oolong base, less sugar and cold (奶盖桃子乌龙，微糖，冷，去冰）The drink is great: The cheese foam itself is thick and creamy, and the tea tastes good as well - not too bitter, not too sweet, not too watery. I like it more than gong cha or coco. Beside drinks, mogetea also serves some pastries, such as taro cake, etc. 

The main customer group here is NYU students."

I ordered the foam uji matcha and let me tell you... this was delicious! The matcha alone would've been really good, but the cheese foam really added to it. I ordered it because it looked good in the picture. I would highly recommend this.

There are plenty of other options, kind of limited on the milk tea side if that's your thing. I'm definitely a milk tea person."
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2018-12-19,5.0,"As someone who has grown up in NorCal/Bay Area (if you've been there you would know that every two blocks and every asian plaza will have at least one to two boba spots) to countless Boba Milk Tea spots and a solid number of joints in the Big Apple, I think it is safe to say that I have boba/bubble in my blood. Moge tee is easily tops my list as one of the best Milk Tea joints in New York. 

The original location is in Flushing which great and priced a little lower, but very understandable being that you are in the city and everything is priced higher in it. This is their newest location within the city, the other being on Canal and one in Brooklyn. I came here with a group of people which become a little difficult to house when there is a lack of chairs besides the benches against the wall. 

One of the things I care a lot about is the flavor and use of ingredients with milk tea. I like to taste the flavor of the actual tea when brewed. When the milk tea has too much milk or sweetener in the drink I tend to leave feeling a little disappointed because I want to taste the flavor of the tea which is why you initially choose between Green, Black, Oolong, Pu-er, Jasmine, Matcha etc. With that said, I really like how Moge Tee cooks their boba/bubble. 

I have definitely be recommending Moge Tee to all of my boba/bubble loving friends and I think it is safe to say they are hooked."

There was too much ice. I should've gone back and told them to remake it, because I didn't pay $7.61 for a pricy long cup of ice milk with papaya bits that were blended poorly. I feel as if it were laziness on whoever made my beverage part. I wanted a nice, creamy and frothy papaya milkshake. The only reason I'm giving this place an extra star is because of the good customer service and the matcha and milk tea drinks in general are good. Other than that, I was pissed by how shitty my Papaya Milk Shake turned out."

They're known for their cheese foam drinks, but I'm personally not a fan. It was too creamy and heavy and made the cold tea lukewarm, taking away the refreshing taste I wanted. I definitely recommend getting the fruit drinks; I think they're better than the milk based ones. I got the peach oolong tea and the tea itself without the foam was delicious.

Not a lot of seats so think again before bringing a large group."

I will come back to give traditional brown sugar a try."
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2020-05-16,5.0,"They're currently under new management!!

The avocado is subtle but the real game changer is a slight pear flavor which I saw they add a little bit of the actual fruit into. Also, it's smooth, creamy and rich. Also, the black tea doesn't taste like regular ol' black tea. It definitely was a mix of I'm guessing Ceylon and Nilgiri."
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2018-12-13,4.0,"CUSTOMER SERVICE: I thought the staff was okay.. Not very welcoming or with positive greetings. I'm not for sure if they were under-staffed the day me and my friends came in, but we wait for our drinks for quite a while.

I ordered the Cheese Rose Oolong Tea. And I gotta say the tea is very distinct, not too overpowering, and the cheese along with it puts a extra twist to the drink. 

I would recommend this place! There is a wide selection of drinks to choose from, which I want to try more of their flavored drinks!"
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2018-11-30,4.0,"I've been a fan of Moge Tee since their initial Flushing location's soft opening.  I've brought everyone I know to the Flushing location to have their black grape tea.

I was surprised when I was walking around the St. Marks area and ran into this new Moge Tee in the heart of the East Village.  It's a really clean and modern location, but you'll pay a bit extra for the location.  You're looking at drinks past the $6 mark.

I went with my usual fresh black grape tea since I wanted to compare to Flushing.  Just like with the Chinatown location, the color of the tea was quite a bit lighter than what the Flushing location serves.  They seem to use fewer grapes here.  It's a light purple instead of the aggressive purple color you get in Flushing.  The taste is still pretty good, but definitely not as grape-y as in Flushing.  I'm glad this location had the seedless grapes unlike the Chinatown location.

When I was there, they were out of boba, so I wasn't able to try it.  I assume they just ran out and had another batch going, but I didn't have time to wait.

Overall, it's definitely good enough to satisfy the craving, although it's not quite as good as the original Flushing location."

Ordered Super Fruit Green Tea, taste like detox juice, I customized less ice and 50% sweetness, no strawberries. Not my taste of fruit tea. Too bland for me. Next time I will try super fruit four season Oolong tea, add more passion fruit syrup, remove watermelon and strawberries."
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2019-05-31,4.0,"Moge is one of my favorite boba shops in NY! Bay Area has way better boba in my opinion though, but Moge will have to do for now!

The purple yam milk tea is delicious! They use a purple yam paste that can be a bit thick, but I love purple yam so I loved it! I was a little worried since you can't customize the sweetness of this drink, but it was the perfect amount of sweetness! The boba were nice and chewy. However, the drink was over $6 which is quite steep for a boba...I remember back in the day when boba was $2.50! 

This location has quite a lot of seating. It is a little odd that they only have bench seating on one side of all their tables though, so you can't sit across from your friend, you can only sit next to them....

They provide free WiFi but it is not a great place to work since they blast hip hop music...this is definitely more of a grab and go place."
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2018-10-21,5.0,"This place is a gem and I wish it had opened while I was still in college! 

They have an amazing selection of cold and hot drinks (from teas, to lattes, to shakes). You can adjust your sweetness level too. 

What I really love is that they have the cheese foam! It's not as weird as it sounds - def try it, it plays on both the sweet AND salty side. Worst case you can scoop out the whip and enjoy the rest of your drink. 

The girl at the register was super sweet and happy to explain anything on the menu, as well as her recommendations. 

The space here is also quite big (especially for a spot in St Marks) and they have plenty of seats. Decor is also cute!"
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2018-11-03,4.0,"Stumbled upon this place after walking around St.Marks. Did a quick Yelp search and found out that they've recently opened and have locations in Flushing and Chinatown Manhattan. This particular venue had plenty of seating and still had that new wood smell that a lot of new venues have.

After looking through their menu, the fresh mixed berry tea with cheese foam stood out to me. I ordered it with creme brûlée as a topping. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with my drink. I wasn't satisfied however, with the price as it came out to $7. The drink probably costed a maximum of $4 to make. I guess you're paying for their St. Marks priced rent and their high quality plastic cups, as well as the drink. 

I did not really taste the cheese foam although I found it to be less oily and buttery than most bubble tea places. Not sure if their ""fresh"" berries were frozen beforehand or not, but I prefer for it not to be frozen. Their creme brûlée topping was nice and buttery and overall, I thought it was delicious. Maybe I'll order the creme brûlée milk tea with boba next time."

The green tea portion tasted great and was not overbearing my sweet. The bubbles were nice and softly chewable. The cheese foam added a totally new experience for me. Sour and acidic ally cheesy. Mmmmmm. It all meshed together. Good stuff."
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2019-01-04,2.0,I love Moge but my last experience was really bad. I ordered the fresh mango with cheese and it came out bad. The drink was watery and lack flavor. Like what happened? When they first opened it was really good. It's unacceptable to pay almost $7 for a drink and giving customers a low quality drink.

Wifi name & password is printed on counter. It wasn't too loud even though a lot of people were talking, I was still able to concentrate. Service was pretty friendly, the lady was recommending drinks to me. The only downside is that they have a card minimum so if you're buy one drink you'll probably have to use cash (only minor inconvenience though). 

Cheese Peach Flavor Oolong Tea ($4.85)-3/5 I really wanted to love this drink more because I long peach and some of the cheese teas are actually really good. However, I felt like this rarely had a taste to it. I'm not sure what Oolong tea really taste like because I don't usually drink this kind of tea but it was flavorless imo. The cheese was slightly salty as expected but that was about it."
211,moge-tee-new-york-3,2018-12-11,4.0,"Big Red Robe (Da Hong Pao) Milk Tea. That's all you need to know when you come to Mogee Tee. I wish I could just leave these words as Yelp reviews but I don't think the Yelp gods will like it. So I'm explaining. 

Big red robe is actually a kind of tea leaves. The legend is that the leaves from these bushes had special medicinal purposes that cured illness of a mother of a Chinese dynasty emperor. In order to protect these bushes in the mountains, the emperor ordered big red robes to cover these bushes. Therefore, you get the name Big Red Robe. 

Watching them make this a few times, I suspected that the trick is either in the fact that they are using this type of tea or the fact that they put the tea and water into this special blender and blend it twice to extract all the tea flavor out. The product comes out super smooth and the flavor is deep. This reminds me of the Hong Kong stocking milk tea. Super smooth and a depth of flavor. 

I know there are some pretty interesting teas and seasonal drinks that they have, but I can't bring myself to not order the Da Hong Pao milk tea every time. Try it and you'll see what I mean."

Cheese foam is good too."

However, they have recently got super stingy with the cheese. It seems every time I come in there is less and less cheese. Very unfortunate when it is the only reason I come here. 

Edit: They seem to have got their QC on cheese distribution down. I still come here at least once a week and it is marvelous. I highly recommend this place."

I also missed the gratifying of French cuisine and French architecture appeal.  My server Brittney provided average customer service who publicly visibly appeared nonchalant without the will to genuinely service customers.  I decided to takeout for a at-home gratifying.  This business hones authenticity to French culture:  restaurant in the rear and bakery for takeout in the front.  Business cards are available for grabs.  Utter dismal price.

Adagio $6.80
Chocolate mousse with a passion fruit center, flourless chocolate biscuit, topped with a chocolate glaze and a mini almond macaron cookie.  The signage does not contain a brief description of what this pastry entails, but my server Brittney verbally informed me the details.  Pinterest from Maison Kayser also provides a very detailed description which is very informative.  This individual cake is very light and decadent as it is not rich nor heavy for swallowing.  I actually enjoyed this pastry to the tee.  I am enamored with the passion fruit center for the sweetness.

French Macarons (box of two pieces)
I believe the flavors were: one vanilla and one chocolate passion.  There were no signage for flavor names nor pricing.  This is possibly one of the reasons for the extremely poor reviews of this business - lack of information provided to customers.  How does customers know what flavors and what about the pricing? These cookies broke apart upon opening the plastic box.  They were average as I had better macarons elsewhere.  The plastic box were very restrictive and confined as it was very difficult to open the flaps."

Under 90+ F (temperature) in the morning, 
this cold tuna croissant was impressively refreshing.
The tuna mix was seasoned, the tiny diced cucumber added the crunchiness, fresh avocado, tomato and lettue.

This apple tart did not have the world softest apple slices, but I like the sweetness, crunchiness, taste and texture go well with the pastry.

The olive torsade was soft like down pillow. Green olive and black olive, added a taste of sour to the bread. Not bad for the summer.

Is it a chain? yes. Are they pushing the French cliche's a little hard*? Absolutely. But let me assure you, the chocolate croissants make all of this worth putting up with. Come here if you need bread for a wine and cheese party, you'll be the star of the night.

Let me start by saying that everything here looks amazing. I was left with so many options that I had trouble making a choice on what to eat next. 
I actually grabbed the salmon salad and tangerine juice. Now when I came in, I diddnt know how this worked and I ended up grabbing a pre made salad thinking I would be able to sit in the dining area and eat it. To my surprise, this was not how it worked. The dining area is actually a sit down resturant. They were nice enough to let me sit and eat. Then I actually found out that they have French onion soup there. So I ate some I ordered some of that as well. The food all had a unique amazing and extremely fresh taste to it.

212,maison-kayser-new-york-2,2018-05-21,4.0,"I'm happy to be able to finally write a review for Maison Kayser's location in Flatiron! This is not the first time I've been to this spot, but I've had so many positive experiences here that my last prompted me to finally put it in the books.

My friend and I arrived at around 12:30 on a rainy Saturday afternoon. We walked in, without having made a reservation, but hoped it wasn't too busy that we wouldn't have been able to be seated. After talking to the host he said we were lucky since one single table opened up prior to us walking in. We were seated at a table in the back close to the entrance of the kitchen.

After we were seated our server greeted us and gave us some time to look over the menu. When she returned she was able to answer the questions we had about some of their items. Per her suggestion, I ended up going with the Saucisses & Oeufs Brouilles (A/K/A sausage and egg over a toasted piece of bread) ($16.50). The dish itself was flavorful and savory. However, it was definitely overpriced for the portion they give you.

Throughout our entire experience our server was both attentive and efficient! She was always ready to refill our water or coffee's and she speedily cleaned off our tables once we had finished our meals.

In my eyes Maison Kayser may seem like your run of the mill chain restaurant, but their Flatiron location is different. Definitely give them the chance to impress you (and also grab a seat outside on a nice day for a spectacular view of the ESB)."
212,maison-kayser-new-york-2,2017-12-09,1.0,"I've always liked Maison Kayser for their desserts. I hadn't been to this location in awhile. And, I convinced my husband to give it a try, after he vowed never to go back to MK after a recent and rather disastrous experience at their Columbus Circle locations. Boy am I regretting that. The MK I have enjoyed seems to be a thing of the past.

First, it wasn't particularly busy. The tables in the front, where we got seated are all sandwiched together to the point, where if you move too fast to get up, you're undoubtedly going to hit the person at the next table. Moreover, you're so close that the people at the other table just sit and listen. We know this since the woman next to us, suddenly jumped into our conversation. 

But that's irrelevant to this experience. We could have gotten past being crammed in on top of the other tables if the rest of the experience was good. Anyways so we are there for about five minutes or less when our waiter comes by and says ""what can I get you?"" Not hello, not welcome, just ""what can I get you?"" And, moreover, how about, ""have you had a chance to look at the menu and need more time?"" At five minutes, we hadn't even thought about what we were going to eat. 

Not sure what the rush was about either, since there wasn't other people waiting for a table. In fact, the other tables were leaving, and the place was not even remotely busy. The other dining guests in our section had been there for quite some time and were engaging with each other. So, it wasn't even that the waiter had 10 other tables seated at once where he was trying to balance them all. 

I point this out, but we'll get back to this later.

Most of the wait staff actually seemed to be standing around, not all that busy. 

I understand that maybe he was busy or something. I then wanted to start with the Rillettes de Canard- Duck rillettes, black pepper, cornichons, toast, then have a pasta dish. He then says I'm going to give you this (and points to a menu selection) saying that it's going to save me money. (We'll get to that in a bit.) I don't really care about the cost as long as the food is good. I get the rillettes de canard and as soon as I open the jar it smells horrible. It was vile. I love this particular dish, when it's prepared right and doesn't make you want to throw up. 

The waiter had no problem with me changing out the rillettes for something else. I chose the endive salad. He then says that they are out of that so it's either the rillettes or french onion soup. Um, ok. It's 5:30 on a Friday, but it happens. It seems to happen a lot, since something similar happened to my husband when he went to MK at Columbus Circle and they were out of things. 

Ok..... so it's either the dish I don't care for or soup? I asked if there was any other salad I can get and with a huff says I guess I can get the mescalin salad. So I get that. 

Now, for those who don't know, the mescalin salad is basically just a bunch of greens thrown in a bowl. And, yet, on this rather slow Friday, where the staff was seemingly not busy and we were rushed to order, I had to wait a good 20 minutes before I got a bowl with a bunch of greens thrown in. By then, my husband was already long finished with his French onion soup and got to watch me wait for a bowl with greens in it.

Then I was finished with my salad and my server was nowhere to be found. We sat there for about 20-25 more minutes. 

At this point, my husband was done with his soup for probably 35 minutes or longer. And I was done with my salad for 20 minutes and our waiter was MIA.

I was full by then but since I waited this long I wanted to eat my pasta or at the very least be able to take it home. 

It comes out and I have to say it was quite lovely. But not sure why it took an hour when the place was not busy.  So I just sat there picking at it waiting for our server to come back to tell him to pack it. He didn't come back for a long time so I picked at my pasta until it was almost gone. 

He eventually came by and I said that I was ready for my dessert. He then turned to walk away and I had to shout to ask what my options were. He looked over at the case of pastries and said I can have an eclair or something else. I chose the eclair and a cappuccino. 

It then, I kid you not, took 15 minutes to get those. And my husband had asked for a glass of ice, which sat on the bar for 15 minutes until the busser got it.

This was just bad. The waiter was poorly trained and didn't understand basic waiter etiquette.  

And after all of this I received a bill for $85 of which I didn't like my dinner at all. I'm still not sure why getting the $37 thing was better, since I got stuck with a dessert I wouldn't have ordered, and would have rather paid for one I did.

I definitely will not be going back.

Bottom line: just skip this place. With the thousands of restaurants in New York you can definitely find one that just saying so much better. It was a waste of time and money."

 not bring milk. No big deal until i had to ask 3 people to get it. By the time it arrived (approx)10 minutes later. By this time the coffee was cold. Had to wait another 10 minutes to get another cup. We were not the only table to expierence this bad service. They made 2 errors at the adjacent table. And the table behind us their order never came out. The server was very pleasant but for us it was a very unpleasant expierence"

212,maison-kayser-new-york-2,2018-04-08,1.0,"We love little cafe's. The look here reminds you of sitting in Paris. That's about where the resemblance ends. Ordered coffee, pretty good. Tried to order a  croque monsieur. The waitress kept saying croque madam. I'm saying no, that is with egg I would like the Monsier. She acts like she had never heard of it. I take her to the front where they have one sitting with a sign. She says oh, I have never seen that. 

Finally when the food comes, we have a piece of bread with ham and cheese. Nothing like what they have displayed with a sign on it saying what it is. So second strike. 

Bill comes, $14 and change. I ask why is this more than the sandwich that I had pointed out to her up front that was $8.50 and ordered. She says oh sorry I ordered you the madam and told them not to put the egg. So I had to tell her again that isn't what I ordered or what had pointed out in the display case. She did adjust the bill. But still strike 3. 

Finally, and this is what I would tell people to stay away. Right before we left I used the restroom. DISGUSTING! Had I went in before ordering we would not have stayed. It says a lot about a place of the NY subway bathrooms are cleaner than a cafe."

I can't even believe this, everything there is so expensive as it is and there really going to charge for butter and for dressing.. and the coffee bar- they don't even look at you for 5 minutes before taking your order... this place is at the bottom of the scale.

212,maison-kayser-new-york-2,2018-10-30,4.0,Not the cheapest game in town but they are renowned for their cuisine and my sandwich was light but filling.  I didn't get to have dessert here and never thought to because I got full but I'd come back in the future though it's not the largest location and it might get super crowded like most places in Manhattan if you go at the wrong hour on the wrong day.  I was here on an early weeknight but it wasn't crazy packed since I guess most people were still trying to take the subway.
212,maison-kayser-new-york-2,2018-06-10,3.0,"Great Croissants - we carried out ham & Swiss and almond croissants which were delish. Went back next day for a sit down breakfast of soft boiled eggs with avocado toast (yummy but teensy portion for my husband), and over easy eggs with smoked ham. Mine was ok - ham was ice cold which was a turn off. Great jam & toast gave half to my husband who was still hungry. $14.50 for each bfast entree sans coffee was too spendy imho. 

Stick to carry out pastry for best value."

When I'm barely awake and it's time for coffee, an americano with Maison Kaysers name is in my hand. Yes it's a chain and more available all over the city (just ran into one in west village) but it's kind of the only bakery thing in flatiron aside from eataly lines and crowd disasters.

They have pastries and cookies and sammies and loaves of savories and sweets. How can you go wrong?

They also give away soy milk and have stevia. I'm always down with places that have stevia.

I haven't had brunch here but I probably would be too sad I wasn't eating bread..."
212,maison-kayser-new-york-2,2018-05-22,4.0,"Ever since my husband and I visited Paris a few years back and fell in love with Eric Kayser's bakeries, we've been so nostalgic about the baguettes, ham & cheese croissants, and pain au chocolats. I remember once looking up if there were any sister bakeries stateside, only to be bummed that none of them were in the California area.

Thus of course the moment we were recently in New York City, we knew we HAD to visit one of the plentiful Maison Kayser locations to reminisce of our engagement trip.

The location is strikingly clean. Everything almost glistens, but maybe that's just my shining shimmering splendid view of this place. There's a large assortment of pastries (3 types of eclairs to choose from!), I could hardly decide, so of course I had to narrow it down to... all 3 eclairs, and an almond croissant... and a pain au chocolat... and... 2 baguettes. Overboard? I think not!

Sadly, the quality of deliciousness is no match to the Parisian shops, but it certainly is better than all the other patisseries and boulangeries of Silicon Valley. The baguettes are repeatedly stale (but I did always go ~8-10pm) so unfortunately they aren't made fresh every 30 min like they do in Paris (I know, it's a hard expectation to meet, but stale bread gets 1 star knocked off). The cool thing however is when I stopped by one night a little before closing, they let me have two baguettes free of charge. That's excellent user experience and customer service right there. I ended up walking away enjoying my slightly stale but deliciously crunchy outer crust and chewy inner gold, feeling so HAPPY. 

Thank you for making my day and letting me relive a little piece of my history. It took me right back to the moment my husband proposed... and few things in life have the power to do something as magical as that."

When we tried getting a table the hostess was no where to be found. Inside it's full of rude French tourists. But the food is as good as other locations I've tried.

They said they were not serving hot food but then toasted a great sandwich for me.

Baked goods and coffee are excellent.

We had vegan friends visiting, and I had to show them what delicious donuts they had, so we're so excited about the vegan options as well! They were perfect, not a second-rate imitation but excellent donuts in themselves. 

And of course everyone is so lovely and friendly there. Wonderful choices in flavors and varieties, great prices, great donuts."

I was forced to buy donuts before being allowed to use the facilities. I had no intentions of using the bathroom without patronizing the place but their money came first. 

I left with my donuts, excitedly rushed home only to find hair in my donut. You're better off going to Dunkin' Donuts."

213,the-donut-pub-new-york-7,2020-02-28,2.0,"In terms of variety and selection, The Donut Pub scores high. There are a plethora of different treats, ranging from cronuts to yeast to cake donuts, and there are also other treats (eclairs and other baked goods). The wall of donuts is an impressive view, but the product didn't deliver as much. 

We ordered the cannoli croissant donut and the birthday cake donut. The texture of the croissant donut was appealing -- very light and fluffy, and very distinct in comparison to a regular donut. But the ""cannoli"" coating was unimpressive and lacked flavor, and the dollop of cannoli cream was not distributed enough for it to balance out the donut. The birthday cake donut was absolutely average -- not much better than a dunkin donut. 

Would come back to try a crueller, but not sure that this place is worth the hype or the price."

I've been to the other location and that was great and I am sure glad I can say the same about this location! Their donuts are quite sizeable. My boyfriend and I shared the French Cruller which is just a classic must get donut. It was so light and fluffy on the side. LOVED It

We also shared the cappuccino cronut. Great flavor. You can really taste the coffee. The cronut had great texture, lots of layers. Very good! They actually had a ton of selection both the regular donuts and the croissant donuts.

I will definitely be coming back for more!"

It's brightly lit with neon lights and so many donuts. I don't think there was one flavor I could think of that wasn't already there, so you're probably in luck. 

I wanted to see if this place had decent vegan options. Unfortunately, only four of their donuts are vegan (chocolate frosted, cinnamon, powdered sugar, and plain) so I got a cinnamon. They also had mini vegan donuts listed on their menu, which I wanted but they were all out that day :( however, I have to say that the cinnamon donut was delicious - the perfect balance of crispy and moist. It was so soft and the flavor was amazing. I probably would've liked this one more than the others anyway, but I'd go back again to try a different vegan option. 

My boyfriend got a Fruity Pebbles donut for him and his mom and they both loved them, even though his mom isn't a huge fan of donuts to begin with! She said the icing was really good mixed with the cereal."

I was an occasional customer here, reluctantly getting a crappy cup of coffee if I was in a hurry, but I walked out once I was reminded of the vermin that overruns this place, leaving presents for humans to find.

213,the-donut-pub-new-york-7,2019-08-28,4.0,"Was it wrong of me to think this would be an actual pub that served doughnuts? Before Jamie W. and I arrived here, I thought I could be like Norm Peterson walking into Cheers where everyone yells ""NORM!"" Sam would ask ""What's shakin', Norm?"" Without skipping a beat, Norm would respond ""My butt if I eat another dozen doughnuts."" The temptation was there as there was a long rack of doughnuts of all kinds adjacent to an even longer counter where one is meant to devour said doughnuts.

The variety appeared endless. Jamie gravitated toward the Chocolate Salted Caramel Croissant Donut (photo: http://bit.ly/2Zs7uP2). Good in theory, faulty in execution as it was way too chewy to eat with pleasure as the guilt kicks in roughly at the same time the thick sugary frosting lands squarely on your face. I was way luckier with the Boston Cream Doughnut which was exactly like its classic progenitor dessert (photo: http://bit.ly/2Zxub4r). A simply perfect, simply decadent treat on a sweltering day in the Village.

DOUGHNUTS - 4 stars...the croissant was a 3 but that Boston Cream was a definite 5
AMBIANCE - 4 stars...not a pub but doughnut racks for days
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...they must have an iron will to avoid the stock

Huge selection of donuts that are always fresh and busting with flavor. Coffee is always on point too. I believe they have breakfast sandwiches too but let's face it, I don't come here for that.

The blueberry cake donut was absolutely delicious - probably the best blueberry cake donut I have had. It was sweet, not too sweet, dense without weighing you down, and had wonderful flavor. The powdered sugar mini donuts were fantastic and made me do a little happy dance while eating them. 

Inside was cute, quaint, and the staff was helpful and beyond friendly. 

The reason for 4 stars is because the Oreo donut was kind of mediocre.

213,the-donut-pub-new-york-7,2020-01-05,4.0,"An awesome experience. I came here the Monday before Christmas to buy donuts for my office. There is an incredibly wide selection of donuts, which as someone used to that big name chain donut place, was a nice surprise. The flavors were interesting too. 

Since they are a little pricier than the chain store donuts and I needed 5 dozen, I opted for the mini ones. When I asked them to give me an assortment, they went out of their way to not only make sure I got several of each flavor, but when I finally opened them at work I discovered they lined them up in the boxes beautifully. They bagged them nicely too and my treats didn't get jostled around in transit. 

The donuts themselves were really, really good. They were slightly crispy on the outside (kind of like the thin, crispy edges of a pancake) and very airy on the inside. All of the flavors were a hit in the office and 5 dozen minis were just the right amount to satisfy around 40 people. The ones piped with frosting were the overall favorites, but if you're getting them for a group definitely don't hesitate to get the mixed assortment. 

Location is really convenient too - if you take the R, W subway line and exit any entrance, you'll see the shop right next to &pizza."
213,the-donut-pub-new-york-7,2020-02-19,5.0,"Donut Pub never disappoints. I'm an old fashioned ""Get what works"" person who always orders the same thing once I find that I enjoy it at places to eat. However, I always find myself trying something different at the Donut Pub. Great staff, knowledgeable and they always stand behind their descriptions of doughnuts that are never a far cry from what they describe. This time I tried the maple glazed cronut. 

The breakoff, follow through, and handling of the cronut doesn't feel too hollow nor pasty. Can have it as is or warmed. Don't like debris but seeing the light flakes of the light overcoat of frosting break away with each bite brings the mortality of the doughnut to the forefront and really makes you savor what you've got in front of you. It's great and not perfect, but it's subtle moment(s) with the flavor of a modest diamond in a haystack creation."

It was hard to choose what to pick because they have so many options, but my friend and I decided on banana cream donut and cinnamon bun donut. The banana cream donut was so yummy and I liked how it wasn't too sweet but I can taste the banana flavor from the custard. I didn't try the cinnamon bun, but my friend said it was delicious! This is a good place to stop by for some donuts/ sit down and chill. Next time I come back, I want to try their croissant donuts which also looked really good!

I was a little shook when I first got in! I mean, they have a ridiculously diverse array of donuts! After looking at the colorful shelves for a while, I decided to get a glazed croissant donut because it looks interesting and it receives good reviews on Yelp. I usually just get a plain or glazed donut because I think desserts are best in their original flavors. Well, I loved my choice! The many layers of the croissant made it less dense and heavy for breakfast. The glaze was delicious albeit a bit too sweet for me (but I still finished the whole thing regardless). I also got an oat milk latte to compliment the croissant donut! It tasted better than I expected.
I'd definitely comeback to try the plain and glazed whole wheat donuts, sounds pretty ""healthy"" to me LOL!"

Selling me a stale/hard donut for $2.50 is a crime and taking it to go without taking a bite in the store was a mistake on my end. I was 2 blocks away when I realized I was duped with a disgusting pile of hard dough - or I would have returned that crap for my money back. 
If you're not going to sell fresh donuts, don't be open, as simple as that because the more you dish out crap to costumers and take their money, the more bad reviews you're going to get. Venture away from here and go right to the doughnut plant, as those are the best donuts in the city. The donut pub is more of a donut dump."

Each pasta was absolutely divine, and they weren't stingy with the bread (crispy crust, soft inside, perfect for soaking up sauce). Everything arrived hot and the amazing food made our night. The spaghetti with tomato basil was my favorite, my boyfriend loves the bolognese and the cacio e pepe is to die for and served on these amazing noodles that really hold the sauce."

Prepared to perfection and served with the bone accompanied with arugula salad and a glass of wine I could not be happier.

Perfect for a late Saturday lunch or early dinner, before or after the crowds."
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2019-01-25,5.0,"It's Restaurant Week, a great way to try fabulous meals at fabulous restaurants. Today, my friends Rochelle and I dined at a fabulous gem: Sant Ambroeus in the West Village. The other location is at Lafayette Street in Soho.We've been wanting to try their fare for awhile now and today is the day.
Located in one of the most charming blocks: West Fourth and Charles. Sant Ambroeus is next to my other faves: Sevilla and Mary's Fish Camp.
On a cold winter day it's fun to visualize dining al fresco on their beautiful mosaic tiled tables but today we entered past the multi colored velvet curtain and were greeted by the friendly host.
To the right is the cozy bar with rustic lighting and to the left the petite but warm dining area.
Restaurant Week consists of a 2 course menu for $26. Drinks and dessert are not included. Rochelle perused menu  as well as I the online menu prior to meeting. There were a lot of great choices.
We decided on the following:
We shared the Insalata Centicolori with farm chicory, sliced avocado, cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella and olives. The salad was split for us and served on two separate plate. Love this! The salad was delicious!
Rochelle ordered off the special menu a dish  she loves: Vitello Tonnato. This dish is thinly sliced veal tenderloin, yellowfin tuna sauce, veal jus and capers.
I started out with the Zuppa del giorno: a puréed creamy ginger/ carrot soup served in a generous sized bowl. It's wonderful on a cold day.
My entree was the Pappardelle alla Norcina: pasta with a mushroom ragout and black truffles. The plate was deceiving: there were mounds of mushrooms. Highly recommend!
There are other dishes that we must come back to try: Cacio e Pepe, Eggplant Parmigiana, Veal Cutlet Milanese.
The waiter comes around with a dessert tray: tiramisu, a hazelnut and almond torte, plum tart and other heavenly delights. We ordered the chocolate 
 mousse, a heavenly concoction of chocolate and hazelnuts? I overheard the waiter, Ivan, state the desserts are prepared off premises.
We really enjoyed our meal here. Our server, Ivan, was courteous and witty.
The ambience is warm and inviting. The food is delicious.
Another West Village gem!"
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2019-10-02,5.0,"This restaurant gets 5 stars for its 5 star service. The waiters literally waited on me hand & foot and I was alone on a weekday afternoon. Just really kind and patient staff. Pasta Portions were the perfect size and al dente. And yes, it's true you get bribed into dessert but it was lovely and delightful. A small note, native Italian people were both working and eating there.  Always a good sign"
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2020-02-18,5.0,Amazing food and service! We were recommended this restaurant by 3 diffeeent people and are so glad we came during our trip. Highly recommend making a reservation well in advance.

Limited food selection and they have fair wine selection. 
It's a higher end Italian restaurant but it didn't meet my expectations. 
Service was decently efficient but towards the end the service started to slack drastically.
The one positive- I truly enjoyed the PRINCIPESSA. 
The next evening I ordered 6 slices thru caviar and unfortunately the PRINCIPESSA wasn't properly put together for efficient transportation."

Our waiter was also super friendly! Will definitely be back to this location"

Great service, good food, & beautiful restaurant. It is slightly overpriced, but what do you expect in the city. They are also really flexible which is nice, we wanted the Gnocchi alla Norcina but they already ran out of gnocchi, so they were able to prepare the dish for us with a different type of pasta!!"
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2018-05-29,2.0,"Sant Ambroeus West Village has great food and an awesome location but their unfortunate staff knocks my review down to two stars. 

I stopped by this location on a recent Saturday and was beyond disappointed by the unfriendly and rude staff at this restaurant. The vibe of the restaurant felt very judgmental and elitist and I would not return as a result. This is a massive bummer because I have fond memories of Sant Ambroeus from a few years back but I refuse to feel so judged while attempting to enjoy a meal out."

214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2019-05-23,5.0,"Due to the quality of this restaurant it is the kind of place that is always busy, yet they make it a point to make each dining experience an unhurried pleasure. They seated my friend and I in a corner booth and treated us like royalty. Everything from the appetizer to the dessert was prepared flawlessly and at the proper temperature. The sense of old world Frank Sinatra like nostalgia made a week night meal feel like a night out on the town. Would definitely dine again!"
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2019-09-04,1.0,"This neighborhood gem has lost its shine  What should have been an enjoyable evening turned out to be so disappointing!!
Celebrating an Engagement.. we were seated at their best table , 4 of us. Asked the waiter to take some photos and he did with disgust A bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne was sent to us by a family member and not one smile ... not one the entire evening, from any staff . They were dying us a favor. Awful attitudes. 
A server spilled over one of the glasses of DP and no apology or effort to make good on the spilled glass. 
We ordered a bottle of red wine.. that too, was presented poorly and again, attitude of doing Us a Favor! 
The food was over salted that all of us were swollen when we left . Pasta was mushy. Veal Milanese soaked in oil. 
Desserts were great. Princess Cake is a fav of ours. It was fresh and did not disappoint.  Lemon cheesecake was yummy. As was the coconut gelato. 
We will not be going back. We dine out ALL THE TIME! NYC has thousands of restaurants to choose from!  We live in the New Hudson Yards and will stay with new beautiful up to date dining establishments that take pride in their food, their patrons, their venues and the passion for life! 
San Ambrous will fade away... as it should!"
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2017-11-12,4.0,"Sant Ambroeus is representative of today's evolving restaurants, classic French preparations atop white tablecloths, but in a refreshed and modern approach. Very much enjoyed the space and its design elements. It really fits with the location. 

This restaurant is a breakfast, lunch and dinner excellent choice. This time we went for a great breakfast. Overall, the avocado toast and the salmon affumicato were a clear highlight - made in house. Just the way I love restaurants that make their food from scratch.

About the atmosphere:
Modern luxe, an understated and sophisticated elegance - great design work. White table cloths, but not stuffy or outdated. Very UES clientele.

Finally the service:
Our waitress was pleasant and  knowledgeable, I ended up with precisely what I had in mind and had a good interaction."
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2020-03-09,5.0,"Charming, intimate restaurant.  A friend and I celebrated a birthday there on Saturday night and were very happy with the delicious food and attentive service.  It was the perfect spot for a celebration."
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2018-07-31,5.0,"Sant Ambroeus is a very quaint, upscale restaurant. I had to insist my husband not look like a lumberjack before coming here. 

It's a small restaurant so make sure to make reservations, even if you feel it won't be busy. Better safe than sorry. I'm sure this place is kid friendly, but I would have been embarrassed and insecure had we brought our son. Plus it would have ruined the calm and serene atmosphere for the other patrons.

We came for breakfast. My eggs benedict was perfectly cooked. Check out the picture of my poached eggs! Never thought a yolk could turn someone on before! And I'm taking this moment to rave about the freshly squeezed orange juice. This is by far the best orange juice I've ever had. Delicious! I would love to come back sometime and try a bakery item. 

So out on your best nicest outfit from Lands End and head down to Sant Ambroeus!"
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2019-02-05,1.0,"Hiya-

My family has lived a block way for almost 100 years and me, myself, for most of that.  We've seen, eaten at, worked the front and back of the house at, and talked pretty extensively among ourselves about the 1000 or so Village restaurants that have come and gone over our 5 generations here. 

Here is the skinny on Saint Ambrose.  I had the 3 course Restaurant Week prix fixe:

Nice enough salad but swimming in 3 times the needed anchovy dressing, making it borderline
swallowable for its saltiness.  

Lamb flavor got lost in the well portioned Lamb Ragu/Broken Veal Meatball over pasta, unlike at Rafele, on 7th Ave South, where the flavor of their long simmered lamb ragu over pasta is intense, for those who prefer that, and a third the price, if you're willing to walk 5-10 minutes.  I grew up always eating pasta al denté.  As far as I know Italian, this means ""to the tooth,"" not broken tooth. 
My dish was molto al dente, cooked sufficiently to be ready for a final cooking treatment of the Chef's choosing, but not for serving or eating.   The manager did offer to redo the dish but I hadn't the time. 

Tiramisu was less than ordinary pound cake topped with so-called zabaglione--no Marsala--and a weaponized chocolate dust that I'm still choking a little on from a slight inhalation.  Skip it.  

Service was adequate to good. Unlike some reviewers who complained about the staff being snobbish (my word), I smiled at all of them and that just melted away, as it does most anywhere. Try it ;)

This being my 2nd go-round here with similar results, I won't be returning. The"
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2019-03-22,4.0,"Very authentic and food was some of the best Italian food.   Who knew this hidden gem in the city.   The only negative is the price tag.  For Italian food, it is bit on the prices side."
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2020-02-17,5.0,First time here at the West Village location and cannot wait to return. We had a larger group (7 people) and needed last minute reservations on a Saturday night. I called and spoke to Alessandro the GM who happened to answer the phone. He checked some things and called me back within 30 minutes and was able to accommodate us. Needless to say everything was fantastic from the food to the service. But I must give an exceptional thank you and praise to Alessandro for accommodating us at the last minute and for also making us feel welcome. He is a true professional and gentleman. We will be back!
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2017-07-29,4.0,"Pleasant stop for breakfast in the West Village.

Big fan of how early they open... didn't expect West 4th Street to be such a ghost town at 9 am but thankfully this spot was open. I was seated outside immediately; this has to be one of the most picturesque corners in Manhattan. Can imagine the people watching possibilities when New York has actually woken up. Service was very polite and attentive.

The menu covers all of your brunch cravings, though at a steep price. Most dishes were $16 and up, though there are some smaller pastries and sides for cheaper. I went for the soft boiled egg ($5) and the smoked salmon paninetti ($8).

My food came out in under 15 minutes. The smoked salmon came sandwiched between two soft pieces of bread with a light schmear of cream cheese. Enjoyed this; it's on the smaller side but the salmon was high quality.

The soft boiled egg was, indeed, soft boiled. I mean, it's an egg, there's not much to write about here. It also came with sunflower seed-studded toast which was fine. I mostly used my yolk on my salmon sandwich, which was a satisfying combination. Can't say I'd get it again though.

Overall, I had a nice treat-myself breakfast here, though I tried not to think about the fact that I paid $5 for a single egg."
214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2017-08-16,4.0,"After some confusion surrounding outdoor seating and dogs, my friends and I decided to go to Sant Ambroeus this past Sunday. Unlike the restaurant next door (Extra Virgin), where the host was incredibly rude and vague about when we could be seated, the host at Sant Ambroeus was nice and helped us get a seat reasonably quickly. My friend had recently gotten a rescue dog and was trying to leash-train it. It's a big dog that barks ferociously at other dogs, but the staff was nice about it. They brought it a big saucer of water, fed it some ice cream, pet its head, and were wonderful.

I ordered the Sant Ambroeus Eggs Benedict with Norwegian Smoked Salmon. It was tasty. The salmon was beautifully sliced and the kale salad was fresh and simple. The eggs were less runny than I usually like them and a tad on the cold side, but the flavors were good. The biscuits also could've been fluffier, but they were easy to cut and didn't feel heavy, which was nice.

In case it wasn't obvious from how nicely the staff treated the dog, the staff was also super nice to people! Our water was constantly refilled. Our server checked in with us multiple times, and everyone was so great, even though the place was full. Even if the food was awful, I still would've given this place a decent rating because the service was wonderful, above and beyond that of a typical NYC brunch spot."

I see some reviews with knocks on the service, but ours matched the wonderful food and upscale atmosphere. We did not have a reservation, but the host worked to get us a table for three on a Saturday night. Our waitress was prompt, knowledgeable, and professional. Shortly after being seated we had our drinks, as well as bread and oil. We were in a bit of a hurry, so we skipped appetizers and went right to main course. I had the Chitarra all'Abruzzese, and it was fantastic. Hearty but full of delicate flavors, with perfectly cooked pasta. It left me wanting to come again just for the same dish."

214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2019-11-10,2.0,"For a place with a lot of hype and good food our experience was unfortunately poor. After waiting over 50 minutes we literally had to ask 3 times before we were seated. Our waiter didnt bring us any bread, didnt check on our table at all after taking our food orders, we ordered pasta dishes and when we asked for cheese no one came by to give us any. There were plenty of tables around us getting proper service but for some reason we were totally ignored. We literally had to ask another wait to call our waiter. When we raised our issues our waiter tried to placate us with a plate of biscotti! Not impressed. Treat all your guests equally."

214,sant-ambroeus-west-village-new-york,2018-08-20,1.0,"As far as New Yorkers go, I'd consider my group reasonably patient. The five of us waited the better part of an hour for coffees with no acknowledgment from the wait staff of a situation or even bread to keep us from getting hangry. When we kindly asked for an update around the 30-minute mark, it felt like the staff responded with an eye roll and chalked it up to only having one barrista. At 45 minutes we lost faith that we'd ever get served and walked out. The manager insisted that he had been planning to comp our whole breakfast, but with the attitude our waiter was giving us we really weren't looking forward to food that he had spit in. For a classic West Village brunch spot, we were really disappointed with the service. We would have been more compassionate had they informed us that there was an issue with the coffee machine the first time we asked. (Separately, a problem with the machine doesn't explain why it took as long to bring my sister a juice, nor does it justify the poor hospitality).

Fortunately, Cafe Cluny around the corner was able to seat us, brought coffee right away and, as it turned out, had a way better menu. Go there instead."

Hi! 

I'm sure the coffee is great, I bought a bag of Mexican Chiapas coffee that I can't wait to try on my aero press, but (this is where things go south) while I was waiting for my beans to be grounded, I ask kindly if was possible to use the ladies room, the answer was ""I'm sorry we are close"" which it wasn't. Still were customer inside the cafe, the hours where 7 to 7 (me not knowing the holiday hours yet)  and it was clear that answer was a general one. I reply to the non so friendly barista that didn't make any eye contact with me, ""how come I can't, I see people and I just bought an $18 pound of coffee"" at he replied; "" no sorry, we are close for the day, sorry"" however I see him organizing bags and such. I went outside where my husband was waiting with my baby and I explained the situation, and he as well got upset. He went inside asking why denying service to a customer, their answer: ""we are in Holiday hours, and we closed at 4:30"" as soon as he got out he explained to me , however the holiday hour sing on the window said 8-6pm, we were there at 4:30. Honestly, if the bathroom service is not allowed because owner stated and baristas need to follow, I get it, but please don't make customer feel stupid where you are contradicting your reasons.  Rant done and hope customer service gets better. Thanks. 12/28/19 Seaport location"

We came in on a Sunday morning and the line was (almost) out the door. But it moved semi-quickly. When I got to the front, I was surprised to see that there was only one person working. She would take an order and go and make a couple of orders. She was quite efficient because the line wasn't longer. But perhaps they should have staffed better for a bustling Sunday.

Birch Coffee always has a pleasant atmosphere with fun things to read and creative napkins. They had a nice selection of bags of coffee to peruse while waiting in line. I didn't buy any this time but one benefited charity.

The coffee tasted great, as I expected, and I appreciate that they have an extensive collection of alternative milk."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2019-08-15,5.0,Cute place to stop by and get a coffee- my latte was ready almost instantly. The chocolate croissant was super yummy and they also had a bunch of different pastries. The espresso was very good- and lots of room to sit and chill.

I had a latte the first day and the tokyo style coffee the second.  Both were very good.  The tokyo, as expected, was strong, but it you were still able to taste some of the underlying flavors.  The latte was made very well with a nice consistency to the milk .  

 I also tried their almond and chocolate croissants and both were very good!  

It was nice having this coffee shop close to the hotel!"

Although it's a chain, I do like this place --- 

No flavors, fancies or bs, just really good coffee.  I got the Americano which had a good rich flavor without tasting like burnt over roasting ala that other chain from Seattle

- Get the coffee for here and you'll get to drink it in a nice ceramic cup
- Wish they had milk options out at the fixins' bar!
- Note: Good bathroom, very clean esp for this area

Maybe not a destination place, but a good neighborhood option"

The rest of my experience was dissatisfying. Cortado so milky it tasted like a latte. (That's called a piccolo.) the small-ish pre-made salads had no price so I was surprised to find out it cost more than $10 when I brought it to the counter. 

Come on Birch. You can do better"

You can still hear the busy streets outside a bit but it's not too bad. I didn't need headphones to work so it's decently quiet. If you're looking for a great cup of coffee, latte, tea or even a good pastry, this is the place. They have great coffee and matcha blends.

The coffee is really good and they have a toasted almond tea that is really flavorful, just add 2 packets of brown sugar. The tea is so good that I've purchased the unbrewed tea and a jug of the tea as gifts for coworkers."

I ordered a dirty chai from Birch (which understandably costs extra because of the espresso shot) and they not once, but twice did not add in the shot I paid for. You can taste the difference. Then, when I called and made a complaint leaving a message, some woman called back without identifying who she was only saying that she received a message that I bought a dirty chai from Birch and complained about not receiving the espresso shot and that she'd give me the $1 and change back, the cost of my shot. Only then was it apparent who was calling. She went right into it without taking a breath. I let her know that this was not the first time and how most of the baristas there were cold, unwelcoming and made you feel like you were an inconvenience and like they were doing you a favor, on top of overcharging for your drink. She didn't apologize or address that concern. She ignored it and told me she would keep the charge for the coffee but take off the dollar, again like she was doing me a favor or as if it was nothing for her. I told her I don't need the dollar back just to address the issue with the staff and that I would not be buying my coffee there any longer. There are plenty of other coffee shops in the area (one across the street from it as a matter of fact). I let the Birch woman know that our film production company always buys coffee there - EVERY DAY - but we will be changing it up. Suddenly her cold tone changed and she said she'll remove entire charge of the coffee. Doesn't make a difference to me. This also happened 3 times to one of my other co-workers. Who knows how much they are ripping people off? Nope, Nope, Nope, never again!"
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2020-01-01,1.0,When you're profile says the place closes at 7 you close at 7. I got there at 6:30 and there was a guy inside. I knocked and he pretended he isn't hearing!!!
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2019-11-29,5.0,"After crossing the Brooklyn Bridge in a biting cold wind, we needed to get our 6 yo and mommy to a hot drink and a bathroom. Despite my suggestions, the bathroom break happened at the Starbucks down the street. However, after that 45min adventure, I successfully got us out of there and in to Birch for the drinks. Fantastic. My drip brew was delicious and light nutty flavor, wife's cappuccino was a wonderfully crafted fine foamed respite. Could not be happier we chose to go the extra block!!"
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-12-22,2.0,"I walked past a Starbucks and into Birch hoping for a more personalized cafe experience. The woman behind the counter asked for my name for the drink and then repeated it incorrectly. I corrected her. She then made the mocha I requested and vs slow pouring the milk, she dumped it into the cup (Pic attached) and then called out my name wrong again. It was such a ridiculously rude experience. I've seen other reviews calling out the pretentiousness of this spot. Save your money and get your $6 lattes from Starbucks. At least you know to expect they'll get your name wrong."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-10-10,3.0,This location for Birch is pretentious. The man behind the counter was not very friendly and it felt like he was talking down at me. I got a white tea here that was only okay. I felt like it was overpriced for what it was.
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-10-27,2.0,"This store used to a place for community, and added to the local spirit and growth. However with the new management coming in, it's not the same. 
I will encourage the store management and employees to think about the community in which the store exists and how their new policies impact it.  A common practice to bring in the foot traffic was to provide the baked foods at 50% after 4 pm. This helped the community and helped the store to bring in the required foot traffic for the store. But this practice has been discontinued. There are other changes too.  It looks like Starbucks will get my dollars versus Birch."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2019-08-08,5.0,"Birch is one of the best coffee shops in town. Love their cold brew with oat milk, and the baristas make it a great start to the morning. I'd recommend without reservation, as there's rarely a wait and the attention to detail is supreme."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2019-04-10,5.0,"The is my new spot to get coffee every morning! Fast service, and great quality coffee. They even offer a discount for Pace students which is great. Being that I don't drink milk, one of the associates offered oat milk as a substitute. The greatest decision ever! Now ever morning I get a latte with oat milk. Love this cute little coffee shop!"
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-02-11,4.0,"Super cute and cozy spot in financial district for some great coffee ! They also sell two types of Underwest doughnuts, which was awesome, because it saved me from making the trip to midtown to try the famous car wash doughnuts. Their coffee is amazing! I ordered the cappuccino and it was divine. If you are a coffee  lover and coffee snob like me you, you know what good coffee should taste like. I was very happy to be able to enjoy a vanilla lavender Underwest doughnut and cappuccino there. 

Overall the service is good. They have a communal table in the middle and a few tiny two person tables on the right side of the coffee/order area. It's a bit narrow so it does get uncomfortable if there are people sitting next to you. But right. They also have some sitting space on the left side of the coffee/order area with high stools, where you can people watch or whatever."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2019-02-27,5.0,"This coffee shop is one of my new favorite spots in Fi Di. One of the main reasons is because they sell oat-ly oat milk by the carton and they sell it as an alternative milk option. They have all the traditional drinks and despite the long lines and full tables they always make the drinks fast for the NYC rush! Their location is perfect too because it's right by Pace University so it's convenient and easy to find (especially for those at Pace). Staff is very friendly and they encourage the customers to interact with others by putting fun activities on the tables! Overall, it's a very nice, cozy and ideal coffee shop for the average book lover and New Yorker!"
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2019-04-29,5.0,"Such a tasty cup of coffee. Rich, but smooth and velvety. Accidentally stopped by to grab a drink and was very pleasantly surprised. Love the atmosphere! I wish we would have Birch coffee in CT. I would be a daily customer"

Four Stars

Located on South West Corner of the Gehry Building, Birch Coffee is a great addition to the coffee shop community. Its open until 8pm which is odd but wonderful because I can always use coffee.  The place was all but empty.  There were some seating by the windows and in the center of cafe.  The staff was friendly. The coffee was excellent. The rich espresso and foamed milk was exactly what I wanted. I will have to check this place out in the morning and see how it really is."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2017-04-06,4.0,"Small neighborhood coffee house.
Operative word being small.  Birch has 3 or 4 other locations in NYC, but this is the only one that I visited so I can't attest to whether or not they're all about this size.

The limited seating didn't affect me in the least, since I did strictly to-go.  They make a mean soy chai latte, so I was happy.

What I really loved about Birch is their book program.  Like a true coffee house, they encourage, honor, & promote books/reading/writing.  You can bring a book that you're done w to add to their collection, & in turn, if you find a book on their shelves that you love, you're free to take it home.  Forever, if you want.  

Isn't that nice?  And cool?  And refreshing?

Conveniently located just across the street & around the corner from The Beekman Hotel.

4 stars."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2017-03-29,4.0,"I was staying with a friend in the area and they suggested that I check out Birch Coffee. Immediately when I walked in I could tell this was a quaint, friendly, coffee shop where I could grab a quick beverage.

The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. I enjoyed that they had little signs available with questions people could ask you if you were sitting there alone. It made the entire atmosphere feel at home where people can come for a drink, relax, and meet new people."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-07-16,4.0,"The coffee and experience was 3 stars for me. Staff could have been a bit friendlier, but oh well. I'm giving it a 4 because this place opened up in my old building, and drinking my small coffee in the courtyard was a great way to spend a Monday afternoon.

The drip coffee was okay. Next time I'll get something to eat. Food looked good."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-06-30,1.0,"Barista decided to leave and the clerk didn't know how to make a latte so he told me that I could wait if I want, but he's not taking an order. With a bit of a stank attitude, added I could order something cold.

Not too impressed with this place. Don't think I will be back. 

My question for management: who hires someone to work at a coffee shop and doesn't train them to make a GODDAMN LATTE??"
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-08-17,4.0,"My friend lives in the Gehry building so when I dogsit this becomes a godsend. It's a cute, tiny shop with a decent amount of seating for the size of the shop. 

I just get a black iced coffee and haven't had much else. This is part of the reason for the 4 stars. There's no 16 oz cup, only 12 & 20 oz, and the difference in a small to large is .50 cents so I just get the 20 oz. 

Other than that, the baristas are nice and don't look cranky when someone walks in the door."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2019-01-17,5.0,I love birch! They give student discounts and their lattes are delish! Nice big table to study at.. and the ambiance is very cute
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-05-05,5.0,"I love Birch coffee. Their roasts are exquisitely done; of all the Birch locations I have had the most pleasant barista's and the most delicious rich, not no bitter, regular drip.. This morning I had my new favorite: regular drip coffee (today a nicely rounded Colombian, with the last 3/4 inch cold brew.

 This is a branch in a  very new  building, therefore this location is architecturally very cold, unlike the baristas who were staffing it this morning. 

The location at 62nd near Lexington is cozy and small , probably because it is located in an old brownstone.

I look forward to experiencing the other locations"
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2016-06-19,3.0,"Comfy place, great culture, great stuff, good coffee and various leaf tea to choose from! Falling in love with this place!

There are countless good coffee places in New York. However, Birch coffee is unique by bring ing a connection between drinkers and through books. The place has plenty comfy seats with chillin background music. The ignition initiative (topics you can place on the table to have a discussion with strangers) is a great idea to add warmth to this busy cold city. I also love their bookshelf - free to take home, free to contribute! 

Coffee - I got soy cap. It has a ""Hello, my name is: Cristina."" on it!!! So coooool. The coffee is less foamy but it's creamy, rich and well balanced. Will come back. 

Note: soy milk available, no almond milk."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2017-07-18,4.0,"Great coffee, whether it's regular drip, cappuccino, or the red eye both hot and cold. They always provide quick service and everyone is very friendly even at the earliest of mornings.

I like the fact that there is never really a long line and after eavesdropping, they offer students 20% off when you show your school ID. They also offer a rewards card where the 10th coffee is on them.

A nice change from the typical coffee chains in the neighborhood. Priced marginally higher but worth it."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-02-07,5.0,Excellent Latte in there small size you get double shot or what they call it something else but it's like a double which is great ! Soy Latte is amazing :) cute little coffee shop birch loves u ;D
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-10-29,3.0,"We came here after a walk  for a coffee. 
The place was definitely nice now the employees are not welcoming at all he was like OMG HERE MORE PEOPLE AGAIN . He got mad because we didn't know wat we wanted and ask him a few questions. I was talking to him. Definitely I didn't feel welcome here."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2017-10-15,2.0,"I've been here twice now, and really want to like this place. But each time I've been here, it seems that some level of ineptitude on the part of the staff keeps me from having the best possible time. 

The first time I came, their dishwasher was broken, and they only served in paper cups. It was completely empty in the store and they were perfectly capable of hand washing a mug or two, but the barista seemed lazy. 

I came again to give this place a chance because the mocha I ordered was quite good. This time, again on a very slow weekend, they told me they didn't have any chocolate and couldn't serve a mocha. It bewilders me that a coffee shop like this can lack basic ingredients. 

I give this place two stars, because the only redeeming factors are the good tasting coffee and nice indoor ambience."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-03-10,5.0,"I read about this place in an article about the 16 best coffee spots in NYC.  While walking around and touring we decided to try it.  I had a ""dirty"" chai tea latte.  So good.  Probably one of the best I've ever had.  I bought the Birch Blend coffee to take home with me.  I'd recommend giving it a try!"
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2017-06-11,5.0,"Birch Coffee's have a pretty good reputation in this city, but unfortunately, that means they tend to be super busy and seating is reserved for the lucky few that happen to be at the right place at the right time. Well, this Birch Coffee is in FiDi which, despite efforts in the past couple of years to become as trendy as the rest of lower Manhattan, is still a fucking ghost town on the weekends. So hooray for me, who happened to be in the neighborhood one weekend and was looking for a place to catch up on some reading. The coffee here is great, there is plenty of seating and the service is friendly - what more can you hope for!"
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2018-07-05,2.0,"I wanted to love this place because I was looking for some good coffee and a cozy place to work in my neighborhood.... unfortunately it was not a great experience.

Few things...

1. No WIFI. Really?!
All customers had their laptops and I'm sure they would appreciate the wifi as well.

2. You can't add your own milk to your coffee - this resulted in the ""barista"" adding so much creamer to my coffee that it did not taste like caffeine any longer.

3. Staff is not the friendliest and seem to be lost with most things.

This place could be better because it has potential and a great location. Coffee was not bad."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2017-12-20,5.0,"Just walked the bridge and this is a perfect stop off on a cold winters eve. Great coffee, not your norm, simple and delish."
215,birch-coffee-new-york-10,2017-11-03,5.0,Iced latte with oat milk is the new healthy alternative to dairy and soy. It also taste really good!
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2020-02-03,4.0,"This is a great place for getting work done! The booth seats were also so comfy with cushions! Exceptional service too! The waiters were so friendly and upbeat. I ordered an orange juice and a dish that I don't remember the name of. It was something like red eye eggs? It was so good and smelled tasty! It was a bit too salty but otherwise was so delicious. It came piping hot and there were yummy veggies inside! 

Overall an excellent place for using your laptop. They are cashless so bring your cards!"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2020-01-01,4.0,"Stopped in between the holidays (Christmas and New Years Day), enjoyed the atmosphere and coffee(s). Had a macciato myself, and others in my group had coffees and even a hot chocolate. Everyone was pleased.  

As mentioned, it is cashless, go you can leave the greenbacks at home. Breakfast sandwich was a bit insanely priced ($13) seemed high.

Did have a warm feel to the place, very pleasant staff, and of course, the good coffee would have me return again though without any hesitation."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-12-24,4.0,"I stopped in here about 1:00pm with my wife after walking the Brooklyn Bridge (Dec. 23, 2019).

We ordered:

- 1 hot brew coffee
- 1 espresso 

This place is cashless. We paid with credit card. The gentleman that served us was pleasant. He gave us a table number marker and we seated ourselves. He also asked if we needed cream (later brought it to the table for us).

My cellphone was running low on power so I moved to a different table (near the wall adjacent the coffee bar) to charge my phone. In 5 minutes our order arrived. 

Both coffees were hot and delicious. 

The hot brew was medium roast. As you can see (pictured) it comes with an extra little bit in a carafe so I felt like I got my money's worth. Great idea. 

The espresso was robust and really hit the spot. They gave us a double cuz ""it's the same price.""

A lot people come in and out. Seems like a popular coffee spot. 

I recommend you drop in some time when you're in the area."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2020-06-08,1.0,Rude. Just plain rude. Come here if you want to be treated like a peasant. Watery coffee too.
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2020-01-24,3.0,"Large, iced beetroot latte- because I was curious. The pink color comes from beetroot powder that is mixed with almond milk. It's then sprinkled with cocoa powder. $6+ and it turns out I'm not a fan after all. Bluestone Lane had other tasty looking options so I'll def return to try something different next time."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-11-17,3.0,"Not bad. It is what it is really. Coffee was very good. Avocado smash was very mediocre. 

Service was alright. Our server was very nice and accommodating, the 2 guys behind the register were pretty eh. Never been to a bluestone so was my first experience. I'm sure DUMBO is a far cry from a flagship location of theirs but nonetheless consistency is key. 

Would probably go again for a coffee or beverage but not food. Big time brand tho shoutout the Aussies"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-05-08,4.0,"I'm not really an avid coffee drinker but me and my friend just happened to need some caffeine while walking on the way to the flea market. 

Place: the place was actually nice. If we had more time we could have stayed to chill.

Service: they were pretty friendly. The guy who served us helped us with the menu

Food: we bith had cold brew. It was pretty strong which was great because it was what we were looking for. 

Price: Kind of like Starbucks"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-04-19,4.0,"Pros: loved the chai latte! And I loved the vibe here. Also, it's outlet heaven here!! Aka you can actually be productive here. :)

Cons: only one unisex toilet, if there's a line and you really gotta go. Good luck!!"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-11-24,4.0,"The coffee and tea selection is on point.  What distinguishes it from a lot of other places in the area is the decor is warm and inviting and it is a large area (so you can get settled and not feel too crowded in the Brooklyn hustle and bustle).

Great spot to warm up after walking the Brooklyn Bridge (NYC to Brooklyn).

Must haves: The avocado toast with a side of smoked salmon was delicious- freshly made with just the right amount of seasoning."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-10-01,5.0,"Bluestone Lane is the place to go to for that Sunday morning ""I don't wanna do a full on brunch, but I want a good bite with some good coffee + good vibes"" place. 

It's also a good spot to catch up with friends. Seating here is abundant and comfortable. 

Coffee here is perfect. No burn or acidity to the taste. And as you can see below, the avocado toast is also pretty darn good. Doesn't really get better than this!

Only downside is the bad WiFi and lack of cell signal. But who cares? Put that phone down you millennial. LOL JK I care."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-04-28,3.0,"First time at any of the Bluestone Lane cafes. Walking in, I was already super in love with the layout & aesthetics of the place. Everything was a bit pricey. 

I take my coffee and drinks on the sweeter side so I decided to get a small hot chocolate. It was more bitter than I expected and a lot smaller than I expected, definitely not worth the price. 

When you order in, you'll get a number & food will be brought right to your table! 

We got the B&E roll without tomatoes and the avocado toast with a poached egg. My egg was a bit over cooked so the egg was not as runny as expected, and there was a bit too much lemon/lime squeezed on top so I had to scrap off and/or mix the avocado spread. Nothing too special so again I thought it was a bit overpriced. Took maybe 5 minutes for the drink and 10-15 for the food (we ordered in). 

Tips: bathroom is located in the back behind the flamingo wall, no cash just card accepted, sizes of the drinks are on the side of the bar facing the tables, and once it gets busy the tables can seem very close to each other. 

Overall: great service, cute aesthetics, pricer items on the menu, and more on the bitter side of things."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-03-17,4.0,"Stop by here for a quick brunch on a Saturday. It was a little crowded but we were able to find a seat easily. The place is quite spacious. You have to order at the counter and get a number to put on your table. I love the concept of this cafe and love the different types of toasts they serve. 
We ordered the salmon with cream cheese and dill toasts and the fig Jam toast. Both were delicious and were quite pricey for toast (about $10-15). It's hard to justify paying so much for toast. I do like the minimalist and blue decor. The cafe gets a lot of light too so it's very bright! I would stop by again if I am in the area and need a pick me up."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-07-28,4.0,"A solid cafe for getting some work done or taking a break from your stroll through Dumbo. It's a large open space which provides atmosphere. Their coffee menu is extensive, including some interesting offers such as Aussie Iced Lattes, Golden Lattes, and Beet Lattes. Their espresso is nice and earthy. They offer almond milk and oat milk at their sugar/milk stations and they also bring out your beverages for you to your table, which is something you don't get often in cafes!"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2020-02-06,2.0,"Used to really love this place for working, meetings, reading, etcetera. However, they've changed the space from a coffee shop to a ""pop up restaurant"" of sorts. It's no longer suitable for usual coffee shop activities as there is no seating available unless you're dining and then it is only wait service. There are a few metal barstools in the front near the door that aren't comfortable longer than a few minutes. It's also very loud like a restaurant would be unfortunately. 
Really only good for a quick coffee to go now because, thankfully, the coffee is still as good as normal."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-12-07,4.0,"Awesome coffee shop from an australian(?) chain? Their coffee and food is quite good but pricey, but it's a great little spot to take a break or catch up with some friends"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2018-10-08,4.0,"So I came here because my friend and I had time to spare while waiting for our boxing class to start. We were hungry and wanted a chill place to eat and grab coffee as a pre-workout meal and found this place while walking to the boxing class (right next door to shadowbox). The interior is really cute and if you download the Bluestone Lane app, you get a $5 credit that you can use (definitely worth it to download it). 

The menu has a variety of different food items as well as drink items. Although it may be a bit pricey for my taste, I was VERY pleased with my food. I got the ricotta and berry fruit toast. It was only one piece of toast but the flavors were absolutely delicious and I kept wanting more haha. But without the $5 it's on the upwards of almost $9 which was a bit...crazy for a piece of toast LOL

Anyways, despite the price, I genuinely loved everything about this place. Definitely recommend if you're in the area and are in need for a little treat!"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2020-02-15,5.0,"Delicious cold brew, fantastic ambiance, and great service. Good Saturday morning hustle without being overcrowded. We ordered the big brekkie, and the lemon ricotta pancakes. Great portions and flavor combinations. The cocktails looked good, lots of bellinis and mimosas made."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-10-11,4.0,Nice stop before heading across the Brooklyn Bridge.  The menu offers creative caffeinated and healthy beverage options. Great vibe but to a while to get our drinks. The loose leaf Chai was delicious.
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2018-12-14,4.0,"I'm always on the lookout for good avocado toast and coffee and find that Bluestone Lane does both well. It's a chain and known for their Australian coffee and while I've liked their other locations, the Dumbo one stands out more for some reason. That's not easy considering how many hip coffee spots are in this neighborhood. Bluestone has a chill inviting vibe and ample space and yes the good avocado toast, served on a thick slice of bread with oil and a healthy portion of smashed avocado (additional toppings optional)."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2018-12-13,3.0,"I've been here a few times for a latte when I am in the area and just recently tried their banana almond butter toast (I asked for no honey). The toast was pretty good and not overly priced, but the bread was really hard to eat, a little stale or over toasted. 

I would stop in again to get a drink but don't think I'm a fan of their food."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2020-02-15,3.0,First time visiting this place. I've had better service at McDonalds. We are visiting from Texas. My girlfriend and I were highly disappointed on the service we received from the initial two staff members. 3 star on the food due to my order being incorrect plus having to wait an additional 20 minutes for my plate to come out correctly while my girlfriend ate her food. Once we finished our food. It took a additional 20 minutes for our tab to come.
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-01-08,5.0,"The dirty chai only available for dine is what I dream about! Very clean and nice environment. My friends all enjoyed their coffee and tea as well. A couple in our group was from Australia and were excited to see some authentic menu items from back home.

We did not eat here, so I cannot comment on their offerings. 

Great spot to warm up after walking the Brooklyn Bridge (NYC to Brooklyn)

Disclaimer: I went to another location in Soho and was greeted with: We are out of ice! They also did not have the loose leaf chai. So, the review is applicable to the Prospect location only."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-05-04,5.0,Early breakfast spot for our foray to Brooklyn to get our touristy pics. Excellent service from Matt and the rest of the staff. We enjoyed our salmon toast and breakfast bowl along with some great coffee based pick me ups. Very happy with this choice.
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2018-06-30,4.0,"Having spent the fall studying abroad in Sydney, I was delighted to find a little piece of Australia in NYC at Bluestone Lane.

The Brooklyn location is absolutely beautiful and very spacious. There are both outlets and wifi for doing work. The wifi unfortunately wasn't working too well when I went, but that might have just been a one time thing.

The drinks are Aussie-style down to the ""iced"" lattes having actual ice cream in them! I got the iced chai which was perfectly refreshing and my boyfriend got the Aussie iced chocolate which he enjoyed thoroughly as well.

Will definitely be back to try more of the drinks on the menu and hopefully I'll be able to do work there too next time!"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-08-07,5.0,"THE BEST COLD BREW EVER!!  The brew is smooth and chocolaty.  Seriously, don't bother with Brooklyn Roastery, Bluestone's is 100x better.  And, they don't upcharge for almond milk.   We also tried an Aussie iced chocolate (which is ice cream + milk + a shot of espresso) and it was divine.  Only thing I did not like was the paper straws, which dissolved into my coffee :|"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-04-29,3.0,"Ordered ricotta & berry toast + Avocado toast with poached egg + drip coffee = $27.00. Both toast came out with a thick cut of multi grain bread. 

Both bread toasts were warmed and not crispy. 

The berry toast has so little ricotta and covered with berry flavor, nothing to rave about.

The Avocado mash is just avocado, no other flavor in addition and the poached egg is well done solid.

Only the coffee serves hot!"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-04-28,5.0,"They have a whole section of gluten-free pastries (banana bread, cinnamon banana bread, chocolate brownies), one of the reasons I fell in love with this place. My favorite was the banana bread! Staff is amazingly friendly and the place is super cute. If you subscribe to their mailing list you get $5 off."

Sat by the window; good spot to kill time and people watch."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-08-27,5.0,"Fun, friendly place.  Loved the oatmeal & salmon toast.  Nice selection of coffees, too."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2020-02-03,3.0,"This place used to have avocado toast that was to die for. Literally the best I've ever had. And it was like $9. For some reason they decided to eff it all up though. Now it's called an avocado smash. Costs $13. And is nothing like what it used to be. They used to do red pepper flakes and lemon juice but now it's feta and tomatoes, which might be tasty but I wouldn't know since I can't eat dairy. I do know that without the feta, it's very bland and still cost $13.  but I still like their varied tea options, so 3 stars."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-11-07,4.0,Amazing food! Really enjoyed the breakfast here. Only reason I put 4* is because the portions are a little on the smaller side :) still great vibe and would return
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2017-05-15,2.0,"Not the best Bluestone Lane location. 

I ordered the avocado smash ($8) with feta cheese ($1.5), cherry tomatoes ($1.5), and a poached egg ($3). An extra $3 for tomatoes and cheese? What kind of madness is this? Really not a fan of these Bluestone Lane Collective locations that tack on all the costs of these skimp add-ons. 

The toast plus a latte set me back $20+. The avocado and tomatoes were fresh, but really nothing special. The bread tasted a bit stale. Also, the toast arrived way before the drink; I finished it before I got my coffee. 

Overall, overpriced and not worth your time. You'd be better off at other Bluestone Lane locations (West Village is great), or other Brooklyn brunch places in general."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2018-11-23,5.0,"OMG for real, this place knocked my socks off! Put this in my list as a must try while I was in NYC for 48 hours and holy cow it did not disappoint! The coffee was on point and the gluten free salmon toast was RIDICULOUS! Truly, the most delicious gluten free toast I've ever had!  can't wait to go back!"
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2018-12-31,3.0,"Avocado smash is delicious! We got 2 along with a chai latte and a mocha. 

The con is it's fairly expensive (not a great value) and the place is filled with hipsters (employees and customers alike). Not the cool kind. The kind that puts on airs and pretentiously carry on like they are winning in life but in reality the parents are paying their rent, phone, and insurance."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-07-27,4.0,"I like to come here for a matcha and a light bite before work some days - the vibe is always nice, it's only occasionally too busy for a seat, and the food/drinks are always well-made and tasty. It is a tad pricey but it's basically dumbo so not overly surprising. My only bone to pick is that if you order any large iced beverage to stay, they don't have glassware that is big enough to serve it in so they always serve you in a plastic cup (not environmentally friendly)."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-08-06,1.0,"Sat down for a $20 brunch, logged into their WiFi to join a simple WebEx meeting and within 10 minutes it disconnected with a nice little message stating I've used all my bandwidth for this session.  Super convenient and very very classy."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2017-07-04,3.0,"Overhyped but it has good coffee.  

The good: 
Coffee options.  They have a unique gimmick where they serve the coffee deconstructed and you mix milk coffee yourself.  Looks fun.  I just had a latte and it was decent.

The bad: 
Latte was small, over crowded, and avocado toast was thin with barely any avocado.  I paid extra for tomato and poached eggs. The tomato it was like an after thought.  It was not worth it. 

I'd come back for coffee but it won't be my first choice."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2018-10-16,4.0,"A great little coffee shop in Dumbo! We wanted to grab a coffee before we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge, and Yelp pointed us in the direction of Bluestone Lane. Great coffee in a big, spacious location a block away from the entrance to the Bridge."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2018-06-29,5.0,"Walked across the Brooklyn bridge while on vacation to enjoy
Beautiful breakfast here. Avocado toast, perfect Flat White and Gluten Free Zucchini bread. Cool space, great service and delicious food. Highly recommend."
216,bluestone-lane-brooklyn,2019-03-22,5.0,Found NYC coffee to be rather lacking compared to Boston and other cities. But this was a wonderfully balanced and delicious cup. Also snagged a sweet banana bread and ricotta cheese breakfast. A bit pricey but alas you're in DUMBO. Terrific vibe and delightful staff.
217,ocafe-new-york,2020-01-21,5.0,"Super cute place, played great music!!!! I didn't catch the barista's name (dark skin, light eyes, hat) but he was so helpful. Very friendly, made the BEST latte I've ever had. Def bringing my friends back here"
217,ocafe-new-york,2020-02-16,3.0,"After researching on good coffee shops where to work I came across O Cafe. The place is big enough yet cosy without feeling to cramped. They arranged wide tables to share but also have a section of cute tiny single tables just to fit your cup of coffee. On the side green plants make this place very European. There is a lack of plugs to charge your laptop so go with full battery. The croissant was ok, I had better and the coffee (cappuccino) was ok. This is why I have a 3. Don't get me wrong this is a good coffee shop, but being obsessed with coffee shops myself it is not one of the top on my list in nyc! Pro: plenty of sitting, nice atmosphere."
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-08-29,4.0,"Really tasty lemon dressing for the quinoa salad. Not the most filling entree but if you're going for something super light, refreshing, and healthy, this $13.50 salad hits the spot.

Place does have a bathroom, outlets, and internet."
217,ocafe-new-york,2020-03-03,3.0,It's totally overpriced especially considering they have outposts in the New School buildings and serving the students. It should be subsidized for students.
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-08-08,2.0,I'm kinda mad that I spent $10 on a flimsy concoction between to dry a** pieces of bread. I couldn't believe how unsatisfying this excuse for food was! They should be ashamed of themselves.
217,ocafe-new-york,2020-01-17,5.0,"Had such a wonderful experience there! The avocado egg is my favorite and I always love a dirty chai, but only from the barista with the dark skin and blue eyes. And he's such a sweetheart! Amazing customer service from him and great atmosphere."
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-05-06,4.0,"Great place! Love coming here to get a coffee/tea/snack. Great chia seed pudding. Their ceramics are beautiful and the crowd seems loyal. 

Only note - please get more mugs/cups so customers can get drinks ""for here"" and not waste a to-go cup on a sit-down coffee. I've ordered a coffee to stay three times and have had them tell me they're out of mugs so it'll be in a ""to go"" cup anyway. Not a dealbreaker but not ideal"
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-03-19,2.0,"You pay for WiFI as it's NOT FREE. The first 30mins only. So certainly don't come here to work online. Great coffee but snacks and food is overpriced for what you get. I'm not very impressed with the polenta cake prices at $6, you can only taste the sugar, not the flavors. Friendly staff and pleasant ambiance. I'll come back here for coffee and chats."
217,ocafe-new-york,2018-10-11,5.0,Stoppen in here for a hot chocolate last weekend.  The staff are very friendly and it was a cute place with lots of seating.  They also had beautiful ceramic mugs.  The hot chocolate was good without being overly sweet.
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-01-18,5.0,"I've been here twice now, as it's one of my client's favorite meeting spots. It's always packed, but if you wait a bit you can usually find a spot. It's quiet enough to focus on work, but not so quiet that you can't have a conversation. The coffee is excellent (I've only had their regular coffee), and I love that they have oat milk! I also had one of their bowls, a delicious coconut rice with avocado, shaved coconut, and other veggies, served warm with a scrumptious, light sauce/dressing. The rest of the food menu looks fantastic, and I noticed lots of folks ordering their desserts, as well. 

It's a great spot to catch up on some work or meet with a friend (or in my case, a client!). Friendly staff and pleasant decor! Will absolutely be back!"
217,ocafe-new-york,2020-02-16,1.0,Rather unaccommodating when they don't have the product you're asking for. Pretty limited selection of coffee and someone rude service.
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-02-28,4.0,"Have loved coming here over the years as my go-to ""healthy"" option before or after yoga class. It's a cute spot with delicious, wholesome food, coffee and tea. Staff is friendly and upbeat. Only thing lacking is the amount of seating available. Sometimes it can get tight in there. But once your sitting down and relaxed, well worth it."
217,ocafe-new-york,2017-10-04,3.0,"It's alright here.... not really good or bad. Service guys are quick and good. Tables are everybody shared. 
I ordered 2 of Americano. 
I will try here again"
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-01-26,4.0,"Really like the food and Vibe here.  They recycle and compost. Have vegan and GF options. Committed to a well rounded healthy menu. It's is kind of pricey with the expanded food selection. That Offsets the cost of having nUt and oat milk available for all beverages. Downside: plastic straws and lots of paper cups, no stay cups. Boo. Happy 8th anniversary, hoping you look toward even more eco friendly service options."
217,ocafe-new-york,2020-01-21,5.0,"Love this place! The tan barista with blue eyes is my favorite, he's always super friendly and makes amazing cappuccinos! It's a great place to hangout, super cozy, great food and they always have good music!"
217,ocafe-new-york,2017-06-07,3.0,"OCAFE is a nice place to go in the area to kill some time and grab a coffee. I was meeting someone nearby and got there a little too early, but thankfully Yelp saved the day and recommended this place to me.

The atmosphere is pretty small and cozy. They sell wine for $10 and have three different varieties. I tried one and, while it wasn't great, it was better quality than I expected from a place that is essentially a cafe.

They have healthy food too, which I didn't get to try but might be back for someday because it looked good."
217,ocafe-new-york,2018-02-25,5.0,Very nice and friendly staff here. Really good chia seed/coconut/granola bowls or acai bowls. Enjoyable lattes. Cute decor and overall warm vibe. I enjoy coming here.
217,ocafe-new-york,2018-09-28,1.0,"Unsolicited business advice: when your payment system goes down and a customer waits 10 minutes, is asked to repeat her takeout order three times, still tips 20%, then comes back 10 mins later because the buratta is missing from the buratta salad, just apologize and add the cheese. And if you really care about repeat customers, offer at least a free cookie or coffee for the trouble. Don't debate the customer whether or not other ingredients are there and waste even more time chatting with one of the chefs about it (who then shoots a dirty look.) Just admit you messed up and move on. And give me my cheese.

Update: salad is fine, but bland. They forgot the dressing. I asked for it when I came back. Guess they ignored me/forgot again."
217,ocafe-new-york,2016-12-19,3.0,"O Cafe is a decent little coffee shop sort of in between the West Village and Greenwich Village.  It is Brazilian themed, hence the ""O"" in the name.  I am not the biggest fan of their coffee, but that is personal preference.  Their hot chocolate is amazing, though.  They also have really good pastries, such as gluten-free chocolate brownies that are amazing.  The main event pastry-with is the pao de quejo - or cheese bread.  They are little cheese bread balls that are simply amazing.  They are impossible to not stop eating.  

The staff is super friendly.  They have places to sit but have often found it hard to find a seat.  I don't know if I would come here just for the coffee, but the cheese bread is worth a trip."
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-11-25,2.0,"It's aesthetically cute, but for short people. I am six foot two and barely fit. Their coffee is decent, but a large is smaller than standard small size, and although served in the cutest of cups, for $5.00, I would expect more. Also, they were really sketchy in answering my question about the wifi, which costs money IF you don't have cable... so you essentially have to paying 100s a dollar a month for cable OR pay for wifi here. If they were upfront about it, I would be better with it, but they did just outright say I would have to pay... so I won't be back."
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-03-30,1.0,"the worst cold brew i've ever had in manhattan.

just bad bad coffee

i slimiest vomited when i took a sip

just bad coffee"
217,ocafe-new-york,2017-03-30,4.0,"Simon and Garfunkel tunes circa 1973. Rustic furniture. The arrangement of plants give the cozy place an innate bohemian feel. Great for focusing on writing and/or catch-up chat. 

Seats are hard to come by here.  Be a predator for   Me time here.  There are dates apricots bananas and apples for sale next to the baked goodies. Good mix of vegan, glut-free, and traditional. I like how the bench area seconds as storage for trash bags. Space is precious here for everyone. 

The Bar staff are witty and seem tight knit. But we're always open for random folk to join in on the fun. 

The wifi is spotty.  BYOI. 

The Butternut Squash Soup is more broth than hearty. Each spoonful has hints of warmth and savory spice.  The sunflower spelt toast was a hearty compliment. 

The Panther Drip coffee was very velvety. Multiple cups were ordered. 

Sometimes it's worth it to go out your way to be comfy."
217,ocafe-new-york,2016-05-08,3.0,"Very good chai latte, spicy and not too sweet, just the way I like it.  The latte was a bit warmer then lukewarm, so no burnt tongues if you drink too fast!

There's plenty of power sockets along the walls for people who want to work on their laptops, or someone who desperately needs to charge their phone. I generally fall into the latter category.

Like other reviewers have already stated, there is a weird odor that lingers in this cafe.  The smell hit me the moment I walked in.  There was a decent amount of people sitting, so I thought it was just me who was smelling a chlorine mop stench.

If I'm in the neighborhood, I would stop by for another chai latte, to go."
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-08-06,3.0,"This place is a cute little neighboorhood cafe with good (if overpriced) dishes and decent coffee. The one thing I can't get over is the pervasive smell in this place! It consistently smells like milk that's just gone off. Not the worst of sins, and I still pick up coffee here from time to time, but I'd be a lot more likely to stop by if I weren't greeted by this off-putting smell when I open the door."
217,ocafe-new-york,2017-12-28,4.0,"This is such a cute little place, with pretty decor, chairs and tables. Perfect spot for chatting and studying! Service is quick as well. 

This is a review just for the pão de queijo (small baked cheese roll). They are really delicious and a little chewy. It is a little expensive for such a small portion, but definitely a staple when coming here!"
217,ocafe-new-york,2020-01-14,2.0,"ok vegan veggie option, nice atmosphere, food and service could improve tremendously , got the lentil salad, i'm not sure how you mess up lentil but it needs work, also got the simple sandwich, again weak, something missing"
217,ocafe-new-york,2017-05-29,4.0,"Pros: good coffee drinks and cozy space
Cons: pastries are mediocre, and prices are quite high

We got a drip coffee, an almond croissant, a butter croissant, and the egg + avocado dish. The egg + avocado was $12 (came with 2 pieces of toast), which I found to be quite pricey. It was yummy, but I'm not sure I'd want to spend over $16 for breakfast!"
217,ocafe-new-york,2018-08-05,5.0,"Great spot close to Union Square for a coffee. Good options to eat for gluten free or vegans... Perfect lounge music that fits with the calm environment... Take a coffee break, it worth!"
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-07-08,5.0,"I met here with a long time friend I have seen in years. We met in Brazil and figured meeting up in a Brazilian cafe would be nice. It was a great choice! The guy taking orders was Brazilian and so so kind which made us feel comfortable. This place is intimate with great service, the Bahia coffee special and Hibiscus iced tea as well the ball with the cheese (I forget the name). The decor is also very creative and homey. I'll come back both for the vibes and drinks!"
217,ocafe-new-york,2019-07-18,5.0,"Very nice, small cafe.l. Friendly staff. The food looks amazing, but we took just brownie , which was very good."
217,ocafe-new-york,2016-12-12,3.0,"Cozy cafe with plenty of seating and a tad slow service. I ordered the yogurt with raw granola and bits of fruit ($6) and found it average. My friend tried the coffee and found it quite good and rich, although the cookies were below average.

The upside is all food here has gorgeous plating. Also, all ingredients here are sourced from organic and local dealers -- some several blocks up at the Union Square market."
217,ocafe-new-york,2018-10-25,4.0,"Great food! Great coffee. Love the ""Avocado Egg"" and ""Leafy Green Sandwich."" However the food is overpriced. The layout is poorly designed. The place is so cramped that you can barley walk in or out. The seats are not comfortable and some of the staff seem let's say ""less than happy"" about working there. One of them smiles but the rest make it feel like I'm interrupting their already terrible day."
217,ocafe-new-york,2016-09-21,3.0,"I had latte Bahia which tasted like a mocha latte. The coffee is nice and the store is cute, but the staff has a a little bit attitude. I am not sure if it is because I use CUPS to order or they were busy."
217,ocafe-new-york,2017-01-05,3.0,"Conveniently nestled between West and Greenwich Villages, with some of the friendliest service I've seen in a coffee shop in quite some time.

Sometimes you need an Iced Green Tea on a rainy day. Knock back a few before feverishly typing on your laptop!"
217,ocafe-new-york,2018-08-25,5.0,kale sandwich with goat cheese and olive tapenade on wheat bread for $4!! Best deal around.
217,ocafe-new-york,2018-10-18,5.0,Hot chocolate was a 4.5 and the cappuccino was a 5. Floors were quite clean though I've seen cleaner.
217,ocafe-new-york,2016-04-10,3.0,"Yes. The reviews are right. There is a distinct, not-so-charming smell of cheese that hits your nostrils upon entering. A plain croissant and latte cost me $8. More expensive than most cafes. The croissant is fried with an oil different from most bakeries; it's strong and overpowering.  A croissant should taste of dough and butter, not weird grease. I won't get it again. 

I was feelin the plant explosion walls. Wasn't feeling the smell and prices."
217,ocafe-new-york,2017-04-30,3.0,"Very tasty food, and off-duty employees gossip about customers in front of customers


On April 9, I was starving and needed a snack. I purchased the organic figs with cashew butter, and grabbed a table to eat them. The Turkish figs were amazing: great flavor, fresh and paired perfectly with the cashew butter. I never imagined putting these two items together, but I loved it!


While eating this tasty treat, I was startled by a loud laugh. I looked around to see where it came from, and made eye contact with an off-duty employee who came in to visit his coworkers. He was tall, blonde, and wearing glasses. He loudly announced that everyone needs to keep it down, because someone just gave him the eye and looked directly at me. Yes, I did look at him. To see the source of laughter, without the judgment his insecure comment imposed on me.


After leaving the restaurant, I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager on duty. After describing this person and the incident, it turns out I'm not the first person to call and/or complain about this employee and his comments. 


Based on the menu, I'll definitely stop by again to check out the food if I'm in the neighborhood. To the tragic hipster employee misinterpreting customers reactions: please be less insecure and enjoy the gorgeous weather outside when you have a day off."
217,ocafe-new-york,2016-05-23,5.0,"Love the kale sandwich, with black olive spread, goat cheese and red cabbage.
The cappuccino is smooth and not bitter. The staff is friendly and the people watching is always entertaining."
217,ocafe-new-york,2016-07-25,4.0,"Alright, I was dubious about the sandwiches because they aren't made to order, but rather sitting in the pastry case. But dang, the simple sandwich (cucumber, cheddar and butter on multigrain) was sooo good and tasted fresh. They also had a cashew milk horchata latte that was super creative and equally delicious. I love the vibe here, it feels open and chip with the big windows, plants hanging from the walls and wooden furniture. Free wifi too! Great spot for doing work near the NYU campus"

218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2020-03-01,4.0,"Removing one star because after going to this place at least 50 times, and after ordering the exact same drink every single one of those times, and after seeing one of the exact same three baristas every single one of those times.... they still act like they've never seen me before and have no idea what I'm going to order. 

Disappointing for a neighborhood place. But their matcha is still really good."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2020-05-30,4.0,"Yanni has been open and I'm grateful for it! The cold brew is amazing. I also recently had a chocolate chip walnut cookie, and it was excellent. Hopefully they'll be able to start stocking more pastries again soon as NYC slowly begins to open up!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-08-18,5.0,"AMAZING COOKIES and great service from the barista. Highly recommend the iced black tea with their chocolate chip walnut cookie or the white chocolate oatmeal one. 

Bright cafe with a few small tables - quiet enough to do work in and also for a quick catch up with a friend."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2018-12-16,5.0,"Stopped into this cozy new coffee spot for one of their cookies - homemade, thick, crispy, and doughy at the same time. An incredible and rare balance in a cookie. Also had an Americano which was smooth and a Chai Latte which was so sumptuous, with a cloud of foam at the top. It didn't have that synthetic over-gingered taste of most Chai's. I would definitely get it again. 

Their white chocolate-oatmeal cookies are incredible - hearty, mountainous, like a filling breakfast treat that's sweet and addictive. And while I'm not even a fan of white chocolate, these have won me over! I could eat two in a row.

The owner Yanni is also such a kind, hard-working guy. He left the advertising industry to open his own coffee shop, and it's so great sitting at a table, watching crowds of people scooping up his delicious cookies and coffee. Risks are worth taking. 

5 Stars!!!!!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-05-05,4.0,"It's a nice little coffee shop, their coffee bean is pretty flavorful. They seem to change them around here and there, I swear they taste different sometimes when I go there. I think it's a good idea to change them around. They are a bit on the expensive side but it's worth it if the beans are good. Today's cappuccino was a bit on the acidic side which I don't really like, but last time I had it was good so maybe next time they will switch to a better bean"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-03-07,5.0,"Fantastic little coffee shop on 7th Avenue.

I was en route to a meeting and needed a quick jolt. Yanni's could have seriously been a Pret a Manger or Dunkin' Donuts--I was running late and didn't have time to traverse all over town for a third wave cup of coffee. I just needed something even remotely resembling coffee to get be back on track from an afternoon fog. But boy was I lucky that the closest possible place for a caffeine kick was this lovely cafe.

It's bright, welcoming, charming, and has a killer selection of coffee drinks and pastries. They get their croissants and such from Balthazar, but they're very proud of the cookies baked themselves on-premise. After some internal dialog telling myself I shouldn't be eating a cookie at 2pm on a weekday, the fact that the staff were so proud of their own baked goods made me break down and try one. I was happy I did, because the walnut // chocolate chip variety was really tasty. I've tried some of the more famous cookies this city has to offer (Maman's, Levain, etc...) and this wasn't far off. Well done, gents. 

I don't live anywhere near this place, but if I were in the area again I'd happily pop in for a second go 'round."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-09-10,5.0,"Stumbled upon this cute coffee shop on my way to work. I ordered a latte that came with pretty latte art and the coffee was so smooth. They also serve Balthazar pastries , yay for almond croissants! It would be a good place to grab coffee and catch up with a friend!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-08-18,5.0,"My favorite coffee shop in the city. The inside is cozy and the coffee is amazing. I used to live right across the street and loved coming in mornings before work. I'm a little further away now but still enjoy going.

The coffee really is better than what you can get most places but the other thing that makes this place great is the friendly service. You can tell they really care about their shop and want people to be comfortable there. That's an unfortunate rarity in NYC and it's worth going here for that reason alone. The good news is they also have the best coffee in the neighborhood so there's really no reason to go anywhere else."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-10-18,3.0,"Get cookies and pastries! Absolutely worth it. The coffee is subpar, especially for an americano- watered down, they seem to stay clear from the 1:1 ratio of americano making."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2020-02-08,5.0,"Such a cute coffee shop. Super friendly service, everything is so good. Had their chocolate chip walnut cookie, it was still warm, gooey, not too sweet and just simply delicious!!!! Coffee is great and their tea too!!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2018-12-31,5.0,"So good! I came in here because of the reviews and was immediately welcomed by a gentleman who was pouring coffee with a smile. 

The coffee was great -- not burnt tasting like Starbucks, which is right down the street. The vibe is more welcoming than your average coffee shop and the service is so friendly, which really puts it over the top for me.

I'll be back the next time I'm in New York!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-07-21,5.0,"Did someone say cookies & coffee?  As a professional cookie-holic, I know I came to the right place.  Cold brew is delicious too & really chill down to earth staff."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-10-31,5.0,I stopped by Yanni's in between meetings on a recent trip in New York! The baristas were generally friendly and I found the environment to be good for working. I felt comfortable working on my laptop while I was there without much judgement which was nice. I got a cortado that was also done pretty well! No complaints here :)
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-08-15,5.0,"Yanni's Coffee serves a solid espresso with a good balance of flavors.

The staff member who served me was friendly and happy to chat while making my drink."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2020-01-30,5.0,Stepped in for a quick pick-me-up on a weekday afternoon. I found the service to be quick and with large smiles! I will definitely consider coming back to do some reading by the window (so much sunlight pouring into this spot!)
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-05-17,4.0,"I came in here on a whim while walking up 7th Avenue and just needing a quiet place to sit for a little while. This coffee shop is super cute with only 2 tables and a few bar stools. They have nice big windows and they get in a lot of natural light, which is great. The music they were playing wasn't too loud or obnoxious (which can be the case at some coffee shops), so it's a good place to get some work done if needed. They have a good selection of coffee and tea as well as homemade cookies. Definitely would recommend coming here if in the area and wanting a quieter coffee shop."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-07-01,5.0,"Love Yanni's.  Simple, beautiful setup.  Delicious flavorful coffee and tasty treats.  What else do you need?"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-02-14,5.0,"Ok I just dropped by this spot because I searched ""chocolate chip cookie"" on Yelp and needed a place close by. I relied on one review (TYSM) of their cookie and it did NOT DISAPPOINT. The ambience is cute af but I literally was in there for 2 minutes for the cookie desperation. I would come back again to try their coffee and hang. It's super clean and quiet. And the cookie is just doughy chewy goodness. Will likely be back next week to try their other flavor lol.
That is all! See you soon Yanni."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-08-28,4.0,"Cute little coffee shop in Chelsea - small venue with some window seating. Coffee taste was not the best I've ever had (americano), but the ambience was welcoming for that of a small biz. Manager was in contact to remedy the situation re: coffee taste and will give it another try!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-09-24,5.0,SO GOOD!!! I can't say enough positive things about this place. The employees are so nice and friendly. Do yourself a favor and try the vanilla latte with oat milk. I was told they make the vanilla in house and its to die for. The smoothest and best latte I've ever had. I tried both hot and cold. You can't go wrong with either. A little on the expensive side. But it's NYC  and totally worth it.
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-08-07,5.0,"Espresso is well dialed, barista is knowledgeable about the bean, origin and processing.  What more can you ask for?"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-08-15,5.0,"The best matcha in the neighborhood! Yanni and the baristas are incredibly friendly, too. I overlooked this spot the first time I walked by but now it's my go-to."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-03-30,5.0,"I was thirsty...I walked in and was charmed by th place, people making the coffee and smell. Got a cold latte. I usually add sugar buuuuuuuuut this was so good that after a sip i didnt! Great coffee"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-04-10,3.0,"Fresh modern small espresso and coffee shop at a good spot on 7;Avenue. If I wanted coffee or a favorite the flat white, I would not hesitate  stop in for one  .and a croissant!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-08-04,5.0,"Yanni's was great--loved the ambiance and decor, and their matcha latte with oatmilk is very refreshing. I've had matcha that is either too bland or overly sweet. Yanni's allows the natural flavor of the matcha to speak for itself. Will definitely be back!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-10-21,5.0,"My favorite coffee shop in Chelsea. There aren't as many seats so it's not a crowded cafe. There are plugs in both sides so as long as you can sit down, you'd be able to find a place to do some studying or work. Their coffee tastes great too. I usually get an Americano with Almond Milk. Really dependable place to get a quick cup."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-06-04,5.0,"NYC travels have enabled our delightful consumption of XRA super delicious coffee lattes, mochas and/ or their incredible chocolate chip cookies! Service is highly efficient, friendly in a very clean environment. There are limited tables, bar settings and outdoor benches There is a frequent users punch card! What else can compare"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2020-01-31,4.0,"I got an iced latte that was $5. I thought the ratio of milk to espresso was off. A little too much milk, but overall it was fine. It's pretty small inside but cute. There's seating for about 10 people with counter top style seating at the window. There's a decent amount of outlets and no bathroom sadly."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2018-12-12,5.0,"I've found my coffee nirvana and it is at Yanni's Coffee. Newly opened in Chelsea, Yanni and his barista have brought latte wonderment to the neighborhood. 
It's a block away from a Starbucks, but thankfully independence reigns and the contrast is evident from the friendliness to the drinks and nibbles.
If you're in the neighborhood and want a respite from ordinariness drop in and you'll be lucky you did."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-05-12,5.0,"LOVE this place!! Amazing coffee and cookies, they also have interesting breakfast pastries like mini monkey bread muffins. Service is always quick, even when it's crowd and the people who work here are SO NICE!!! This is my new go to for good coffee in this neighborhood."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2020-01-24,5.0,AMAZING COFFEE. Their iced latte is everything and more. Very friendly staff as well.
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2018-11-26,5.0,"Had a coffee and a chocolate chip/walnut cookie and I was treated to a little piece of heaven from both. 
In addition to great artisanal coffee and snacks, the service was friendly and swift. In fact, THE Yanni is behind the counter manning the uber-cool coffee machine. 
Great addition to our hood!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-07-22,5.0,"Wonderful, independently owned Chelsea coffee shop.  Always feel welcomed and appreciated.  Best cold brew in the neighborhood !"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2018-11-20,5.0,"Beautiful and tasty coffee shop right in Chelsea. Good music, relaxed vibe, homemade treats and delicious coffee. Just popped in here for a respite from the cold and it couldn't have been better. Well lit and spacious so it's a nice place to sit for a while or just stop in to get something to go. 

Highly recommended!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2018-12-03,5.0,"What a great addition to the neighborhood. Yianni has the best mocha in town. Try the cookies. You will not be disappointed, Oatmeal are my favorite. Chill music and relaxed atmosphere, my new spot for sure."
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-04-20,5.0,"I live for Yanni's and come in at least once a day (usually twice)! I can't say enough good things about the place -- it's a much-needed local addition to a neighborhood teeming with too many Starbucks shops. Yanni and the entire staff could not be friendlier or more welcoming. The fresh-baked cookies are heaven!! Run, don't walk!"
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-12-23,5.0,Chai is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!!!!! Highly recommend. Service was also very good. Staff is super nice and the shop is cozy.
218,yanni-s-coffee-new-york,2019-07-13,5.0,Great spot! You walk into soft jazz with a simple menu. I love the no frills and getting the coffee right. Perfect spot for a lazy Saturday morning
219,the-elk-new-york,2020-02-13,5.0,"Cute little shop. Love the vibe. The music is so good. 
Very limited seating but I went on a weekday, early evening and was able to grab a seat. The chai latte is so good!

I'll definitely be back!"
219,the-elk-new-york,2020-01-12,4.0,"Came here for the Matcha Latte. There isn't much seating and it can sometimes get crowded so you might be waiting and drifting around for a bit before you can find a seat.

I ordered the Matcha Latte with soy milk. The soy milk was surprisingly good quality, it wasn't too sweet and while it did taste of soy, it didn't reek too strongly of it. They also did a good job with the matcha, properly whisking it before pouring it into the drink.

It looked like they also served a variety of affordable breakfast options, so might have to be back in the morning when I want an easy breakfast."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-12-17,4.0,"Stumbled into this coffee shop on a Saturday morning. It's a small shop with seating for less than 10 people but it was surprisingly filled for a weekend morning. The menu is simple and it lacks extra large portions of coffee. 

I ordered a cappuccino with oat milk. The espresso is not too acidic or bitter the flavor was great with the oat milk. This is more of a grab and go place than a sit-down but I would not mind coming back if I am in the area."
219,the-elk-new-york,2020-05-13,4.0,"The Elk is open right now as a grocery store and coffee shop! The cold brew is great. My boyfriend and I also picked up some fruit and fancy crackers; in addition to the beauty/""general store"" items they typically carry, they now also have pantry items and some fresh produce in stock."
219,the-elk-new-york,2020-05-23,5.0,Their coffee drinks are great and the people who work there are really nice and friendly. I also love the design of the coffee shop and the area is really quaint.
219,the-elk-new-york,2020-05-26,1.0,"This place sucks! Coffee is not good and the workers attitudes are horrible. I will NEVER step foot in this place again. I am extremely allergic to milk, asked for a small coffee black NO MILK......guess what...they gave me milk. 
I do not like the vibe and attitude of this place. I've been living in the west village for 13 years and there are better coffee shops in the area such as Merriweather and Partners cafe. Stay clear of this place. Very snobby."
219,the-elk-new-york,2020-05-11,5.0,"Such an adorable little spot! In a beautiful neighborhood, a spot like this only adds to the charm.  Great coffee, staff, and vibe."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-02-08,4.0,"Super cute little cafe! There are limited seating options that seem to fill up quick! I definitely recommend ordering to go because people take their time. I love the fact that they asked what type of milk you want with your latte! Sometimes I forget to say almond milk! 

The kitchen is downstairs so all foods come up through a hand cranked dumbwaiter next to the barista. 

The kale Caesar salad was very good! Wished the tomatoes were cut in half but that is nothing to complain about!!"
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-11-29,4.0,"i've been here a few times. Coffee, food. The fare is good, prices in line, coffee is top shelf, as they say. It's bright, clean, open and modern, ie, upscale, befitting the ""new"" west village which is fine, and attracting its representative clientele: boutique shoppers, models, people who feel entitled to bring their dogs inside food shops, locals old and new, and of course the laptop enthusiasts. So be it. It's quiet and comfortable, with delicious coffee and croissants and a nice place to sit for a little while with a book or catching up on the news or hanging with a friend.

So here's why I'm taking the trouble to write this review: There seem to be a few complaints in this review thread from fellow yelpers about the seating allocation in this space regarding laptops. There are five small round tables that can sit two people each, and there's also a window counter with bar stools where another half dozen people can sit. The house rule is that if you're gonna go laptop, you should sit at the counter, and if you're gonna socialize or read a book, you can sit at the tables.

If anyone doesn't see the logic of this, maybe I can help. People who bring laptops to cafes to do work tend to stay forever. That's how it is. Sure, people feel entitled to do this, you know, ""free country"" and all, but it's selfish, and it's not helpful for the cafe's bottom line and it alienates the nonworking people who just want to hang out for a little while and have a coffee and relax. If you're working, you should probably go to a work space -- there's a ton of these -- or a library or a big cafe or just work at home. 

Small friendly nonfranchise cafes are an increasingly scarce commodity on Manhattan Island, especially those with excellent coffee. Relish and preserve them, don't obliterate them with your jobs. Have a sense of where you are and try to enhance it. It's not about wokeness, it's about awareness and paying attention. If you do this, I and ten thousand other people will thank you."
219,the-elk-new-york,2020-04-03,5.0,Best breakfast/brunch in town. The people here are amazing. Neighborhood staple no lie. Eggs are always on point and the Customers are always happy. That's the best pulse check on a restaurant you could ever have.
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-03-26,4.0,"I profess a serious weakness for coffee shops in the West Village, a sentiment shared by the rest of the population, as demonstrated by the fact that I came here once before with my best friend on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and every single seat was taken. Especially when a cafe hits the holy trinity: free WiFi,* some amount of seating for NY standards, and working bathroom. 

Although my latte was perfectly serviceable, the best thing I had all week was definitely the pistachio cardamom loaf - moist and buttery enough without being overly sticky, beautiful hint of cardamom. I did that undignified gesture of tilting the bag back so I could get all the crumbs. The barista was a sweetheart who said the slice she cut was a bit small and charged me a little less. 

They won't chase you out if you choose to spend three hours here wrapped up in a book or talking to a friend but at least my rule of thumb is to buy something for every hour or so I'm at a cafe. The sun falling in from outside and the quietness of the cobble street makes this a really pretty place to get work done. Plus the food looked/smelled amazing. 

*Which brings me to the laptop policy. The Elk tries to be ""fair"" and divides up the room so that, if you need to work on your laptop, you sit on the uncomfortable, backless stools to the left as you come in, while the comfier seating to the right is reserved for reading and conversations. My question is - why dis-incentivize laptop use but still offer free WiFi if people can be equally disconnected and watch stuff on their phones? Is it just the keyboard typing that's too distracting? I would disagree after sitting next to someone who refused to disable the keyboard sounds on their phone. This is all something I spend too much time ruminating about."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-05-11,5.0,"Got the tropical smoothie on a gorgeous spring day here and it was the perfect companion for a stroll: coconut milk, mango and more deliciousness. So refreshing, like a mango lassi but less thick and more interesting ingredients in it."
219,the-elk-new-york,2020-02-11,5.0,"Love it here, such a cozy spot to sit and read! I got a latte and Greek bowl! The costumer service was amazing!"
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-04-14,5.0,"The west village has many options when it comes to coffee shops. I've been to a few and I haven't loved any in particular, they were okay.

This morning I decided to give the elk a try, and I'm so glad I did!
As I waited on line I noticed the pastries, they had gluten free options! Which is always a huge plus!
I ended up getting the Cardamon loaf cake and an ice coffee with oat milk. 
The service is awesome, they were nice and quick ! 
The price wasn't too bad.
I will definitely return when I'm in the area."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-08-04,4.0,Ordered an almond milk latte iced- it was over $6. It was strong and really tasty. The straws they have are compostable which is awesome. Would visit here again!
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-12-18,4.0,"Are we still using the word Yuppie in 2018? If so, let me say that The Elk personifies Yuppie culture more than any other coffee shop I've visited in NYC.

Formerly Mojo, a subdued coffee shop that at least harked back to prior eras, the Elk has embraced the contemporary West Village in all of its glory. Think fluorescent lighting and overly photogenic, ostensibly light and healthy food options.

Nonetheless, who am I to talk, as I live around the corner, and they do make the best cup of coffee west of 7th Avenue, so I keep coming back."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-07-01,4.0,"Stopped in on a weekday morning around 8am. Got the avocado toast and an iced americano.

The avocado toast was pretty delicious- I love that they add lemon juice to the avocado to brighten it up. It did take a little while to come out, and my friend who ordered the scramble was already more than halfway done by the time I got my food.

The americano was good- pretty standard, really. Overall it's a cute place and I was surprised that they had so many food options because it looks like just another little coffee shop. I'd definitely stop by again."
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-05-25,5.0,"Seriously my favorite coffee shop in the West Village. 

Sat here probably for 3 hours. It is fairly small but I love how cozy and intimate it is. I wouldn't come here with a group of people because the place is small, but its great if you come with a friend or by yourself. 

Loved the coffee here! I got a cappuccino, a latte and a matcha latte and all were so good!! The food is very good - everything from backed good, to avocado toast, to eggs, to sandwiches, to soup - you name it. Simple and delicious food, though a bit overpriced, portions are generous. 

The staff is really nice and friendly. 

Would definitely recommend"
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-06-06,4.0,"A well-designed, intimate space if you're looking to catch up with a friend and chat. They have several tables designed specifically for laptop-free use (so, maybe not the best go-to option if you're looking to do an hours-long marathon of work, especially since it was pretty crowded on a Saturday afternoon). 

They do have a small counter area outside the storefront for you to place your coffee on, if you'd like to read and just have somewhere to put your drink. A particularly innovative design considering how limited seating is on the inside."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-04-06,1.0,"Been coming here for awhile (practically twice a week at least) but the service is really disappointing. The shop itself is gorgeous and a warm west coast feel. However, the staff (with the exception of one wonderful gentleman) is very rude and makes poor quality drinks. I have ordered oat milk matchas from here that were full of disgusting clumps. The one time I asked a barista to remake it she was incredibly rude. Today, I ordered an almond milk dirty chai. Upon receiving the chai I asked to confirm the barista if she put almond milk in it... to which she replied no. I then told her I asked for almond milk and if she could remake it and then she said ""oh actually I THINK I put almond milk in it."" 
Needless to say, as someone with lactose intolerance I felt anxious drinking the chai but I felt uncomfortable with the barista's way of avoiding remaking the drink. 

I also find it weird that there are sooo many reviews like this but no response from the shop owner? I'm assuming they don't care. Anyways, the worst barista is a tall brunette who typically works on Saturday's so avoid the shop then or at least don't expect good service"
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-08-28,4.0,"Friendly staff. 
AMAZING veggie bowl, seriously. Vegan friendly.
Dog treats. 
Free wifi. 
Good music. 
Tap water open for grabs. 
WaterCloset. Clean. 
The only downfall was that my matcha latte was too cold, twice. Beautiful foam art though."
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-11-19,5.0,"I've only gotten their latte and sat to read a book. What a pretty cafe! It was a bit crowded but I eventually got a table. Love the natural light here, and the cobble stone streets nearby, definitely one of those coffee places that put you in a good mood!

They also sell some small knick-knacks on the side wall."
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-10-20,4.0,"This is a great cafe if you can actually get a seat at decent hours. Every time I'm here it's filled completely and there really isn't anywhere to sit. If you do get a seat, it's a comfortable place with pleasant natural light and an iconic West Village view.

My cappuccino was fine, just what I'd expect.

The tables are laptop-free zones so if you want to work on your laptops you'll have to sit on the stools."
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-10-27,4.0,"If you like good coffee, this tiny shop in the West Village is worth checking out. I've tried their cappuccino, chai, and a plain old cup o' joe - all three were great. If I were rating on the drinks alone, I would give this place five stars.

Unfortunately, the space leaves something to be desired. Tables, stools, and people are packed into this tiny room, it feels like you're climbing on top of one another just to get your order, take a seat, or make your way to the bathroom.

Even though there is free WiFi and laptops are allowed at the bar/stool area, I would say this is the kind of place to get a delicious, well-made drink to go. There are other cafes a short walk away that are much more read-work-coffee date friendly."
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-08-12,1.0,"I am so so sorry but i need to rate this place 1 start and the only reason is because the barista was so rude and so unprofessional, i can't accept that.
Unfortunately if you work at a coffee shop and you deal with people daily and constantly you should love to be around and in front of people.
Her name is Katelen i believe.

Besides this little accident that ruined my afternoon at the Elk, i love the spot, it's small and cozy."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-07-03,5.0,"I almost don't want to write a review about this place, but for the past two years, I consider it my oasis. It's not just that the food is amazing, or the coffee great, or the ambiance just oh so perfect. It's Christina and Greg and the rest of the amazing team. 

I read through some of the * reviews here and you know - you're the kind of people everyone shakes their head when we see you interact with staff. Yes, lady - you who demanded the manager squeeze a croissant to prove it's soft. You buddy who ordered a cold brew and then complained it was, cold. You mate, who spilled your coffee on the counter and didn't even apologize.

In coffee shops, as in life, you get what you give. So give some love, smile and see what happens next time you're there."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-10-11,2.0,Service is fine but I came here to do work and was told no computers at the tables. I find this incredibly odd and am upset as I only came here to do work. So I had purchased food and drink only to have to finish it quickly to go find another place to go where I had to buy another drink so I could stay.
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-06-14,5.0,"My friend first introduced me to this place a couple months ago, when i moved into the neighborhood, and this cafe has constantly been on my mind since then. Their food is healthy yet filling and extremely flavorful. I've had the breakfast burrito, avocado banh mi, and spicy chicken sandwich - all of which are amazing!! My goal is to try everything before my lease is up!"
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-11-28,5.0,I've been here a few times and it's such a cute coffee shop. There are a few tables but it can get crowded. The space itself lets in a lot of sunlight and the staff is very friendly. I would definitely recommend checking it out!
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-10-11,1.0,"Rude service, overpriced items, their wifi doesn't work. Will not come again, go somewhere else"
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-05-13,4.0,"Went here with a friend to grab a drink and a small bite to eat. 

I ended up ordering an iced chai tea and a small peanut butter cookie. Both the chai tea and cookie were tasty, and the bite I had of my friend's chocolate sea salt cookie was also good as well.

The one downside here is that there is not a ton of seating and the space is relatively small, but a cute spot nonetheless."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-01-15,4.0,"The first time I visited The Elk was a few years ago and Julianne Moore was sitting at a table, casually enjoying breakfast. I haven't seen her there since, but The Elk has since turned into one of my regular spots to grab a coffee or chai when I'm in the area. 

If you're looking to snag a table and enjoy a coffee with some friends on a weekend morning, good luck to you: The Elk gets slammed, so I usually end up getting my drink to go. On weeknights, it turns into a more low-key, quiet space, usually with a few people getting work done on their laptops. 

In short: solid coffee shop with great drinks, but you'll either have to pounce on a table the moment it's vacated or go during off hours to get a seat."
219,the-elk-new-york,2017-05-30,5.0,"Beautiful (but small) coffee space with very friendly staff! There is only 2-3 tables and some bar area to set up camp at. 

I ordered a mocha with skim milk. It was delicious, perfect temperature, and decently priced. The coffee art was beautiful. 

Definitely swing by here for coffee on the go or a quick cup of joe with your boo."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-03-19,5.0,Absolutely loved this coffee shop. Cute and quaint. Has excellent coffee. They gave me a 10% off on yelp which I thought was very sweet as many places don't do that. This place not only has great coffee and atmosphere but also great customer service. Can't wait to go back tomorrow
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-05-21,5.0,"I love this spot in the west village !! My friend introduced me to it and I will be coming back many times in the future !

What I got :
The matcha latte, green smoothie with no honey, and the scrambled egg plate. 

The scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and came with sweet potatoes and tomato ( which I opted not to get). The matcha latte was really good (although I should have gotten it cold on such a warm day. The smoothie was really good ! It had cucumber and kale and mint which had a refreshing taste. 

My friends got sandwiches and they looked so good ! I definitely want to try one next time !"
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-08-15,4.0,"Nice spot for breakfast and a lite lunch.  A bit more expensive, but the food was good!"
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-12-16,5.0,"Good things do come in  small packages. Always crowded, and for good reason. The coffee and teas rival any other NYC establishment. Along with a cappuccino, I purchased a gluten-free peanut butter cookie (btw, love gluten) and one bite and my mouth leaped for joy. It was just a tad sweet but that didn't stop me from taking down another! Along with coffee and tea and munchables, there's an assortment home goods (think candles and such) which are all organic and stuff...a gift to yourself and to your home for sure."
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-08-24,2.0,The iced matcha latte was terrible. Was a brownish green color and was premade. Waste of $6
219,the-elk-new-york,2018-11-04,4.0,"I really enjoyed it here! The ambiance is very nice, but seating area is limited. I came in at around 9 am on a Thursday and all the seats were taken. Iced coffee was strong and the chocolate croissant was delicious. I'm glad I discovered this place - it's not too far from work!"
219,the-elk-new-york,2019-12-15,5.0,"The Elk is a cozy, cute spot in the heart of West Village. Service is fast, coffee is amazing and the food is very delicious. Staff is very nice and helpful. I highly reccommend visiting The Elk."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-29,5.0,"Want the perfect cookie? Then look no further! Chip offers your classic chocolate chip, but also layers on fun seasonal flavors!

They are really big and can be split!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-05-07,1.0,"This place sucks came to Chip store on Bleecker street the 2 girls working there refuse to take my order online they said it's 7:25 we can't take orders past 7:00.
Where is this said on the website.
Many stores would love to get business now Chip has the wrong reps in store handling this.
You would think Chip and these reps would be more sim pathetic toward people spending there money coming out to support them to then be treated like this"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-04-04,4.0,"Cookies are pretty good. Definitely not levain level though (but similar price level to Levain). There is a larger variety of flavors than Levain, and also the lines are much shorter. 

They are fairly big (just like Levain) so one is probably good enough for at least 2 people. I did find then to be a little too sugary. 

This place first appeared on our radar due to the selection. But keep in mind that they only have 4 flavors at any one time. So if you want to come check the options online and figure out the best day(s)."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-03-08,1.0,"Believe me, I love CHIP Cookies and think they are the greatest cookies on this planet. However, this location is terrible.

I came in this Friday for their all day, 4 different flavors of cookies n cream (plain, PB, chocolate chip, and s'mores). It was only 8pm. The place was packed with a huge line. I was getting so excited to order all the cookies which I saw advertised on both the menu website online and Chips Instagram - all day long. After 5 minutes or waiting, the cashier told us that they ran out of ALL the cookie flavors and they would be having 4 other basic flavors (Funfetti, s'mores, PB&J, and chocolate chip).

Clearly the management team doesn't understand how their advertising will draw in a bunch of people to the store. They should know the amount of cookie dough to make when they advertise an all day cookies and cream event. Yes - I may sound salty about this  but I feel that I've been lied to. Take advertisement. I probably won't be coming back again for a while because of their false advertisement!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-05-29,1.0,I simply did not like these cookies.  I found them to be too cakey.  I prefer my cookies gooey with a crunchy outside.  And the girl behind the counter was not at all nice.  I waited in line for this?  There are way better cookies in the city.  I'll pass.
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-21,5.0,"OMG. Best cookies? Ummm. If not the best, I can't recall any  better as far as a soft, gooey, melt in your mouth yumminess. 

Wow! So happy we stopped here. It's not as ""Insta-worthy"" as many dessert spots, but for sheer smells when you walk in and tastes when you eat, you'll have a hard time beating Chip. 

Definitely come and get some warm cookies here. 

Only sad that we couldn't try more flavors."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-11,5.0,"Hands down the BEST cookie I've had in NYC so far. My friend and I both fell in love with the Vanilla Dulce Crumble, a soft cookie oozing with creamy dough and dulce de leche. Surprisingly, this cookie didn't induce any sugar sweats even though it was large enough to last two servings.

My rankings: 
Chip
Duchess
City Cakes
Gooey on the Inside
Schmackary's
Levain Bakery"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-16,4.0,"After dinner in the West Village we walked over here at about 7pm on a Friday. Lucky for us - a new batch of chocolate chip was coming out of the oven! 

The cookies are served, warm, soft and gooey. I'm not sure how they even are able to pick them up and put them in a box with how dense and  full of filling they are. But MY oh my was this a delicious find. 

I am already planning on returning during my next trip to NYC to try different flavors. 

Deducted a star because the bro's working were a bit meh and rude when we were just looking around. (The bf was trying to check if there may have been additional seating in the back and the guy behind the counter rudely shouts - EMPLOYEES ONLY BACK THERE! in a very defensive manner). The cookies made up for it and I assume that the rest of the staff doesn't treat patrons this way."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-28,4.0,"I've been to Chip three times now, once during valentines day weekend and once the weekend after. Chip is definitely an asset to the West Village, and with its rotating menu, offers something different than most of the surrounding dessert shops. 

There are four flavors a day at Chip, and at this point, I have tried the Classic Chocolate Chip, the Red Velvet, the Funfetti, the Cookies and Cream, and the Strawberry and Cream. Cookies like chocolate chip and funfetti are delicious, but how stand-out they are depends on the batch -- if you get a gooey, warm one, they are outstanding. If you get one that has been sitting out for more than a few minutes, it is less impressive, and more of just a thick cookie. 

The stuffed cookies are delicious, but I found both the red velvet (which wasn't red velvet at all -- it was a regular cookie dyed red, stuffed with nutella. No cream cheese to be found) and the strawberries and cream to be overly-sweet. 

I will continue to return to Chip to try out some of their other flavors, and think that one of the only improvements to be made would be to warm up any cookies that have been sitting out for more than a few minutes -- that way each guest would get the gooey, warm treat that has given Chip such a good reputation."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-05-19,4.0,"I managed to scoot in here mid-March, meaning early into quarantine and before they temporarily closed prior to resuming quarantine contact-less operations. My online order box of 6 (for value) was ready to go and sitting in the front window under the watchful eyes of two gentlemen working and double checking order names/pickup times. The smells inside the bakery were intensely buttery and sweet so hopefully those are still wafting as I type. On their Instagram @chipnewyorkcity and website, they post their daily flavors with a constant being either chocolate chip or walnut chip, and then three other rotations including the ones in my attached photos. I ordered two chocolate chip, two cookies and cream, one peanut butter chocolate and one vanilla dulce crumble. Out of all four flavors, vanilla dulce crumble was the one I could've gone without. Mostly tasting like a well made pie dough in a cookie-texture topped with a stiffer coffee cake-like crumble on top--imagine alfajores meets brown butter cookie--it just wasn't for me. A friend tells me that blueberry cheesecake is the one to wait for however the new addition of banana nut oat also beckons a taste. If you're the only person in your household who consumes sweets like me, six cookies will last you a very long while, depending on how quickly you can polish them off!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-01-20,4.0,"O yea .... served warm soft and gooey !!! 

Had to double park & let the wife run in ...

The chocolate chip was super yummy with the perfect crisp top & bottom but in the middle was a melted gooey explosion of more chocolate chip goodness .... Got Milk ?? Your gonna need it !!!

The others in the tin are chocolate peanut butter & cookies & cream along with another chocolate chip which we dropped off at my brothers  house .......

Nice lil cookie shop super clean but small, seating for maybe six people .... 

If your in the area it's worth definitely worth it !!!
This is an adult cookie spot the cookies are huge !!!

Tips; get plenty of napkins & make sure you got milk !!!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-25,4.0,"Thank god there is officially another location of Chip in the city! I may or may not have been depressed when the Gansevoort Market location closed down but was elated to hear that it was because they had relocated to the West Village. It's great that they have a rotating menu and fun seasonal flavors. My personal favorite is Cookies n Cream and I get a little way too excited when I see it's on the daily menu. So why four stars instead of five? Because of their boxes. That sounds like a lame reason but if I get a box of cookies and it can't even close properly so the employee has to tape it closed (which ended up being futile) and it's raining cats and dogs outside, it can get annoying because I'm not exactly trying to have soggy cookies lol. Either way, Chip is still amazing as always."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-11-08,5.0,"This would have been my first time trying out Chip and was every disappointed after arriving that they only have four flavors of cookies there.

I was planing on getting the box of five get one free deal but that was reduced to just getting two cookies since there were no S'mores. I got Chocolate Chips and Peanut Butter & Jelly. 

On the way home I was even contemplating giving them three Stars because I traveled from 53rd St to 4th St to get to the shop.

Well it was a chilly night and after I got home I nuked the PB&J for like 10 seconds in the microwave. I split it open and it was breaking apart but I can see that it was covered with what look like peanut butter chips like Reese's and the center had creamy peanut butter from those melted chips and jelly that was sealed inside before baking.

I then began to eat it and It was peanut heaven in my mouth, a soft peanut tasting cookie with a thin thin crisp outer shell, creamy super peanut butter center with a layer of jelly, and some peanut butter chips falling out. 

They need to change the name to Triple Peanut Butter and Jelly.

3 Stars ? No No No, 5, 6, maybe 7 Stars for that cookie alone it was good."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-10-25,5.0,"The new Chip is finally open!

After at least a year, the vacant storefront on Bleecker Street is open at last, in a nice, big space. They are finally back in Manhattan after their exit from the depressing Gansevoort Market.

As always, there was just a huge line on opening day for their free cookie giveaway. I had to get the Cinnamon Roll, only available here, and one of each of the rest of the excellent menu.

This is a perfect location and much more convenient than the Queens ones, so I'll be here a lot."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-05-04,5.0,"This is such a cute place to stop for a quick treat + rest your feet from all the walking you've probably done! There was not a ton of seating, so be prepared if you are visiting at a popular time of year. The cookie was super dense and I could not finish half of it. Be prepared to take back leftovers!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-10-28,4.0,"I dare you to try walking by this place, with the smell of cookies baking, and not go inside.  Resistance is futile.  Just go in and order yourself a massive cookie.

This store appears to have just opened and it was packed.  We got 2 chocolate chip cookies.  They also had chocolate peanut butter chip cookies and there were 2 other varieties as well.  

They were quickly filling in the trays with fresh batches as soon as cookies quickly sold out.  The cookies are the kind that are en vogue now, massive, thick and partially baked.  The cookies were delicious, but they are heavy.  Sharing with someone else is probably a good idea.

They also have coffee, espresso, etc., so they have some caffeine to wash down all that sugary goodness."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-14,5.0,"Wow, we are probably Chip's best customers here at Kiehl's. We ordered cookies so often, we even did a custom catered order for someone's birthday. I'm surprised we're not all 10 lbs heavier yet. Anyway, we are obsessed with chip and their delicious cookies. They are MASSIVE, but you keep wanting to come back for more because of the awesome flavors. Some of my faves: blueberry cheesecake, chocolate chip (classic), triple chocolate, peanut butter & jelly and butterscotch. Funfetti isn't really up there for me, it's too dry in my opinion. Overall, best cookies EVER."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-01-26,4.0,"So I decided to come visit one of their many locations thru out the N.Y.C. area, I picked this particular one, because it wasn't to far from where I already was. It's a Friday so I wanted some good wine and some chocolate, two of kind pairing. Any who, what I didn't know about this place, and I don't think anyone mentioned this, or I may have forgotten about this for whatever reason, but I'm leaving it clear for those of you who don't know, forgotten, and those of you who actually read my reviews.

THEY ONLY DO FOUR KINDS OF COOKIES PER DAY!!! 

Now with that being said you better call and find out what they have before you hope in an Uber or Lyft, Bus ride, train ride, car ride etc. I was just looking at pictures on this particular day getting all caught up with the scrumptious I was looking at only to arrive and they had no cookie I was into at all. So I decided to go basic and get a regular chocolate chip and some Sprinkle Fetti chip for my kids. They prefer the chocolate chip over that Sprinkle one, but said it was still good. Both cookies I will admit was tasty, kind of reminds me of another particular famous chocolate chip cookie here in N.Y., but that one has walnuts in them and is way better. Look through my reviews and it starts with a L. ends with Bakery.
Anyway I would definitely try more of their cookies but  not without making a call of course.
F.Y.I. -the cookies are crunchy on the outside edges and soft and chewy in the inside, Its a really good cookie."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-10-29,5.0,"As I stood in the insanely long line outside for opening day, people would walk by and ask, ""Standing in line for a cookie? Really?"" but I'm telling you, they're worth it!! 

These cookies are so delicious and HUGE - definitely reccomend getting a few different types and sharing amongst friends. The menu offerings change daily, but there's always a great variety to choose from. My favorites are the pb&j, butterscotch toffee, and can't go wrong with the classic chocolate chip! 

So glad to finally have a location that's convenient for me - but it's impossible to walk by without being tempted by that fresh baked cookie smell!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-01-15,4.0,"Not only are these cookies very heft in portion, but they're delicious too! Their new location on Bleecker Street is fabulous and a great addition to the neighborhood. I've tried six flavors so far: Funfetti, Chocolate Chip Walnut, Cookies N' Cream, Peanut Butter Chocolate, S'Mores, and Oatmeal Apple Pie. My favorites are the Funfetti (any sugar cookie lover will be happy with this) and the Chocolate Chip Walnut (simple and decadent), with S'Mores in third place. 

I've eaten them warm off the Chip tray, at room temperature, and warmed up in a microwave - all were delicious, just depends on what you're in the mood for and the type of cookie! 

Next on my list of flavors to try are the Peanut Butter & Jelly, Butterscotch Toffee, and some of their seasonal specials like Pecan Pie. Can't wait!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-11-10,4.0,"When I heard they were doing holiday flavors I knew I had to go. So far I've gone twice and had:

Sweet potato s'mores: really good. Not as brownie-like as Levain, but still soft and gooey in the center. This one's got more crunch on the outside. 

Pumpkin spice latte: ok this was amazing. I'm still thinking about it sometimes. There was this warm filling inside that tasted like a pumpkin mocha. If this flavor was able to stay all year I would be coming back literally every week. 

Although I would say cookie-wise they don't exactly match up to Levain (although they are still great), they are equal because Chip has a much bigger variety of flavors. They switch up the daily flavors which is nice."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-11-06,5.0,"Mmmm cookies!  If you're looking for a beautiful picture perfect cookie with some weight and some fun flavors, drop by Chip!  Their new location is perfect for walking in with a hungry tummy and walking out with a cookie in hand to relish on the go or to enjoy inside in their (limited) seating. 

They offer a rotating menu with flavors like chocolate chip (generously studded) and ones like blueberry cheesecake (with a real fluffy and creamy center and freeze dried blueberries!) and glazed pear (fragrant, festive, and beautiful). They go for $3.50 a cookie. There's also a buy 5 get 1 free deal that's always good news!  :)

I like these cookies better than Levain for the more varied menu, being less crumbly/bready, fresher tasting, and a lot cuter, hehe. These cookies are AWESOME cold from the fridge if you like them dense and chewy!  

The workers were nice, and the place is clean. Only negative is that they don't have a public restroom despite looking like they'd be big enough to offer one.  I'd come back for the cookies for sure next time I'm in the area! :D"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-16,4.0,"I've been wanting try Chip cookies for a while now - one of my foodie friends says it's her favorite cookie place in NYC. Finally had the chance to try it this Valentine's Day weekend. We went early afternoon on Saturday and there wasn't any line but there were about a dozen people sitting inside the shop eating freshly bought cookies. The four flavors that were there that day were XOXO Funfetti, Chocolate Chip, Red Velvet Hot Chocolate, Strawberries n Cream. If you're like me and want to know what flavors are available before you go to the store, their menu is online on their website with the daily flavors posted for the week. We got a box of 6 (it's buy 5 get 1 free; also if you pay cash there's a discount!). My favorite flavor by far was the red velvet hot chocolate - it's extremely instagrammable and when you break the cookie open, it's ooooozing chocolate!! Chocolate chip is  also a great option if you're into the OG classic flavors. One cookie is definitely more than enough to fill you up, but I recommend buying a couple to go for later during the day!

If I were to compare these cookies to other shops' cookies that I've had, I'd rate these a 8.5/10. I love how they have different flavors every day and I'm especially a sucker for cookies that have a filling (like red velvet hot chocolate). Will definitely be back another day to try other flavors!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-06-07,5.0,"Soooo so so so good.  Super soft and melty on the inside, great flavor options, and really nice people who work there!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-12-14,4.0,"We went here early, when they open, on a cold winter Saturday morning. Probably the best time to go since the cookies are out the oven and ready to be gobbled up with coffee. So yummy.

We ordered 10 cookies to go for an event. One of each type. I liked the pecan. The smores and chocolate chip were a bit too sweet for my liking. Cookies were more like cakes. All were made well with quality. 

We'll come back soon. Please keep making wonderful stuff. Recommended!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-12-23,5.0,"Chip cookies are PHENOMENAL! They are legit my favorite brand of cookies. I will schlep all over the city to buy these. I have no idea how they get the outside to be perfectly crisp but the inside to stay gooey and moist. They are so perfect. 

Give this place a try and you won't regret it! My favorite is the funfetti!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-12-06,5.0,"The line is worth it. I could write more but then the line will be longer next time....

Ok... its delicious. Imagine a pregnant cookie. A gooey cookie within a cookie. That is what happened here. It is supremely thicker than the average cookie and dense. If you get any of these, don't eat an hour before. You will be in a sugar coma and uncomfortable.  Also, this would not be the day to wear skinny jeans."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-12-02,5.0,"Hands down the BEST cookies in NYC. I went around the city to try 6 of the top cookies spots to determine the winner and while it was a close call with Levain, Chip won! The warm & gooey centers complemented the exquisite flavor you would hope for in a cookie. I got both the classic chocolate chip and the blueberry cheesecake. Even between these two, it was hard to determine which was better! This will be my go to spot for cookies in the city from now on."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-11-03,3.0,"The buzz on this place is so crazy I had to give it a try. Stopped by last night and was glad to see no crowds. 

I kept it OG and ordered a ChocChip. The closest thing I can compare it to is Levain, but it's far from being as good as that. This cake was cakey, but still tasty. 

This could have been a better experience but the gentleman at the register told me they don't serve tap water. My girlfriend was thirsty and requested it, but he recommended the $3 water instead of just pouring some water from the sink behind him. We didn't mind buying water but she just needed a sip to clear her throat. 

We were pretty annoyed by that, especially since that's illegal but it's whatever. 

Try it out for yourself, maybe try getting a cup of water!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-12-29,5.0,"So glad this finally opened in the Village, as I'd been trying to find an excuse to go try it out in Queens. 

These are some of the best cookies in NYC. Perfect exterior, just enough crunch while still being chewy. And on the inside? Just the most spectacular ooey-gooey ess you could ask for. 

So glad I brought a bunch back to Chicago with me. Excellent!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-12-02,5.0,"4.7/5.

Top 2-3 cookies in Manhattan. Pretty empty on a saturday night after 8pm. Comparable to Levain but just missing their level. Nice to have a new go to dessert place in the west village. $3.50 per cookie and the size is perfect. Crispy, warm on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. Cant wait to come back and try their other options. 

Note: the flavors are not always available everyday. Apparently you need to check the website or call to see whats available."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-11-24,5.0,"OK, I had a wonderful work-related excuse (not that you need one) to buy all the available flavors at Chip these past two days and tried a little bit of each. In short, Chip is great at delivering consistently crispy on the outside, soft on the inside cookies and the rotating offering of flavors will keep me coming by whenever I'm in the neighborhood.  Is it the best cookie in the city? IMO you have to compare each flavor within its own category and some definitely come out on top.  The chocolate chip is NOT the best I've had (Levain is still the champ) but other cookies are unique and scrumptious and deserve recognition. My take on the seven I tried, in order of preference: 

Pear - the only of its kind! Sweet with a perfect touch of autumnal spices, like eating the inside of a holiday pie, with bits of pear throughout.

Nutella sea salt - tied for first. Not as sweet as expected,  more complex and nutty, oozing with nutella filling with a pleasant salt after note.

Cookies and cream - really good! Rich and indulgent, a soft and creamy cookie,  totally spot on. 

Sweet potato s'mores - the most Insta worthy. Not overly sweet with a good balance of sweet potato flavor and a hint of toasted marshmallow from the topping. 

White chocolate cranberry - the best of the standard flavors as compared others of its kind. Great variation of texture,  a bit of ooey gooey batter in the middle, contrasted with crunchy oats, juicy cranberries, and sweet white chocolate morsels. 

Chocolate chip - thick and chocolatey; good, but not as good as Levain.

Chocolate peanut butter - it's fine and chocolate and peanut butter are always good; but this rendition is nothing special.

Oh yeah, we also tried the matcha latte and a mocha-- both were lukewarm and just okay, even though the guy making them took time and was very nice.  Plain old milk is probably the way to go!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-03,5.0,Love love love chip! I have tried basically every flavor cookie on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet! My go to fave is definitely the chocolate chip but I would recommend exploring and trying all the flavors! Everytime I'm in the neighborhood I have to stop by chip!
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-19,3.0,"A friend and I enjoyed warm, gooey cookies at Chip last night.  We split the s'mores and the triple chocolate.  The favorite was the triple chocolate.  They also sell them for a decent price.  Great spot if you're looking for a sweet pick-me up."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-04-04,5.0,my fat ass could not choose just one so i got them all for the day that i went! you honestly cant go wrong with chcolate chip it was just so solid and delicious. its the perfect cookie becuase the outside has a crunch but the inside is soft and gooey! i love when its both crunchy and gooey.
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-03-12,5.0,"For $3.50, Chip is a sweet deal you just can't pass up. Their cookies are wonderfully decadent and rich and gooey and everything else a glorious cookie should be. With the popularity of the store, they're constantly turning out new batches, and you're guaranteed to get a nice, warm treat. I tried the chocolate chip, PB&J, and vanilla dulce de leche, the latter being the best for sure. Expect chocolate melting onto your fingers, caramel dripping down your elbow, and disappearing into a soft baked world of nostalgia as you remember eating your moms cookies right out of the oven-- except these are probably 10939281 times better. Sorry mom (;"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-12-25,5.0,"Words cannot describe the excitement of having the Chip franchise come to Manhattan. As a Manhattan dweller, I am more than willing to make the commute out to Astoria just to satisfy a craving from one of the best offerings in the city. With this new location, this is the go-to place for cookies for the foreseeable future. Let's face it, most Manhattan folks are unaware of the great local businesses and foods in other boroughs. All the Manhattanites I speak to would tout Levain as the best, but Chip is right up there in my opinion.  The chocolate chip cookie is soft, chunky, and melts in your mouth with every bite. The Chocolate Chip Walnut and Triple Chocolate are both favorites, and the Carrot Cake is one that is criminally underrated. It's hard to get a cookie box (of 5 and get 1 free) without stressful deliberation on the variety when they are all so good!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-01-26,5.0,"These cookies are phenomenal. On our first visit, we tried the walnut chocolate chip and the vanilla dulce crumble. Both were delicious, gooey in the inside and with a light crisp on the outside. We loved our cookies so much that we stopped in the next day to try the peanut butter and jelly cookie. This one was a little underwhelming- not as gooey and warm as the others with the same level of satisfaction as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  To be fair, it tasted like peanut butter cookie dough which I don't think stays nice and gooey like chocolate chip cookie dough does. Overall, awesome cookies with fun rotating flavors, gives levain a run for its money!"
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2020-02-17,5.0,"Stopped by here to get some sweets in after lunch. The cookies are thicc and are perfectly crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. It's a good thing we split a cookie because they are pretty sweet. Got a cup of milk to go with it as well."
220,chip-nyc-new-york-9,2019-12-20,5.0,"The new delivery service is an amazing idea but isn't carried out very well as of now--I tried it out and they got lost, and I wasn't expecting them for a couple hours because I ordered them for a specific time. Thankfully I saw their messages, found the deliverer, and the cookies came all crumbled inside the box. :( Still delicious but the boxes they give you for the cookies are terrible."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-12-19,5.0,My favorite coffee spot in Manhattan.  I had my first and most delicious turmeric latte here. Super avocado toast and savory mushroom spinach breakfast toast are served all day. Definitely my happy place.
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-09-30,5.0,"I stopped by Merriweather while at work in the West Village. One of my coworkers was raving about the great lunch options so I decided to give it a try. The restaurant is an Australian inspired breakfast and lunch spot. 

I tried the BLAT sandwich which was really good. The sandwich has Bacon, Prosciutto, Tomato, Avocado, Arugula and Spicy Mayo on a Toasted Baguette. It was really tasty and the service was friendly and quick. Merriweather is a good healthy lunch spot and worth checking out if you're in the area."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-09-29,4.0,Tiny shop but great coffee and pastries. Met up with a friend here to catch up before heading up to the Whitney. Excellent espresso drinks and pastries from Balthazar or Bien Cuit. It was quite busy on a weekend and was a little crowded.
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-09-02,5.0,Sooo good! Stopped in here yesterday as we were just walking by and wanted a coffee. Surprised this place was SO good! We tried the hot latte with almond milk and the iced latte with almond milk. Great roast and flavor of coffee beans and no bitterness! Perfect blend of almond milk. Top quality!! And the prices were average for New York coffee. So worth it here though!! We would love to drink coffee from here all the time! So so good!! Highly recommend this coffee shop!!
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-06-10,4.0,"A cute, small, communal Australian café in West Village with a good selection of breakfast options and coffee drinks. The place can probably fit 10-15 people at any given time, so you may have to wait for a spot. I appreciate how quick and to the point everything about Merriweather is without losing a charming quality about it. 

My friend and I came here for Sunday brunch and shared the MW Avocado Toast with poached egg ($10) and the kale kabocha salad with poached egg ($13). Both items were delicious, quickly prepared, and to the point. There were a lot of other item on the menu that captured my interest and looked healthy and yummy. The coffee was very good as well (from Counter Culture)."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-04-13,5.0,"Cute little Australian cafe that makes many types of coffee/espresso drinks and has tons of breakfast options. There's avocado toast, poached pear with yogurt on toast, banana mint on toast, breakfast sandwiches, and a ton more!

Great seating options - could probably seat like 10-15 people.

Seems like a lovely place to spend some time and get some work done.

Prices are on par with the neighborhood. Lattes are $4-5 and toast is $8-10."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-08-18,3.0,"I was getting done with business nearby, and I was in need of coffee and a snack. I found this place using my Yelp app, so I made my way here.
I walked in to this moderately sized coffee shop. It was fairly busy, but the line was not long. I ordered an inced latte, and went with a banana tahini toast. The latte was as expected, although the caffeine content was not as great as I'd like it to be. The toast was delicious, although a bit too sweet for my tastes. 
The staff here was friendly, as were the other patrons. The place had fans in side the place, as well as an A/C unit. I'm assuming their central A/C was not working, or they were in the middle of installing a new unit. 
They had one restroom, which was clean, just like the rest of the place.
Next time, I'll stick with a black coffee, as it is less likely to be short on the caffeine content. And I'm forgoing any such toast henceforth."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-10-20,4.0,"Have to give big ups to Merriweather coffee. There is a lot of hullabaloo about Australian coffee places, and rightly so but this one is right up there. Much simpler, less crap around the edges. If you want a simple high quality coffee and breakfast for about $30 for two people, this is your spot. Coffee isn't the absolute best in the city but an easy 4/5. Breakfast sandwich is my absolute go to. With or without avocado is excellent either way. 

Food 4.5/5
Coffee 4/5
Price 5/5
Ambiance 4/5 
Service 4/5"
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-08-27,5.0,"Great quick or grab-and-go breakfast/brunch spot with plenty of healthy options. A pretty cool scene that wasn't trying to be extra or trendy. 

I ordered the banana, tahini, honey, mint & cinnamon toast - delicious! I can eat a LOT for breakfast and this actually filled me up. Great iced coffee as well.

Would love to come back!"
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2020-02-21,3.0,"This place is almost so good. The coffee is great and so is some of the food. The staff is amazing and always so friendly, only problem is that they are constantly cooking fish and other smelly foods and it's always so stuffy and smelly. You kind of forget about it after a while, but clothes will smell like Merriweather for weeks"
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-11-07,5.0,"This is a superb establishment! 

I am so lucky to have taken a new job within walking distance to this place. The staff are über friendly and bump to the beat of the tunes they play. The service is prompt, the food options are plentiful, and their selection of specialty lattes and single origin/blended coffee's will not disappoint."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-12-13,5.0,"Yum. My daughter and I were spending a Christmas weekend in NYC. Let me preface this by saying she's from Boston, doesn't feel the cold. I however am from South Carolina and have thin blood. Hate the cold. She insisted we venture up to the upper West Side all the way from Tribeca to have breakfast. Glad we did. Very good Aussie vibe egg avacado on brioche bun with runny egg and harissa. Amazing. Make the trek it's worth it, even in the cold"
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-12-03,5.0,Delicious healthy options for lunch reasonably priced and comfortable space for sitting in with friends. Thanks!
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-12-18,5.0,My go to's here are - mushroom toast!!!! YUM. Vegan coconut balls!!! YUM. And a delicious oat cappuccino. Obsessed and the staff is kind.
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-09-18,4.0,"This may be my new favorite coffee shop.  It's quaint, hip and super friendly.  They also have some interesting drinks like the Turmeric with macadamia milk which was delicious.  The prices are also very reasonable compared to most other shops."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-09-30,4.0,"Food is great (breakfast sandwich, avocado toast, ham and cheese on a croissant). Coffee is fine but has a turmeric taste. They don't provide refills on coffee if you are eating-in which is annoying. Other than cream you have to ask for milk."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-11-11,2.0,Rude barista. I expected to be treated better with my overpriced coffee.
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-11-06,3.0,"It does the job, but that's about it. I've been here several times now since I work nearby. Overall, love their iced coffee, matcha tea and earl gray tea, but their iced chai is just okay. I've been here twice for a coffee chat. The space is very small and intimate. The first time I had a meeting here, it was perfect. The second time was very.....off-putting. Whoever was doing the dishes that day wanted to make it very clear he was doing the dishes. There was a lot of banging and crashing, I'm surprised nothing broke. My friend and I ended up having to talk over the noise to hear each other. It was pretty ridiculous. I don't think I'll come back for sit-down visits, maybe just a quick coffee take out here and there."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-09-08,5.0,This is my new favorite coffee place in the W Village! Found it by accident one day while looking for the Passport Office. Love their coffee and love that oat milk is a dairy alternative! Not many places offer that. The staff is amazing and friendly. Baked goods super yummy. Last time I was there I sat outside and just enjoyed the busy goings on of Hudson street. Very peaceful and relaxing. I go as often as I can!
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2017-01-27,3.0,"New spot that's fairly popular with the morning crowd. Your regular coffee shop doling out specialty coffee and some baked goods in an inviting atmosphere. 

First time I came here I realized they don't sell large coffees (needed a bigger fix that day). This time I was okay with settling for a regular drip and a bran muffin ($6.50 total). The muffin is fantastic - flaky interior and just the right amount of raisins to counter the hearty bran. As for the coffee, was pretty disappointed. Got a big sour taste from the drink that wasn't helped by the milk or sugar at all. If it wasn't for the fact I needed something to wash down the muffin, I probably wouldn't have finished most of it.

Service here is friendly and they keep the busy line moving. Maybe just a bad day, so will re-rate when coming back."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-12-19,5.0,Friendly staff food is great I can get what I want and customized to my liking since I cant have dairy due to being lactose and intolerant. They can make the food anyway you want it. Food is great.
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2016-08-11,4.0,"I have been digging this café in the mornings.  Firstly, it's nice to see anything open up in this space as it has been empty for the past couple of years.  I have been stopping in here for breakfast about once or twice a week since they opened and I am please with the addition to the neighborhood.  Merriweather has even kind of reminded me how much I like cafes in general.  I love the light and airy design of the space, and I have noticed I can usually pop in and out for my breakfast sandwich and coffee faster at Merriweather than at some of the other chain options in the neighborhood.  

The coffee here is from Counter Culture, which is a popular choice in the neighborhood, but its not my favorite.  For breakfast I get the morning sandwich which is served on a brioche bun with tomato, avocado, egg, sharp cheddar (I think) and harrissa sauce.  At $9 it's a bit of a splurge for breakfast but it's pretty tasty.

Overall a great addition to Hudson Street and I hope they do well."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-05-09,4.0,"Love the vibe here. Drinks are unique and the food portions are decent. 

Perfect spot for catching up or conversations over coffee.

Suggestion: the place is a bit small and can get really overwhelming or a bit hot! Recommend to have better air circulation."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2017-03-29,5.0,"I love this cafe so much! It's got ambiance, character, a super delicious breakfast sandwich served most of the day, and great matcha lattes and chai lattes (made locally in Brooklyn)! 

I love the mint green branding and artsy neon Merriweather sign, inspired by the trendy beach cafes of Sydney.

They have a lot of healthy options that I'm still working my way through, like the tahini quinoa bowl, but my hands down favorite is the Merriweather Morning Sandwich. You must try it, and then you'll find yourself getting it again and again and not trying the rest of the menu. The toasted brioche roll is flavorful by itself, but then you get a nice sunny side up egg, tomato, avocado and some white cheddar...and the best part, housemade harissa!! 

Bonus: you'll usually see someone's cute dog waiting patiently outside :)"
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-09-05,5.0,Cute Aussie owned coffee shop. The owner is super friendly as are all his staff (seems to be able to hang on to staff which is always a good sign). Glad to see this place doing so well.
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2017-04-03,4.0,"Cute West Village spot for quality tea and coffee. It's on the pricier side, but that's typical for the location. My matcha almond late was close to $6, which is pretty bougie IMO but I was in need of the caffeine so splurged. Also got the avocado toast with poached egg, which was cooked really well so can't complain. Overall a really satisfying meal, but my favorite part was the people watching. Hipster meets rich kids of Soho is the most entertaining mix.

Simple but bright and welcoming interior layout, with a good amount of seating in comparison to the typical two seater compact coffee shops. They also have benches outside for drinking your coffee/tea outdoors on nicer days. Good service, also."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-03-17,4.0,"First things first, these guys are very generous about the avocado! I ordered my usual ""safe"" choices (latte and avocado toast) when going to a new place, and I was not disappointed. I was hesitant at first, since the avocado toast is $8.75, but the slice is huge. It was really delicious, though I think the next time I am going to ask for no chili flakes on top. The seasoning is heavy, but not too nice. I just can't handle too spicy foods. The latte was flavorful, aromatic -- went down very smooth, milky, and creamy. You can also ask for Almond, Oat, Macadamia or Soy milk substitution for $0.50 more. The baristas are friendly, and the interior is really elegant! Perfect for a working lunch or a study break."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2017-10-31,5.0,"Such an adorable little place! Sweet, bright and nice and cozy for a cool rainy day. 

I ordered a hot almond milk late and an avocado toast with an egg. The price wasn't bad at all considering the size of both items, and I appreciated the quality and quantity of Matcha. 

I'll be back on my next visit!"
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2016-09-22,3.0,"My wife loves this place, she has eaten there on several occasions and is a big fan.

I've only popped in for coffee 3 times, look it's ok, I think it's a little expensive (the location I suppose commands a premium).

I've found it ok...looks cool, but noticeably better coffee than other places on Hudson? I'll leave it to you to decide."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2016-07-31,5.0,"Best way to start a lame Sunday would for sure be a large glass of iced latte after a short run. Felt like my cells have been burning and stayed energetic. Merriweather serves one of the best lattes in this neighborhood - I can tell that my iced drink carried a light touch of creamy flavor, though I only asked for skim milk...very well done!

My neighbor sitting next to me was enjoying a large toasted croissant and it looked so delicious to me!! I must step away right now otherwise I probably would end up with getting the same piece.

Such a lovely place!"
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2017-07-29,2.0,"Brunch cafes live and die by their eggs. If you keep serving ""poached eggs"" as hardboiled...I worry about your future...especially when your team doesn't care when feedback is given. Apart from that, the quality and texture of the coffee was great."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2016-09-29,2.0,"Ordered lunch from Merriweather yesterday....so this review is just for the food, which was sadly quite terrible.

Both my colleague and I ordered the Kale Kabocha Salad, which sounded delicious. Unfortunately what actually came was a cardboard box full of raw kale, a few pieces of squash and avocado, and a tiny poached egg. All for $13. We both agreed this salad was one of the worst we'd ever had. 

I could have had a better, cheaper, and more filling lunch at Pret. i won't be returning."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-07-10,2.0,"I paid $10.75 (tip not included) for a piece of bread, a thin spread of avocado and a poached egg on top. Was a $5 dish. Cortado was good."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2016-08-01,5.0,"This coffee shop just opened up around the corner from my apartment and it is pretty amazing. First, and most importantly, the coffee is perfect and on point every time. They clearly pride themselves on making the perfect latte / capp / cold breh / matcha (whatever your drink is) and it shows. I have only tried a couple of things from their food menu and both times, they have been great. Would definitely recommend the avocado and poached egg on toast! The shop itself is so cool, chilled and hip, you kind of just want to hang out there all day, drink coffees and people watch. 

I'm so happy to have such awesome coffee spot in my neighborhood and to be honest, I was a little hesitant to write this review - because even though it's only been open a week or two, every time I go in, this place seems to be busy and selfishly I kind of want it to stay under the radar! But seriously if you're ever in the 'hood, do yourself a favor and check this place out, it is so so good."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2017-10-27,5.0,"Great coffee and breakfast.  It's perfect on my way to work.  Best poached egg on avocado multi-grain toast.

Love the people also."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-06-24,3.0,"My feelings of this place are mixed. Things I love: the matcha latte (so much yum), atmosphere, and decor. Things I don't love: the employees seem rather judgmental no matter how friendly I was and a breakfast I had with egg, tomato, ciabatta made my stomach feel instantly queasy."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-03-05,5.0,My friend and I both got the avocado toast with the poached egg. They give you a good amount of avocado and a very large piece of toast probably equivalent of two pieces and the egg was cooked perfectly. It's nice and clean and bright and the people who work there were super friendly.
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2018-02-25,2.0,"Food has gone downhill since opening. I had the turmeric steel cut oatmeal and it was disgusting. It was bland and watery, almost like a soup. It cost me $7.50 and it was one of the worst oatmeal dishes I've ever tasted. They took more pride in their food when they were less popular. I give two stars for their service and decor."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2019-01-23,5.0,"I think this place is great! They have that great balance of good coffee/ drinks and a varied, clean, healthy choice of food options. They make a PERFECT avocado toast. Coffee is outstanding. Some minor constructive criticism- I think their iced drinks should be larger for the price and they can use some better pastries. Overall, I love this place bec it's so hard to find a coffee shop that has good, savory dishes."
221,merriweather-coffee-kitchen-new-york,2017-02-10,3.0,Cute coffee shop. I got the Thai Salad. While it was a really large portion the taste was blah. It needed salt and some kind of fat like sesame oil to make it pop. Also I'd roast and crush the peanuts on top because they just sink to the bottom.
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2020-02-10,5.0,"I hesitate to post a review here because I don't want this place to lose its charm and become flooded with tourists and WiFi hoarders, but nonetheless it needs to be shared how low-key awesome this cafe is. 

The location is perfect, tucked into the Brooks Brothers store, downstairs and away from the hustle and bustle of the city this cafe makes you think that you're somewhere else where space isn't a premium and pretentiousness got checked at the door. 

They have real, large, (CLEAN) unisex bathrooms. Big tables for working, small nooks w/power to work in while you're enjoying your latte, big comfy chairs to sit and have a conversation in while you're chomping down your breakfast sandwich. It's perfect.

Relaxing, working, socializing, this is the spot. Oh yeah, the coffee is bang-on and the folks working there we're nothing but polite and professional with me."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2020-02-12,4.0,"After going to a cafe last Tuesday, a friend of mine invited me here for happy hour. She was doing work there. I love the decor and ambiance of this place. The bathrooms are also so clean. There is also decent seating and plugs by the walls which makes it an ideal place to do work or study. 

I got a chardonnay for happy hour and the portion and price for it was amazing. I love that it wasn't placed in a typical wine glass as well. I really want to come back and try their hot beverages. 

This is located inside a Brooks Brothers. There will be stairs to the left that will lead to Red Fleece Cafe."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2020-02-04,5.0,"This place is such a hidden gem in the basement of a Brooks Brothers. I met with a friend here, but I can see it being a really good place for a date. The inside is cozy, there are wine + beer + coffee specials, and it's a mix of folks working, friends meeting, and of course dates. 

In a city that's so busy / energetic this is a really nice place to slow down."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-08-26,4.0,"You know I have to try it when it has 4.5 stars on Yelp!  I trust the Yelp nation even though it is on the bottom floor of a clothing store.  I think it actually helps the place considering it is kind of hidden and feels comfortable. It wasn't crowded at all and it was pretty quiet. They have good wifi as well if you are trying to get work done. 

For food they have a whole menu of things but were out of some ingredients when I tried ordering. I went with the avocado toast and they were out of avocado's... that is crazy. I went instead for a prosciutto sandwich that came prepackaged. It wasn't bad after heating it up but not my favorite. 

In my opinion you don't come for the food here. You come to have a coffee, relax, and get some work done. It is hard to find a quiet comfortable place in Manhattan and this is one of them."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-09-25,2.0,"I used to loveeee this place but had such an unfortunate experience here recently when ordering their horchata iced drink. The barista was a bit rude from the start but it quickly progressed as he seemed annoyed with anything said to him. When I received my latte it had so much cinnamon covering the top (and don't get my wrong, I typically love cinnamon) but I actually had a coughing attack. I tried to stir it but there was so much it wouldn't disintegrate. When I went up to the barista to share my concern about their being too much cinnamon I was coughing and actually couldn't drink the drink - he said ""this is how much we always put on. Mix it around."" Wow okay... I mentioned how I already had and there were still tons of globs, the drink was actually undrinkable. 

This is when he proceeded to hastily grab my drink from me, get another plastic cup, shake it back and forth in front of me then give it right back, saying ""here""! Seriously....  the nerve... no apology, no ""Let me just make you a new one"" nothing... so I took my drink, thew it out and left.

I was planning to meet a friend there for a coffee but I told him there was a change of plans because the place was rude and their drinks awful. Ambiance is cute but no need to be around that energy."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-01-16,5.0,"Was originally trying to go to Devocion down the street but it was PACKED and so stumbled onto this cafe instead (saw it passing by). I thought it was so cool how Red Fleece Café is under Brooks Brothers. It definitely adds a cooler vibe walking downstairs to know that you'll be sitting under a floor of some chic clothes.

I got there around 2pm and immediately noticed the homey atmosphere this place provided. There was a larger crowd talking to each other than doing work/on laptops. There are more sofas than traditional desk/chair setups which probably cause this! However, I came to do some work/reading so made myself at home at the inner right side seating facing the wall. There were plenty of outlets and clean restrooms so I was rest assured that I could stay there for a while with no worries.

I got a cold brew and it was served in a nice glass cup. I enjoyed it. They also serve alcoholic beverages with a happy hour starting at 4pm. Once 4pm rolled around I noticed the crowd starting to change and getting louder/taking advantage of their nice happy hour. The baristas/bartenders were dressed in a light blue shirt with a red tie/blue and red apron. They have great WiFi and plenty of seating I would definitely revisit if I'm ever bored in the area either alone or with a friend!"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-08-07,5.0,"This place is great to get work done or to catch up with friends! I came here on a Sunday afternoon and there was plenty of seating on both tables and chairs as well as couches! It did get more crowded towards the late afternoon but I came to do some work and there are plenty of outlets and the atmosphere itself is quaint and homey!

I got a latte and cranberry scone! Both items were fairly priced and pretty standard for most coffee shops in NYC. They also do sell beer and wine for those of you who aren't coffee lovers. WiFi is fast and reliable and the place is clean! I definitely recommend checking out this place, especially if you're like me and trying to find new places to study!"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-08-25,4.0,"Red Fleece Cafe is a bustling cafe that's located downstairs at the Brooks Brothers store. 

I ordered an iced tea and grabbed a table to do some work. What's great about the cafe is that there's plenty of seating, tables, and outlets. People come here to catch up with friends, study/do some work, read, and even conduct job interviews here. It does get loud here so keep that in mind if you come here to do work. 

Staff was nice. Restrooms are clean."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-08-21,2.0,"I came in here for a seat and free WiFi for a video interview. Glad I didn't come for the chai because it had no flavor. It just tasted like steamed milk. Ended up not drinking most of it. 

The older man who took my order was not friendly and was so quick to say they were out of apple cider when I tried to order it that he either didn't hear or didn't care that I also ordered a croissant. So I ended up with just the bad chai. 

The space itself is very nice. There was a group of friends hanging out together and some people doing work. WiFi requires no password. It is fairly quiet, which is the reason I chose it.

I cannot speak to the coffee or pastries, which seem to be pretty good considering this place's rating, but I am not likely to return to find out based on my experience."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2020-01-11,5.0,"LOVE this place!!! The ambience is relaxed without being too quiet.  It's a great place for people to work, study, relax or socialize.  There's a long table with a few smaller tables, as well as some comfy couches and chairs.  Had the Chai Latte and it was really good.  I wouldn't necessarily have wine, but it seemed like a great place to enjoy a glass of wine while you're working.  People also seemed to go just for the drinks so it must be good.

Went on a Saturday and it was busy, but not super crowded ... granted day was beautiful outside so that may be the reason.

Regardless, this is my new favorite coffee shop in Union Square"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2018-09-02,2.0,"I walked past the sign for Red Fleece Cafe (in the basement of Flatiron's Brooks Brothers) almost everyday on my way to work last summer and always wanted to go in but just never did. I did today and it was a disappointment!

First off: service was good. Friendly and patient as I was indecisive over what to order. 

Aesthetic: honestly loved the interior design of Red Fleece. Very rustic lodge-y. There's a few big comfy sofas, lots of outlets and tables, lots of books...I could see myself camping out there for the day. 

Drink: I tried the horchata cold brew and I enjoyed it for the first five minutes and then all of a sudden couldn't drink another sip. $5.50 ($6ish with tip). I just didn't like the mix of cinnamon with vanilla flavoring and coffee. It was also very small :( 

My friend enjoyed his drink and I'm pretty sure I just didn't order the right drink. I wish I'd been able to sample it first! 

Overall: I'd still be back just for the free WiFi, interior design, and rustic warm vibe. I just would not order the horchata cold brew at all #ragrets"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-06-13,4.0,"Tucked away coffee and wine bar below the store. It's relaxing and yet stuffy all at the same time. The barista there has tries his hardest to give off this aura of superiority and it's a little funny to watch. I don't drunk coffee so I can't help you there, but they do have s happy hour with a pretty healthy selection. Couch is comfy and they have iPads for common use. Would recommend for a quiet place to read or do some work. Prices are on the higher side if not ordering from HH. 

Will probably be back."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-05-16,3.0,"I was excited to check this place out after seeing their sign that they serve Stumptown (one of my faves). They may serve Stumptown, but they sure don't make their cappuccinos like them. I had ordered an iced cappuccino with almond milk. What I got was a watered down iced coffee. For $5.44? Nah. Not worth it. You couldn't even taste the espresso. Very disappointed. Didn't enjoy it at all. Maybe their other drinks are better. 

Friendly staff. Has a nice, homey atmosphere to the shop (found downstairs at a Brooks Brothers)."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2020-01-29,1.0,"Wish I could give it zero stars. I asked what was in the chai concentrate. The kid rolled his eyes and shrugged. Then said he didn't know. Then threw the bag of tea my way and said ""here -knock yourself out"" to which I pushed it back and said ""no you knock yourself out"" and walked out. Will never come here again.  Here's a tip -hire people who know how to explain what's in your beverages and know how to talk to customers. Disgusting behavior. Fire this person immediately. I came on 1/29/20 at 5 pm. He was a young kid. Who should not work in the service industry."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2020-02-26,4.0,Yummy scones I would have given 5 stars if they served me in a red mug  it would be easy to have meetings here or to do work as well!

222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-02-17,5.0,Had a cup of latte here in the afternoon. It is really good. The environment and service is also good. A great place to grab coffee before AMC movie.
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-03-12,5.0,Cute little cafe tucked away under a brooks brothers shop. They had variety of different drinks. I had the matcha latte which was brought over to where I sat. It was creamy and delicious. It was the perfect gentle caffeine boost and the right little pick-me-up for a Sunday afternoon.
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-06-14,5.0,Cafe is located in basement of Brook Brothers Flatiron district. Nice comfy cafe with decent spacious place and nice coffee . Good for meeting etc
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2018-01-06,5.0,"This has to be one of my best discoveries of 2018 by far!! Apparently this cafe opened about a year and a half ago -- who knew?? I wish I had found it sooner! 

This cafe is located in the basement of Brooks Brothers. The cafe just feels like an extension of the store. I love the decor, design, and overall feel of the place. It's warm, inviting, and has a nostalgic vintage vibe. There is ample seating, great tasting coffee, wonderful pastries from Balthazar bakery, and very dandily dressed baristas! 

Definitely a great spot to stop by if you're in flatiron! Also free WiFi!"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-06-17,5.0,My latte was delicious. They bring it to your table in a nice red mug. Plenty of tables are available. It's located downstairs. They also have nice looking pastries.
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2018-08-21,5.0,"This cafe is easy to miss. It's hidden in one of the stores & shares its entrance with, you guessed it, a retail store that sells some pretty nice clothes. 
But after you walk through the front door, follow the signs to the basement level & you'll find this cafe. It's pretty small but it'll do the trick. Plus, there's happy hour which starts around 4 (I think). A lot of people here take the time to read a good book or work on some assignment. WiFi is free so why not take advantage of it. Or, if you're just stopping in for happy hour, play a game of scrabble as you sip on your drink. My boyfriend really enjoyed this place while we were in town that we had to make multiple drop ins during happy hour."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-04-08,5.0,"If you're looking for comfort and top notch customer service as your relax or get work done, this is the place to go. The atmosphere is amazing. 

As for the people, they're great! As for customer service, Jason does an amazing job and is on top of things here. Just got a smoothie that I didn't like and asked for a refund and that I'd purchase something else. Dan (I think that was his name) wasn't going to refund me, but Jason stepped in and said ""of course we'll refund you."" This is exactly why I've been coming for two years and will continue to keep coming. The amount I purchase far outweighs the few times I may not like something. 

Smart business, comfortable location, and kind people."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2017-09-08,4.0,"I think this is the first time I've been inside a Brooks Brothers, after being pulled in by the Stumptown sign in the window. I don't leave that many 5 star reviews and definitely not ones this short, but here goes:

-Stumptown coffee
-Balthazar and Délice Bakery baked goods
-free refills on coffee to stay (medium size and I'm assigning large too?)
-free wifi
-plenty of outlets
-lots of choices for seating: tables, high tops, sofas
-iPads available for use
-sandwiches and lots of non-coffee drink choices
-two clean and spacious bathrooms
-very courteous staff

edit: decreased by a star for a horchata cold brew ($5.50) I wasn't wowed by. Also the tables aren't super clean (I have to wipe them down with wet napkins each time) but it's still a really really great study spot!"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-04-28,4.0,Great spot for reading and studying! It's not very crowded and I can always find a comfortable seat. It's my go-to place when I want to hang out in a coffee shop in the city.
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2018-08-07,4.0,"Red Fleece Cafe is tucked away inside the Brooks Brothers in Flatiron. It's a great little coffee stop to catch up with friends. It's impeccably decorated and the staff is nice.

I love their little red cups. WiFi is decent, but there is a lack of wall plugs.
Will definitely be back when I'm in the area."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-03-15,5.0,"Used Hannah O.'s review to hit this spot up. I was sitting in a Starbuck's in Union Square and couldn't focus enough to get work done for today. Popped on over to Red Fleece and what do you know! Silence. No distractions, friendly staff, and such a cool vibe. Love that it is hidden beneath the Brooks Brothers store and there are so many tables, outlets, and charging stations I was able to spend plenty of time here to be productive. Coffee wasn't so bad and they have a Happy Hour?! Might have been too early for a bevy on a Friday morning but definitely would hit this up at some point. $5 Wine and Prosecco and $4 Beer. Can't beat it. Thanks for hosting me!"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-07-17,5.0,"I'm pretty picky about cafes. Ever since I realized they're the only place I can get any work done, I've been religiously searching for the best ones, compiling a collection of my favorite places to bum free WiFi and air conditioning off for hours in exchange for a cup of coffee. Red Fleece Cafe is one of my favorites. The setting is very unique-- it's spacious, yet homey, and it's quite literally an underground cafe. There is plenty of seating, the music isn't too loud, and the tuna avocado croissant is decadent (although my cheap ass thinks it's a splurge at $8.99). The ambience is great for working, although you may hear an excitable group here or there. FYI, the air conditioning is on high, so bring a light cardigan in the summer. I almost forgot an important highlight--bathrooms are clean!"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2017-10-09,4.0,"Thumbs-up for Red Fleece! Relative quiet, plenty of table seating, and great WiFi combine to make this basement cafe a solid place to study, work, or catch up with someone. 

Drinks are a little pricey, but worth it if you consider it your workspace rent for an hour or two. Other reviewers mentioned a free refill policy on coffee, which would be awesome, but it wasn't mentioned or posted anywhere inside. 

The tea is Kusmi, which I guess is fancy but whenever I've tried it (here, at the Kusmi store, at friends' apartments) it just never seems to be satisfying. I also expect substantial tea bags to steep a second cup, and the detox tea barely steeped one medium-strength cup. The flavor was kinda of like blue drink, if blue drink tasted pineapple-y. It was served in an itty bitty personal teapot, which was cute but unnecessary given that it held less than two teacups' worth of tea."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-01-27,4.0,I've been here multiple times when in the area and it's a cute little coffee shop underneath Brooks Brothers. They have a wide selection of drinks (including wine) and pastries. They also have outlets and tables to sit at if you have work to do. Would recommend coming here if in the area and wanting a cute place to stop for a coffee.
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-01-03,1.0,"See pic. WTH...seriously? Latte? I don't know what their problem is. Barista was not interested in talking to me at all. There was an attitude, which apparently is noticeable on the latte as well. It also tasted very watered down. Nice job guys."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-01-05,1.0,"Second time coming to this spot, first time was a really pleasant visit- friendly staff great coffee. Unfortunately this time around was quite the opposite!! I approached the counter to order, mentioned one of my orders and was so rudely interrupted by the girl taking my order,She started  laughing with her other rude colleague. "" I told you so"" she sniggered to the blonde girl. I proceed to finish stating my order when she said "" I should have bet you 50 dollars"" to the other girl and once again started laughing. 

I'm not sure what kind of staff you want to employ at your business, but coming from a woman that works in service- these two immature girls , you can't teach them manners. Such a bad image for the place."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-02-18,4.0,"what a killer, smooth latte this place has. I've gotten spoiled, so many places make a great cup of joe, but I don't think that should take away from each place! So to confirm, this place has a top notch soy latte (and if you know anything about how hard it is to make a good soy latte, that means you know they have a killer regular latte as well). It's a bit of a funny location-or cool if you're looking for something a little different ;) It's cramped so you may need to fight for a seat, but you won't regret stopping by this place, even if you have to take your coffee to go."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2017-04-27,5.0,"Omg!! How did I not know about this place? This is Brooks brothers cafe. Great coffee, fresh pastries and a cozy environment. There are many searing options. You can sit on a sofa, table. And there is a bar with iPads!  Yes, iPads!!! Amazing. They also have a sofa on the other side of the floor. Seems idea for a meeting. I will definitely be back! 

There are some board Games sitting on the table, books on the shelf and they serve wine and beer. Plus a clean bathroom! That is always a good thing."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-10-02,5.0,"Really cool place. Great place to do work or meet up with friends and or for business. I spent 3 hours year doing work and it was the perfect spot. They have really good coffee and pastries but also have a happy hour special that I would recommend. You can go from drinking coffee and working to drinking $5 wine, so that's always fun."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-08-16,5.0,"Such a cute and cozy cafe downstairs from Brooks Brothers. Great happy hour too! I didn't try any food but it looked good with an assortment of parties, muffins and sandwiches. I will definitely be back! Plus, they are pet friendly!! :)"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-06-06,1.0,"The name is partly true: ""fleece"".  Went in today for 3 small and one medium drink, a salmon bagel and a couple of pastries. They messed up by substituting the medium for a small drink and then totally forgot to give us one of the drinks. When we went to ask them where the missing drink was, they claimed it wasn't on the order. They also claimed they couldn't print out the receipt but I would receive it by e mail. It's been almost 10 hours and no e mail receipt. I checked in my bank account and sure enough there was the charge for the complete (expensive) order. My suggestion is if you want to get ripped off, go give your money to the scammers in Central Park"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2017-01-22,4.0,"Brooks Brothers has a coffee shop and bar... as a native California who used to own more workout clothes than pastels (actually, I don't own any pastels), Red Fleece Cafe is a place that I never thought I would go. But it's worth checking out and one of the better coffee spots on this part of Broadway.

Here's what you need to go:
1. Coffee cups are on the smaller side but the coffee quality is good.
2. Great selection of pastries.
3. $6 prosecco during happy hour. I think I found a new spot.
4. Quiet area that can be good for working/studying.
5. Leather chairs and free wifi.
6. Selection of juices are available.

It's a place to definitely check out, if anything to say that you've gone to a Brooks Brothers cafe. It's not the absolute best coffee in NYC but is better than the majority."
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2018-10-08,4.0,"This is a nice little hidden gem in FlatIron. It's directly below Brooks brothers, but don't be worried that it's underground because the lighting is really warm. It has a cozy atmosphere, perfect for working, a coffee date, OR happy hour too apparently.  The bathrooms are a plenty and very clean. I got their cappuccino and oat/currant scone, and my friend got the Golden Latte (has espresso). Overall it's a really nice place. I need to check out their happy hour at some point!"
222,red-fleece-cafe-new-york-3,2019-07-24,5.0,"Great place for good coffee and working. It gets crowded pretty quickly downstairs after a certain hour, but there are a few seats upstairs too. There are a lot of outlets and also Wifi which makes working more convenient. I've been here about every week for a month now to get some work done. The staff is generally very friendly and quick with making your order. There are also 2 giant bathrooms."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2017-12-14,5.0,"The ultimate bakery in Brooklyn!  This is a quaint shop near the subway station in an up and coming neighborhood.  

This isn't a place to sit and eat your delectables, but rather take them to go.  There is a huge park just a few metres away!

Everything is super fresh and when it's gone, it's gone!

I had 3 medium hot chocolates and 2 cheese pastries, $7.50!  Holy cow was that cheap, after experiencing Manhattan!   I really wish I had found this place sooner!"
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2020-01-07,3.0,"Came here one time before. Found a hair in my bagel with cream cheese, tossed the bagel out and didn't go back for about about year. But seeing they have a consistent line in the morning, I decided to give Cranberry another try. 

I believe this is the only close pastry/sandwich shop in the vicinity - specifically in front of the  AC subway line (other than the breakfast cart). Appears mostly locals stop by in the morning for breakfast to-go. Coffee is decent here. Service is fast pace which I like. Two benches outside the store if you're planning to sit and sip coffee. 

I got whole wheat bagel with ham egg and cheese. Pretty good with omlette cooked eggs and (yes, I checked) no hair. But $6.00 a sandwich isnt on the cheap side considering its cash only. Still have mixed feelings about this place but may be back on a hungry morning."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2020-02-01,3.0,"Friendly staff and service! They have a decent assortment of cookies!! I ordered a peanut butter cookie, medium coffee and sausage, egg and cheeese on a roll which came out to $10.  It was a bit pricey for just regular breakfast to go."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2020-01-20,1.0,I used to love this place a few years back. I stopped going for years and couldn't remember why. Came in close to 7am to get a coffee and a pastry. I was told no cards. So in my mind I'm cursing myself but also formulating a plan. I'm told to use their atm. I say no thanks. There's one person behind me so I was going to say I'll run a couple blocks to get cash. Dude says in response to my loyalty card that if I had one how did I not know they were cashless. That card was years old. Even if it wasn't what space in my mind should I clear to remember you're cash only?? I paid in cash because I always had cash not because I was promoted to. 95% of the time I do have cash. This time I didn't. I remembered immediately that my last few experiences were rude encounters with the girl that is usually at the register. I left and got Cuban coffee from Cafecito since I receive coffee without a side of extra lip.
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2019-05-20,3.0,So it's right off the train and I really wanted a breakfast sand which .... I'll just say I am Still eating while I write this but am disappointed... my bacon egg and cheese has legit one piece of bacon in it ... the croissant is good and so is the egg.... but it's completely miss the bacon for $6.50 I don't feel I received my money's worth. 3 stars bc the service was fast and the sandwich would be great jf it actually had the bacon I paid for in it...
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-01-11,4.0,"After trying to figure out NYC's subway system and getting lost a few times trying to get to the Brooklyn Bridge, we became hangry and decided to grab a small snack to help us continue our journey. Cranberry's was nearby.

The place is small and is pretty compacted inside. They had a variety of pastries to choose from as well as a menu where you can order sandwiches, salads and other things. The customer service was okay. It wasn't superb, but it's a buy your food and dip type of thing.

We got the danish bread and it was great. It had a nice sweet touch to it and was cooked well. Definitely helped us with the rest of our journey to the bridge that's for sure."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2017-11-24,4.0,"Cute little shop in Brooklyn to grab a quick bite or pick up some pastries. It seems like a go to spot for the locals. 

Tons of pastries, sandwich and bagel options, as well as cold sides to choose from. 


Lox bagel - good. Lox was fresh. Bagel was soft and fluffy. The bagel was large and half got me full. 

Spinach and cheese croissant - good. Perfect for a morning snack"
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2019-10-18,4.0,"Great cappuccino, and variety of sweet and savory pastries. THANK YOU FOR THE SAVORY!!! Lacking one star because the baristas who were working had too much personal convo going on- people come in for coffee, and skip the small talk until everyone is caffeinated"
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-10-26,4.0,I really like their homemade scones. Not always the same amount of butter to salt nor maybe even degree of freshness but the scones are so simple and wonderful that way. More of a giant biscuit than most scones you'd likely find really. And if you come on a weekday morning you will see how crazy it gets in the teeny shop. Cash only.
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2019-01-29,3.0,"I think this is a fairly honest review since I've been here for coffee at least four or five times. 

I think the staff is very friendly and work very quick and efficiently, and I'm grateful for that. The neighborhood is also really cool. I've never had any food so I won't comment on anything they cook. However my only problem with this spot is the only thing I've come there for: coffee. 

Every time I get their hot coffee, it seriously tastes like toilet water. It just isn't any good. Maybe they don't clean their pot often? Maybe they use really lousy beans? Regardless, I never found the coffee to be pleasant. There's plenty of other spots for coffee in the area, so I'm not sure why I stuck with Cranberry's despite all of the other local options. In any case, don't waste your money on their coffee, you'll regret it."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-12-01,3.0,"Picked up a quick sandwich on the go - egg and pepper jack cheese on a roll ($4). Overall, it was just okay. Sandwich came stuffed with eggs but didn't have much seasoning on it. It's a cash only place and doesn't have any seating. My gf also picked up a dozen rugelach ($1.25 each), and the cinnamon and chocolate ones were amazing!"
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-11-20,5.0,"Came in and ordered a bunch of things for friends coming by including the truffle brownies, several turkey and cheese sandwiches, coffee cake muffins and their famous coffee. Everything was so good. Ps They only take cash!"
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2019-11-24,5.0,Fantastic spot for coffee and sandwiches. Can get packed though. They also have some solid cookies
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2017-02-02,5.0,"The best scones in New York. Two things: the hazelnut coffee with some sugar and milk, and the blueberry scones. Any of the rich, decadent, made fresh every morning scones are great but the blueberry? Divine. This neighborhood spot is a legend!"
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-05-26,5.0,"Came here to snag some sandwiches before chilling at a park.
The 'gobbler' which they spell 'gobler' is C.R.E.A.M. (Cash rules everything around me, a wu tang reference)- I was expecting it to come with cranberry sauce, but they don't stock it in the establishment at all. That said, the sandwich was gangster good and I got to ride the ferry (check out my ferry review for a micturific review)"
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-11-27,5.0,"Such a nice 'to-go' breakfast spot and I am so lucky to live nearby. As a native New Yorker, it is somewhat of a ritual to have a bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll or bagel on a Saturday morning. Cranberry's is one of the few places that can deliver on this in an affordable and consistent way. They have a really nice team and the store owners are often there to make you feel comfortable and at home. Thanks for all that you do."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2017-04-13,3.0,"I stopped by here while waiting for my number to be called at the nearby post office. I had a coffee cake muffle and a raspberry rugelach, total $3.50. the muffin was moist but not too much flavor. The consistency was great but lacked the flavor. The raspberry rugelach was quite nice so I'd get this again. 

It's located near the Brooklyn bridge so expect tourists."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-02-20,4.0,One of the more reasonably priced cafe/deli spots in this area. The have both baked goods and sandwiches. Employees are usually very nice and they have a lot of regular morning coffee customers that go there. Not a lot of room to sit but you are close to Cadman Plaza if you want to grab some snacks and go sit on those benches. This is also in between the 2/3 at Clark street and the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge walk way so would be a good spot to stop in for a quick bite if you are seeing the bridge.
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-02-21,5.0,"CASH ONLY!!!!!! The prices were decent and the food was pretty good. Parking in that area is terrible. However, the service & food was good. The cashier guy was very nice & polite. He made our experience worth while. I highly recommend for a day in this beautiful Brooklyn neighborhood. Atm is inside!!!!"
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-12-11,5.0,"Found this place on our way to the Brooklyn Bridge. Got the crumble cake and it was AMAZING. If you love parties, I would definitely recommend stopping by."

223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-01-06,5.0,Someone else reviewed that this was the best latte they'd had. Well I agree that this is one of the best lattes I've ever had as well! Super flavorful! We stopped. H this cafe before walking the Brooklyn bridge! I definitely recommend this spot before walking the bridge on a chilly day!
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-10-28,5.0,"Warmest welcome on a cold October day

The food and great! I've tasted the spinach and feta croissant and it was delicious.

Aside from the food, the staff is great! So nice and thoughtful, they make you feel welcomed. Also, they speak Spanish which is a plus for most tourists visiting Brooklyn!

Get yourself warm there!"
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-10-25,5.0,Best coffee and muffin I've ever had and the costumer service was amazing. I cant wait to go back to New York and visit this place again.
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2019-03-31,5.0,"Just popped in to get out of the rain, and I'm so glad we did. This is THE best coffee I've ever had! Make sure to talk to Michael. He's as awesome as the coffee is! This is Brooklyn!"
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2016-12-27,3.0,"Cranberry's is a small neighborhood coffee and bagel shop serving up fresh snacks for people on the go. 

I got the bagel with lox, cream cheese, red onion and capers and honestly inhaled it. It wasn't the best bagel and lox I've ever had, but it certainly hit the spot. 

The thing that turns me off about this place though is the fact that it is quite dark inside and sort of grungy. But you're not there to eat-in (there's no room even if you wanted to) so it's not a deal breaker."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2017-08-26,5.0,"""What would you like?""
""Coffee with milk and two sugars please.""
""My coffee is good. How about with 1 sugar and I'll give you another on the side?"" 
""Deal.""

Haha. He was right. The coffee was quite good. It didn't need extra sugar. 

Such a great start to my day. I went in here expecting just coffee.  What I got in addition to that was a great exchange with whom I assuming was the owner, and left with a huge smile.

I loved the fact that he was a personable character. And he gave us a little history about Brooklyn. 

I'd be happy to come back here."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-07-29,4.0,"Amazing bagel sandwich! It was truly great. Filling too. Very tasty. I had an everything bagel toasted with egg whites, ham, and pepper jack for only about 4.50. However, the cashier staff lady (an older white woman) wasn't the most polite and seems pretty abrasive. I definitely prefer ordering from the Latino staff who are super courteous. Other than that, good food at least, and for a decent price."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2018-06-13,5.0,"Scones are delicious and so are the muffins. Coffee (especially the latte) is terrific, too, and so is their loyalty card that they stamp, earning you a free coffee after buying 10. There is usually a line in the small store but the employees are friendly and move efficiently, especially during ""rush"" hour in the morning. I hardly ever see scones anymore, and when I do, they are coated in sugar - so it's nice to taste a traditional, freshly-made scone from Cranberry's (I either get the cranberry or blueberry)."

223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2016-08-18,4.0,"Here you can grab breakfast and lunch items.  It might not be the most healthiest thing, but it is affordable and convenient when you are about to go across the Brooklyn Bridge.  I recall getting bagels here and seeing quite a selection.  The place is like a cafeteria but smaller.  I remember someone came in with a baby, so they are family friendly.  I do know that there can be lines, so they are probably doing something right!"

They actually enjoy what they're doing which is quite a rarity nowadays in New York. Lol."

223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2015-12-20,2.0,"Charming store front and awning but that's about it. Dark, dingy interior with no room to sit. 
The drink options are sparse despite the large fridge and the deli case is awkward. You're left wanting more - not your typical epic deli case with endless food. 
Got the lox sandwich and it was very underwhelming. 
This place is a tourist trap with a cute storefront. Don't be fooled."

This scone was pretty delicious, however. It was studded with pecans and had a crispy exterior with soft insides. It was a huge size too. I could only finish half.

My friends got a egg bacon sandwich and other pastries. They all said it was delicious.

The mom and pop atmosphere is great too."
223,cranberrys-brooklyn,2017-04-14,5.0,"Oh my god, I love this place. I come here for coffee every morning and it's always delicious.

224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2020-05-24,5.0,"* I have never been to Ole & Steen in person before this is is a review based on their food delivered to me

I ordered from Ole & Steen when I saw they had a vegetarian sandwich and then I also ordered a cinnamon social because I had read that that's their signature pastry.

My food arrived and my sandwich was so beautiful! I got the Beech Mushroom vegetarian sandwich and it was a good sized portion. Each bite was flavorful. However, I do have to add that it was a bit salty (maybe the pesto?) but other than that it was amazing.

I also noticed that in my order that the workers here threw in a chocolate bun for me which was so sweet. If yall are reading this yelp review I hope you guys are staying safe, thank you so much! The bag w/ the bun on it had a note on it, ""Be kind and spread love - Stay safe!"" It really made my entire day and it's only 1:31 PM. 

The chocolate bun was very good. Pretty big sized portion, loaded with dark chocolate chips. If you were to cut it in half and throw some PB or any other butter of your choice it would really make it transcend. Tasted pretty good cold and the chocolate chips still melted in my mouth. 

I had a bite of the cinnamon social (because I already had the bun you know) and it definitely is a pastry that tastes better being warmed up (but is also enjoyable while cold). I tasted an explosion of the rich cinnamon swirl inside and the bread was so delicately soft. Definitely looking forward to that later.

All and all, pretty happy with my order and hopefully I'll be able to get the chance to visit Ole & Steen soon."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2020-02-29,4.0,"Always a huge fan of anything Ole & Steen. I've tried multiple sweet options- carrot bun, strawberry tart, chocolate muffin, cinnamon social, and pumpkin bread (seasonal), but this time decided to go for their savory, open rye sandwiches (served on a thick slice of rye bread). I didn't even bother eating them with my hands because the massive amount of toppings were so carefully arranged atop the bread. 

Smoked Trout - Relatively new item, and my marginally favorite of the two. It came with a thick spread of hollandaise sauce and smoked trout on the base, and then the deviled eggs and scallions stacked on top. 

Smoked Salmon - The smoked salmon wrapped itself around a thick tube of celery root, caper, pickled onion, and watercress.

One other note- Ole & Steen sells amazing quality breads. I've bought their seeded rye and sourdough, and they're both so hearty. Definitely overpriced, even compared to Whole Foods varieties, but if anyone was ever curious, that's the fact."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2020-02-18,4.0,"A unique part of the neighborhood, Ole and Steen is a Scandinavian cafe that sells a variety of breads, pastries, and coffee drinks. A few things make Ole and Steen stand out from the rest of the coffee shops in the area. The first is how large it is; seating is abundant on the main floor with a full set of stools and tables for working, as well as an entire bottom floor accessible by stairs full of additional seating. As well, the selection of foods eclipses that of almost any other coffee shop, and there are several Scandinavian style buns and pastries that have unique flavors. Top ones for me are the cinnamon pastry and the lemon cardamom bun. The coffee itself is fine, nothing crazy but gets the job done.

The one drawback is the price; this place is not the cheapest and you'll probably pay $1-2 more for food and drinks here than other comparable shops. But it's worth it once you find your go-to item."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2020-01-15,4.0,"As a Scandinavian, I was EXTREMELY happy to see this place come to New York. I'm forever explaining baked goods and pastries to my friends, and while this place doesn't sell aebleskiver (filled pancake balls) year-round, or lefse (Norwegian-American potato flatbread), it DOES have some amazing cinnamon rolls and cinnamon socials, breads, and other pastries.

I brought my sister here and we shared the cinnamon social. It's a little doughier than the cinnamon roll, and doesn't have all the icing the roll does. It's the perfect size for sharing, or for taking the rest home for breakfast the next day. It's not exceedingly sweet, and big plus to no overdose of cardamom (yuck). I went with a friend last night and tried the cinnamon roll, which is stickier with a flakier pastry--perfect with a hot drink. I got a hot chocolate, which was not Hershey's in a cup thankfully. It was the right amount of bitter and sweet, thick and mixed well, and went perfectly with the cinnamon roll.

I like that they have a water dispenser here to cut down on the plastic water bottle craze! My only thing is it's not totally hygge. The booths are nice and I like the chairs and the little tables, but it's just missing that extra Danish hygge touch, like some candles and a fireplace...which is a lot to ask for in the Flatiron area, but I can wish for a piece of Copenhagen here (Flying Tiger being up the street).

I got a loaf of rye for my great aunt here and she LOVED it. She grew up with the real thing, made by my great grandmother, so she really appreciated the authenticity. And the prices are not bad for anything they sell here. I WILL BE BACK!"
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-10-26,4.0,"Pastries are a 5. The cinnamon social is a essentially flat Cinnabon - YUM. Their open face sandwiches are also great. I like the chicken smorrebrod, lots of fresh cream with the crunch of chopped Brussels sprouts. 

There's usually someone by line, in front of the window of pastries, to help you figure out what everything is. 

There's seating upstairs and downstairs. Downstairs is more spacious, and you can get work done there also. 

I'm only docking a star because during weekday lunch hours, they do a subpar job at line maintenance, and get confused by what order people are standing in line. This past week, someone rang me up at the counter, and then completely forgot to hand me the food I got."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-10-02,3.0,"Another day, another fancy bakery in the Union Square/Flatiron area. Ole & Steen is a Danish bakery filled with delicious-looking pastries and sweets. Prepare to splurge a bit, but the place is spacious and worth checking out, with more seating downstairs.

I went overboard on my first visit and got three items. My one savory purchase was a toastie with braised short rib, caramelized onions, and cheese. The meat was a bit sparse and dry, but I enjoyed the bread and cheese together with the sweet and tender onions. The cinnamon social slice was also a bit dry but I can see it going well with tea or coffee. The blackberry and white chocolate carnival bun was sweet, lightly tart, and tasty.

I've also had the poached pear porridge for breakfast, and while it's warm and comforting, it's not worth the price.

If, like me, the vast display makes you feel overwhelmed, chat up an employee. They're very friendly, and they'll patiently explain what's available and offer up some good recommendations."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-12-02,4.0,"Ole & Steen is my new favorite chain - this Denmark bakery recently took the city by storm and I love the Midtown East location. When I was hunting for a coffee shop to have a mini meeting and walked by the Flatiron Ole& Steen by happenstance, I knew I was in for a lovely time. 

Ole & Steen excels at pastries, sandwiches, breads, espresso, and also offers soups, lighter beverages, and occasional bowls. Last time I got an apple fog, which is like a hot cider with a smooth froth that was reminiscent of chai. Can't go wrong with any of the pastries, they're all a treat for your sweet tooth.

Prices are Midtown expensive, but the thoughtfulness in each location makes it worthwhile if you're sitting in. The cafe's are bright, clean, quiet, with impeccable bathrooms. I love the tableware, which is perfectly balanced if you need to carry a pot of tea or a bowl of soup. The seats are not crammed too closely together. The Flatiron location also has seating downstairs if you need it. I haven't tried the wi-fi.

The ordering process is weird, where you get in line and then a counter person follows you down the row as you order things. It makes it easy to lose your train of thought if you're new and haven't seen all the options. The awkward wayfinding is worth docking a star as I can imagine chaos during lunch rush."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-11-25,5.0,"I came here last week after randomly finding this place on Yelp. I loved visiting Copenhagen for all their coffee and delicious pastries, so I was really excited to see that a Danish style bakery opened up in New York. 

It was buzzy around lunchtime, but the workers did a good job keeping the line moving. 

I ordered the Cinnamon Social, which is this giant slice of what looks like a squished cinnamon bun. It was so pretty on display but also so tasty! The texture was really soft and the bun just melted in my mouth. It was pretty big (and $5) but it lasted me 2 servings.

I also got a coffee which was okay. 

Definitely will be going back to try out all their other food options!"
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2020-02-23,4.0,The pastries here are to die for.  Stayed close by for a weekend and came here everyday.
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2020-01-25,4.0,"Very nice atmosphere and cozy seating area. Great place to catch up with a friend over coffee/tea. If you get a tea in a mug, they'll refill hot water without extra fee :) The cinnamon pastry I got was ok, but look forward to trying other sweets/ baked goods during my future visits!"
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-09-13,4.0,"I've wanted to pop into Ole & Steen for some time.  Boy, it did not disappoint.  I opted for the Lemon Tart with Strawberry Meringue.  The base of the crust carries a slight saltiness to it which balances out the sweetness.  The base of the tart was smooth and understated too.  If only it had more hints of citrus.   

What really made this dish stand out was the Strawberry Meringue Top.  It's quirky colorfulness paired with it's light crisp made for just the right amount of texture.  I was also fond of the box in which it was served in.  

The one minor caveat was ordering.  Pastries seemed to be housed on separate shelves near the front entrance.  It was unclear how this process works when approaching staff members who were kind, patient and inviting.  

This space is sleek and gorgeous. Very Scandinavian.  A wonderful addition to the Flatiron District."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2020-01-05,5.0,"åh godhed! That's ""oh goodness"" in Danish. 

This place is top notch. I tried the open-faced salmon sandwich, cinnamon roll, and a hot cup of coffee during my visit. Everything was delicious. Service was friendly for a place that was VERY busy on a Saturday afternoon.

They had enough seating inside too people watch, and a downstairs area which I did not visit.

I will certainly be back!"
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-06-03,5.0,"Update:  we have finished the bread with the chia and sunflower seeds, which remained crispy on the outside due to the seeds until every last crumb was gone.  I wish they would open up a location in lower Manhattan in either the Financial District or in Brookfield Place, where there is a dearth of good bakeries. 

I am still dreaming of the strawberry tart, which is like an almond-flavored ring ding with a crispy chocolate layer with strawberries on top.

Previous review:
Love the bread: soft in the middle and crispy on the outside with chia and sunflower seeds.  

I had the opportunity to sample many pastries here and the strawberry tart is a must-try: chocolate coated marzipan cake with a strawberry on top with cream in the middle."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-11-20,4.0,"This is a cute bakery with tons of artisan made breads and baked goods.

Sweet tooth got out of control and needed my sugar fix.

Tried this awesome looking fruit cake 8$ish for a tiny portion.

It's light and natural,without being too sweet.
There is seating area in the basement.cozy!"
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-05-08,4.0,"Exceptionally friendly staff always ready to give you good recommendations. I got the Cinnamon Twist and another cup of the expensive coffee cup size is equal to Starbucks tall cup at twice the price but not twice the flavor.

It wasn't too busy when I went there since I went in the afternoon. The Twist was good but they should offer to zap it to get it warm and let you get a whiff the Cinnamon aroma.   I will be back again because I love pastries and they have so many items I have not tried"
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"I've passed by here a lot and it always looks so good so I finally came in one day. I got this seedy, marzipan, puff pastry twist thing, and it was so unique and so so delicious. The marzipan was such a nice touch. I also got a cup of coffee. It was pretty good, not the most amazing ever, but standard and good enough. The employees in there are al really nice and attentive, and overall the place is really nice and clean. There's a fair amount of seating and I was able to find an outlet pretty easily to charge my phone. Overall, I'd come here again to either get that same delicious twist or to try something new!"

4. Truffle log
Good environment."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-11-03,5.0,"Probably one of the fanciest looking cafe I've come across. They had a huge collection of pastries and sandwiches. Prepare to splurge a bit more than you would spend on pastries. I had the following:

1. Smoked Salmon Roll: This was just so delicious, I am not usually a fan of smoked sandwiches but this made me change my mind.

2. Chocolate Muffin: Not your typical muffin, you will go back for more."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-05-13,3.0,"Ole & Steen is one of several bakeries & cafes hailing from overseas that are opening in NYC lately. Based in Denmark(known there as Lagkagehuset), it's nice to see a Danish cafe open for some variation to typical French ones. This location is their first U.S. store, and they have already opened a 2nd NYC store since my visit.

I stopped in just to get some baked goods to go. As far as the food, I got a cinnamon social, which they call one of their signature items, and the raspberry pastry slice. The dough of both pastries are ok in flavor and texture and fit in to what I'd expect of Danish pastries. What stands out are the fillings in the pastries. Even though it looks like a thin amount of filling is used, they are very flavorful. The cinnamon flavor of the social pastry was yummy, but my favorite was the raspberry pastry slice with a white icing. 

Unfortunately, the feedback about the layout from a number of other Yelpers is true. It's not particularly customer-friendly. Before going in the cafe, I suggest and looking at the pastries displayed by the storefront window from outside because you can't really see them inside and the line is a few feet away for health/sanitary reasons. 

Once inside, there is a long counter with more items displayed. Some are the same as the ones in the storefront window, others are not. There are a few register stands spaced apart along this counter where you order once an employee directs you there. Because everything is at a distance while you wait in line, it's a little harder to decide what you want to order before it's your turn. 

An employee walked over from the counter to the front of the line. I guess this is to help with any questions about what's in the storefront window due to the awkward layout. Then, the employee directed me to his register at the long counter, where more items are displayed. I didn't have time to look closely at what was available there. I asked him if the items at the counter are the same as the storefront window. He said yes...in reality, they aren't because I noticed some things that I didn't see before. 

I added the raspberry pastry to my order from the counter display. The pastries were on a raised metal surface and the employee attempted to slide a spatula under one. He ended up pushing the rest of the pastries towards the glass. Instead of stopping and getting a bakery tissue/sheet, gloves, or another tool to help himself, he kept pushing the spatula and pastries toward the glass. I watched two of them fall off the metal surface into the gap between the metal surface and glass. The 3rd one was pushed on top of those, which finally allowed him to get the spatula under the 4th pastry because there was nowhere else for the pastries to go. He wasn't particularly friendly either.

I would stop in again to try other items and hope the service experience is a little better."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-10-02,3.0,"When I was in Copenhagen I was inside a bakery everyday, I couldn't resist. I was happy to see this place open up right by union square! The staff recommended the cinnamon roll and additionally ordered the carrot bun and custard danish. My expectations fell flat as nothing blew me away and the bun was a little bland. The cinnamon pastry was just that, a cinnamon roll. Maybe if they warmed it up it would've been better. The custard danish was good, but I also love custard so it would be difficult to mess up. Overall the place is nice, had plenty of outlets but the pastries were just okay. The staff weren't as helpful as the layout is is a bit awkward and hard to see what all the options are and when I asked the staff they just kinda sorta leaned over the counter and pointed."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-02-07,4.0,"I love all things Japanese and Nordic, so was ecstatic to hear that Ole & Steen was opening in Union Square. The pastries were really good, but not life-changing like I'd hope it'd be. Would still recommend visiting if you're in the area though.

I got the cinnamon pastry (believe this is one of their most popular menu items) and the marzipan truffle log. The cinnamon pastry was essentially a cinnamon roll - tasty but nothing to rave home about.  The truffle log was very indulgent, and had a strong almond/cherry taste to it. I'll be back to try some of the fruits tarts. I also had a cup of Americano, which was solid. You can either order your food/drinks for here or to go. There's a decent amount of seating on the ground floor and in the downstairs area.

My biggest issue is the layout of the store/how chaotic it is, though I'm sure they'll work out the details past their initial opening. It was truly a cluster last Sunday afternoon. The layout is absolutely awful - the pastries by the front window are the only ones on display, so you unfortunately can't even see all the baked goods everything until you're at the very front of the line about to order. Unsurprisingly, that bottlenecks the rest of the line. When I ordered my coffee with my pastries, they never gave me a receipt for my coffee nor did the baristas have a slip for my order, so I had to verbally tell them what I ordered/they had to take my word for it. I really hope all this works itself out, but the layout seems difficult to change tbh."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-01-26,4.0,"This is good, but definitely not ""wowsa, this is incredible!"" Also, it's super expensive for what you get. I'm pretty surprised by the reviews here and wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but it's solid for a dessert when you're in the area.

We got the cinnamon slice special, which is their signature treat, and the chocolate truffle log with marzipan filling.

I actually like the truffle log more than the cinnamon slice. The cinnamon slice was like a cinnamon bun knock-off, with some edges of it fairly dry. The inside was moist and delicious. 

The truffle log is huge and dense and fudgy. You kinda feel like an Adonis taking a bite. Perfect for those pre-menstrual days (hey girl!)"
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2020-04-28,5.0,So gooooooooood!! Some of the best I've ever had! How come I only knew about this place now??
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-01-23,5.0,"The newest all-day bakery you need to try is actually the 100th (!) location worldwide of the renowned bakery that started in Denmark.

This is the first US location, a huge beautiful space with tons of pastries on display in the window plus tons more breads behind the counter and sandwiches and other sweet and savory items in the long display case running down the long counter.

I just tried a bunch of stuff and it was all excellent. The Cinnamon Swirls and the Spandauer were exceptional if you want a flaky pastry, and if you want something chocolatey, definitely try the Truffle Logs or the Tosca Tart.

I'll definitely be back soon and often to try more of the extensive menu."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-01-26,5.0,"As someone with a real weakness for Danish pastries, I'm beyond thrilled that Ole & Steen opened up an NYC location. Ole & Steen is exactly what you would expect - gorgeous space, huge array of delicious and fresh pastries, and the perfect vibe for a weekday pick-me-up or weekend catch-up session. 

Here's what you should know about Ole & Steen:
1. Get everything. All the pastures, bread, all of it. It's all fresh and delicious. (Special plug for the chocolate rye.)
2. Modern fixtures that give the space the perfect millennial vibe. There is more space and seating downstairs. 
3. The drinks and sit down menu have a huge selection - so you can find something for everyone here. O&S also offer Danish beers and sodas. 
4. Friendly staff. Everyone is really nice.

224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2019-08-07,4.0,"So, my friend and I wanted to see a movie and wanted to grab dinner before that and we were looking for places. This cafe/bakery looked cute but we weren't sure if the would have any sandwiches or soups (a meal). Turns out they did. So we decided to go here since it was a minute away from the AMC movie theatre. When we entered, all these desserts were staring right at us and we didnt know which one to get. They all looked good. The lady at the counter saw this and she was patient and super nice and gave us samples and suggestions. I got the breakfast sandwich for dinner (it was the American thing to do!). I love eggs and bacon and it was good. I also got the cafe mocha pastry and if you're a chocolate coffee lover like me you would love it. It was like heaven! The place wasnt too crowded but it was a great place to hangout and take. Overall it was a nice bakery."
224,ole-and-steen-new-york,2020-02-17,2.0,"Today marked my first and last visit to Ole & Steen. The cafe is filthy, and the service is painfully slow and delivered by comically incompetent staff (How do you not have forks? How, Sway, how?). 

It's a shame because the pastries and drinks aren't half bad. 

The wifi must be lightning fast here because the place was packed, but I don't work out of cafes so there is nothing to draw me back here. With Maison Kayser and Le Pain Quotidien up the street there is no good reason for me to return to this travesty of a bakery. Good riddance."

In particular, their chocolate cinnamon bun was so good that I even brought an extra one back all the way to the US as my carryon luggage. I was delighted to find out that they had a US version of the bakery called Ole & Steen. Last night, I finally made time to go visit the bakery. I bought the same chocolate cinnamon bun. However, when I ate it, it tasted different. While the one in Copenhagen was airy, crispy, and delicious, the one I got from this location was super greasy, heavy, and didn't taste quite as good. It seemed like the ingredients used were the same, however the assembly of the pastry wasn't as skillful as that for the one I had in Copenhagen. The pastry itself is 2-stars because it still looked good, even though it was unsatisfying to eat. 

I added an extra star for the service. The staff managed the line efficiently and I was in and out. They were very friendly and helpful. 

I'm still open to checking out a separate Ole & Steen location to see if I have the same issues with quality."

That sums it all up. Seriously, someone, please take away my credit cards or I'll go broke and get diabetes from visiting this location so often!

After a pretty amazing YES event, I've become a regular customer at this irresistible bakery. EVERYTHING on the menu is good. And I mean that. You HAVE to try all of their desserts--they're like little bits of heaven that transform your senses and transport your taste buds to a place unachievable through any other experience. AND, I don't feel bloated or disgusting after indulging in these delicate sweets, unlike many others, which are loaded with who knows what.

The breads are also something you should consider switching to if you want to eat healthier without giving up bread. Their rye bread is the real deal--the kind that I used to eat in Ukraine, not the disgusting, American wonder-bread chemical creation. I get rye loafs and freeze them, so my freezer always has some quality bread that tastes almost like fresh once you remove it from the cold."

I got a raspberry dessert with cream on the inside on a marzipan disc with a small piece of chocolate just on top of that chewy almond goodness. Oh! And pistachio crumbles on top... how can I live my life without having one of these every damn day? I also tried their version of a cinnamon roll, nice and soft but also slightly chewy in the middle. Yum. 

Had a cortado to accompany the desserts, it was an okay espresso, but we needed something to cut the sweetness. 

Pricey but completely worth it."

Whatever was inside, it tasted well together. The sandwich was $7.50, I would say it's fair considering the location and other sandwiches from around the area line pret a manger and maison kayser in walking distance. This place has a lot of seating, they also have seating downstairs as well. Wasn't expecting the downstairs seating when I walked in.
