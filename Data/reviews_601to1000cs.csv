601,java-works-new-york,2009-04-30,1.0,"Located in the back of the Student Lounge at the Tisch School of Arts resides quite possibly the worst sellers of food in all five boroughs.

Nothing good can be said of this dark soulless place.

Sandwiches - Each day 'fresh' sandwiches are made, yet somehow the meats and cheese immediately soak into the bread, making it a soggy mess of carbohydrates, oozing out into a cornucopia of Boar's Head knock-offs.

Coffee - Burnt. Burnt burnt burnt burnt burnt. No amount of half/half and sugar could possibly tie together this ode to ruined mornings.

Price - For a place serving only students it baffles me that they would charge the prices they do.

Service - They simply do not care.

I will never understand why anyone would get food from here. So many places so close, it just doesn't make sense."
603,7-eleven-new-york-76,2017-01-06,1.0,"They have some bullshit story about the Amex Serve reload not being programed into their POS  system.  I was here 6 months ago and they did not want to take Serve loads then either.  Amex should revoke their Amex ability all together, but for now.  IF YOU WANT TO LOAD YOUR CARD, DONT GO TO THIS STORE!!!!!"
605,the-bar-and-lounge-new-york,2019-02-26,1.0,"You should only eat food here if you want the pleasure of tasting it again later when its coming up.  Very expensive, small pours, minimal selections, small restaurant, thief's on staff.  So many better options in the area, coming to this shit hole just makes no sense."
606,audreys-coffee-and-sandwich-shop-brooklyn,2018-06-04,1.0,"Per the building guard, this place no longer in business. He also added that it wasn't good."
607,tolstoy-alexandra-new-york,2006-01-15,3.0,"The food here is good however, beware of how many coffees you drink. There are no coffee refills. And they will take your cup half full, refill and charge you again. I consider myself a very experienced brunch diner and I have never been charged for coffee refills anywhere."
608,caffe-bon-greenwich-3,2015-08-10,5.0,"I chase the food truck all over town!  And am so glad I know where she is during the warm weather (Byram Beach concession).

I love the coffee.  The panini classico is my favorite . . . though the panini italiano and the grilled cheese are also heavenly.  And then there are the pastries . . . and soup . . . and specials.

Can't get enough!"
608,caffe-bon-greenwich-3,2012-05-25,5.0,"I am thrilled to give Caffe Bon a 5-star review!! Maria has the best, most authentic, homemade Italian bistro-like food in the area!  Simply delicious!  And, Maria is such a warm and friendly person!"

I still can grab my coffee and bagels 
Stay safe
Stay healthy"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-05-11,5.0,"Is there a line out the door any time you come here? Yep! Is it totally cramped, overcrowded, and has extremely limited seating? Completely. Do I still come here every time I get off the train coming into NYC? Oh yeah. 

I'll admit I don't have much to compare it too, not being from NY, but I just love the bagels here. They offer so many kinds of bagels and flavors of cream cheese. Don't let the line scare you, it's well organized and moves quickly. My favorite combo is the everything bagel with strawberry cream cheese. I know it sounds weird, but the savory with the sweet cannot be beat."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-04-21,5.0,"I've said it before and I'll say it again: if you have an 'everything' bagel on your menu, you're almost automatically getting five stars from me. Hah! Could there be anything more delicious?! 

I'm personally super grateful for this place because our team leader picked up a whole slew of bagel sandwiches for our team lunch offsite in a co-working space. While we never went in this bagel shop, it traveled well to-go. They got our orders correctly and I ate MULTIPLE of them. They were so great!

Such an awesome quick lunch or breakfast stop!"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-05-19,5.0,"This is one of my favorite bagel sandwich place. Was recommended by a friend and turns out it was close to our hotel. It really busy here and usually a line. We didn't wait too long though. They have so many things here--sandwiches, pasteries, coffee, etc. My boyfriend ended up getting the breakfast bagel sandwiches. Their bagels are fresh and soft and there are so many flavors to choose from. I love their blueberry bagel. Definitely another bagel spot to try if you are around Manhattan Town. I would come back if I am around!"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-03-24,5.0,"Like the name implies.... BEST BAGEL & Coffee (which I didn't drink) lol.

Don't let the line deter you. There is a reason why there is a line out the door. It's THAT good. They are very efficient in moving the line. First, you order at the first cashier and then you go pay for your items at the second cashier. 

Lots of bagel options. I got myself a smoked salmon lox bagel with extra egg on an everything bagel. The eggs were thick and fluffy. My bagel had a good amount of scallion cream cheese and avocado! Wow, NY bagels are no joke. STACKED. It makes California bagels look kinda sad... I wish all my bagels looked this goooood. Forgot to tell them to hold the capers. I HATE CAPERS. 

It was love at first bite. Seriously the bagel was so big it was hard to fit in my mouth.... hey, again not complaining! So warm and toasty. Bagel was PERFECTION. Saved the other half for later that day. 

Very little seating so it's best for on-the-go. Highly recommend coming here in you are visiting NY or in the area."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-03-17,4.0,"Definitely best bagel, however, the coffee is questionable = 4 stars 

Coffee - originally wanted a cappuccino but they were honest and told me that it's not a real cappuccino but a powder form, no expresso and added sugar. I ended up with brewed coffee, which wasn't that great. 

Bagel - was an absolute dream. As a tourist, it did not cross my mind to have bagels in the city. I went for the smoked salmon and scallion cream cheese. It was extremely stuffed, they did not cheap out on the toppings. I had a bite of the Philly cheesesteak and it was SOO good. 

Line up may look big but it goes by fast."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-03-11,5.0,"It was workout wifey's birthday weekend and she was determined to get a New York bagel. Luckily for us, Best Bagel & Coffee was down the street from our hotel. A nice hop, skip and jump, before we take on the day's adventure.

At around 8am, the line wasn't too bad. I want to say that it took us about 30 minutes to get to the front and order. The shop itself isn't all that big. Expect to be packed in like sardines. 

While my friend went to find us a table, me and another gal pal waited to pay for our food and drinks. That took maybe another 15 minutes, with staff being polite and efficient. All good. We were on vacation and wasn't much in a hurry to get to anywhere.

Wifey found a table that a few Canadian tourists were kind to share. Eating our NY bagels was a great conversation piece. Somehow it led to a discussion of east coast vs west coast rap. Humorous all around. 

Rap conversations, aside, the bagels were STACKED. Like seriously loaded. I ordered a garlic bagel with olives and cream cheese. Wifey got an everything bagel, while friend got herself a lox and bagel. I think they put an equivalent of a tub of cream cheese. My friend swore that they put an entire salmon in her bagel. 

Best Bagel isn't shy about stuffing their soft and chewy bagels. It was soooo good! You can complain all you want that there's too much. But, at least, you can take it out. I prefer too much cream cheese versus not enough any day.

Great bagels and good company for breakfast. Definitely, a 5-star experience. If I'm in the area, I'd hit this place up, again."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-03-04,5.0,"I had this place bookmarked for a long time but have never had the chance to come.  I finally was in the area and went for it. A lot of reviews mention the line but I went at 8am on a Thursday and although there was a line it moved really quick.  I probably waited 5 minutes to order and 10 minutes to get my food. They are so busy in here so make sure you check your order before leaving!  They forgot my chocolate chip muffin!  It was probably for the best since I am trying to watch my figure anyway. That was the universe teaching me a lesson. 

What I did eat was a Plain bagel with turkey swiss lettuce and tomato.  It was a beautiful sandwich. I love how the bagel is soft and chewy. I can't stand when there is a hard crust on the outside of the bagel and it makes it hard to eat. This bagel was perfect. So good! They have all sorts of options in here so no matter what you are in the mood for you will probably find it. 

I highly recommend! 5 stars all the way."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-05-16,4.0,Was walking by and happened to see this place on yelp. The line was out the freaking door so naturally I had to try it! We got the salmon lox bagel and it was delicious. Only downside was that it was so packed finding seating was like playing musical chairs.
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-02-28,5.0,"Holy shit!  I love bagels, but these are probably the best bagels I've ever had.  Of course this review is based off of me eating Californian bagels all my life and comparing it to a New York bagel.  

Best Bagel & Coffee is packed with very little seating, and normally there is a line.  This place is really popular.  Don't worry though, the line moves pretty fast.  You order your bagel or even a sandwich at the counter straight ahead of you.  The staff taking down your order will then hand you a copy of your order to which you will take it to another line to hand over to another staff who will ring you up.  I know, wtf?  Then you hover over people eating and kind of keep an eye out for people leaving so you can pounce on an empty table.  While you're waiting, listen for your order number to be called so you can then go back to the counter to grab your order.

Seating and even a table with no chairs is very hard to come by here.  I think if the weather was a lot better outside then I wouldn't mind eating outside on some random sidewalk, but since it was chilly, no one wanted to leave their tables.  We ended up eating at a table while standing up which was not ideal, but better than no table I guess.

As for the bagels, they are on the pricey side ($15ish each), but I do think that the freshness and the generous toppings make them totally worth it!  My bf and I ordered toasted bagels with Smoked Salmon, scallion, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocados, capers, cucumbers, and cream cheese.  Man, oh man, these bad boys were humongous and freakin delicious.  Everything just tasted super fresh.  I've never had thin cucumber slices with bagels before, but it totally works!  My bf and I eat a lot, but even we were like damn, we should've ordered just one bagel and split it between the both of us.  That's how filling these were.  They were basically bagel sandwiches.  

Best Bagels & Coffee definitely has the best bagels, but not the best coffee though.  The customer service is here OK, and very basic.  I know that the bagels are on the pricey side, but it is definitely worth checking out if you're looking to try out a New York bagel.  Just have some patience and maybe order take out if there are no tables/seating available."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-02-26,5.0,"Such a cool find near Times Square. 

It is an awesome place! The line looked long when we got in it, but was so fast I almost didn't have enough time to make up my mind! I got a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel and my husband got a bagel with strawberry cream cheese. They were both phenomenal. The cream cheese was astonishing."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-02-06,5.0,"Omfg!!!! The bagel is perfect! I miss nyc putting milk in my coffee! The smell of delicious bread when you walked in! It's huge in here too! It's right around the corner from my hotel which is dangerous, but perfect at the same time! I kept it very very simple, 3.54 bucks for a bagel. My total meal $5 buck, coffee only needs to be $1.00! This place is worth the stop! Check out that everything bagel with  plain cream cheese just how it should be! This a trap for locals and tourists. They are fast, with over 3k reviews I  flew in to come here! 

Lunch or breakfast, hits the spot."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-02-25,5.0,"Wow, the bagel here is great! I had the smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel and they gave me so much toppings the single bagel lasted me the entire day. Seating is pretty limited, so you probably have to share a table, but the food is so worth it. I could only finish half my bagel in one sitting and kept the other half for later.

Would return again!"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-02-10,4.0,"THIS IS A PLACE FOR TWO!! I got the smoked sandwich bagel and it was A LOTTTTT. I'll also suggest ordering a drink, it helps :) 

I came here Monday ~6:30am and there was no line. I got the smoked salmon on an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and capers on the side. I got it on the side because I wasn't sure what capers taste like. It's like small sour pellets fyi (think of like pickles but not that crunchy). I think it added like a dimension to the sandwich but I'll leave it up to you to see if it's worth the additional $0.80. 

The salmon was ok. I wished it had a smokier taste tho. I feel like you are paying more for the amount of salmon. They are not skimpy on the scallion cream cheese as well but the capers help cut into that a bit since I like lighter coats of cream cheese. The veggies were good, I honestly wished there was more cuz I've been lacking in veggies this NY trip haha. The bagel was nice! I'd come back for just the regular bagel!!!

If you are a solo traveler, maybe just get a regular plain bagel with a spread. (It is still a NY bagel! Something I wished I told myself lol.) With some will power, I was able to finish my bagel...but now that I finished I'm like I could've done without. 

Note: my review may be skewed by the big dinner I had last night :)))"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-01-29,5.0,"I live all the way across the country and still fantasize about this bagel! I have been to this shop twice. It's a no frills, commuter type bagel and coffee shop- but damn it is so good!

There is not a lot of seating and often a line, especially during morning commute times. The line moved very fast when I was in and I was able to grab a seat.

The lox bagel with scallion cream cheese was massive. I could only eat half and then saved the other half for later. 

I tried another fancier shop and found Best Bagel was definitely the best! And cheaper to boot! I will definitely come back EVERYTIME I am in New York. Hell, I'm considering grabbing a flight right now!"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,"I've been to this bagel shop a few times... it's always crowded which means it's always fresh! Bread is on point, they have a variety of cream cheeses, and plenty of options!! Breakfast sandwiches, hot or cold subs, salads and pastries !

I've gone in the morning before work and there's always a line out the door. However they run their shop great!! It runs smooth, you're in and out within 20 minutes which I feel is worth it. If you'd like to eat in, that will be a little be harder. Seating is limited and like I said there's always a crowd! 

I would suggest Checking them out if you're big on sammies and freshness !"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,"Amazing Bagel spot!

Stopped here prior to our New York adventure and it did not disappoint. We got here right when it opened and it instantly started to get packed! Seating is limited (we were lucky and scored a small seated table). The bagel was delicious and their iced coffee is everything! 

I ordered a Bacon, Egg & cheese on an egg bagel and my husband ordered it on a cinnamon raisin and we had them both toasted. It was perfect! Highly recommend if you're in the area to try this place out!"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-01-31,4.0,"The food is good but quite pricey for a grab and go place that don't have any service at all. 

I got the smoked salmon with sesame bagel and the blueberry bagel with cream cheese. I don't really find the smoked salmon bagel to be any special. It's a standard one but this place gives you more fillings. I enjoyed the blueberry bagel more with just cream cheese filling and toasted. The bread is very fluffy and chewy. You can definitely taste that it's freshly made. It has a pretty purple color and subtle blueberry flavor. They are very generous with the cream cheese; it's as thick as the bagel itself. The cream cheese is whipped so it's very fluffy and soft. It's not overly sour either."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-01-02,3.0,"I arrived at 6:30 am because reviews said lines were out the door. There was no line and they were cooking bagels and muffins which was cool to watch. However the register person was confused and didn't know what was going on, over charged me and when he called someone to help him there was still confusion. 

I needed a platter of bagels to bring someone to the hospital wrapped but they only have wrapping with confetti on it and ribbons which is happy and ok for a birthday but not for a hospital visit - or shiva- or something like that. 

Bagels they claim are $1.49 and then charge you extra per item you put on the plater - which they were not up front about. If I knew I was being charged per item like this - I would have gotten a dozen bagels and made my own platter.

But the quality of the bagels are high - good spot to just grab an individual bagel. The crowd favorites were blueberry bagel, cinnamon raisin and corn muffin."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-01-09,5.0,"To be honest, I'm not sure if these are the best bagels in NYC because they were the first bagels I had.  They were so good that I couldn't even try any other place and had to keep coming back.  

We ordered the everything bagel with lox and scallion cream cheese and onions.  It was so delicious.  They gave SO much lox that it was almost hard to eat because the bagel was so massive.  I seriously could have ate their every day if I could, but I had to leave room in my stomach to try other things on our trip.  I was so envious of all the business people going in there to get their breakfast to go.  I wish I had something like this near my work in LA.  

Like I said, to be fair, this is the only bagel place I tried, but I'm telling you, you really couldn't go wrong with this place."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-12-26,4.0,"Had a great whole wheat everything bagel with tofu veggie spread here! Probably the smoothest tofu spread I've ever come across so I wonder if they put a lot of oil or butter (hopefully it's dairy free). 

Regular black coffee was over brewed/burned so unfortunately we couldn't enjoy bagels&coffee. I would recommend using something like almond milk in the coffee if you do get it."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-12-30,4.0,"Great bagel spot located near Penn Station, it's about a 5 minute walk as you get off the train. I got a smoked salmon bagel with cream cheese, capers and red onion. The bagel was great and also massive, they don't skimp on the toppings. The coffee is your standard drip coffee though and nothing special at all. 

Personally I prefer Russ & Daughters for a NYC bagel but the convenience of this place can't be beat. Be prepared to wait though as the lines can get crazy long."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-12-09,5.0,"Get this, their everything bagel has seasoning on the top and bottom of the bagel. I didn't know that was possible! 

Wonderfully chewy and boasting a giant dollop of smooth and creamy tofu cream cheese, my everything bagel was a heavenly experience.

I wouldn't say it is better than Absolute Bagels on the upper westside, but I believe their operation may be busy enough to have more consistent bagel output. Like boba, a key to making bagel shops good is having the volume of foot traffic to keep churning out fresh bagels.

It was a 20 minute process at 11:30 a.m. on a Tuesday from lining up to receiving my brown bag of chewy goodness."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-03-07,5.0,I ordered a bagel for lunch and it was still amazing and there was still a line!! It is totally worth the wait. Bagels from Best Bagel is always a good idea regardless of the time of day!
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-12-26,5.0,"We got the Smoked Salmon Bagel Sandwich here and substituted the normal cream cheese for scallion cream cheese (+ $1). We also added the capers (+ $0.80). 

The bagel sandwich was delicious and plenty enough to share for 2.  The capers definitely added some saltiness to the overall flavor. 

This place is busy, but efficient so don't worry."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-03-14,4.0,"I have been making my way through all of the top bagel spots in New York. As of now, Brooklyn Bagels still holds the crown, but this place is also very good. Except a long line, especially at peak times, but it will move pretty quickly. It's pretty tough to find a seat, as with any bagel spot, but that's okay. Would come back for sure! I ordered an everything bagel with lox and the works."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-12-22,3.0,"I ordered a sesame bagel and schmear because I really wanted to try this bagel on it's own.   ($5.01)

I like my bagels chewy and I found it to be crispier than anything else so to me this was not the best bagel and the schmear wasn't a schmear  it was more like a goop.  It was so much cream cheese oozing out if it I couldn't really enjoy the bagel I had to take some of it off. 

If you like  crispy  bready bagel you might like this place.  The bagel is large and with all the cream cheese you'll be full just a few bites in."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-11-25,5.0,"Yelp has done it again folks!  The reviews are accurate - this has to literally be the best bagel in the city.
We had the cinnamon raisin, plain, and everything with two small cream cheese on the side.   The cream cheese is fresh and nice size - easily enough for two bagels unless you really like to load it on.
Each bagel was soft on the inside with the right amount of chew.  The best bagel of the three was the everything.  This one was served to us still hot and fresh from the oven which made it absolutely delicious.
The place is relatively small but there are a number of tables that turn over quickly.  There is also someone cleaning the tables that helps you find an open one.
The line to order can be out the door but it moves quick.  Then you have to crowd around the counter waiting to pick up your bagel.  What else do you expect for something this good.  Trust me folks it is worth it!

Tip: when ordering bagels, if you do not have your heart set on a specific flavor, ask them to give you what just came out of the oven and is still hot"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-11-22,5.0,"What more can I add? Their smoked salmon bagel is perfection. I get it on a non-toasted plain bagel with all the included toppings. The lettuce is perfectly shredded, the purple onion is thinly sliced and crispy, and the tomato is the perfect thickness not to be messy. I don't add the optional toppings like capers or avocado.

It's always crowded. First go to the right hand sided line to order. They will give you an order receipt. Then turn around and go to the pay counter and pay for the order. Then wait until they call your number and pick up at the front counter. They call numbers fast. I would say they call a number every 5 to 15 seconds, so it flies by."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-03-14,5.0,"Now I see why New York bagels are a thing! The bagels here are so delicious with a crispy outside, and a soft chewy inside. I had the onion bagel toasted with plain cream cheese and I LOVED it! My kids loved the plain bagels as well (they aren't very adventurous). When we arrived the place looked packed. All of the seating was taken, and there was quite a line but they moved that line quickly. I would definitely recommend Best Bagel & Coffee!"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,"I stay up some nights thinking about their smoked salmon bagel sandwich. The lines here can be daunting, especially in the cold. Worry not, your patience will be rewarded. It can be a little pricey but the portions are humongous and can definitely be shared between 2 people. I'd fly back to New York just for another bite."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-12-14,5.0,"I was staying in the area for work at MSG and looked for spots to grab an early bite. We arrived around 7am on a Thursday and there was no line which was great. Ordered a bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel toasted + large iced coffee. The service was super quick and the shop was quiet, we got our order really fast. We took our bagels and SUPER strong coffee with us back to MSG with us and ate there. From first bite I was so impressed. I had taken 3 of my workmates and they were all so happy with their bagels and the coffee - it was exactly what we needed. The bagel was stuffed full, toasty but moist at the same time. Took me all morning to drink my coffee because it was so strong.

We attempted to come back at 9am Friday and then 10am Saturday but the line was out the door so we passed - the other bagels we got both times didn't even hold a candle to the Best Bagel and Coffee. I will definitely be back for early morning bagels in the future (when there's no line)."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"Best Bagel & Coffee, the name says it all.  This is by far our favorite bagel place in the city. We were in the city last weekend and have a rule on frequenting our favorite bagel place plus one.  No one has taken the favorite away just yet.  We love this place.  I think this time around was the first time the line was not 10 to 12 people deep out the door.  Surprising and not complaining at the same time.  Not sure if it was the time of day or if everyone was watching the Marathon runners they forgot their bagel.  

Now, for the bagels and what we had...my human had his usual, plain bagel with a side of turkey bacon.  The staff is really helpful in charging it as a sandwich, this saves us a buck or two.  Which is always appreciated.  He loved it! 

I had an egg bagel with chive shmear, eggs and turkey bacon.  It was delicious. The amount of shmear was perfect for me to eat the sandwich like a sandwich and not wear it.  

The team has changed something and I think it was a great idea.  They have a person who helps customers get a table by confirming you have already ordered. This allows the patrons who are about to receive their order to have a seat instead of standing because others who have not ordered are already sitting down.  This is was  a great idea! Way to go team.  

All though the line usually goes out the door the team does a really great job at moving the line along.  So, don't let the line intimidate you.  Make the line it will be worth it."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"This is a busy, busy place so if you're trying to sit somewhere come with someone so they can scout while the other orders. 

I'm not a bagel person but my husband is and he absolutely loved guys everything bagel breakfast  sandwich. I got a chicken and bacon wrap and it was delicious warm but didn't reheat well. It was actually more than I was anticipating to eat so don't worry about not getting enough food."
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2020-02-06,5.0,"This line was pouring outside the shop. I was in New York and I thought I've never been to a bagel shop in the city. This couldn't have been a  More perfect place to have them. So authentic, you see the bagels being made in front of you, the rave isn't just cause they're known for the bagels it's really cause they are amazing. So soft, so much variety. You can have anything on the bagel for breakfast lunch or anytime of the day.  
If I'm in the area again I would love to try something else there. I had chicken sandwiches and they were great. 
They ran out of ccupcakes they had they sounded good and wanted to try it but by  11am they're out. I'd suggest getting a menu while your online to know what you want because they  like taking orders fast. On a busy saturday like that I would probably say expect to eat back home or wherever else because getting a seat will be difficult otherwise just eat standing like some others do.

609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-10-28,5.0,"Looked up the best bagel in the city and Yelp led me here. Located a quick 2 minute walk from MSG and Penn Station, this bagel deli is the real deal. 
My boyfriend and I ordered a sausage, egg and cheese on a plain bagel and an everything bagel with cream cheese and then swapped half of each. Both bagels were not only huge, but perfectly soft and chewy on the inside. If I could come here every day, I definitely would. Don't be intimidated by the long line, it moves fast and they have the process down pat. Order your food at the first counter, then pay and order drinks at the second. Wait for your food and voila - you're out in no time ;)"

Staff is relatively friendly and extremely efficient! You get in line and make your order at one register and they print you out a ticket to pay at another register. It's a great system! You can grab your friends tickets and pay for their meal easily."

I got the smoked salmon with lettuce, red onions, scallion cream cheese on an everything bagel and it was almost perfection (wish I added tomatoes!). My travel buddy also got the smoked salmon on an everything bagel but added tomatoes, capers, and jalapeno cream cheese. We both really enjoyed our sandwiches and would definitely come back for more! The portions of the bagel sandwiches are huge because they pack so much in it so I suggest sharing if you just want to try it out."

At the young age of 31 I had never tried a bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese... and what better way than to try it at best bagel in NYC. I was recommended this spot by a cousin and I am so happy we made the morning walk to try. My boyfriend and I ordered a breakfast bagel with sausage and then another bagel with smoked salmon and capers both on everything bagels. Bagels are definitely good to share and be prepared to wait in a line... luckily it wasn't too busy when we went. 100% would return... Best bagels EVER!"
609,best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york,2019-09-08,5.0,"Navigating this place can be tricky because there's always a huge crowd once you walk in, so please follow these directions if it is your first time. 

1. Make your way to the back of the store to place your order. If you are indecisive, it may be best to study the pictures of the menu that your fellow Yelpers have posted. New Yorkers may express their emotions of frustration if you stand in front of the cashier not knowing what you want.

2. Once you order they will give you a receipt. Take this receipt back to the front of the store (by the front door entrance) to pay.

3. Now that you have paid, stand with the crowd until your number is called. The crowd may be overwhelming but service is quick and most are in and out. 

4. Enjoy your delicious bagel and coffee! Oh and good luck finding a table."

Definitely would love to go back after the corona virus. Bubble tea was also refreshing. The Beignets are so yummy. Their sorbets were pretty good too. 

Place was really busy when I went which is a good sign. Cant wait to come back."

610,grace-street-new-york,2020-04-10,5.0,"Ordered 2 Dalgona coffees and a 6 pack of their prepackaged matcha honey lattes for pickup. The coffees were incredibly delicious and filling (they come in huge cups and we ordered ours with boba so definitely a meal-sized drink lol). The perfect pick-me-up during these crazy times! A few hours later I got a message saying that the matcha lattes were accidentally made with regular milk and asked if I wanted replacements. It was such a lovely surprise that they reached out and offered this. I took them up on the offer for a new set of lattes, and they let me know that they can deliver them. However, my address was too far from the store so I offered to drive back in. When we arrived at the shop the next day, the lattes were ready to go and everyone was so nice about the mistake. They even threw in some extra free goodies for the trouble. I highly recommend Grace Street not only for the wonderful drinks and snacks, but also for their customer service! An incredibly pleasant experience, will be ordering again soon!"
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-06-03,5.0,"Thank you so much for providing the frontline hospital staff with your delicious food.

We appreciate you"
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-05-10,4.0,"Edit 2/2020: Honestly, five stars alone for the rose petal milk tea. The ube tea is a close second. I will be getting one or the other every time I visit from now on!

Edit 5/2020: Ordered delivery via Postmates. Rose petal milk tea remains perfect, and I absolutely loved the Dalgona coffee cream puff. Our Postmate got lost so delivery took a long time, but I would order again because the products are so amazing!"
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-03-31,5.0,"Visiting K-town in NYC and craving some desserts? You should defiantly stop by grace street! 

The desserts that are at this place are pretty close to the deserts that are served in Korea. The way that it is plated to the desserts that are on the menu. The matcha ice cream waffle was served warm and it has defiantly satisfied my cravings. If you stop by here I recommend the jasmine matcha bubble tea that is served here. The tea that is served here is so good and you can taste both the jasmine and matcha which, is weirdly such a great combo! 

The atmosphere is nice to go during the day and study when there are less customers. You could stop by with your friends or family it is a relaxed place and there are a good amount of seats here as well! 

Overall this is such a good place to visit however, this place is a bit on the pricer side but I would say it is a place I would visit again when I am in the city!"
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-03-08,3.0,"I like this place, but I think it's slightly overhyped. I'm also not a strong believer of waiting in line, so that also is a reason I docked a star.

Food-wise, it's great. However, it's not the WOW that would make me wait 30min+ for this place. 

So onto the food (important note: food reviewed was based on their vegan/gluten-free option):

1. Ho-Dduk (Korean Donut)- 7/10. Honestly, I've had better. For the price, this isn't worth it. I love hodduck, but I don't feel like the price justified for amount of Korean donuts we got, especially since they were small. The ice cream that it came with was sorbet so I get that that contributes to price, but I don't know if I'm convinced to order it again. It is tasty, but less so when we account for the price.

2. Matcha Beignets- 9/10. These were great!! For the price, the amount we got was lovely. Also, we had ordered the regular + vegan/gluten free and they tasted identical? Not sure if the vegan/gluten free aspect was just for the ice cream. It is YUMMMM (but don't compare it to the ones in New Orleans because that's just unfair)

3. Rose Petal Milk Tea- 9/10. I really liked this! Not everyone likes rose-scented drinks but this girl does and this hit the spot. It's slightly sweeter than I'd prefer but nonetheless a tasty beverage.

4. An Almond Speciality Tea- 8/10. If you've been to DavidsTea, this is quite close. It's a western take on tea with sweetness from a combination of different ingredients. 

P.S. Some people work in this shop which I find mindblowing because it's so loud, I have no idea how they can concentrate. BUT, all that is to say, you can study/work here too and bring a book/laptop :)"
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-03-21,4.0,"This is a must try dessert place if you're looking for a place to hang in k-town. It's a super cute place to chill with friends and grab some desserts. It's usually not hard to find seating and the service is very friendly. 

I usually get the rose milk tea with oat milk and boba. The honey boba can be inconsistent at times but during its peaks it's soo nice and chewy. The boba is already very sweet so if you're not into a lot of sweetness you should get the milk tea with less of no sugar. I like the rose flavor one because it's beautiful and has a nice, floral taste. The rose taste it pretty strong, which I like. 

I also usually get the hotteok, which is a korean sweet pancake with brown sugar filling. I can't find this dessert in the city elsewhere, so I'm very glad grace street has it. Can't say much about this dessert because it's usually super delicious, and the one at Grace street's is no exception. The only thing is the bread part can be thick and dry at times. You can make it vegan by getting it with strawberry sorbet!

Usually people get the shaved ice here, which are also very nice. But I want to shine light onto their other options! They are equally as good."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,"Grace Street's beignets might honestly be some of the best I've ever had. Beignets with matcha powder? Say no more! The beignets were fluffy yet not completely filled with air on the inside, and the powdered sugar + matcha powder gave a wonderful flavor to the dessert (I used the matcha ice cream more to dampen the powderiness of the sugar and matcha, so I wasn't accidentally breathing those in and coughing). Though we got the beignets to share, I ended up eating most of it, heh. 

We also ordered the churro waffles with vanilla ice cream, and it was DELICIOUS. The waffles were perfectly soft yet with an outside layer of crunch, and it paired delightfully with the ice cream. The waffles ended up being sweeter than I typically like, which is why I opted to eat more beignets than waffles. Both were excellent, however, and I wished I had the available stomach space to try more desserts! Next time. 

The space is adorable, with wooden tables and benches for a rustic feel, perfectly Instagrammable if you are getting hot tea in the kettle. My friend and I came expecting to get the tea in a kettle, but it seems that this is only served after a certain time in the evening."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-05-03,5.0,Recently came here to get some rose milk tea with honey boba and I loved it. I've tried the hot version as well and it is so good! I cannot wait for them to reopen so I can enjoy their desserts again!
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-03-11,5.0,"Great cafe, if only it weren't so absurdly popular.

They are apparently known for their desserts; we tried the matcha beignets and they didn't disappoint.

Drinks we tried were good as well. All the food is very pretty-looking."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-02-25,4.0,"Finally had the chance to try this spot. It's usually super packed and apparently they push you out right when you finish your dessert. Luckily for my friend and I it was a little less busy and we were seated right away this day. We decided to share the sesame shaved ice which I thought was really good. I'm not a big sesame guy but they did a great job of finding the right sweetness. The fresh fruit and mochi were also great.

Overall a really tasty dessert place. It's pricey which is expected in nyc and can feel a bit rushed because of how busy it is inside but I guess that's pretty expected from nyc as well."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-02-21,3.0,"My group of 6 ordered three things: the mango bingsoo, boba honey toast, and matcha beignets.

The bingsoo portions were really small. Like REALLY REALLY SMALL. I'm paying $14, you'd think I'd get a small mountain's worth of shaved ice, but in reality, I don't even think we got enough for two people to share. Seriously, I could've demolished what they gave us AND still been hungry for me. In fact, I was! Honestly, I didn't think this was worth it but my group wanted to try it, so we ended up paying for the tiny portion anyways. Everyone had like 3-4 scoops of it and then it was gone. Disappointing.

Their honey toast did not look like what I expected it to be: it came out as a really shriveled looking thing that was hard to cut and not warm at all. We paid $14 for this too, and each person again only had like 4 bites before it was gone. Jeez.

Why do I have this sentiment? It's because I've had better of these two elsewhere and for a much more reasonable price, along w better presentation. So, again for the people in the back, THE PORTIONS HERE ARE NOT WORTH THE PRICE.

Besides those two dishes though, the matcha beignets were actually really good though and they would be the only thing I'd get again, if I ever came back here. Really good texture + flavor, and actually came with enough beignets that paying $9 was a good value. Kind of messy to eat but that's expected of beignets. Literally the only saving grace (haha, pun intended) of this place."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-01-25,4.0,"We shared the matcha shaved ice and paid $18 which is quite steep. The shaved ice was good because I it was creamy rather than icy. I think it also came with pink yams (?) which I could do without.
This isn't really a  place if you want to hang out for a long time and chill like in most other cafes because they don't want you staying for very long."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-01-06,5.0,"Hey hey my fellow Adventurers! 

I adore this place so much and make it a point to visit whenever I'm in the city! I've gone here twice and have found it so wonderful--staff, food, coffee, everything! The first time I came here I ordered the churro waffles with the cortado. Both were phenomenally delicious! I love the ambiance and decor of the entire place! I hope on my next visit to try the shaved ice that everyone raves about!"
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-02-14,4.0,"Came across this place when I was getting ramen in the area, and it was pretty solid dessert! My friend and I got the korean donuts since it was one of the most popular items, and it was definitely very sweet compared to most asian-style desserts -- but it satisfied our sweet tooth. The vanilla ice cream went nicely with the ""donut"". 

It's a sit down place and was super packed when we went on a Saturday night. But despite how many people there were, we didn't wait more than 5 minutes and the service was really fast."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-02-12,3.0,"Crowded and loud, this place is always bustling! We were seated quickly at a table for 2, in what seemed like incredibly uncomfortable seating. I sat against the wall on a small shared bench with the table next  to us. The waiters were quick and efficient in taking our order. 

We ordered the black sesame bingsoo and a lavender latte. We had one waitress who was incredibly genuine and friendly. She answered our questions with enthusiasm, which really stood out among the other workers! 

Black sesame bingsoo: (3/5) good sesame flavor, but arguably not sweet enoUgh. The sweetness comes mainly through the sweetened condense milk drizzled in top so once we finished that, it didn't quite taste like a dessert anymore. Some of the mochi was hard and others were soft. 

Lavender latte: (5/5) This drink was not overpowering at all - it was the perfect drink to unwind. It reminded me of what I'd drink cozying up next to a fireplace before bed time on a snowy day. We had ours made with almond milk and it still had nice latte art."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-02-10,3.0,"- Got the Mango madness, cookie monster, ho-dduk and mochi
- High top tables available for large groups
- Good spot to have some shaved ice if you're in the mood
- The portion size was too much for us to finish. About 5-6 people could share 2 servings"
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-01-27,4.0,"This is a great place for desserts located right in K-Town! I'm a fan of their Ho-Dduk and matcha beignets. The portions are pretty big so I recommend sharing them unless you're a big sweets person!

I've had their shaved ice before but I wasn't really a fan. For $14, the price is also a little steep for my liking. There is plenty of seating with people in and out but it does get pretty crowded!"
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-12-28,5.0,"Over two thousand reviews can't possibly be wrong- this place is fantastic! It's located in Korea Town and is always insanely busy, but if you have a small party they should be able to seat you quickly because it's a bit of a ""fast casual"" type place...but for dessert! 

I had the matcha beignets which were just perfect! If you're concerned it might be too ""matcha-y"", don't be. They are just regular beignets with some matcha powder on top. Warm fluffy goodness. It also comes with a small cup of matcha ice cream. Again, sooo good 

I also had the lavender milk tea. Beautiful presentation and really smooth. What I like most about the desserts and drinks at Grace Street is that they are not too sweet or overpowering. Somehow they get it just right"
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-04-12,5.0,"Spent a weekend in New York with some friends a while back and just happened upon this spot while a few of us were waiting for another friend to finish up her tour of the Empire State Building. We decided to stop into Grace Street for a snack while we waited. SO GLAD WE DID. I ordered myself an oat milk tea with boba, and we all shared a serving of the matcha beignets with a side of sorbet. DELICIOUS. As I recall, not too outrageous pricing considering it was in downtown Manhattan."
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-12-26,5.0,"I came by to meet a friend for coffee and he recommended the place. We stopped by in the afternoon on Sunday. The spot is easy to miss as it's a black trellis with the name outside. It was pretty busy but we were lucky and he found a seat right away. There's a good amount of seats. Even though the line was long it went by very quickly.

He got milk tea and I had the lavender milk drink. It was really good and the lavender flavor wasn't overpowering. They had a lot of other options that looked really good that I'm planning to go back and try."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-01-22,4.0,"I was in ktown with some friends for lunch and someone suggested grace street for dessert. I begrudgingly agreed, as my previous experiences left me unimpressed. 

During the morning/afternoon it's a free for all seating, which then converts to table service in the evening. The place was pretty full for a Sunday afternoon but my party of three managed to find a large table to share with other people. 

I remember their desserts being overly sweet so I stuck with an iced americano. Their drink sizes are super tiny with small being super small and their large being more like a medium/starbucks grande. My friend got their yin yang (half milk tea, half cold brew) which actually was really good. 

We then also got a desserts to share
- hotteok: a classic Korean Street snack of fried dough with cinnamon/sugar goodness as filling. It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which ties up the dessert nicely
- boba toast: It was actually pretty tasty! The toast was buttered and sugared, so with the extra condensed milk sauce = very sweet (but this time I'm prepared with my americano!) There were some caramel popcorn sprinkled around the toast which kinda threw me off, so I just ate around it

Tldr; get the iced yin yang with boba"
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-12-30,4.0,"This poppin dessert spot is always packed but the wait is not as bad as it may seem. On Saturday around 7pm, we were seated within 10-15 min.

I shared the Matcha Beignets ($9) with a couple of my friends and we were all thoroughly impressed. New Orleans who? You can get your beignet fix right here. The powdered sugar got a little messy but that's expected when devouring these. They were perfectly warm and soft, and you will just melt in its deep fried aromatics. The scoop of green tea ice cream tied the dessert plate all together - amazing quality and a great balance.

As for drinks, I went with an Iced Coconut Ube ($5.50) which I should've known was gonna turn out to be flavored milk... lol. It was the only caffeine free option (trying to cut caffeine out of my diet) but I guess I was hoping they'd use a caffeine free tea at least - something that would bring in a tea flavor. But alas it was very light in flavor and again, just tasted like flavored milk. Wouldn't recommend unless that's what you're into. It probably would've been a little better with tapioca balls but I opted out of that. My friend got an Iced Jasmine Matcha Latte ($5.50) which I stole a sip of and tasted pretty legit. If only there were more caffeine free options that tasted better... Otherwise a solid dessert spot in the heart of Ktown."
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,"I'm a major bingsoo (Korean shaved ice) fan, and whenever I visit Korea I have it at least once every few days. When I moved to NYC I was immediately on the lookout for some quality bingsoo. The bingsoo here is definitely solid! But I would say that I actually like Grace Street more for their non-bingsoo desserts.

The desserts here are inventive, beautiful, and BIG. The only downside is this place is super busy! They have a ton of seating, but you'll probably have to wait if you come here on any night. Some desserts I've tried:

The ""O.G."" - The black sesame bingsoo is so tasty. Not too sweet and accompanied by strawberries, red bean, and mochi. The texture of the bingsoo isn't the best I've tried (more creamy and not like the powdery ""snow ice"" you'll find at some dessert cafes). But it gets the job done.

Matcha Ice Cream Waffle - Really yummy! I definitely want to order this again. The hot waffle breading contrasts with the matcha ice cream for a delightful eating experience. 

Milk Tea Boba Toast - Also yummy! Sweet toast topped with ice cream, popcorn, and tapioca. The tapioca and popcorn adds a fun texture to the dessert, and also this thing is HUGE!"
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-12-22,4.0,"Humongous delicious desserts! If you are fan of shaved ice this is the place to go! 
The rest of of the desserts are worth a try but go with appetite  for desserts or if you prefer desserts as your mains!"
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-01-04,5.0,"Came back a second time to try the rose petal milk tea & milk tea boba toast and loved the taste of both!

Rose petal milk tea: there was a hint of floral flavor in each sip I liked it because it was not too overpowering but you could still taste the combination of the two flavors! Also a really pretty latte 

Milk Tea Boba Toast: I really had no expectations for this because I assumed it would be crab overload but the toast absorbed everything well and was not too soft. The boba was a nice soft chewy texture and a favorite!"
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-11-28,5.0,"Amazing dessert place in Koreatown!  We all enjoyed our desserts, but we were so impressed by the service despite the restaurant being completely packed.  We were given a buzzer and told we had a 15 minutes wait.  It buzzed in less than 5!  A server came by soon after we were seated.  He gave us a few recommendations and took our order.  Our drinks and treats came out quickly.  There were servers constantly refilling waters and checking on us.  They were so efficient and friendly.
We ordered a variety of drinks and two desserts to share. 

Matcha latte
Lavender milk tea-light, floral, sweet drink
Iced matcha latte with lychee jelly
Jasmine tea with boba 
The drinks were good and I liked being able to customize the type of milk and adjust the level of sweetness.
Matcha ice cream waffle-green tea ice cream, crispy waffle, condensed milk and Oreo crumbles.  This was delicious and we all devoured it.
The O.G.-black sesame snow, fresh strawberries, red beans, mochi, condensed milk and misugaru.  My fave!!

Great dessert place!"
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-03-14,3.0,"So I was kind of disappointed with my matcha honey latte and ended up throwing it away, it was super chalky tasting. I'll def stop by again to try something else but this I just wasn't a fan of. I also felt a bit rushed to order as well when I was ordering."
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-12-30,5.0,"This is very nice Korean coffee place with great deserts. 
The place has great location next to the herald square  train station and those major shops, so if you are tired and want to try something new and tasty , this is the place you wanna go. 
Inside it is very spacious and have bunch of tables and seats. Even though I came on Monday the place was full of ppl, which is a very good sign. 
The staff is super nice an accommodating. I ordered rose tea latte and ask to reduce sweetness, the tase is magical , well balance delicate and smooth, I became addict to this drink. I also ordered Korean donuts, which  has a very nice cinnamon flavor, goes with vanilla ice cream to cool sweetness down. All that good is complemented by visually beautiful picture. Definitely will come back if I am around the area."
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-12-05,4.0,"Grace street is a great place to hang out with friends or to grab some dessert. During the day, it's first come first serve like any other cafe but in the evenings, it turns into table service and I believe there's a minimum to spend. 

The space is big but it gets extremely packed on the weekends and evenings. I've been here many times since this is usually the go to dessert spot after dinner in ktown and I've tried quite a few of their drinks and desserts but my favorites would have to be their matcha beignets and hodduk (korean donut). Most of the milk teas are pretty good but their tapioca bubbles can be a hit or miss. I personally don't love the shaved snow but lot of people come for that and it's large enough to be shared between a few people."
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-11-25,5.0,"Delicious Asian desserts!! 

Interior - this place was quite spacious!! There's gotta be 20+ tables?

Service - they give you buzzers to wait for your food. And they are pretty friendly and fast with their service.

Taste - great matcha beignet!! They give you A LOT of powder sugar and you can dip the beignet into the matcha ice cream. One downside was that the ice cream didn't taste like green tea at all, wish it was more matcha-ish."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-02-23,5.0,"This place is so cute! It's right in the middle of Korean Town, and it is super legit! The Variety is awesome from every matcha thing you can imagine, milk teas, and Korean fried donuts to name just a few options. Prices are pretty comparable to what you will see around the city- so definitely not cheap but it won't kill you to take a date here either! Most expensive dessert will set you back about $14. There is plenty of seating and the place is so tranquil you will feel for that moment you have been transported out of the city!"
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-10-29,3.0,"I've walked by this place too many times to count, never realizing that a well-renowned shaved ice/drink shop was hiding amongst the hustle of bustle of Ktown. 

Upon entering, you realize that Gracie (I'm going to call her Gracie) isn't your typical dessert/coffee shop. She is BIGGG as in whoa, I think 100 people can fit here BIG. I almost got flashbacks of high school with the large crowds, long tables and hard chairs. Definitely a different, almost refreshing feel from the Tous/Paris Baguettes around the area. 

As for the food, Gracie specializes in waffles and shaved ice. I ordered The O.G., which has a black sesame base with various toppings including strawberries, mochi and red bean. I've been to many shaved iced places and this place l, while was good, did not thoroughly justify the $15.50 pricing. Maybe this is just the cost of Manhattan, but EHHH.. I much rather make the trip to Coffee Factory in queens for a $12 shaved ice, which has even more generous proportions.

Overall, I did enjoy the food here and I'm looking forward to try other options on their menu, such as their Boba Toast and beautiful drinks."
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-11-08,3.0,"The pictures here can be a little deceptive. The shaved ice bowl was nowhere near as big as what I found on yelp, and that's probably because most of them are so up close that you don't really have a good comparison point.

I got the strawberry one and I thought it was mostly just okay. Not too special but not bad either. I did enjoy the texture of the snow but I've had better.

They also have a very anti WiFi policy for some reason."
610,grace-street-new-york,2020-03-05,3.0,It's interesting here. The line is long. Came to try it out. Nothing special. The donut is pretty good. The shaved ice is just shaved ice. The bubble tea toast is tooo sweet. Would not recommend it unless you like eating pure sugar.
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-10-11,5.0,"I needed some refuge from the crowd on a hectic Friday late afternoon - on a three day holiday weekend no less! - and stumbled into Grace Street.

First, I was super impressed to find that there were a ton of seats available, even though it was busy here. I liked that this cafe opted for bigger, longer communal-style tables, allowing for more usuable space for sitting. They did have some of those typical two seat round tables, so you can definitely grab a spot of you're early for a date. Looks like they also make fresh and hot (or cold or both) Korean treats, which is fantastic!

Someone clearly put a lot of thought into this local Ktown spot, from the tasteful decor to the great lighting to the modern take to the food and teas available. They even had a couple of gluten-free and vegan option, which I heard can be a struggle at Asian places. 

A nice little gem for sure - I do think places like this makes for more charming and interesting neighborhood, so full stars and a review from me.

Rumors are that they do table service at night, so I'll have to make a return trip for dessert sometime after a dinner date."

This place was great especially for the served sit-down portion.  For a place this popular, having someone seat us was really useful, especially since we had a relatively ""large"" party of six people.  We got the Mango Shaved ice to share as it was HUGE!

Mango shaved ice
PROS:
- fantastic quantity.  Sure it's shaved ice, but this thing was so big it almost toppled over.  
- super soft, not granular: as much as it is ""ice"", it should be fluffy!
- good amount of topping (syrup/drizzle)
- good amount of fruit as well (some places can be stingy)
- good for the dieter as normal asian desserts aren't typically as sweet
CONS:
- gotta be careful how you attack this otherwise you might lose the top half of your dessert
- not super filling as it's so fluffy.  It's also not as dense as normal ice-cream which is great for the dieter but not so great for those who love a solid dessert

I'd totally come here again.  In fact, this was probably my fourth time here because they have these amazing matcha beignet donuts.  Definitely check them out."
610,grace-street-new-york,2019-09-23,4.0,"I live for cuuuute cafe spots & desserts. 
After having a giant meal for dinner, my friend agreed that there's still room for dessert. We found Grace Street on Yelp and gave it a go. We decided to be basic and ordered the mango bingsu, which was perfect for the two of us to share. The ice is fluffy, the flavor is light, and it definitely satisfied our sweet cravings. 

The decor and atmosphere is great; it was packed and lively when we went, but we could still hear each other talk and had great convos. An alternative location in K-town to go to if you're not feeling drinks or bars. :)"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-01-07,5.0,"I love the cappuccino coffee here. It's just perfect in every way..the cream is thick, the flavors are well balanced. The service is usually friendly and efficient. I often drive out of my way to grab a cappuccino to go when I am in the city. It's that good. 

If you can, have the coffee to stay, there is a standing bar along the windows or you can take your coffee to the lobby of the Ace hotel where there is plenty of seating."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-01-06,3.0,"I got the nitro cold brew and it tasted kinda really watery? I like how strong it is and its foamy taste in the beginning but it quickly disappears into coffee water.

As a disclaimer I don't drink cold brew that often but having had nitro beers or Guiness or whatever, I know this could be a lot better."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-02-14,5.0,"This coffee shop is a hidden gem! Not so underrated on Yelp though! Picked stumptown coffee for one of our Tuesday post-work coffee rituals and after having the coffee here I think this is going to be our usual spot! 
Ps: They also have baked goods like chocolate, matcha filled croissants from supermoon bakehouse. So if you're one of those, who has never got to try them at super moon because they are sold out by the time you can get there, visit Stumptown to try some! And get their amazing coffee too!!!  we tried the rum and raisin latte (which was soooo good! Not very sweet), Non-Fat cappuccino and nitro cold brew. Perfect for this spine chilling weather!  will visit again to try those delicious baked goods!"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-02-10,5.0,"Still the  best coffee in NYC, but now they have metal drinks stirrers in place of the old disposable wood ones!! I love their commitment to sustainability and hope they continue. Currently, they have a great selection of mugs, travel cups, and cold brew jugs. And of course, the baristas are as friendly as ever, making the dopest coffee art :)"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-08-07,3.0,"It's coffee... it's a smooth blend. It's just ok. 
Gold, it is not 
Don't get me wrong, I love this location and the decor - it's convenient to just drop by and have a cup before you're next appointment or grab and go. 

But the coffee tastes the same as any of the following places: Intelligentsia, Blue Bottle, Joe Art of Coffee or Counter Culture. It's coffee for purists. 

Good coffee, yes. Gold? Platinum? No. 

Plus the staff takes themselves a little too seriously here. As one reviewer mentioned, get over yourselves. 

But three stars for an outstanding oat milk latte."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-03-17,5.0,I stayed upstairs from this place at the Ace Hotel for work and would grab an oat milk cappuccino on my way out every morning. They make it perfectly and it is well worth the wait/money. I'll be back every time I'm in NoMad.
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-04-24,5.0,"Came by the other day or breakfast and it was excellent! Located inside the Ace hotel made this a super convenient spot for breakfast!

Ordered a mocha which came out at the perfect temperature! The mocha was a perfect dark chocolate that wasn't too sweet! The latte art was perfect too!

The ham and cheese croissant was also world class! Light and fluffy pastry stuffed with a delicious piece of ham!

Staff was friendly and even offered a stamp card! 

They take credit cards!"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-10-05,5.0,"lovely coffee shop.

I've been stumptown coffee in portland last year, it was so good. NYC stumptown also great. It feels almost same things. 

Coffee was good and staffs also kinds!"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-02-26,5.0,If you are looking for the perfect pour look no further than stump town. Best baristas in town!! They know how to pour a good cup!
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-10-28,3.0,"I got coffee from here on a Sunday at 2PM. No line and friendly service. I got the cold brew with light ice for $4.50 - I am not a fan of the taste. My friend got the espresso for $3.50. The interior is clean. It's a small coffee shop but the good thing however is that it is connected to the Ace Hotel so when I got my coffee I was able to find a spot in the lobby and catch up with a friend. 

Overall, acceptable coffee if you are going to be squatting in the Ace Hotel for a bit."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-01-31,5.0,"This was recommended to us from a lot of friends that have visited or are locals. I can't lie, they make a really really good cappuccino. The kind that tastes so genuine it brings you back to Italy and you want to taste it forever. 

Not to mention the staff is very friendly and will listen to your needs + recommend other things that may be of interest! I highly recommend this location!"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-01-24,4.0,Ordered the orange clove coffee and matcha croissant. The Orange flavor permeated the drink but was really light on the clove. I prefer stronger coffees so it wasn't quite down my alley. The matcha croissant looks pretty unusual given how green the insides were but it was nicely buttery and flaky. Added bonus was the little bit of matcha surprise in the middle.
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-01-02,5.0,"If you want great coffee, this is the place to come to!!  I had a double espresso with a little milk. It came in the little cute cup and taste amazing.  The staff is also very nice and helpful"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-12-30,4.0,"Delicious coffee, could not resist leaving without a bag of beans.  Very cute place although not much place to sit down and enjoy the cup of joe, I guess that's the NY style of pick it up and take it to go."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-05-31,5.0,"Wanted to venture away from my usual coffee go-tos and found this gem on yelp!  Came in and ordered a small vanilla capp with oat milk and it was the best capp I've ever had.  The taste far exceeded my expectations, with smooth flavors balanced against the right amount of milk. I am not usually a fan of oat milk but my options were oat, soy, and almond so I decided to give it a try... it was surprisingly creamy and the perfect complement to the vanilla flavor of the cappuccino.  I also had one of their almond croissants which tasted way better than it looked in the display and very fresh.  

Customer service is ok but it's a busy coffee shop and also during the morning rush so I get it.  I'm happy to have discovered Stumptown as it's a block away form work and look forward to going back!"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-02-04,5.0,"I got the iced cappuccino (basically, it's a short latte) with oat milk, and my goodness, the reviews saying how smooth the coffee is weren't kidding. It wasn't bitter, wasn't sour, the best espresso drink I've ever had. I remembered later that a cafe I love to go to in Boston also serves Stumptown coffee, which now explains why their cold brew is my favorite."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-05-04,5.0,"Well, the place is hecka cool.  It serves excellent coffee and more-than-decent pastries.  (For the record, I ordered a cortado and a plain croissant.)  The lobby of the hotel has long community tables with free ""ACE Lobby"" 10 Mbps WiFi.

I stayed in a crummy hotel around the corner and was happy to come to Stumptown for a good breakfast after fleeing the complimentary ""continental breakfast"" where I was staying.

There can be long lines.  On the second of my two trips for breakfast, I was able to walk directly up to the counter and place my order.  When I walked to the lobby with my croissant in hand, I was astonished to find that about 30 people had showed up a few moments after I had.  If you need to ""grab"" a coffee before a meeting, you should definitely head elsewhere."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-11-02,5.0,"Stumptown Coffee Roasters is hands down the best coffee in NYC. I've traveled to so many cities all over the world and Stumptown always remains at the top for me. Their coffee is very smooth and high quality. Another thing I like about this coffee shop is that they are consistent with their drinks. My favorite drink at Stumptown is their ""Iced Vanilla Latte"". It is the perfect blend of sweet and creamy! Stumptown gets busy at peak times but the line moves quick. The shop is also very clean and located adjacent to the Ace Hotel where there is ample seating inside."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,"Found recommendations for this on yelp and was pleased. My husband and I enjoyed the mocha. It was a great latte. Since the shop is in a hotel, you can enjoy your coffee in their lobby. There are comfortable couches, tables and a place to charge you phone. Great place to grab a coffee and recharge while in the city."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-11-04,5.0,"Had an espresso macchiato and it was perfect! So smooth and done perfectly! 
Great place to stop by for great coffee! They do get very busy though and the space is small.. so be patient.. it's worth it!"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-03-15,5.0,"Updating my review to 5 stars because their coffee is THE BEST I've had so far. I've gone to several other coffee shops, but they just don't compare to Stumptown! Their almond cappuccino is always on point. So smooth!"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-03-06,5.0,"I failed to do my research on Stumptown, which resulted in a coffee high for 2 days lol. Got a large cold brew, the coffee is delicious, but educate yourself on the caffeine level. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable, didn't feel rushed when I wasn't sure of what to order."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-07-30,2.0,"High ratings must be from tourists from the hotel who are predisposed to be happy on vacation and don't know that this is a chain shop that's like any other but slower. 

This shop needs new management. Been here a few times. Each time, they've been over-staffed (6 people behind counter today). Yet, service has been extremely slow (10 min wait without a line), apathetic to passive aggressive rude but you can't prove it service, and erroneous order every 3 times. 

I know it's hard to hire and manage front line but the other Stumptown locations do it. The 1st Ave one makes me feel welcomed. The Amazon books one strives to be friendly and efficient despite a rather busy store. All locations have 1-3 people behind counter. Why can't this location perform better with more people?"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-07-29,4.0,"Small shop with no sit down area, only a small bartop strip/standing desk that makes it tough to concentrate with the opening doors, long lines, and brewing winds. If you're in luck you could catch a seat in the connecting Ace Hotel lobby. But most of the people working there are posting up all day. Also, make sure to not seat in the hotel lobby bar area b/c they will ask you to get up or order something off the menu.  

Always a line that moves fairly quickly so have your order ready to go. 
Coffee itself tasted exemplary, but at a rather steep price. I got the latte and it was bold with flavor and creaminess.

TLDR; Great place for a grab-n-go tasty coffee to kickstart your day, but probably not the most pleasant workspace to post up."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-12-03,5.0,"Stumptown coffee rosters has multiple locations (in my home town of New Orleans as well) so I was happily pleased to see they were right at my hotel where I stayed during my family New York thanksgiving vacation .. had coffee there twice a day for probably the 3days we were there  
Staff was very friendly and the coffee was really good .. they even carried our locally kambucha from the big easy, that brought a smile to my face and a closeness to home so far away from home!"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-06-26,5.0,"Easily the best coffee in NYC, with a gorgeous location at the front of the Ace Hotel. Their menu is concise yet interesting, offering seasonal blends and unique varieties of beans. The shop itself is small, but there is plenty of comfy seating and table space in the Ace lobby. The baristas here are highly trained and skilled in their craft, so you are guaranteed to get a perfect drink every time. NYC coffee professionals have a tendency to be rude, but the employees here were refreshingly kind, and genuinely friendly.

The pastry case was abundant even at 3pm, and had one vegan option-a Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie. The delicious cookie was moist and soft, with salty caramelized brown sugar flavor and extra dark chocolate chips. The treat paired perfectly with my wonderfully acidic Small Batch Cold Brew, which tasted delicious with a touch of soy milk. I had the luxury of coming here out of convenience while staying at the Ace, but would definitely go out of my way to return."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-08-26,4.0,Coffee was pretty good - I had a small hot vanilla latte. Pretty pricey and loud. They have a nice selection of pastries that I would like to try next time I visit. There is no seating in the cafe but I believe you can sit in the lobby of the hotel which is connected. People also sit on the bench outside of the cafe.
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-03-02,4.0,Coffee and chocolate croissant were fine. Service excellent. Hard to find a place to sit.
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-10-14,5.0,"This is one of the better coffee shops in NYC. Normally I order a soy latte, but they only do regular milk, almond, or oat. The oat milk latte is out of this world good! It's consistently a great cup of coffee each time. It's a bit of a small shop, so not really a good study spot, but if you are on the go, I'd go here to get your coffee. Reasonable price, but great coffee. Highly recommend going here for your Cup of Joe."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-11-27,1.0,"I know coffee is great there, but HOURS are off. I walked 15 blocks at 6:40 am, and the store os closed at those hours..."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-05-09,4.0,"Definitely prefer this Stumptown location over the 8th Street one. The service is friendlier and better. It's sunnier. As it's standing room only, there is no seating in the cafe section, which is inconvenient, but you could go sit in the hotel, where there is plenty of sofa and outlet availability, though it's always super crowded. The coffee is fantastic, never bitter, though pricey, because of the brand name. Stumptown is one of my favorite cafes in Flatiron with pretty quality coffee. Just prepare for a long line and don't come here in pursuit of that relaxing cafe ambiance."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-06-29,4.0,Solid coffee shop and well deserving of its ratings. Heard so much about this from friends and had to try it when I was in NYC. Ordered their 8oz latte which was pretty tiny for $4 but the quality was superb -- the coffee was very rich and went well with the creamy milk.
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-05-18,4.0,"I have been told this is THE place to go to get work done around the city. I have to respectfully shrug my shoulders as I didn't find the space super conducive to getting work done. Yes, the coffee is great - that cold brew was on point - so smooth no milk or sugar needed to be added. Yes, the service in the ACE hotel lobby was also on point, but my issue was the lighting - you can have a chill space without it being practically dark. Also, the music was way too loud for early morning on week day/early afternoon. I had headphones in listening to a podcast and I could still hear the loud, eclectic music. 

If you're in the area - sure stop and get yourself a cup of joe. If you're looking for somewhere to hunker down and get sh*t done, go find somewhere else because the ambiance here doesn't do it."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-11-09,5.0,"I'm no coffee connoisseur nor a hipster but I do enjoy a good cup of coffee from time to time.  On this most recent visit I popped in to purchase a bag of beans, which came with a small cup of coffee.   In the past, I've picked up bags of their House blend, Holler Mountain and Hair Blend coffee and have tried their coffee black or in a cappuccino.  

On the occasions I've been to this location, the line has never been that long with the wait around 5 minutes or less.  The staff was friendly but know how to keep the line moving.  

Patrons can either stand at the back counter or move into the Ace Hotel lobby to linger.   The space is pretty small and can get cramped but most people just order, head to the condiment table and then head out the door.  

I don't enjoy paying this much for coffee but I will pay for quality and Stumptown makes a great coffee."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-05-28,4.0,"Since I can't get this in California, I came to do some work here and was not disappointed by their Nitro Cold Brew. They have adequate workspace and outlets for working professionals trying to seek some asylum from the office. Wifi disconnect sometimes which was the only flaw, but the internet was very fast."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-12-24,5.0,"I had stumptown coffee in many places. I always loved the coffee. I was surprised to see that they have a coffee store. I went for mocha latte. It was delicious. Through all those creaminess and sweetness, I could still feel the flavor of the coffee beans. They have very limited amount of food items. All of them are from near by stores. They don't make anything to eat, but just focus on what they do best (coffee)."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2018-01-26,3.0,"This is not a place to hangout with friends!
I didn't realize this cafe has no tables until my friend and I met there. Yes there is a seating area in the hotel lobby but it was super awkward wandering around to find seats while holding an overflowed cup of coffee (plus half of the seats are reserved for hotel guests only). 
I had mocha which was tasty and strong, almost like a hot chocolate. Brownie was okay. Overall a good place to grab a coffee to go."
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-01-13,1.0,The rudest stuff or she is mute just to me. You have great coffee but female stuff is awful. She working on Monday at 3pm
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2020-01-07,5.0,"hands down best coffee shop in nyc,was greeted by the workers there when I entered very friendly environment and great service.If you were to visit this place I recommend buying the cappuccino to go,best to go drink for the mornings"
611,stumptown-coffee-roasters-new-york,2019-12-27,4.0,"Delicious coffee with some unique seasonal flavors - we tried rum raisin cappuccino which was subtle and tasty, not too sweet. They have some store space to enjoy coffee in house but also allow you to take it to The Lobby next door for more seating. Baristas were friendly in giving input for seasonal drinks."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2020-02-01,5.0,"Cozy, warm, inviting, yummy.  What more can you ask for in a bakery. And so much more than I expected we when I stopped in on a chilly morning. Had coffee and a mini almond croissant which was heavenly--a bit of creaminess and a bit of chewiness and a lot of deliciousness. 

Service was friendly...I asked to just have a few minutes to look around and felt no pressure to hurry   

They had a number of different treats at different price points as low as $1.30 so lots of options.  Free WiFi too!"
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2020-02-19,2.0,"I originally wanted to go to Laduree for some macarons but saw that it was a bit far, so I found La Maison du Macaron on Yelp and found that it was much more convenient along my route so decided to stop here instead. Approximately 4 stars with 850 reviews on Yelp, can't be too bad right? 

This shop is quite tiny, I didn't have time to check out the seating area but it didn't look like a place that you could sit down for some time and catch up with friends. I walked in on a Tuesday night and it wasn't that busy, the workers behind the counter looked unhappy and uninterested. The worker behind the counter was not very helpful in letting me know the price for their macarons and she didn't even know how many unique flavours the place sold! I decided to go with the 12 piece box and asked that she just give me an assortment of all the most popular flavours. To give you an idea, they did have flavours like: tahitian vanilla,  almond, pistachio, rose lychee champagne, passionfruit, mango, etc. The flavours remind me a lot of what they sell at Pierre Hermes. She was going to put two passionfruits in my box although I wanted all different flavours, the macarons also did not come ""perfect"" (the shell was cracked or sometimes dented in). Every question I made about a flavour was followed with a sigh before the answer. 

**NOTE: If you choose your own 12 flavour box, it comes out to $41. They have premade boxes of 12 macarons for $38, if you want to purchase the premade one - they cannot tell you what flavours were placed inside.

Separately, I am also not a fan of the box. It does not perfectly fit 12 macarons and there is no protection if it were to break. They last for 4 days if you refrigerate them. They did taste okay and on par with other high end macaron parlors that I've had but this service was such a turn off that I don't think the taste could make up for it."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2020-01-05,4.0,"Delicious, light, chocolate croissant! The chocolate melts in your mouth, subtle yet intense.  
The perfect amount of chocolate surrounded by a light and airy delicious croissant. The lady behind the  counter was delightful, it brought
me back to my time in Paris."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2020-05-15,5.0,"This place is amazing!! I've LOVED everything I've tried!! The owner is sooo sweet patient. Yes it's a bit on the pricier side but everything was completely worth it. I tried the pistachio, almond, mango salted caramel and a couple other flavors I can't quite remember but they were all wonderful. The almond crossaint is definitely a favorite. I wish I took a picture of the stuff but they're all long gone now- I'll definitely treat myself again!!"
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2020-03-07,5.0,"Come for the macaron and the chocolate almond croissant. They have a large variety of macaron. Also they have different types of pastries and quiche. I honestly think they are way better than a lot of the larger franchise. Everything smells and taste delicious here. Coffee is good too here. Large sitting space, very casual and comfy."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,"Lovely cute French style café. The macaroons are delicious. I personally like the chocolate, caramel and raspberry. The dulce de ledge Coffee is also very sweet and delicious. Great spot for meeting friends, catching up on work, date night."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-05-21,4.0,"Stopped by here on a whim Saturday afternoon for a quick bite. Standard setup of pastries behind glass as well as couches to the back for comfortable seating.

Between two people: split a Brioche ($3.60), a couple of Macarons ($3 each), and a couple of small Lattes ($4ish each). Brioche is made well, only a hint of butter and sweetness which went well the coffee. The banana nutella macaron was interesting - a little too much banana flavor, which was unexpected. The other macaron was a basic chocolate offering that had a better balance.

Service is quick despite only one person behind the counter. Seating, although pleasant to look at, isn't optimized for eating food or to handle larger groups of people. Fine enough establishment to stop by for a macaron fix."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2020-02-26,4.0,I came here to get some macaroons on the way to book club. It is a very cozy place with couches and many people enjoying pastries in the back. The macaroons were very good. The line was only a few people but it took about 15 min for me to get the macaroons and pay. That just seems like too long to wait for pre-made pastries. It is a great spot to meet and catch up with someone.
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,A great place to come for macarons plus coffee and tea. There's limited seating but it wasn't terribly busy for us on a Saturday evening. $3 for a macaron and it's worth it to stop in to have a few.
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-06-17,4.0,"Stopped by for coffee and a snack at this cute (and bougie) bakery. The atmosphere is great, super calm and quiet. It would be a good spot for studying. The treats were good; we had a chocolate dacquoise and a Parisian brownie. The chocolate dacquoise was mediocre; it looked beautiful, but just tasted like any other chocolate fudge dessert. I was more impressed by the Parisian brownie, which was like a custard with brownie pieces inside. Both were almost $8 for a tiny portion, but it did look like everything was baked in-house in the back."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,Most amazing croissants and macaroons imported. If you're looking for a chill place to have coffee with friends this is it. Absolutely loved it
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-08-17,4.0,"A bit overpriced for the small deserts but tasty overall. The lemon tart was really good! We had a pistachio and dark chocolate macaroon, both were good. Tasty and glad we stumbled upon it, but probably won't be back. The place quaint though."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-02-24,3.0,"We got opera ( coffee cake) matcha latte, and latte. 
 
Latte was standard. 
Matcha was too sweet. Can't taste the green tea. 
Cakes were okay. Too sweet too. 

We were caught in the rain and spent some good here to wait for the rain to stop. Regardless of the lower quality of the drink and cake we got, it's a cozy place to hang out."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2018-02-13,4.0,"You typical NYC macaron bakery. 

Atmosphere: cozy with old comfy armchairs 

Macarons: $3 each 
Banana nutella: hazelnut-y, not overpoweringly chocolately 

Apricot champagne: tart fruity flavor with a hint of champagne and a brush of glitter

Graham cracker key lime pie: very strong tart citrus flavor

Mixed berry lychee liquor: great balance of berry flavor. The liquor came through and was a pleasant surprise. The real star of the show was the aftertaste of lychee

Alexandria (rose, lemonade): yuck, did not go together at all

Tahitian vanilla: fairly generic vanilla flavor"
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-12-21,5.0,I cannot express how much I enjoyed these macarons.  They were light and delicious and the absolute best I have ever had.  So good we went back and got more today.  So good!!!
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2018-04-03,4.0,"I'm a fan of their macarons.  Never tried anything else here.  Maybe, a coffee once, but don't remember the taste.  Macarons are very good.  I like several ones - Cassis being my favorite.  Other favorites are Lemon, Raspberry, Caramel.  This time tried a new flavor - Banana Nutella.

The flavors were all spot on.  Every macaron I've tried has been pretty good."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2018-01-14,3.0,"I haven't tried any of the macarons here but the plain croissant is probably the best option in the area. The dessert I tried from the pastry case was ok but not super impressive, and I really didn't like the almond croissant, though it might have just been personal taste.

Plain croissant ($3) - one of my favorite croissants in NYC, after Patisserie Florentine and Mille-Feuille Bakery. Very light and airy with a crispy, flaky layered exterior.

Almond croissant ($4) - it reminds me of Patisserie Florentine's version (very flat and soft, almond filling is mushy and not too sweet) except there's this layer of hardened caramelized sugar/syrup at the bottom. Personally I found this way way too sweet and couldn't finish eating this; I think it would be way better without this bottom layer.

La Sicilia ($7.25) - nice lightish top layer (milk chocolate lemon) and really great middle layer (fig!) but the ""pistachio macaron"" bottom layer was too sweet and mealy, and tasted of neither pistachio or macaron. I ate the top two layers but the bottom was too overwhelming; I wouldn't recommend this."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-05-28,3.0,"I went there to meet a friend for coffee and a chat while we were visiting New York. My husband got a latte and I got a mocha. They were pretty good. He had a croissant, which he liked. I wish I could have ordered something and I could have. I just didn't want to eat a macaron that early in the morning. Too much sugar and nothing to fill me up. But the coffee was good though."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2018-08-27,4.0,"Is there any reason why when typing ""la maison du"", this place literally comes up last in any search? I seriously had to triple check to make sure I was going to the right place.

The macarons are comparable to other places like Laduree. The place is really cozy and chill, with a nice relaxing vibe that makes it good for catching with someone over tea/coffee. Never got too crowded or loud. A nice way to spend an afternoon."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2020-03-08,5.0,Very pleasant and welcoming warm atmosphere. Nice selection and variety of macarons and a very good hot chocolate. Pleasant way to spend 1 hour
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-04-04,2.0,"The misfortune of my looming curious and wandering eyes brought me indoors. Sometimes ignorance is bliss :( It's $3 per macaron here. I couldn't help but wonder if I should have just walked out or not. But the girl behind the register has her eyes glued to me as she were going to do something if I didn't buy anything. Or maybe it's all in my head. Idk. She seemed eager as hell to get me to buy more though, when I settled for two. I chose the passion fruit and the Russian macaron.

There is no ""artistry"" behind crafting a French macaron. It is not a ""delicacy,"" and I wish people stopped treating it as such. With a pack of decent almond meal, sugar, and eggs, you can make a batch of 50 for under $10. What does that tell you? That I'm a super stingy POS ranting about how I should've gone for 4 chicken tender pieces and a soda instead at McDonalds? You are exactly right!"
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-05-03,5.0,"Not your traditional almond croissant. I mean that in the best way. On the flat side with an underlying crust of caramalized sugar, yummy!! Served on a silver tray with a robust cappuccino. One of the few bakeries with comfortable place to sit, enjoy your food and read a book."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-11-03,5.0,"Delectable macaron's in a comfy atmosphere. Try the pink champagne, lemon and coconut ones. The staff is incredibly nice and welcoming."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-03-26,4.0,"The place looks a bit hole in the wall, but the macarons were extremely tasty. I had walked by multiple bakeries selling macarons during my day in the city and none of the selections seemed very expansive, original, or impressive. One bakery I wanted to try only sold jumbo sized ones, which was weird. Anyway, I'm glad I waited for here. The macarons were as good as any I've had in Paris. The flavours may not have been as bizarre as some I've seen- mostly basic flavours but really well done. Espresso was tasty as well. $3 a macaron, sounds pricey but isn't actually that steep. Would have been nice to get a discount for buying a bunch/a box, but whatever."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2018-08-04,5.0,"BEST MACARONS EVER!!! 

I've tried Laduree from multiple locations- NYC and Paris, Pierre Herme from Paris, and lots of other spots in NYC and Paris and nothing compares to La Maison du Macaron! 

What I love about La Maison in particular is their selection of flavors. They have so many options that you won't find anywhere else and they do them all so well. I've never been a fan of vanilla, chocolate or pistachio flavors but they taste amazing here. My personal favorites are the rose, champagne flavors- usually in all the light pink colors!!! 

As others have mentioned, I'll admit the customer service is lacking here. The employees do come off a little snobby but I'll still continue to make the trip for their amazing macarons."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-10-24,5.0,"Absolute heaven in a box. I got an 8-piece variety box.  The flavors are amazing.  Delicate but full of TRUE flavor.  I've gotten macarons that claimed to be a specific flavor...but tasted the same as every other flavor offered.  I could taste the strawberry...the key lime (even the graham cracker)...the coffee...all were perfection.  I have 2 days left in NYC...and this place is 50 feet from my hotel...thank God I'm walking everywhere, because I will eat my weight in these before I leave."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-06-07,1.0,"This place was recommended to me by my co-workers. What a disappointment! Tomorrow morning during the office event I will make sure to NOT RECOMMEND this place to 30+ colleagues. 
Thursday evening after a long day in the office, I was rushing to La Maison du Macaron to get some quality macaroons for an office event; all the way from Midtown despite many outstanding pastry shops in the area. Walked in at 7:43 pm and my presence wasn't acknowledged by neither of the two cashiers that were extremely busy doing everything else but what they are supposed to: serve their customers. One of them was mopping the floor, the other - was simultaneously  checking the phone and wiping the counter top. They were extremely annoyed    and angered by the late coming customer that asked them for an order that required some extra work : 3 pyramid boxes of assorted macaroons. Sophie stayed very clearly that I came in late and she is unwilling to look for boxes ( because they were somewhere in the basement) and suggested I came back in the morning. After a little back and forth, I decided to take my business somewhere else and spend $300+ in a place that respects, cherishes and goes an extra mile for their customers.
In such a competitive market, just having a good product doesn't take you far, the outstanding service is definitely a key to success. It's sad that small businesses turn down valued customers so easily and without any regret."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2017-07-15,3.0,"Honestly I was disappointed in my experience with La Madison du Macaron. I was looking for an alternative to the well known Laduree, but honestly if you're in the city just go to Laduree. I appreciated the presentation of La Madison du Macaron; my Oder was presented on this adorable tin plate but the macarons here are tiny for $3, though they do come in a good variety of flavors.

For the price point and size, I won't be coming back. Flavors are quite good though!"
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2017-03-19,3.0,"(Review based on 3.5 stars)

Wow this place is pricey. 

I came by La Maison du Macaron yesterday with my husband a little before 8 pm after having dinner to celebrate my birthday. When we came in, one employee was sweeping up in the seating area that was currently closed. Another employee had her back towards us as she was washing something in the sink. She did realize at one point that we were there and told us to let her know when we are ready. After browsing the display case for the macrons, I ended up getting:

Irish Coffee- I picked with for my husband because he likes coffee (and I don't). I had a bite just to try it and thought it was okay. 

Lavender Vanilla- This was a great flavor. The lavender and vanilla really complement each other. 

Apricot Almond- This was a nice flavor. I thought the apricot really came through. 

Almond- Good but I have had better.

Blueberry- This was a nice flavor. The blueberry wasn't overly powering and had a good amount of sweetness.

Strawberry- Pretty lackluster. Didn't really have a strawberry taste. 
-------------------------
(Total= $17 for box of 6)

It is actually a little cheaper if you purchase these separately, but I didn't know that was an option until after I read the other Yelp reviews (which after I had purchased these little treats). I think it is kind of lame that I had to pay a little extra for a box that I just tossed after finishing up these cookies.  

Service was friendly for the most part. 

The unisex restroom was clean upon this visit.

Overall, I thought this place was good, but not the best macarons that I have ever had. The price per macaron is expensive and I don't understand why do you have to pay extra for the box that will get trashed? I don't see myself coming back here. 

By the way, for the restroom code it is 9065 and WiFi password is macarons23rd (also conveniently provided on your receipt if you purchase something from here."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-01-03,1.0,"Let start by saying that I love this place for so many reason, atmosphere, taste, smell and look! An oasis in the middle of Chelsea! BUT, the service is always so unfriendly, not sure if the owner is following the snooty French model but this is NY and I don't want to pay for Bitchy!  With the shortage of lovey places to work, one would think that the servers would smile a bit more when working in this lovely place! 



Hooray ! New staff, great service and once again I am in Paris without the attitude!"
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2018-01-23,4.0,"This is a great place to stop for some coffee and some small sweets or baked goods. We were disappointed they were out of their almond croissants! Not to worry this place has other delectable snacks.

We ordered 2 harvest lattes which were very big. If you enjoy sweet coffee drinks you will need to add sugar. But if you're pallet is good the way it comes is perfectly fine.

With our lattes we ordered a chocolate croissant, pistachio macaron, rose macaron and a slice of kings cake. The chocolate croissant was too sweet for my taste. The macaroons were petite and perfect. Both the pistachio and rose had a flavor. 

Our favorite item was the kings cake slice. It was an almond flavored cake made of puff pastry. We assumed it would be extremely sweet and it wasn't! It was the perfect balance of flaky, savory and moist. We highly recommend the kings cake if your looking for something yummy and different!"
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-09-09,1.0,"I used to come to this WAY too much after school and in the few years since I've left school I've been back a couple times every year. They've declining slowly. First they played with the size then flavor intensity and now it just sucks. The cookie is thin and wafery, falling all over your clothes from one bite. Really disappointed."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-02-28,1.0,"dirty, unprofessional customer service, dont always wear gloves and if they do they use the same gloves to cash in the money
like many people i get fooled by the grade and then when i checked the violations, i was shocked 
they have mice on premises!!!"
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2018-02-19,5.0,"Macarons definitely lived up to the hype. So many flavors, service was great and the price made sense for the quality. Definitely stop by to try it out. 

I heard the croissants were good but I didn't try it. I'll be back though!"
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2018-03-19,1.0,"Never go again. If i can give 0 start i want to give 0.
A cashier was really really rude.
They need better customer service.
My friend and I love macarons so we ordered 5 macarons, one apricot pastry and clementine.
The apricot one was good but all of the macarons' texture were not good."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2018-02-17,1.0,"This place is cool for a social media photo but their flavors are very bad. I usually like lavender and rose but theirs tastes like bathroom spray, it's bizarre. My friend and I made sure we weren't crazy. The only flavors that are decent are their vanilla, coffee,and pistachio type of flavors and even those were way too sweet, so sweet it actually stings! I'm not even exaggerating, I'm just sad because I really love macaroons. I came to cure my craving but I was let down so bad."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2016-11-21,4.0,"Food: great macaroons! Not as over rated as Laduree, with little to no tourists when I went. They have very unique flavors and the presentation is very nice with some of the macaroons being dusted with gold powder.  I prefer my macaroons with a little more crunch but these are good.
We ordered a box of 6. If you didn't read my tip, but it's cheaper if you buy them individually without the box. The box is nothing special, the Laduree boxes are much nicer. 

The little shop is really cute with a nice sitting area in the back. 

Brew: they have coffee and other special drinks to wash down your sweets."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2017-03-25,4.0,"If you're looking for Macarons this is the place. Its pricey, but macarons are always expensive and this is NYC. The flavors are bunchy. This place is right next to my gym, so I often just sit on the comfy sofas in the back and drink coffee or tea. The other pastries are very tasty too. I especially like the almond croissant for a ""practical"" treat, but they have fancy desserts for like $4-5 a piece. They serve your food/drink on a silver platter. 

A few cons: they removed all the outlets a few years ago. I use my ""sitting time"" coffee time in a place where i can charge my iPhone. The staff is not friendly. I mean, I don't need them to be that friendly, but don't give me stinky eye when you pass to go to the kitchen. I'm a customer, for goodness sake."
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2019-06-11,5.0,Excellent pastries!! Best croissants I've ever had in the City!! My favorite place to work while enjoying a good cup of espresso
612,la-maison-du-macaron-new-york,2018-11-02,4.0,"This shop is so cute! There are so many different flavors of macarons. I purchased a box of six for 18$. A bit on the pricey side for their size though but in terms of taste, they were really sweet to me, but not bad. The lady who helped me box up the macarons recommended to take the macarons out of the fridge at least 15 minutes before having, but I preferred having it on the hard side, which means straight out of the fridge without sitting. Being that I only tried 6 I will go back to try more macarons as well as their caffeinated drinks."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-03-12,5.0,"Get the avocado toast! I know as a millennial people joke about how much we love avocado toast. But this toast was so good! I let my sisters try it and they thought it was the best restaurant avocado toast they ever had. The way they mixed the avocado with spices and lime, the pairing of beet hummus. . .all so good! I also really enjoyed my hot chocolate, they made all the drinks look so pretty! My sister also really enjoyed her breakfast sandwich and, after adding sweetener, her velvet latte. My other sister got the match latte, it was my favorite after the hot chocolate. It has a very strong match flavor, since they use ceremonial strength matcha. 

This is a wonderful place to come for brunch. There are also plants everywhere which really brightens the cafe. 

Get the avocado toast though!"
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-03-03,4.0,"A beautiful Australian brunch. The interior is very green. They have green paintings and even the bathroom has green leaves. It also has many plants and succulents. The food tasted great and had an artistic assembly. I liked the beet sauce that lined the plate. It was very sweet and healthy. They were out of the açaí bowl, which made me a little disappointed but that was soon forgotten after getting this substitute. 

My boyfriend got the salmon, and it was really good. He said it blended well with the toast and egg. There was a little to much vinegar in the side salad though. The taste of the vinegar was overwhelming and we recommend you ask for less on yours if you get it."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-02-29,5.0,"I really thought it would be overhyped, but it was actually so good! The yelp waitlist feature is super helpful as well; on a Sunday morning around 11am my friend and I only had to wait around 10 min. The tables are all pretty small though, so I definitely wouldn't recommend coming with a larger group. 

We tried the baked eggs (similar to shakshuka) and the very popular avocado toast (+ egg on top), and both were really good! Usually I feel like avocado toast is kind of boring or bland but this one was actually really flavorful: I think it may have been one of the best avocado toasts I've eaten. 

Excited to check out the other locations!"

613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-02-05,5.0,"Super spacious and a great spot for brunch. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and quickly snagged a table on Yelp wait list. 

We started off with a golden latte which is steamed almond milk with turmeric, ginger, and everything that is good for you. It warmed our stomached up and it was frothy and light. 

Next we had the salmon eggs with avocado which is lox and pickled onions served on top of a slice of scrumptious soft bread. The half of the avocado had a drizzle of lemon juice vinaigrette which made the avocado super tasty. 

Lastly we had the waffle and WOW, we didn't feel like we were eating a waffle because it tasted so good, but it was pretty healthy! It was topped with granola, nut butter, bananas, and more.  

Love the vibes here and having a brunch spot that serves delicious food and doesn't have too long of a wait is sold in my books."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-11-27,3.0,"After perusing the menu, my brother and I decided not to have any of the quintessential Millennial meal items offered (i.e. avocado toast, acai bowl). 

The service was friendly and accommodating, esp when we decided to abandon our table for the coffee bar. At $13 for an acai bowl, I don't think I was ready to shell out that much on what is essentially a smoothie. Yes, it's vegan, gluten free, sprinkled with all the good stuff. But I've had my fair share of acai bowls and I can't say I was ever super impressed. I'll get my antioxidants elsewhere, thankyouverymuch. 

That being said, the broski and I had some tea. He ordered a black tea (earl grey) and I had the chai. My brother enjoyed his black tea, but let's face it how can you eff up black tea? My chai was decent but I have to say that it wasn't the best. It was definitely on the sweeter side rather than the spicy side (and this is the rare occasion I prefer spicy over sweet). These days you gotta be picky with drinks because they're not cheap. At $4.75, I was surprised with the steep price point. But ofc I had to keep in mind this is New York. Everything is overpriced. 

Now, would I ever come back for brunch? Probably not."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-03-05,4.0,Food is very clean. Salad and egg Benedict is really good. Their latte perfect. Nice cute girls date
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-03-19,5.0,This has to be one of the best brunch spot ever! I came last week and it was such a cute spot to have brunch. I don't know why I've never been!! They have tons of vegan/vg/gf options too. I got the brekkie sandwich and it was delicious! My friend got the waffles and it was super sweet and good. I am definitely coming back. The lighting was great since there's tons of windows. The servers were super friendly and helpful as well! Decent pricing for chelsea :)
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-03-11,5.0,"I have been here a few times for brunch and have always found the food to be great. This is an Australian brunch place. There is always a line even earlier for brunch. They have an assorted menu and you can go healthy or indulgent. There are many windows, plants and very bright. You can put your name in online to be in line for a seat. The tables seem to turn quickly."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-02-23,4.0,"Light and fresh ambience with tasty bites. I really appreciate that the restaurant identifies what is vegan, dairy free, and gluten free. The portions are enough to satisfy you but not make you feel full. I wish they would have more options for people who are dairy free but not also vegan. That gets a little tricky. Also, it would be nice if they relied a bit less on kale, which is super hard to digest. It's odd how so many health food places don't really consider FODMAPs. Anyway, all that said, you won't have a bad meal here! Go early and you'll beat the crowds."

We went on a Saturday and the wait was an hour. However when we added our name and number to the waitlist, yelp automatically tracked where we were in line. I really enjoyed that feature. Inside the restaurant it was packed. There's not much room to wait inside so I would definitely take advantage of adding your name onto the waitlist from home. You do share tables here, so be aware. We were sat at the bar. It had little coat hangers under the bar top. I just love these little details--things you didn't know you need but appreciate the thought put into it. The inside is decorated with open light and greenery wherever you look. I loved the ambiance. The customer service was so friendly and welcoming and it definitely made up for the wait. Our server was patient and kind and attentive as she took down all of my modifications. I ordered a late with oat milk and honey--amazing! For my meal I had the brekkie sandwich which is a fried egg, cheese, arugula, and lemon aioli on a bun. I modified it by getting my egg poached and adding avocado and a side of potatoes. It was so filling! There was a guy working the bar/drinks and he went out of his way to make our visit special. This was such a great experience. The food was good but the service is what set it a part."

The avocado toast was so-so; the toast was chewy and hard to bite into. The wellness bowl was a delight; I liked the beet hummus.
Would I come back? No."

We had the option to sit inside at a shared table or by the window. We opted for the window but to our dismay, the sun was strong and bright. I did not have my obnoxious sunglasses with me that day so the rays were shining in my eyes. 

I had a light breakfast before coming so I opted for the banana bread with Arnold Palmer, while my friend went for a lunch entree, bowl of fruit, and a cappuccino. My banana bread to my surprise was delightful with its yogurt pairing and nuts. 

All in all the staff were helpful and food came at a good pace. The bathroom on the otherhand took a little longer with it's one stall."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-10-25,4.0,"Portions are smaller than I thought, but enough to satisfy you for a meal. Though would say that given its price the size could be a bit bigger. 

The pulled pork Benny had a lot of flavor, paired with roasted garlic potatoes which added that much more zing to the Benedict! 

The eggs were good but a little lighter in flavor in comparison with the Benny. Though a healthier option as it has beans and a poached egg!"
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-10-05,4.0,"Pro tip: use the Wait List app on Yelp before coming here on the weekend during the busy peak brunch hours like noon and onward. 

Food: Got the Belgian waffle and cappuccino. The waffle actually was a big portion given how sweet the waffle was. I ended up really liking the toppings too. I don't think I'd get the waffle again, but I definitely would come back to try the avocado toast or another savory item on the menu.

Be prepared to sit at a communal table, and if you're with one other person they sit you next to the person. However, it didn't feel too cramped of a space or as if I were able to hear every conversation next to me. Overall, great brunch spot!!"

613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-10-21,5.0,"Such a cute and yummy breakfast place! It is a bit on the pricier side but it was well worth it for me. I got the Belgian waffle with berries and I believe there was Nutella powder that was absolutely amazing! Everything that was topped on it made the dish so delicious and filling. I would definitely come back again just for that same dish. 

The inside is very modern and cute. Ample seating and wait time wasn't greater than 15 minutes for me. Very busy place though! Staff were kind. Would recommend"
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-07-21,5.0,"I seriously love this place! Not only is the vibe trendy and with instagram worthy decor, but the food is awesome. Everything is so fresh and they have tons of healthy options.

I had an iced latte and the smoked salmon toast. On the toast, I subbed a fried egg for a poached egg. I also added avocado. I loved it! The flavors were so great and it was an elevated version of smoked salmon toast for sure! The avocado had some sort of lemon juice on it which was amazing! It really made the flavor bright and added a nice citrus note. The service was great and I will definitely be back. It is a great spot for breakfast or lunch. 

I was here on a weekday and did not have to wait for a table, but it is not a huge space. I would assume that you would have to wait on the weekend, so be prepared for that. Definitely worth it though!"

Ps: My friend and I came around 12 on a Saturday, and we didn't have to wait at all. However, a waiting line slowly built up between 12 and 1."

The yogurt bowl was alright, but I was disappointed by how boring the dishes were despite how colorful they are. If you are looking for a brunch spot in New York, there are plenty of other places I would go, but this place is not it."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-08-26,4.0,"I was always inquisitive about this Australian brunch place. This place is expensive for the tiny portion per plate. Be sure to wait in queue on weekend at peak hours! 

Daily fresh pressed orange juice - always a sucker for fresh pressed juices, it wasn't too sour and perfect !

Cultured kombucha - fermented green tea with a little alcohol? yes!!! (It also has health benefits)

Yogurt bowl -  It's the cliche yogurt bowl with chia seeds and granola, but everything was fresh and tasty

Belgian pancakes - a pancake with peanut butter? Well, you got to be a fan of both these products and if you are, it is heaven! Served with fresh berries and ice cream on the side!

Waffles with panna cotta - a nice waffle with raspberry panna cotta, this combination sounds odd but blends extremely well. 

Smashing avocado - a must do at an Australian restaurant, the multi grain toast was a little too crisp. Would have preferred the toast to not be so difficult to cut!"
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-11-26,5.0,"My husband and I came here for an early brunch one morning before a Rangers game at the Garden.  The place was pretty full around 10:45AM but we put our name down and they texted us when the table was ready. We only had to wait about 15 minutes, it was great! They are clearly very efficient with serving people.

The decor inside was light and inviting with plant life everywhere. I absolutely loved it. My husband and I got a turmeric latte and a hot chocolate to start. Both were outstanding. We shared the avocado toast and the buckwheat waffles. When I tell you this is some of the best breakfast we have ever had, believe me. It blew our socks off. The avocado toast was seasoned well with crunchy roasted peptias on top and the beet hummus complemented it perfectly. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The buckwheat waffles were outstanding. The fruit on top was fresh and the marscapone was a perfect compliment. The dried banana chips were a lovely touch as well. 

We will stalk about this breakfast weeks later. It was amazing. I highly recommend."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-01-20,4.0,"5/5 for the pulled pork with eggs (must have!!)
4/5 for the smoke salmon toast with two eggs. The bread was way to thick and smoked salmon is very normal. 
Remember to take the waitlist from yelp head of time. It was pretty busy at Saturday noon."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-05-27,4.0,"Giving me Bluestone Lane vibes - almost identical little Australian cafe. With the ability to save your place in line on Yelp (which is amazing btw), it was fairly simple and easy to get a table for 3 of us on a afternoon. 

To compare fairly, I ordered the same order I get at Bluestone Lane: avocado toast with poached egg, accompanied with a fruit bowl. The avocado toast was beautifully prepared, with a side of beet hummus and pumpkin seeds, which made it a beautiful picture. Overall, I still prefer Bluestone Lane's, simply for the fact that their GF bread is a tad better, in my opinion. 

The fruit bowl you can't mess up, so I won't even give that a review. I ordered an almond milk latte to top off the meal, which I could've done without. The coffee itself wasn't very strong and I still prefer Bluestone Lane over the two.

There are two locations: Citizens of Chelsea and Citizens of Gramercy. Definitely go to Chelsea for the larger space and atmosphere."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-05-02,5.0,"Citizens of Chelsea offers a very quintessential and ideal brunch situation. The space is light and airy, trendy, and very aesthetic with the pretty hanging plants and wooden elements/decor. They offer an all day menu that's filled with Brunch classics like avocado toast, a breakfast sandwich, eggs Benedict, as well as more unique offerings like their ""Barbie Bowl,"" which is a blended bowl of greek yogurt and pink pitaya, topped with peanut butter, granola, and more, and ""Chocolate PB&J Waffle.""

Even their more classic offerings include innovative ingredients and spins to the traditional, OG version of the dish. For instance, the ""Brekkie Sandwich"" is served on a cheddar chive biscuit, and includes beetroot chutney in addition to the conventional components like scrambled eggs and bacon. 

We went for the ""Pulled Pork Benny"" and ""Smashing Avocado."" Benny is unique as the base was crispy smashed potato instead of the traditional English muffin. Pulled pork had a strong, smoky BBQ flavor that was delicious and added great heartiness to the dish. Served topped with two poached eggs, chipotle hollandaise, and scallions. Great option for a super filling and flavorful, meaty brunch dish.

""Smashing Avocado"" is not your basic avocado toast. For this, the avocado is typically tossed with feta cheese, but requested it without the cheese so mine was neatly sliced instead. Was served on thick-cut toast that was indeed very thick, chewy, and worked as the perfect base for all the avocado goodness (and the portion is very generous, I approve). The ingredients that garnish the plate are what really differentiate this toast. There's beet hummus, pumpkin seeds, pickled onions, and watermelon radish, which I added to the toast before each bite. These garnishes added so many layers of flavors and textures, resulting in a unique avo toast experience. Added a poached egg for extra $, worth it. Presentation for both items was top notch. Seriously gorgeous food. And we were so happy to discover that the taste and flavor were just as impressive as the visuals, yay!

Our waiter was a sweetheart, offering his recommendations on the menu and patiently waiting for my very indecisive self to make a selection."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-07-14,4.0,"Mainly writing another review to rave about the blueberry chai bircher muesli! Came here for brunch with a friend and all I can say is omg, this dish. I would eat it every meal if I could! Portion sizes here typically tend to be on the smaller end, but this one was very filling - lasted me almost the entire rest of the day! 

I'd highly recommend using the Yelp waitlist feature if you come here - was seated almost immediately upon arrival after putting myself on the waitlist about 30 minutes prior! Food came out very quickly, only downside was that they don't do separate checks, but not a huge issue as you can still split the bill accordingly."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-01-11,5.0,"Im giving 5 stars because of my server and the barrista 
They both were amazing, welcoming, best customer service ever 
Place is a little too crowded but they make it work 
I went for brunch on a Saturday 
The banana bread warm up is the best 
I also ordered the avocado toast (it's big so you'll be full)"
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-10-16,4.0,"Especially in regards to brunch, Australian cafes might have an edge on their competitor, the American greasy spoon; with their highly stylized heathy-ish plates of food & picture-perfect cozy spaces, spots like Citizens of Chelsea are understandably attractive to Yelpers, epicureans, millennials, & those who generally care about such things when it comes to their restaurants. 

I thought Australians really knew what they were doing with the Flat White; now Citizens of Chelsea makes an avocado toast to beet (you'll see what I did there) most avocado toasts. There's layers to their genius -- the plate is garnished with pretty magenta beet hummus & sprinkled with pumpkin seeds. Feta crumbles, pickled onions, & some whimsical thing called Easter Egg radish decorate this Smashing Avocado ($14) & a hint of citrus & cilantro finish off the flavor profile. A feast for the eyes & the discerning palate."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-02-03,4.0,"This is a wonderful little spot tucked away in Chelsea! They offer healthy dishes with lots of flavor.

My friend and I arrived around 8:30 am and were seated immediately. Service was attentive and quick! We decided to split the pulled pork with eggs and the miso chicken bowl, both of which were served up quickly.

At first glance the miso chicken bowl looks quite unremarkable, however, the dish packs a lot of flavor. The blueberries are a nice touch, and it turned out to be quite filling. I definitely ate more of this dish than the pulled pork. It leaves you feeling light and clean! (4.5/5)

The pulled pork dish was a bit heftier than I wanted. The pork was almost too flavorful, and I had trouble finishing half of the dish. Luckily, my friend really liked the dish and was able to carry the team. The potatoes are cooked very well and pair nicely with the  pulled pork. (3/5)

Overall, it was a cute little spot. I would definitely stop by again. Next time, I'll have to try a latte as the coffee seems to be a hit with other reviewers!!"
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-04-07,4.0,"I love the vibe that Citizens of Chelsea is striving for! Came here for brunch with a group of six friends. We arrived at around 11pm, and the restaurant was PACKED. Luckily, we only waited for like ten minutes before we were seated. Most of us got the Salmon eggs with Avocado, while a few opted for the pulled pork. My portion (where I only got the salmon eggs and avocado) came about $20 including tax and tip. The dish itself is $16, not a bad deal considering the quality of the food you get.

AMBIANCE:
Hands down one of my favorite spots. Brightly lit and the restaurant gives off a little industrial vibe without being too grungy. I like the decor inside and the amount of sunlight that you get from here, and definitely gives off a California vibe here.

PROS:
I love the salmon and the eggs on my toast! The eggs were poached perfectly so breaking that yolk on top of the toast makes it soooo delicious! Salmon was smoked very well, and they weren't stingy in terms of giving you a decent amount of salmon per toast. The avocado combination definitely added a dimension of flavor to the dish. 

One thing of note, all the food was veryy fresh and organic! I love the concept of the restaurant, and I think its a great place to impress!

Friends said the pulled pork and highly recommended. The mimosas were also really good according to another friend who got it. 

CONS:
Salad was a little bland for my taste and uninteresting. Also in addition the toast was rather stale - I wished it was a little bit crispy, the toast was rather hard to eat.

OVERALL:
Great place to impress, with locally sourced vegetables and ingredients. Love the avocado and the salmon, but the toast and the salad was asking for more."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-03-24,4.0,"This place is super cute - very instagrammable if that's your thing. My sister and I got the Salmon Eggs, Banana Split, and Velvet latte to share. The Salmon Eggs dish was quite refreshing after a non-stop trip of unhealthy eats. The salmon was super fresh and the bread had a nice bite to it. The side salad was also quite refreshing with the pickled onions providing a nice acidic flavor. The Banana Split was pretty good too but nothing to rave about. The Velvet latte was super smooth and velvety but overall flavor kinda meh (probs wouldn't get again but good to try!) 

Plating for everything is on point (hence a good insta spot) but overall food is 4/5."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-11-10,3.0,"Grabbed brunch here on a Saturday morning with some friends in town for the weekend! 
A wild wait time-- over an hour and a half, which we prepared for and spent walking around the local area, stopping by a farmer's market, and exploring the nearby boutiques! 
Great food and great ambiance! Very trendy, fun brunch place with many gluten free, Celiac friendly, and vegan options. Really enjoyed everything we ordered. 
Service was mediocre-- our table never got water glasses, and our teas came at the end of our meal, after asking and reminding for both. Though our server was very sweet about it. 
Overall would recommend the food, and perhaps a different, less crowded time would be a better expetience."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-11-19,4.0,A little overrated. I mean the food is good and solid but I feel like there's better brunch places with better tasting food. Prices aren't bad and service is fast. The ambience of the place is nice and there's a good amount of ambient nice( not too loud to have a nice conversation) the açaí bowl was not as good and the toppings were very light. The baked eggs was hearty but not that great. I would not return again but it was still a good experience.
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-02-23,4.0,"Brunched here twice and always am a fan of the coffee and brunch dish selection. My go to is the smoked salmon and poached egg but the avo toast is a second fave. That beet hummus... mmm. Service is pretty quick and not hard to get on the waitlist or get seated if you come on the earlier side. Definitely recommend for a weekend brunch with a group (or not), with drinks (or not)... it's a solid spot."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-08-18,2.0,"When they say they close at 6, they literally mean they close at 6. You have to get out of there. All the chairs will be up and they won't even give you anymore water because they've literally dumped all the water out of their bottles. 

Came in to check the place out because of a friend's recommendation. Two of us shared the Smashing Avocado, just enough to fill out stomachs before we headed to dinner an hour after. Our waitress started off really kind, but as time went on seemed to be more and more impatient. She rushed us to order, then when she brought us our bill, she only gave us about 1 minute before coming back to check if we had put our card down yet. We felt rushed, so we put a card down right away. When she came back, she reminded us that they were closing soon. After signing to pay, she came to pick the receipt up again, and reminded us yet again that they were closing soon. At this point it was around 5:50, I get it, your closing time is 6, but telling us this many times really actually just makes me want to stay longer. We both used the restroom and left around 5:55. When we were leaving, there was still one other table, but we could tell that they were being rushed out too, since they were chugging their drinks. 

With the decent food and pretty decor, I still wouldn't recommend coming here simply because of the unwelcoming service."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2019-08-19,3.0,"Food is good, but a little bit on the pricy side. Also seems there is no AC in a hot summer day? It's crowded and loud inside, so may not be good if you want to have an effortless conversation inside. Service is okay."
613,citizens-of-chelsea-new-york,2020-02-29,4.0,"Love the decoration and ambience there so much. The atmosphere there is very ""Chelsea"" lol. I ordered the avocado toast. The toast was so delicious and the avocado was fresh. I didn't like the sauce on the side though. Definitely a good place to enjoy brunch and hang out with friends."
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2020-01-19,5.0,"About me: I love cookies. Any kind will suffice, but I love chocolate chip cookies more than life itself. I can confidently say that I am a cookie connoisseur. I've been to all of the popular, over-hyped cookie places in NYC and other cities that tout the best cookies. Levain? Great. Chip? Great. But Seven Grams takes the cookie (yes, lame pun intended) for best, under-rated cookie ever. Each flavor is better than the rest, but the chocolate chip is beyond banging and is always served warm and gooey and chocolately. The peanut butter chocolate chip also slays, as well as the double chocolate chip.  
Besides cookies, the coffee is stellar-- they have tons of special flavors that change daily and are some of the most unique syrups you'll find in SoHo. 
The waitstaff is always incredibly friendly and attentive and makes you feel at home while waiting for your coffee. 
My only wish is that this review allows others to taste the delicious-ness of the treats and coffee at Seven Grams!"
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2020-03-05,4.0,"Good coffee. Lots of milk alternatives, oat milk included. And many vegan/gluten free pastry options. And, pause for applause, the real winner in NYC: plenty of space to sit! My two complaints: when I was there, I did not see any non-pastry food choices. So not the place to get a coffee and a healthier breakfast on the run.  Always like when I can grab a piece of fruit, hard boiled eggs, overnight oats. You name it- just not bread. Also, I like a 16 ounce coffee. I'm a coffee guzzler. But here, if you want it hot, that wasn't an option. But if bread and cookies is what you want... THIS IS YOUR PLACE!"

It seems very simple to add eggs and pickles to a puff pastry, but i dont know a lot of places in the city that have this. The chocolate walnut scone was also to die for.

I enjoyed the matcha latte since it barely had any sweetness and was true to the flavor."
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-12-31,4.0,Their matcha latte was perfect and unsweetened! A lot of places tend to add too much sugar. Biggest qualm is that there is no bathroom. Not uncommon in nyc but coffee shops should have bathrooms!
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-06-11,5.0,"Beautiful space for a cup of morning coffee. I got a iced latte, which was delicious but I'd have to get a hot latte to decide whether the coffee is really good. I also got some thin chocolate cookies to take back as gift, and my coworkers (and me) devoured them in no time!

Tip: If you are a regular, join the email list and you will get good deals periodically"
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-05-08,5.0,"Hands down the best chocolate chip cookie in the city - I've tried Levain, Schmackary's, City Cakes, Gooey on the Inside, and none of those shops can hold a candle to Seven Grams.

If you enjoy your cookies on the thicker side, you'll love these. The cookie is doughy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Instead of chocolate chips, these are made with chocolate discs so the dough permeates nicely throughout and you get a pleasantly layered bite.

I'll definitely be back to try more of these delicious cookies :)"
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-12-02,5.0,"This is one of the best cold brews in town.  It is up there with Gimme, and super strong, so bring a togo cup to carry the second half home.  Unless you like to be buzzing!

I also like the fact that when you order to stay, they have these really cute glasses to serve your coffee in.  They say seven grams on the side.

I know seven grams refers to the measure for 100mg caffeine in a standard double espresso, but it also reminds me of the excellent movie by Almodovar, 21 grams.  

I also also really like the interior of this place.  Very clean, and feng shui of the layout is perfect.

If that's not enough, it's convenient to penn station, so when I'm getting the Amtrak, I'm sure to give myself an extra hour for coffee.  :)"
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-11-16,4.0,"Seven grams.....when I think of seven grams, I think of a quarter of ganja. Lol


I knocked off a star because they only take card. Interesting. 

Butttttttttttt on the bright side, their coffee is yummy. I ordered a latte w oat milk. Took a sip and it didn't burn my mouth unlike some other places. Perfecto temperature. The also have baked goods (ha, get it?) it looks appetizing but didn't get the chance to try it."
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-12-12,5.0,HIGHLY recommend the cortado here! One of the best I've had! I was very tempted to try the vegan chocolate chip cookie but unfortunately was too full. I will be back to try it with my next cortado!

I had a dessert.  And it was delicious but I can't remember for the life of me what it was.  Something vegan."
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2020-02-06,4.0,"Tried for the first time, small coffee shop in Chelsea.  I went in about 3:15pm and it was super crowded - it's a small place.  Easy to order, not many choices for a regular coffee (not sure which flavor I had).  $3 for a small brew - decent afternoon pick me up. I may return for other types of drinks and for their huge variety of cookies and cupcakes, although coffee brews of other shops appeal more to me."
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-01-15,4.0,"My favorite coffee shop in the neighborhood. I typically get the cold brew or oat latte, which are consistent and always solid. I like their non-dairy milk options and the different flavorings options you can add to your coffees. I think their pastries are quite good as well. While the pricing on basic coffee options are in line with other shops, specialty lattes can get quite expensive here.

There's free wifi here, but I think this is more of a stop and go coffee spot or a quick sit-down place rather than a coffee shop you poach out on for a whole afternoon. There's plenty of seating, but it's just a relatively small shop that can get noisy and cramped depending on the time of the day."
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2018-12-22,3.0,"Not bad but not amazing either. I wouldn't waste my money or time to go back. The service was friendly and I enjoyed the music that was played while I dined in, but the value for what I received was subpar. 

I ordered a almond croissant and a small hot chocolate. The total was $9 which is insane. Honestly shouldn't have paid more than $3 for each. But I guess that's New York and they can get away with it."
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2018-12-21,5.0,"Seven Grams is Chelsea's best coffee shop. Come for the coffee, stay for the pastries.

It is a pretty small place so you will often have to wait for a seat or just order to go. 

The coffee is excellent and their pastries are even better (the cookies and coffee cake especially).

They have wifi and outlets too. I highly recommend it!"

The arugula, goat cheese and red pepper croissant was amazingly delicious and fresh. They have a lot of cute details in the packaging and around the shop and they used super cute paper straws with stars for 4th of July. They only take Apple Pay or credit card, no cash.  Don't go to the chain places next door, it's worth the extra walk and $ to come here!!"
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-07-25,4.0,Loved this thick and gooey cookie. The tahini added a nice salty flavor. The caffe was super cute inside and had a good selection of coffee drinks.

That olive oil bread loaf was delicious 
I didn't have any coffee though 

The food is really good, 
Perfect for a nice light start to the morning 
Would go well with coffee 
Someone what ok with tea (it's a coffee shop)

1. The options they have are diverse 
Egg sandwiches, muffins, loaf slices 
2. Quality of the food is above average  
3. Size of the portions is good for the price 
Considering quality/ taste    
4. The price is, average, not a great deal but also not over priced considering the above 

So the space itself is really nice 
The interior is a clean open space 
A decent amount of seats and seating styles 
Plenty of room to stand and wait for an order 

The service is really efficient and friendly - almost unsettlingly so. It's been a while since I've seen someone so chipper, definitely brought a human element to it 
 
The flavor and texture is really nice , Spongey like a marble loaf and has the oily taste to it but it's not dripping or staining the bag. It's not heavy or light, you don't need a coffee but I can imagine it being a really good pair 

Will come back for sure 
Nice spot to hang out with someone for a few minutes or grab a cup on the go"

I thoroughly enjoyed my almond croissant--though I wish it had a little bit more almond in it and he thought that his scone was one of the best that he's ever had.

The cafe is not too big and there weren't many tables, so I'd imagine that it might get packed during certain times. The amount of table space is also quite limited. It was sufficient for me, but I'd imagine anyone needing space for more than just a laptop or tablet may run out of room. Also liked their cold brew and latte.

Polite and friendly barista. Beautiful store with lots of natural daylight, clean minimalist feel. Not a ton of seats- relatively small store but not super tiny either. Can seat about 10-12 I think ? 

I will definitely be back to this beautiful cafe in midtown. It's nice and quiet on the inside and removes you from
the hustle and bustle of the penn station area."

The coffee is great and the service is delightful.

614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-06-05,2.0,"I don't care what you call the current era -- late capitalism, neoliberalism, the age of inequality -- but this place exemplifies it. We're talking $4.75 for an ice coffee (yes, I wasn't paying attention until I ordered). I noticed little difference in taste from mass-market options. Ditto for the overpriced baked goods. It's a classic example of the ""if it's more expensive, it must be better"" fallacy that Louis Vutton has coasted on for years, hoodwinking almost-elite tryhards into spending thousands on a chessboard quilt pattern. 

There are better ways to spend all that surplus (ha, ha, right?!) than here, which could be an object lesson in how demand-side recessions happen. Alternately, it's another data point affirming EJ Hobsbawm's argument that an excess of luxuries points to ugly social pathology underneath: gaping inequality, capital deployed to frivolous purposes, and so forth."
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-08-07,4.0,"Just discovered this coffee house. They make a top notch cappuccino. The barista knows what he's doing. My niece got a flat white, and equally as impressed. The place itself is clean and modern with a decent amount of seating for a coffee shop.
My biggest complaints is the music was awful!!!! This is a coffee shop, not the GAP or H&M. What is this shit music being played? Actually took away the experience from the amazing drink. There were businessman trying to conduct business over a cup of coffee, and they literally had to yell across the table. Please, please, please... put on some chill music. We don't need to hear Britney Spears or Rhianna while sipping a sophisticated cappuccino that was made with such expertise."
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2019-08-24,5.0,What a special little coffee shop. Everyone Working there is so kind and wonderful. The oat milk cappuccino was perfect. The desserts were very tasty. Gem. This place really is a gem.
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2018-12-12,3.0,"Overall - maybe 1 step above Starbucks but nothing special

What I got - Nutella babka and hibiscus tea

Taste - the babka did not resemble any kind of babka Ive ever had. It was light and flaky like a pastry but nothing like a bread as expected. Additionally, it didn't taste anything like Nutella either, chocolate sure but not Nutella. The hibiscus tea was ok but served way to hot to the point where the cardboard guard didn't help.

Value - average, $7 for tea and a pastry that was about average taste

Service - line moved quick and server was friendly

Atmosphere - casual and less noisy than other coffee shops Ive been to around morning rush. 

Facility - ~14 people can sit and most of the tables were in use

Would I come back - No

Would I go out of my way - No

Additional info - Although it wasn't bad, I'd rather try anywhere else for breakfast and coffee because there are many in the area. To be fair, I think this place is more about quality coffee than anything else and I didn't have"
614,seven-grams-caffe-new-york-3,2018-03-26,3.0,"I've been on a hunt for good coffee and I decided to try seven grams. I ordered an almond milk cappuccino. The price is more on the higher end in comparison to other small coffee shops and like some places they charge 50cents extra for almond milk. I didn't particularly enjoy the taste of the coffee: it was more on the bitter and acidic end and there was a lot of foam from the milk.
Other tips:

Ambience: (5/5)on a Monday afternoon it is pretty quiet spot where you can get work done.

Comfort: (4/5)they have a wooden bench and a pretty comfortable bar stool,however no restroom.

Baristas (5/5): quiet but pleasant.2"
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2020-05-13,5.0,"Blank Slate was always on my list of cafes to try in NYC, and I feel very blessed that they've stayed open and are within walking distance from me - they've really become my go to spot. I come here for coffee or takeout a couple times a week. I've tried a few different menu items here, but what they really knock it out of the park on is salads. The chickpea salad and kale caesar with brussels sprouts are amazing. Good texture/ingredient combinations, and they really do not skimp on the toppings!! When you add chicken ($4), you get basically an entire grilled chicken breast. 

Also, the boys who work here are incredibly nice and patient. One of them actually remembered me (which I am now extra impressed by, given that everyone is wearing masks these days) and complimented my style. Given that I have only worn athleisure for about two months now, that affirmation was extra cherished. Whenever I resume my office commute again, I will be genuinely sad not to get to come here all the time."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2020-05-10,5.0,"Blank Slate has been my favorite place to order delivery from during COVID-19. You can order through Postmates.

Important to note- the food has consistently been exponentially better when we order M-Friday morning than when we order over the weekend (most noticeably with the steak sandwich and avo toast)

Regardless Blank Slate has been the best. 

Favorites: Avocado toast. Has a kick and topped off with a little bit of honey. Absolutely delicious. When I order it during the week they usually bless me with 3-4 slices vs. 2 on the weekend. Still probably the best avo toast in quarantine and prior to quarantine was definitely up there with Bluestone Lane.

My boyfriend always orders the bacon egg and cheese. I have really enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich with cranberry as well."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2020-03-24,5.0,"An absolute favorite neighborhood coffee place that also offers excellent food and a cozy atmosphere. The chili honey avocado toast is easy to fall in love with, and they serve Vietnamese iced coffee which is such a wonderful treat. They use recycled materials for their packaging which I love. Takeout is always quick and spill-free."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2020-03-03,5.0,"TLDR: Great service, fast wifi, usually seating available, cute atmosphere, and large selection of coffee, wine, beer, food and sweets. What more can a human ask for? 

Food: Love the steak sandwich! The salads are all solid and they have a good selection of apps and fun desserts (cookie skillet!). Their strong suite is their food, pastries look fine but nothing special for NYC. 

Drinks: Coffee, wine, beer...oh my! Happy hour special for the alcohol is a plus. Wide selection of different coffee/espresso drinks. 

Atmosphere: clean, inviting, functional. 

Service: fantastic! Warm, friendly, and respite from the typical New York brusqueness that you often find 

Note: I'm an evening visitor so I can't comment on breakfast."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-12-03,4.0,"Blank Slate was really cute and had good coffee and breakfast options, but wow, they are really, really busy for brunch! Seating is first come first serve, so you can either be really lucky or have to wait for a table. You can also come in to just order food and coffee.  

I was looking for a place to sit for a while, and it's not a great option for chilling for a long period of time if you come during prime breakfast/lunch hours. I did stay long enough to order the bagel and lox dish, which was really good! I was a big fan of their cucumber and capers sauce that went with the dish."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-10-27,4.0,"Got the berry Belgian waffles and cappuccino. Girlfriend got the mushroom omelet. Both great! Really love how they have magnetic slates to play with while waiting for the food.

Instead of maple syrup they have Honey and Agave which were actually pretty amazing on the waffle.

Great spot for breakfast!"
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-09-10,5.0,"Ok, I have since been back  multiple times and have to add how much I love this place.

I've tried the turkey sandwich, the flank steak and the coffee. Every time I come here I leave satisfied. 

I still stick to my point that they should have more locations, I really feel like they would do well in the LES. They have a great atmosphere and don't disappoint on food and beverages. This is the best place in the area to get cafe food and coffee with a good vibe. I definitely recommend.

I got their Avocado Toast and it was tasty. My friends got different food and they look all tasty. Everything is reasonably priced for the portion.
 
This place is good for a quick bite alone or with a small group. Definitely not suitable for a big group. 
You order food at the register and they bring your food. 

There are many menu options for breakfast. I would come back!"
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2020-01-13,4.0,"So I wasn't as impressed with this side of Blank Slate as the pink one.  I wanted to try both and maybe it's because I went to the other one first and then here, but the staff here were more brusque and I felt very rushed while ordering my coffee.  I ended up not ordering any of the food because of it.  My latte was good, but the service really put a damper on my experience."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2020-05-31,5.0,"Blank Slate is my favorite cafe in the city! You can't go wrong when ordering as everything is delicious, but my absolute favorite is the bacon scramble. The staff are incredibly nice/helpful.

615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2020-05-23,5.0,Yum Yum Yum!  Love the smores here!  Smores are pretty hard to find at a restaurant so props to this place for being willing to be unique!  The smores go so well and perfect with coffee or latte!  Cute presentation also!
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-11-26,4.0,"Came  to Blank Slate for a light meal before flying home. There are a variety of options and many are healthy.

 I got the avocado toast, which is served all day  The avocado comes drizzled with some spicy stufft, so it's a little spicy! Definitely an interesting take on the classic avocado toast. We also got the roasted turkey sandwich, The sandwich was delicious, and was also served with an arugula salad on the side.

They have a s'mores dip for dessert that looks amazing, but we had to go unfortunately.  i'll come back just for that!"
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-05-27,5.0,"LOVE this place! We stumbled across this after accidentally first walking into the sister tea shop next door. 

The service is extremely well done, given the small space and quick order atmosphere. We ended up waiting about 15 minutes for a table for 3 when there was a full house, which isn't bad at all. 

When going to the counter to order after getting a table, I was super impressed with the speed of the order. I could've been lucky, but I ordered an almond milk iced latte with the rest of my meal, and by the time I was swiping my card to pay, the barista behind the corner handed me my latte. 

The avocado toast is amazzzzingly good! The GF bread is as well! The breakfast bowl, salmon bagel, and yogurts are other great options if you're not an avocado fan like me. Next time, I'm definitely getting the yogurt parfait!"
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-05-13,5.0,"We stumbled upon this breakfast spot while on a recent trip as it was on the same block as our hotel. We could not have been happier with the service and waitstaff! The food was great and we were quickly seated even though the place was packed at 10:00am on a Sunday. The hostess seats with a number and you go to the counter and order your breakfast which could not be easier and eliminates having to wait for a server to place your order. 

My boyfriend got the truffled goat cheese egg sandwich and I had a plain bagel with lox and caper relish. The bagel came with plenty of lox and the egg sandwich was delicious. 

We will definitely be back the next time we're in the neighborhood!"

Great place to stop for a quick but filing breakfast and coffee."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-11-16,5.0,"Blank Slate made my day today with their impeccable service and it prompted me to update my review with another 5 star! 

I visit Blank Slate at least a few times in a month. Last weekend however, my to go order was missing a portion and I did not notice until getting home. It made me sad as it was a meal I really looked forward to, so I messaged the cafe via Yelp, hoping to at least get the missing portion back in my following visit. 

It was to my delightful surprise that Ashley, who I think is the store owner, responded in just a day or two apologizing for the mixed up and offering to have my meal covered for the next visit. Today, I went in and was able to redeem her offer with the help of Nick and Rebeca. The process was very smooth, everyone there was super kind and welcoming. The food as always is exceptional. 

I really love Blank Slate for many reasons- food, coffee, atmosphere, and most certainly the service. Looking forward to the many more visits to come! Thanks again for today!"
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-05-30,5.0,"If you're in need of a fresh salad or sandwich with some awesome ingredients than try Blank Slate Coffee+Kitchen. They also serve breakfast but haven't tried it yet. 

I tried their rustic sandwich which tasted amazing, the combination of flavors pair really well with each other. The sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese really stand out so if you're a fan, do yourself a favor and order this guy! 

There is no real table service, just order at the counter and if you're staying to eat they will give you a number and someone will bring the food to your table. Service is really fast as I believe it took less then 5 minutes from ordering to get our food on the table. They do serve beer and wine and have a happy hour from 4pm - 7pm. 

Blank Slate Cafe is right next door and owned by the same owner do if it's to crowded, you can always check that place out as it seems like they have a similar like menu."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2020-03-01,5.0,"I can't believe I've never given a review to this place. It's healthy with a cute atmosphere, and overall a great, but quick breakfast spot. It's a personal favorite because I found it when I first moved here. We've gone and run into plenty of parades on our way, which is an added benefit. 

We would come back time and again for their egg skillets. Highly recommend the mushroom OR bacon skillet, not as big of a fan of the quinoa breakfast bowl. Yet to try their lunches, but look amazing."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-02-26,5.0,"How did I not know this place existed before now? I happened upon it by chance while looking for a place to grab a quick cup of coffee with a colleague. It couldn't have been more perfect. It is adorable, quaint and an ideal spot for a cup of coffee and a little sandwich to talk work, meet a friend or simply to chill for a bit one your own.

It's not a huge place by any means. There are maybe five or six tables (for two), which can easily be pushed together for a group of four. There are also two high top tables. 

I wasn't really hungry, per se, but everything sounded so yummy, I had to get something. I ordered the BECLT Egg Sandwich with hot sauce. It was yummy!

The staff is extremely friendly, which a nice turn, as you'd almost expect people working at a charming coffee nook like this to have an air of pretentiousness. But not at all."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-10-08,4.0,"Came in for breakfast - got the cold brew and split the bacon scramble and avocado toast.  Both dishes were good but a little sweeter than we may have liked (caramelized onions in the scramble, chili honey on the avo toast), and both were helped along by some salt and pepper.  Vibe is open and airy, and there's etch-a-sketches (fun play on the ""blank slate"" theme) to entertain yourself with which brought a burst of nostalgic joy to my morning."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2020-02-13,5.0,"So I think I have a healthy obsession with their avocado toast. 

I hate buying food items that are so simple to make at home (like an omelette, or a ham and Swiss sandwich). Why pay $10 for eggs when it's literally the easiest food to make at home for a unit cost of $.10??

And for something (in my opinion) simple to make like avo toast, why can't I recreate it like the Blank chef?? Am I in avoidance of and too guilt-ridden in using sugary honey as a topper, but will look the other way when someone else makes it? Or maybe they just toast it better. I don't know, but since I can't make it as Delish as they do, I'll stick with my obsession."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-09-02,4.0,"I feel twice as hip as I usually feel walking into @blankslatenyc which is a very hip lunch spot cafe in NoMad. I got a unique take on a roast turkey sandwich that includes balsamic roasted squash, cranberry goat cheese, sauteed kale all on seven grain ciabatta. I wish there was more seating available because as soon as you get the food here you'll want to dig in right away."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-02-18,4.0,"This review is solely for the dessert!  My friend and I came to Blank Slate around 6pm on a Monday evening.  When we arrived, the restaurant was about three-quarters full.  You order at the register and then sit down so I would not call this a full-service restaurant.  The decor and ambiance is typical of a bougie-style eatery.

We ordered the S'mores Dip ($12) and hot chocolate ($4/each).  The heart on the hot chocolate was nicely done!  Regarding flavor, my taste buds may have been a bit thrown by the S'mores Dip but the hot chocolate was toward the bitter side.  The S'mores Dip is very rich and sweet, which I loved!  My friend thought it was tasty, but she was affected by the heaviness of it and couldn't eat as much as she wanted.  The marshmallow:chocolate:graham cracker ratio was well done.  However, I thought both the hot chocolate and the dip were tiny portions for the price.  But, considering the location in midtown and the bougie vibe, I would expect that type of pricing.

I recommend trying out the S'mores Dip if you're in the treat-your-self mood.  Unless you have a really strong stomach, I also recommend sharing so you don't get overwhelmed by the heaviness!"
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-07-07,5.0,"Went in for a quick but not to-go breakfast. Tried the BEC (bacon egg cheese), croissant, and iced latte. The sandwich was so good and came out fast. 

Listen to the description for BEC. 

BEC SANDWICH
bacon, runny egg, aged cheddar, spicy aoili, butter lettuce, tomato on brioche 

This was so good we are going back there again today. The iced latte was delicious. I drink at least one iced latte every day and this one was noticeably good. 

The croissant was not good, a little stale. That's ok. I ate it with the BEC (sauce is delicious) and it was even better than on the brioche. 

The tables were clean and one girl was hanging out doing bullet journaling. Good peoplewatching and service was friendly."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-12-03,4.0,Cutest coffee shop! I was looking for a place to work from as I was in town for the week and stumbled across blank slate. I ordered the blank slate chopped salad which was so yummY! pine nuts and atrichokes with the homemade dressing was delicious. I ordered the iced latte which normally I like vanilla flavoring (forgot no NY coffee shops carry flavors lol) but the plain one was so good. The spot is good for working from with the exception of not too many outlets but it's big for a NY coffee shop. Def a try if you are in the area!

615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-07-06,5.0,Super cute cafe with lots of brunch and beverage options! I was honestly just trying to kill time (and go somewhere with AC) before a lunch appointment in the neighborhood. A quick search on yelp led me here and I pleasantly surprised. Service is on point - everyone here is so cheery and that makes all the difference. Also love how they decorated the place - lots of greenery. Ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee and it was great! Will definitely be back for brunch!
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-06-01,2.0,"Exceptionally disappointing. Saw pics of the food on yelp and it looked promising. We got the bacon scramble, quinoa bowl, cold brew, and mocha. 

The mocha was sweet then for some reason sour. The cold brew was sour. The avocado was sour. The side of toasted bread for the bacon scramble. Sour. Ok well actually that was sour dough so they get a pass. But that bread was set to max dehydration. Terribly hard.

Let's start from the beginning. Ambiance was nice. Wooden tables, chalkboard menu, impressive etch-a-sketches masterpieces on the way. A good way to start. Little did I know it was just a trap. 

The quinoa bowl comes with brown quinoa, roasted Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, avocado smash, and a sunny egg. It was so bland. There was no dimension. Maybe the avocado was supposed to bring that fresh spring but it was just too sour. I thought at first, maybe they just over lemoned it. You know, to prevent browning. But the more I ate it the more the lines blurred between lemon and the kind of avocado that turns sour because it's well...turning. The egg was the only redeeming factor but even then it was slightly over cooked and didn't have much ooze factor. Wouldn't be a deal breaker if the dish as a whole was any good. 

Bacon scramble? So sweet. Maybe it was the maple bacon. Maybe it was the caramelized onion which tasted almost as sweet as a onion jam. Maybe it was both. The cheddar cheese was in cubes and seemed to have been thrown in the mix last minute as quite a few cubes were not fully melted and actually cold when eaten. While this was much tastier than the quinoa bowl, that was wasn't a very hard feat to accomplish.

So heartbroken. The dishes sounded and looked great, but left so much to be desired."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2018-12-29,4.0,"Came for the avocado toast - was severely disappointed. The toast was seemingly more crust than not, and the avocado was way to liberally thrown on the bread. 

The avocado was also doused in honey which ruined the flavor compliments since pepper flakes were also included. 

Had to remove the honey portion to enjoy the toast. A small portion for the price tag as well.

Atmosphere of the spot was enjoyable for a light breakfast."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-11-24,5.0,"We came in with a group of 11 people, and we were quickly and nicely helped to find a table.

Not everyone in our group were coffee drinkers, but everyone found something they enjoyed. Would definitely do an easy brunch here again."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-04-09,4.0,Small very busy breakfast coffee space. Get in line. Order. Pay. Get a number ..Sit down ...wait.  Food!! Very efficient! The cold brew was excellent and large in a real glass. My eggs came out in a cast iron skillet. On a wooden board. I got the spinach feta mushroom scramble with a side of bacon. I asked for the eggs soft. They came out crumbling. Oh well. Bacon was a bit over done. Toast was hard. But... it was all good. $19
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-05-13,5.0,"Just so delicious!
The avocado toast with chili honey and smoked salmon was amazing. The chili honey gives a lot of pizazz to the flavor. If you like avocado toast, just take my word for it and order this!
The rose berry Belgian waffle with sweet cream was an excellent follow up to the savory toast. True Belgian style waffle with deep squares to hold all of that yummy topping. 
The orange juice is Natalie's fresh squeezed. Such a good breakfast find.
Not sure about the place itself as this was an UberEats delivery but after tasting their food I'd love to try it in person."
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-05-15,4.0,We stumbled upon this place while in the area and reading some Yelp Reviews. The food was delicious! I highly recommend the AVO & WHITES and TRUFFLED GOAT CHEESE. The Avocado dish tasted fresh and light while the Truffled Goat Cheese Sandwich was decadent and creamy! The bread pairings on both sandwichs was wonderful as well. The drink menu was substantial and would recommend the Macha Iced Drink. We arrived a bit after 11am on a weekday and was very packed. The hostess sat us on the communal table at our request quite quickly. Definitely would love to try the rest of the menu as their sweet offers look incredible as well!

Fast Casual with excellent service. You pay at the counter but they bring you your food and coffee. We had two bacon  scrambles and shared a grilled cheese with GF bread.

615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-12-31,4.0,"This is honestly such an adorable and friendly coffee shop! Although it gets rather crowded and hard to find a seat, especially around noon, I really enjoyed my visit here. I grabbed a hot chocolate and a mushroom-scrambled egg on a croissant, while my friend grabbed a normal coffee and a yogurt with fruit. We both enjoyed our meals, with the scrambled egg on a croissant being especially delicious and incredibly filling. And the staff was very friendly and accommodating, even taking requests such as swapping toast with a croissant and putting almond milk instead of dairy milk in my hot chocolate. 

The only problem I had was the price, which I suppose isn't *that* terrible for good quality food in midtown. Still, just my hot chocolate and egg on croissant ended up being about $17 with tax and tip, which gave me mild sticker shock. But if you don't mind the prices and you're around in the area, I'd suggest you pay this place a visit!"
615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2019-04-14,5.0,"Oh my so yummy!!!! Ok so it's a small place. We had 6 people and a toddler and somehow got a table by sheer luck. They do have a high chair for anyone wondering

Food:
- I had the truffle egg sandwich. Amazing. The truffle spread on it really adds a POW to it. The focaccia bread was soft and delicious and the hints of rosemary went really well with the rest of the sandwich. The mushrooms were also super delicious. It's a big sandwich but somehow I devoured the whole thing. Also the truffle spread was toddler approved surprisingly. 
- my mom has the avocado toast which was also amazing. The chili oil on that would've tasted super good on my sandwich"

615,blank-slate-coffee-kitchen-new-york-3,2018-09-13,4.0,"We had breakfast at Blank Slate on a rainy Sunday morning. 

I ordered the Rose Berry Waffle and this was really good. The waffle was similar to a Belgian waffle and fresh whip cream went perfectly with the berries. I would order this dish every time I go Blank Slate. My wife and daughter were also happy with their choices.

The space has lots of natural light and the servers were very friendly. It was a bit pricey but the ingredients all tastes of quality and freshness.

Great little spot on Madison."
616,besfren-new-york,2020-05-27,5.0,Pretty solid dessert place and quick service. I'll stop by here to pick up a drink or their famous ice cream. Very great texture and smooth and the cookies are pretty yummy too.
616,besfren-new-york,2020-01-24,5.0,"The matcha taro soft serve is a win for me -- tastes exactly what it sounds. Neither of the flavors are overpowering which gives it a great balance. They also top it off with a cute flower for presentation.

The service was great! The workers were very kind and helped provide suggestions as needed.

Although it's a small shop, my friends and I were able to grab a couple seats and chatted for sometime. Because my friends are from the area, they are familiar with this place; however, if I were alone, I think I would've missed and walked right by it. 

We arrived around 7pm and it wasn't busy, though, I noticed that it got busier around 8pm."
616,besfren-new-york,2020-03-01,2.0,"So disappointed to find out they had gotten rid of the chiffon donut cake!!!  (Why did they get rid of it though?!?) You'll be forever missed!!!

Got the matcha jasmine roll cake, nothing special in my opinion and too soggy for my taste. I don't know if it's because it has been sitting out for too long....only good thing about the matcha roll cake is that it has strong matcha flavor/taste but not worth paying the $4.25. You're better off going to your local Chinese or Korean bakery for roll cakes. Only coming back for the soft serve and lattes from now on."

My bes fren had the cookie in milk and it was great, but watch out for the cookie and milk ratio. My other bes fren ( yes I have 2 ) got the taro and matcha ice cream and it was quite sweet but delicious! The playlist of this place is lit playing Drake and Frank Ocean! There are also some cosmetic products that my other bes fren ( yes I have 3 ) bought while enjoying their cookie."
616,besfren-new-york,2020-06-03,5.0,"Besfren sells the best chocolate chip cookie is my opinion. It was the best chocolate chip cookies that I ever tasted. The chocolate was a little bit gooey, once you break it in half, the chocolate is melted. It is soooo soft and the melted chocolate is just mmm. Strongly recommend you to get the chocolate chip cooking! Another recommendation that I have to make is their taro soft-serve, that literally blew my mind as well. The matcha and  taro is definitely not a combination that I would usually choose, but I'm so glad that I made the decision to get it. Ever since then, every single time I visit besfren, I always get the cookie and the ice cream. They're a perfect match made in heaven."
616,besfren-new-york,2019-12-02,4.0,"Nice little bakery/coffee shop/cafe offering a tasty taro and matcha swirl soft serve.

Bestfren is located on 32nd St and 5th Ave.

The taro and matcha soft serve, takes a really nice pic. It's also priced very reasonably, at around $5, for a good amount of ice cream. Considering this is midtown, I was pretty impressed with pricing of this particular item. The taro and matcha swirl actually tasted pretty good, too. I found myself visiting quite a few times, during the summer.

There's quite a few bakery items, and drinks that were available. I haven't tried any of them, but I think I will, next time I visit. It's a little cramped inside, especially when a line forms. Towards the front of the store, there's a few tables to sit at, and enjoy your sugary snack."
616,besfren-new-york,2019-12-21,5.0,"I ordered the jasmine matcha roll. The cream itself is something else. Usually these rolls have a lot of cake, but they flipped that paradigm upside down and gave it more cream. The cream itself was delicious and paired well with the cake. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would get it again. 

This place has only a few spots to sit."
616,besfren-new-york,2019-12-09,4.0,"My boyfriend and I stopped in here last night. We wanted some dessert. It was a little after 9 and they said their espresso machine was off for the night so we couldn't get lattes. We each got a cold brew to try the coffee and we got the double chocolate chip cookie, warmed. The cookie had crunchy edges and a soft center. I prefer soft cookies so I ate the center and my boyfriend ate the edges. It was average, nothing special.
The cold brew was good, in its own way. It definitely has a different taste. A bit on the acidic side. I added almond milk to mine and it made it taste better and toned down some of the acidity. They do have the best coffee sleeves of allllll the coffee shops we've ever tried! Fancy. The total for the cookie and two cold brews was $12 and some change. Not too bad."
616,besfren-new-york,2019-10-02,4.0,"Came here after dinner in K-town against my best judgment and got the matcha-taro soft serve in a cone. Two of my favorite asian ice cream flavors in one swirl! My two other favorites are black sesame and red bean, which btw can be procured in Chinatown Ice Cream Factory, but I digressed. The matcha flavor was slightly bitter but very refreshing, and the taro flavor was sweet but only subtly so; they complimented each other extremely well and were honestly kinda fun to eat! The cone was just aite - nothing special. I'd go with the cup next time. Would be nice if they could add more flavors but I'm already content. 

Four stars instead of five because it's a bit pricey compared with Soft Swerve on the Lower East Side, which also has a lot more flavors and gizmos. I'd prefer Soft Swerve to Besfren it weren't for the convenient location."
616,besfren-new-york,2020-02-16,3.0,"Matcha soft serve that's not really worth traveling for, but good enoufh if you happen to walk by. I watched the interactions of the employees with their customers and felt like the employees weren't friendly."
616,besfren-new-york,2019-09-04,3.0,"Eh. I came here as it popped up on my Yelp when I was looking for ice cream. 

I didn't realize until I was already there that they only have one flavor oh ice cream. I figured I'd try it anyway. 

I found the flavors a bit muted. I still ate it all, but definitely could have had more to it than what it was. I would be interested in trying one of their other dessert options. At that time, I may re-asses this review. 

Service was great, the person working the counter was very friendly. 

Not a fan of the interior, they share a space with some small store and the seating is at the store side. Every single one of the tables were dirty, so I stood outside to eat my cone. 

Eh.

616,besfren-new-york,2019-08-23,4.0,"This cafe is so adorable! They have a little section where they sell ginseng which I thought was cool. There is very limited seating due to the very small cafe. Everything is very clean and decorated very aesthetically. The staffs are also extremely friendly.

I ordered a matcha and taro soft serve and a small pink lemonade. The soft serve was absolutely amazing. I didn't find it too sweet; the balance was perfect. The two flavors, taro and match, go so well together. I will definitely purchase this again! 

I also got a small pink lemonade because it seemed like popular option. I think I was expecting some kind of sweet, fruity flavor and completely forgot that lemonade means sour. However, I did find it too sour to my liking. There was no sweetness to this drink at all. Especially when the ice melted, the drink got too watery and didn't taste like anything but sour water. I probably won't order this again.

Overall, I do love this cafe and would recommend this place to all my friends. The matcha and taro soft serve is amazing, so you should definitely try it out!"
616,besfren-new-york,2019-08-12,5.0,"Came here for their iconic matcha/taro soft serve after dinner at the AYCE kbbq next door.

I ordered the matcha jasmine roll cake and the soft serve to go. Everything came out super quickly - they wrapped the cake in wax paper then put in a box and it was super cute!

The soft serve was super yummy and creamy. It was not too sweet so I was able to actually finish it! (I am never able to finish ice cream cups because it gets too sweet and heavy after a while)
It was swirled very prettily and ofc the flower was super pretty too.

Took the roll cake home. Its different than traditional roll cakes where theres a swirl of cake and the cream is swirled inside with it- theres a lot more cream on their version- it's basically a circle of cake and the inside is all cream! It was very tasty and I was able to taste both the jasmine and the matcha flavors."
616,besfren-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,Small spot  with some banging dessert. The taro ice cream was like a  magic trick one second it was there and two minutes  later it vanished wtf? Also came with a pretty flower I didn't eat. The flavor is like a sweet spiced vanilla. Smooth and creamy soft serve  style
616,besfren-new-york,2020-01-05,2.0,"Emm... I think not.
On a recent visit after dinner, me and a group of friends sat at a rattly table next to dirty floor and enjoyed our bitter ginseng latte that was at best passable. Weird set up with jung gwan jang ginseng vendor at the corner with random TV screening random stuff, the place just did not give a comfortable vibe. 

One would think that in NYC, you would do better. One thing going for it is that it did have a few tables. I'd recommend management to keep things cleaner on the shop floor."
616,besfren-new-york,2020-01-28,5.0,I was a matcha lover and now match and taro lover. Had the  matcha and taro softserve and I love how sweet it is. The taste of taro compliments matcha well. Wanted to get the small cream puffs and other sweet too but they're kind of pricey
616,besfren-new-york,2020-03-24,5.0,"Taro matcha soft serve. It has no business being so delicious. Their cookies are insane, gooey and chocolatey. They have a taro tea-puccino that's lovely. The store also features a red ginseng shop!"
616,besfren-new-york,2019-08-11,3.0,"This is a cute Asian dessert and drink place near Koreatown. It's a bit confusing that there's a skincare place by the same name next door, and there is skincare sold in here in addition to food and drink.

There's not much seating and there are a few outlets if you care to charge any devices. It's a bit small, so you may have to take your food or drink to-go. 

My friend and I shared the Matcha/Ube soft serve and the taro bunny tail. I also tried the ginseng ginger latte. We'd recommend the soft serve (very Instagrammable and refreshing on a summer day) but I found the latte lacked much flavor--it was fairly watery and I didn't taste the ginseng.  The bunny tail is cute but small, and head's up--very messy. I'd eat it in the restaurant and be sure to get napkins!"
616,besfren-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,"I highly recommend the soft serve taro and matcha swirl in a cup! It cost me $4.99+tax and every spoon was worth it. It looks just as amazing as it tastes! The flavors were strong and delicious. I will be returning again during my next visit to NY. 
---Also, my fiancee (a person who usually doesn't like desserts) couldn't stop stealing scoops from my soft serve! That's how yummy it was."
616,besfren-new-york,2020-01-20,4.0,I got to try the matcha and taro soft serve as well as the chocolate chip cookie! I enjoyed the matcha and taro soft serve a lot! Very flavorful and creamy! The cookie I was a little disappointed in because I saw it on one of the insider videos so  maybe my expectation was a little too hIgh. Yes it was very chocolatey but the cookie itself could've been a little thicker I guess. The place is very small and it was packed. So it was a little chaotic after I ordered and was waiting for it.
616,besfren-new-york,2020-01-08,4.0,"The grapefruit cold drink tasted amazing !! 
The chocolate chip cookie wasn't as good as I thought it would be.
The matcha taro soft serve is a solid 10/10 in taste, but they sold me air. My experience was going so well until i realized the whole middle top to bottom of the cup was empty! 
The seating area is small with tiny stools."

Triple chocolate cookie - we tried the triple chocolate. Have tried various chocolate cookies. This is no extra ordinary. 

Tiramisu roll cake - one of the popular desserts here, we ordered the tiramisu roll cake. Probably we went there late or it wasn't our lucky day, we found it a little more dry than what we would expect! The taste was good but nothing great."

The ginseng tea latte was just okay to us. We didn't feel any special about it and there's no latte art. But do highly recommend their ice cream! We're really enjoy it!"
616,besfren-new-york,2019-05-23,4.0,"Super cute dessert. I was hesitant on eating the green tea and taro soft serve swirl fast but had no choice as it melts fast! I tasted the green tea and liked that. Thought the taro would be sweeter, but it was good. Overall I like it! 
This location also is great as a coffee spot. I've planned a life trip here and never felt rushed."
616,besfren-new-york,2020-05-23,2.0,Very friendly and nice staff but the ice cream itself was very poor quality.  Did not enjoy it one bit.  Just didn't taste good.  I guess that's why the price is a lot cheaper than those expensive soft serve places.
616,besfren-new-york,2019-07-12,5.0,"They got me just on the aesthetics for the soft serve swirl. If you're a fan of ube and matcha, look no further, Bestfren is the spot to be! I love how beautiful and looks and how balanced the flavors were together. Both the flavors for ube and matcha were strong and complimented each other very well, super creamy, not too sweet. You can actually even just get a whole cup of ube soft swerve by itself if you wanted!

There is some tables and seats, but can get busy. I would definitely come back!"
616,besfren-new-york,2019-05-07,4.0,"Even though it was pouring outside, I thought to myself, ""This is soft serve weather.""

One bite of that beautiful swirl of lilac and green soft serve and I was amazed by how well the taro and matcha flavors complemented each other. Individually these flavors are subtle but together they seemed to bring out the best in one another - just like a best friend. 

There are a handful of seats available."

.:: Sweets ::. 

::Mini Chiffon Cakes (6) ~$16.50 (2.75 each): 
-Rainbows Roll Cake: vanilla cream rolled with rainbow swirl chiffon cake. The cake complimented the cream well as it was moist and good to look at. 
-Milky Way: Vanilla roll cake with vanilla meringue cookie and chocolate pearls on top. Very basic but comforting. 
-Beauty: lavender black currant roll cake with cassis macaron and lingonberry on top. A mesh of interesting flavor.  
-Beast: Mascarpone cream with espresso jelly and cocoa nibs on top. Very coffee like! So if you like that you will prob like this one. 
-Rose Bourbon: hints of rose meshed with bourbon, exactly as it sounds. More so tasting the rose so rest assured if you don't like bourbon. 

::Jasmine Green Tea Roll Cake ~$4.50: green tea roll cake encompassing jasmine ice cream in the center (honestly did not know it was ice cream until I put my spoon to scoop a piece). Very good overall flavors! The jasmine ice cream was not prominent in jasmine taste but the matcha was pretty strong. 

.:: Service/Ambiance ::.
Cashiers were nice. Got all the goods within 3 minutes. However, one complaint is that she gave me the ""Beauty"" roll cake that was broken where the macaron was squished in, but it's like giiirrrll, you see me with my DSLR and u gonn play me like that? But I told her it was smooshed and asked for another one and she did give me a better one. 
Ambiance was cutesy. Very limited seating as many mentioned. About 4 small tables that fit only 2."
616,besfren-new-york,2020-02-16,2.0,Came here for dessert after trying unsuccessfully to get cheesecake at Keki's next door (everything was sold out). I got a cup of the matcha soft serve (opted not to swirl it with the ube) for a little over $5 after tax and was pretty disappointed. The ice cream was more sweet than matcha-tasting. The tea flavor was too light. There was also a giant hollow hole in the middle of my swirl. There are about ten seats in the seating area.
616,besfren-new-york,2019-12-23,5.0,"All I got was the taro latte, but that's all I needed.

It was very very yummy. Taro in my opinion is a very hard flavor to get right but they got it right here. It does not taste artificial.

Walked to the shop the next day to get another.  I'd go out of my way to be able to swing by and get another the next time I'm in New York

The shop is very small but has some seating available, was not busy either time I stopped by. Service was fast and friendly.

The pastries did not look appealing to me. But next time I'm in the city, I would like to try the soft serve matcha. (I had just had some not even 30 minutes prior and couldn't bring myself to order another - it looked very yummy though!)"
616,besfren-new-york,2019-11-19,5.0,"After having lunch in NY, I was craving some ice cream so I found this place near our hotel. It was a swirl with half matcha and half taro and priced around $5 from what I remember. It was more than enough, I remember not being able to finish it.

We got their taro and matcha soft serve and it was really good! It comes in a pretty big portion for the cost so it's good to share as well. The matcha flavor was not too sweet or bitter and I also loved the taro flavor. However, I felt like it was a bit too sweet for me after the first few bites.

This place is also pretty tiny and only as a few tables since it's combined with a beauty/ ginseng store right next to it."
616,besfren-new-york,2020-01-16,4.0,"I only bought the matcha taro soft serve, and it was good. The taro was really smooth and creamy, while the matcha was more subtle. The dessert, overall, was not too overwhelmingly sweet, which was a major plus. I would have preferred if the matcha flavor was stronger because I thought the taro can become overpowering after a while such that you don't really recognize the matcha flavor. There was a flower that also added to the pleasing presentation of the ice cream.

This shop was very small and had a couple of small tables and chairs. It was a bit cramped since the shop also shared its spot with a ginseng vendor. I came Thursday evening (7-8ish) and I managed to snag a table after a customer had left, but if the store had more customers, I would probably not be able to get a seat. The service was fast and friendly. I would love to see the cafe expand to a larger area because lots of people would love to sit down and enjoy the food, yet there was not much space to work with. I think I might return to try the other items; for a shop in ktown, it's pretty decently priced for its portion size (soft serve only), so I would recommend people to come and check it out!"

So cute, so insta-worthy, so delicious!"

There were a few matcha drinks available, and the only espresso option was drip coffee. I was surprised that they didn't have any espresso options. The coffee was lukewarm and not very good for a ~$3.75 price tag. I tried a green tea cake roll (1 of 3 flavors) which was $7 and overpriced for what it was. It wasn't bad, but it was a pretty average pastry that you can get for much cheaper in the nearby K-town. 

I haven't had the lunch combo, but I'm definitely curious about it and may be back to try it. My friend tried one of the rice rolls and said it was pretty average.

It's perfect for those who seek rest, a place to write, or catch up with friends. No loud music. Clean, quaint, and a place to rejuvenate.

I ordered green tea latte and a dinner combo of rice balls, appetizer, salad, and soup. The green tea latte was dense with flavor and uplifting to drink. The rice balls were pre-made and displayed on the counter so I worried how long rice balls have been sitting, but they were fresh and delicious even though they were small. I didn't expect to feast on a heavy meal. The hawaiian and sweet potato were the highlights.

There is no wifi in this cafe. I'd figure it's a good thing. Come not to eat, but rather to relax and enjoy a conversation with friends. This cafe is a hidden gem of peace and rest in a city that never sleeps."

The food was underwhelming and pricey for what it was worth. The onigiri rice balls were on the smaller side, which really didn't bother me, but were also incredibly bland - I couldn't really tell which was which because both just tasted like slightly-oiled rice. I'm so used to the delicious onigiri with generous amount of fillings from Harper's Bread House that this just subpar in comparison. The two sides were so small - think dipping sauce/condiment cups instead of ramekins and tasted okay. The soup was the only thing that was good. 

Overall, nice environment and cute presentation if you're into Instagram. The dinner set is not worth it, and there are better places for onigiri like the one suggested above."

The spam musubi was sooooooo good. The rice had tomato in it which I thought was so unique. It really added to the flavor. The unagi was a little disappointing. I didn't see enough unagi. Everything tasted pretty healthy but who knows.

The matcha roll cake was soooo good. I love the light roll cake and matcha cream. Mmmm~

It filled us up and was just enough but it is pricy because we paid about $27 for that. It filled us up for church but after an hour or so I got really hungry again. But I do think they use quality ingredients and I def want to try other things here. I love the aesthetic of the place."

The rice balls are incredibly small and you also have to pay $1 extra if you get a premium one. The flavors weren't all that great -- they just tasted healthy and didn't have much flavor to it. The miso soup was slightly sour..? And i didn't care for the sides (i got some sort of root vegetable and okra with a really sticky sesame paste).

Colombe. However, I am basically in love with the matcha roll cake, and will probably be pining for one again in about three days. I am a notorious matcha fiend and this thing did not disappoint- light and fluffy with enough matcha flavor and the right amount of sweetness. The coffee and matcha roll came to like $12, which is kiiiinda pricey, but when for me when it comes to matcha desserts, money is no object.

(One of these days I'll go back and try the omusubi. Maybe. After I tire of the matcha roll. Which will take a while.)"

I opted for lunch combo. The portion was perfect for me, two rice balls, two sides, and large bowl of miso soup. The soup was nice, not too salty and good amount of things inside, mostly tofu. The sides, okura with miso & sesame(?) and Kinbira gobo were good as any Japanese sides in a bento box. 

It is a perfect spot to catchup and spend a good time with your friends. I saw several of them, mostly girls, or couples. And some solo with a laptop. It is a charming place with a solid Japanese food. I will definitely come back to try for a tea with some sweets next time."

Pros:
- So beautiful inside
- Very friendly employees 
- Plenty of tables, and they're clean 
- Relatively quiet so you can definitely get work done here but not a lot of plugs
- Really good onigiri - extremely flavorful but really small

Cons:
- Very pricey"
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-08-10,3.0,"Maybe it's because a lot of my friends hyped this place up but I was pretty underwhelmed. There are a decent number of seats and wifi is provided so you could even get work done here if you want. It's also aesthetic so you can take a nice picture #forthegram 

My sister and I split the lunch combo which comes with 2 omusubi (we got sukiyaki and pork chashu), 2 veggie sides (you get to choose one--we chose spinach with miso dressing), and a miso soup of your choice (we chose tofu and tofu). Nothing was amazing, so for $15 I thought it was kinda pricey and not worth it.

Service was also kinda eh... like it would have been nice if the person taking our order recommended something or told us what was popular since it was our first time here.

I don't think I would come back here or recommend this place to anyone."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2020-02-27,5.0,"A rare find in Manhattan. This little shop transports you to another world. From the decorations to the cute plating to the delicious lunch special, this cafe is truly an experience. maybe it's because onigiri is a comfort food for me. Or maybe because I just love cute lunch special. But I quickly fell in love with this place!"
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-06-01,4.0,"A cute cafe close to Penn station! Definitely the most aeathetically pleasing, wholesome, delicious spot in the area. The plant walls and art make it such a cute place to spend some time. 

We got a mushroom and spam rice ball - the last two remaining (it was around 6:30PM) and chose the miso soup with tofu and edamame as sides. The rice balls were cute and tasty, though a bit small. The soup was large and filling. Overall, definitely a bit pricey for the amount of food, but for a nice healthy meal before a train trip out of the city, it was perfect."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-05-22,4.0,"Cute little cafe! I got a sweet potato rice ball and the green tea roll cake. Both were not too sweet or salty, so I could probably eat five of each before feeling sick. Also because they were way smaller than expected. 

The staff was very friendly!"
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2020-03-06,4.0,"Fairly cheap lunch special - really enjoyed trying several different omusubi options (the yuzu was a surprise favorite when compared to the sweet potato, hawaiian and chashu). The salad and veggies the special comes with as sides were actually pretty good - would skip the dashi."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-10-27,5.0,"The lunch combo is a steal, given the quality of the onigiri! Prior to this, I only had onigiri from the supermarket and I was amazed by the selection here. The combo was $15 and included 2 onigiri, 1 miso soup, a side of Japanese pickles, and a side of your choice. I had the tofu miso soup, sweet potato and unagi onigiri, and glass noodles.The unagi was my favorite; the eel was so flavorful and tender! The rice in all the onigiri was amazing, perfectly sticky and textured with other kinds of grains/seeds. I highly recommend the glass noodles as a side too. The meal looks small, but I was full! The cafe itself is beautiful, with tons of natural light. It would be a great spot to spend a few hours working in."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-10-30,3.0,"I will never get used to the fact that some cafes in NY don't have wifi!! But understandable. I'm not docking any points because of this, but certainly sucked to have realized it after buying something from them. 

Their menu in general didn't have too many actual coffee options. They didn't have normal lattes or Americano, but they did have normal brewed coffee. If not,it was some kind of matcha infused drink. I got their matcha Americano but the lady was saying there was ""no actual Americano"" in it????? Guess she wasn't wrong because when I tasted it, it literally was just water and matcha. A major disappointed seeing that it was nearly $5 for it. Also why name a drink with the word Americano but has no coffee? I was just confused by that whole drink.

They did have cute onigiri options but they were around $4-5 each for a rice ball the size of a baby's palm. I didn't think it would be worth it, but it looked delicious. Should have tried those instead of the drink. 

The decor was cute but I think they can utilize the wall a bit more. It seemed a bit plain to me."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2020-02-10,4.0,"Came in for a light dinner on a Saturday night. They still had a good selection of onigiri so I decided to get the wakame and chashu. They were quite flavorful and I enjoyed both of them. My friend got the coffee jelly, as she had been craving coffee jelly, and really enjoyed it. Bonus: if you pay a dollar or so extra you can take their dessert mason jars to go. I definitely want to come back to try more of their onigiri and also get the tamago pudding."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-04-27,4.0,"Came here for a small lunch and got the kinoko and wakame omusubi along with a green tea roll cake. The omusubis were mixed well so I didn't feel like I was only eating rice with every bite. The green tea roll cake was fluffy and had a good amount of matcha flavor. The omusubis weren't huge, but I wasn't super hungry so this combo filled me up.

A downside of this place is their bathroom is super janky. There's no lock so you have to flip a sign that says ""occupied"" and hope that a jerk doesn't barge in while you're peeing.

Overall, I would be back for more omusubi and green tea cake rolls if I was in the area and wanted light bites."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2020-03-15,5.0,"I love the onigiri! It's really good and I come here before class sometimes on days that's I have later classes for breakfast and some quiet study time
The cafe usually has a decent amount of seating when I get there 
There's no wifi though :((((( I'm not too upset about it though, considering it gets me to actually do my work"
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-10-17,3.0,"Visited here with a friend in the late afternoon and had an okay, but underwhelming experience. The café itself is very cute with thoughtful, decorative touches permeating the establishment, and it is decently crowded. While the service was not particularly memorable, and we felt the pricing was rather much for a small lunch meal, I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the easygoing atmosphere and aesthetic of the place and plating presentation. 

The food itself was not very filling and had a very light, bland taste to it--something felt lacking. My favorite part of my lunch combo was actually the canned matcha drink. The next time I am in the area, I will explore other options. However, if you are in need of a quick, simple lunch in the area and do not mind it being expensive, this place might be for you!"
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-08-22,3.0,"Growing up Japanese in the US meant my mom would pack my lunchboxes with onigiri, or rice balls as they're called in english. I got made fun of for having black (seaweed) covered rice in elementary and middle school, so it makes me happy to see a place like this have clientele of all backgrounds who obviously have accepted the type of food my peers did not back in the 90s/00s. I was excited to try this place because of those feelings. 

My friend and I came here for a snack and split the riceball combo, which comes with two balls, side of veggies (your choice), pickles and a miso soup. For the riceballs my friend chose unagi (eel), and the sweet potato. This came out to just around $15. For something that cost that much, there was really only one piece of eel in the unagi onigiri. It was underwhelming overall but good if you work in the area and need a light lunch."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-02-03,3.0,"Hanamizuki Cafe is an aesthetic cafe in NYC.

When you enter the cafe, you get to seat yourself down. There's music playing. It is very cozy, and is a nice place to get some work done and to catch up with friends. Plus, there's a bathroom at the back of the cafe.

I came here with my friend for lunch before watching a movie. My friend got the Cha-Shu Pork Omusubi ($4.25) and Unagi Omusubi ($5.25). I, also, got the Cha-Shu Pork Omusubi and Suki-Yaki Omusubi ($4.25).

The Cha-Shu Pork Omusubi was filled with cha-shu pork, fried egg, scallion, and bamboo shoots. The Unagi Omusubi was filled with unagi-eel, white sesame, and pickled san pepper that was wrapped with bamboo leaf. The Suki-Yaki Omusubi was filled with Japanese premium beef, burdock root, konjac, and scallions.

The Cha-Shu Pork Omusubi and Suki-Yaki Omusubi were very small for the price and eating two rice balls did not fill my stomach. The cha-shu pork in the Cha-Shu Pork Omusubi was very dry and I preferred the Suki-Yaki Omusubi over the Cha-Shu Pork Omusubi. The Suki-Yaki Omusubi was flavorful."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2020-01-13,4.0,"Super cute cafe, nice date spot and a really good place to work as well during less crowded times (don't think there's any WiFi though). I got the set with an unagi ball and a suki yaki ball -- both were fine, nothing spectacular. It was super filling though! Matcha americano was good -- naturally overpriced like all matcha drinks in NYC. 

Would come back to try more of the other menu items!"
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2020-03-01,4.0,Stopped by due to its cute decoration. I liked the green tea roll cake but felt like it was a bit overpriced (7 USD!!!!!). Staffs are friendly. I'll see if I can stop by again to try their lunch set.

It's worth to visit here."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2018-12-09,4.0,"Nice ambiance and polite staff! Came here for lunch and got the lunch special with 2 omusubis with a side and soup for $15. I tried the unagi and Hawaiian. Unagi has the eel inside the middle and Hawaiian is similar to a spam masubi. They were a decent size. But the price is a bit high, about 5 bucks for each. But the combo is a good deal! It was a light lunch, but I was full.
The staff was really pleasant and there were a lot of seating when I was there. Beautiful music in the background. Not much of a cafe shop as they had coffee from colombe and not really their own. Lots of tea options though. It was a good quiet place. Would recommend trying it."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-05-20,4.0,"I needed to get work done and popped in here as I was craving the Japanese green tea roll.  Upon walking in it's a mix between slightly Anthropologie decor and Victorian influence with the plants that are displayed like taxidermy in the glass bottles.  

The service was very good and in addition to the green tea roll I ordered the Passion Mate tea w/ sugar.  I wasn't hungry, but saw that they offered Japanese bites.  There is ample seating, but on a weekend I can see it getting packed.  They have WiFi and a bathroom to use also.  The green tea roll is slightly high for the price, but was worth it for that time being.  If you don't sit at the tables, there are areas with high seats and an area where you can place your items."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-07-15,3.0,"It was alright. The rice balls were well seasoned but I wasn't blown away. I wish the cashier was a little more welcoming when we were trying to figure out what to order as it was our first visit to the cafe. 

We ended up getting the lunch combo set for $15 (a bit pricey tbh) which came with two rice balls (hawaiian and sukiyaki), tofu miso soup, and noodles. We also added an extra rice ball (cha-shu pork). The total came out to be around $21 for the lunch combo and extra rice ball because of the extra fees for the premium rice balls."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-07-27,4.0,"Very instagrammable place! Everything was cute, succulents everywhere, very chill vibe. My friend and I got the green tea roll, he got the sushi wrap, and I got the lavender chamomile tea. Pricing could be better, kinda overpriced in my opinion. My friend didn't like the sushi wrap because they used brown rice. The roll was good and not sweet and filling. The tea was refreshing. Service was super nice and friendly, bathroom was clean too which is a plus. I wouldn't mind coming here again, but it's not my first choice."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,"Every single time I hop off the Megabus, I dash to this cafe...for the one and only best Matcha Cream cake!!! I absolutely love their cake. 10/10 quality!"
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-06-05,5.0,"I wish I was in this area more to come visit often! One of my favorite lunch spots for solo days or a peaceful lunch with a friend. The interior is open and cozy and might even be nice to do some work at. I ordered the Lunch Combo, which consists of two rice balls, soup, a side, and pickles. I had the Sukiyaki and Hawaiian rice balls, both uniquely flavorful and still moist. The Tofu & Tofu Soup was hot and soothing, brimming full of tofu and seaweed. It feels like a light lunch, but it really fills you up and makes you enjoy the variety of everything on you plate."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2018-10-24,5.0,"I came on a rainy Tuesday evening to grab a quick dinner with a friend and do some work. The interior is super cozy, but it can get quite loud when it's full. Otherwise, the music is very ambient, and it's a great place to get work done when it's a little more empty.

I was hoping to get one of their specials, but unfortunately, they only had one omusubi left, which is a testament to how good the food is! I got the hawaiian omusubi and the kinoko miso soup. The rice ball was well seasoned and the tomato mixed in with the rice was a surprisingly nice pairing. The soup was also very broth-y and just what I needed on a chilly night. I definitely will be returning to try out other things! 

I was still a little hungry after the rice ball and the soup, so I treated myself to the matcha cake. It was absolutely delicious!! The cake wasn't too dry or too moist, and the cream inside was just sweet enough, but not overly sweet."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-11-10,2.0,"Honestly I had pretty high hopes for this cafe but the food was only mediocre. My friend and I both got the lunch combo - two onigiris, a miso soup of your choice, and one side dish (tiny). 

We got there around 2:30 PM and most of the rice balls we wanted were sold out so we had to opt for the other choices. If they tasted great, that would have been fine, but it did not leave me wanting more at all. Instead, I struggled to finish my rice balls. The miso soup and side dishes were also only mediocre. Last but not least, the lunch combo was $15 - not too much but... did I mention that I struggled to finish my food?

I left the cafe with an excited appetite and left without any at all sadly."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2018-10-03,4.0,"This is a really soothing spot in an otherwise pretty crap area, with classical music, and twinkling lights, and white, worn-in furniture. It feels like an upstate cafe that just happens to be in the design district and sell rice balls. 

Now, to the rice balls.

The beef one with scallions and burdock root is, by far, the best. Crunchy, hearty, just the right amount of oil, perfect. 

The unagi eel rice ball was just so-so - there is some kind of citrusy ingredient, I think the pickled pepper, that overpowers all other flavors, so it tastes like the rind of an orange.

Next time, I'll try one of their matcha cookies and the mushroom-zucchini rice ball, along with the beef."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2018-09-15,4.0,"Caught up with a friend here over coffee and found this cute spacious well light cafe. Limited drink options so I just got the ice coffee. Some desserts were sold out when I was there late afternoon so I chose the green tea cake and a sesame cookie. I liked the cake but the cookie was dry. They had rice balls to which I would like to try next time. 

Overall would recommend for a spot to chat over coffee and light snacks."
617,cafe-hanamizuki-new-york,2019-03-21,4.0,"This place has a lovely calming atmosphere. It feels like such a lovely little respite from the hustle of the city, it's open and bright and warm even on the dreariest days! 

If you come here during the lunch hour expect a crowd! It fills up fast and people don't move too quickly through their meals (not that I blame them by any means). 

There is a great little lunch special that gets you two rice balls, a miso soup of your choice, their side of the day and pickles. It's a totally filling combo, and you get to try so many exciting flavors. 

The rice balls are obviously the star of the cafe. There's so many different flavors and they're all delicious. They do run out as the day wears on, but all the choices are pretty good so you can't really go wrong. The premium ones especially are great. 

I didn't love that miso was the only soup option, they do have 3-4 miso options but at the end of the day, miso is still miso. It's just not my favorite and wish there was just one other option or a small salad you could substitute. 

Lunch is right around $15 which is totally fair for the quality! Overall I definitely recommend!!"

I went back today and got the espresso with milk--soy because I'm actually a lactose intolerant person, but they also have oat milk and regular dairy.

You can even top off your beverage with Oatly and sugar in the raw.

I've also tried the straight up espresso and it's just amazing.  These guys know what they're doing.  For serious coffee peeps.

Don't know how they made it but it was rich and creamy, perfect just the way it was, one of the best lattes I ever had with the latte art. Very impressive.

Ninth Street Espresso is located in Chelsea Market in lower Manhattan where there are many places to eat, drink and shop. When I ordered our lattes the Barista knew exactly what he had to do to make our perfect lattes, quick and efficient. If you are in the area I highly suggest checking out this coffee spot, you will be pleasantly pleased."

I usually add sugar to most but this is one cup that rolls down my tongue so well with no sugar at all. It is nice and hot sometimes a line but it moves quickly. The only problem is there is only a little seating near the indoor fountain on  a shaped cement bench  or some scattered seating around th market, but this is the best when taken to go to explore cup in hand all the shopping and maybe a dessert  at one of the many places in the market to get chocolate , brownies cookies, pastries, yummy!"

618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2016-06-20,4.0,"Location/Accessibility : Right in the middle of Chelsea Market.  Very easy to get to! Just a short walk from the ACE and L trains, then just an avenue further from the 123.

Ambience : This place doesn't have it's own seating area, but you'll be able to find various seating options while walking throughout the market.  Definitely has the market vibe.  Pretty simple, but nicely decorated nonetheless.  Very much of a grab and go place.

Service : Greeted with a smile. That's always a nice start!  There are 4 things on their menu, very simple.  However, lattes were not.  While one might assume that they would and could make lattes, but, you never know.  So, I asked, and the man behind the counter ever so warmly said, ""Well, of course!""  The drink came out really quickly, another plus that is always welcomed.
*Good to know : Cash Only (if you haven't already read it elsewhere!)*

Drink : I ordered a 12oz latte, which was $4.  Interestingly enough, they have 4 sizes, but they were all the same price.  The only difference was the amount of milk - the same amount of espresso would be in each size regardless.  While I like espresso, I very much like a lot of milk in my drinks and try to make them last as long as possible, so the 12oz was the way to go.  The drink came with a nice latte art heart, perfect temperature (hot enough but not so hot that it needed the sleeve to carry), and was very smooth.  Good flavor, although I was expecting much more considering others' reviews.  To be fair, the flavor MAY have been drowned out by the milk since I got a 12oz.  

Didn't quite live up to the hype, but good stuff regardless!"
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2015-10-03,5.0,"Came here to Chelsea Market during the day on a weekday and decided to check out Ninth Street Espresso. Holy Moly, this was one of the best espressos I've ever had in my entire life. It was so nice to enjoy this liquid gold when Chelsea Market was almost empty and not crazy hectic busy like it is on the weekends. I even had a bench to sit on!

The menu only has three items - brewed coffee (house/iced), espresso and espresso with milk. It's very simple but that is all they need. I decided to order the espresso with milk and the barista did some amazing foam art on the top. Every sip tasted better and better. I was actually quite sad when I was done drinking it and was really contemplating on buying another one.  

It's rare to go to a coffee shop and get a coffee without adding extra milk, creamer, sugar in it. Everything here is made so beautifully you don't need anything extra. The aroma and richness of the coffee is just perfect!

FYI - this place is cash only."

After a short run, I stopped by their small counter inside Chelsea market. 7am in the morning, there was no one but me, and certainly no line to get my dose. Got their most renown latte, and had my barista heartily poured a cute latte art for me.

1 star less because I usually like to drink my coffee while sitting down, read some books or newspaper. I cant do that at this place. I guess this place is where you get a cup of coffee drink it and go.

They use beans from Alphabet City (to be honest I never heard of this place before) and it was pretty darn good. They were serving Brazil that day and I could definitely taste the chocolate notes of the drink. I wasn't very impressed with some of the coffee joints I've had in New York but this place definitely did the job.

The barista was also really cool and I had a good time chatting it up with him. Sadly it's cash only so make sure to bring some cash if you're going to get a drink here."
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2018-03-25,5.0,"LOVE the minimal menu.  Hard to mess up coffee when you only serve 4 things.  

Can't go wrong with 2.75 coffee.  5/5 for me -  No BS. .  good stuff!"
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2016-12-27,4.0,"Pretty good espresso here my only complaint is the lack alternative milks. For someone lactose intolerant who doesn't drink soy, there isn't an option. While they had some nice simple syrup and sweetening options, not alternative milks. They made a solid espresso for sure, the baristas are very talented and I even got a heart in mine. This place gets busy but it's not too long of wait."
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2019-05-12,5.0,"Great coffee and friendly staff! They don't have much variety but the quality of coffee is excellent. I'm glad I went to this place instead of the Starbucks reserve around the corner. Although there is no seating in this place, the coffee makes up for it."
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2016-11-13,5.0,"The BEST latte I have ever had. Period. 

Milk was steamed perfectly. It wasn't too hot, too dense, it was just there. Perfectly. 

The espresso had a bold but complimentary flavor that was spot on. 

Bring your cash because it's worth it. Go to an ATM if you have to."
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2017-08-09,4.0,"I came here on a week day around noon, and the shop was empty. It's in a very convenient location in Chelsea market, you really can't miss it! Their prices are average, around the same all over New York. However, their sizes are a lot smaller. However, the coffees were delicious and came out quick!"
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2016-06-27,4.0,"Nothing too special but the iced coffee made the Chelsea market bareable and the staff was friendly. Also, they had soy milk out with all the dairy in insulated pitcher's.

CASH only.

Yea for coffee!"
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2018-10-27,5.0,Best extractions I have ever tasted. Simple experience. Simple menu. Simple craft. Awesome result. My taste buds definitely find this to be my most favorite coffee in NYC. Worth any wait I think.
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2016-11-03,4.0,"Standing room only espresso bar in Chelsea market. 

Four varieties of coffee - brewed, iced, espresso plus water and milk infused variations.

Service is quick and polite. Coffee is decently brewed, although I thought my 6oz long black tasted a tad watery. That said, roast is unique enough to sustain interest (tasted cereal, chocolate in my brew). 

Good for a quick Chelsea market pick me up!"
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2018-01-16,5.0,"I passed by a couple days ago and tried their coffee for the first time. I got an espresso with milk.

Best. Coffee. Ever.

Smooth, nutty, with wonderfully caramel-y notes. The ratio of milk to espresso was perfect and brought out the flavor of the espresso. Also there was no bitterness at all, which I found impressive. Love at first sip!"
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2018-02-28,5.0,Best coffee place in city!!! If your a coffee lover you have to go out of your way to have it. So excited just opened a new shop close to Penn. 221 W 29th betw 7th -8th.
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2016-04-18,3.0,"It is sometimes better that you experience something without expectation.  As we were walking through this magical Chelsea Market , out thirstiness    brought us to this place. Ordered their iced coffee, the barista simply delivered. Pricing   includes the coolness of its location.  No variety , no flavors , simply their trademark brand beans. The coffee tastes fine- excellent choices of sweeteners and creamers. Cash only. Standing room only. It stands out in the market , i think it is the only coffee shop."
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2016-11-22,4.0,"Yay, a non burnt delicious creamy latte! 

And with such a simple menu, there's no hiding bad coffee through advertising syrup laden drinks. It is cash only. No pastries, just coffee. This place is located in the Chelsea Market. It is on the side next to a set of elevators so no place to sit and chill, but a grab and go type of place. 

I ordered a simple latte and it came perfectly foamed with latte art. There is simple syrup on the side for you to add on the side but no shelves of Torani syrups which is a sign of confident coffee shop in my opinion."
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2017-06-16,3.0,"I don't fully understand the high reviews here... This was completely mediocre coffee. 

I stopped by Chelsea Market to grab tacos from Los Tacos No. 1 and decided to get a coffee from Ninth Street because it was so close to the taco location. I got a cold brew, which was small and cost $3.50, which is a little overpriced even compared to other coffee I've gotten in NY. The coffee tasted old, stale, and a little watery. I'm not a huge fan of Starbucks coffee, but I even prefer their coffee to Ninth Street. I'm glad the portion was so small so I could just throw it away."
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2016-01-22,3.0,"I'm sorry, but I just don't understand why people are going crazy for this place... Im not saying it's bad, but it really isn't something to rave about. 

I ordered a regular coffee and my boyfriend ordered an espresso shot. I loved my coffee, but that's just because I simply love coffee in general. It wasn't far off from Starbucks. My boyfriend orders espresso shots pretty often, but didn't like the one from here. 

If you happen to be walking around Chelsea Market, grabbing a coffee at Ninth Street Espresso isn't a bad idea! But I wouldn't recommend that you go out of your way for it."
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2018-03-08,2.0,"Maybe I got the wrong thing? I usually get an iced coffee when I need the pick me up, but the coffee here was just mediocre. It was pretty watery and didn't taste like much. The guy at the front end was really nice though."
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2017-11-26,5.0,"for the past few weeks i've been hitting this spot every weekday without fail. 
ninth street espresso never disappoints -- the staff are a lovely bunch of people, the coffee is fantastic, the non-dairy milks come at no extra cost, and they include tax IN the (reasonable) price stated on the (wonderfully minimalistic) menu!!! 
i've become so loyal to this golden nugget in the heart of chelsea market that most other places seem inadequate!"
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2018-09-04,5.0,Ninth Street Espresso is only coffee shop I continue to revisit whenever I' am in New York. They recently started a rewards program and I can't wait to return for their satisfying cup of coffee. Keep up the good work.
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2015-10-23,5.0,"This guys really have their espresso down right perfect, from the method of extraction to the coffee beans they use. All espressos are based in the tradition Italian espresso that's tends to be a little smoky and bitter. With today's great variety of coffees is becoming very difficult to find a very well balanced espresso. 

This guys have pulled it off. Their espresso is with hints of chocolate very low in acid and with bold earthy flavors. Almost like a traditional Italian but less smoky and bitter. 

                              EXCELLENT!"
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2019-02-04,5.0,"Refreshing: they serve coffee and espresso. Simple. Clean, well prepared. No BS. No hipster catitude either; friendly, smiled, pulled a good shot and on my way."
618,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-6,2016-01-08,5.0,Very no frills coffee shop with limited menu. I had the espresso with milk and it was superb. If you want to have a coffee and run this is the place.
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2020-03-12,5.0,"I am a softy for finding a good coffee shop so I was pretty excited to have come across this gem!

So adorably decorated, I think the servers could tell how excited I was just walking through the door. And then seeing the many options of coffee, lattes, milks, and pastries was cherry on the top. 

The Caramel Latte was so beautifully filled with oat milk leaving a gorgeous flower and leaf picture at the top. I am usually slow to drink hot beverages but I could not put this down. The flavors of the caramel and oat milk mixing together were so delicious I was ready to ask for another drink. 

Would highly recommend checking out this coffee shop and trying new mixes of flavors, coffees, lattes and pastries! It's also a great place to chill with friends."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2020-03-08,4.0,"I ordered the chai latte with oat milk. It was very sweet, which is not unusual for chai lattes. I would get it again if I was meeting someone there, but I wouldn't get a drink from there on my own. 

The baristas were very helpful in showing my ingredients and knowledge about the drinks. The vibe was nice, but there aren't many good spots unless you get there early. I went around 4-6 pm and stayed for a while. I would recommend this as a meeting spot!"
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2020-03-05,5.0,"Why am I giving 5 stars to a coffee place if I drink coffee, on average, only like 4 times a year? Because Culture Espresso is awesome. AND they have the only chai latte in midtown that doesn't hurt my sensitive tummy (and yes, I've tried all sorts of milk and milk alternatives. Oat is my current favorite.). I've been to two locations and this one is my favorite as it is the more spacious of the two. The service is great, they never balk at hippies like me bringing in reusable cups or accidentally (or ""accidentally"") put my order in a single-use cup, and it's super easy to get a drink to-stay as well. 

Back to the coffee - the only coffee I like is espresso. Proper, tiny espresso. Again, this is the only place in midtown I've found for my, albeit rare, espresso fix. It's the closest to Italy in vibe, too - you can roll up, grab your tiny coffee in an in-house cup, sip it down, and head on out. Perfetto. 

Oh, and DO I EVEN NEED TO MENTION THEIR CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES? If you haven't had them, they are life changing. Definitely indulge."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,"I went for the cookies and I'm hooked. They are soft, buttery, chocolatey and exactly what you need for a middle of a Midtown work day treat. And the coffee is delicious to boot! Really a can't miss."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-08-25,4.0,"Came for the coffee here yesterday, and had no regrets! The coffee was delicious. When I was paying my drink at the cashier, the other guy beside him told us that their cookie was something people swear by. SO I HAD TO TRY IT LOL. When I asked to add a chocolate chip cookie, this gentleman went inside and got me a freshly baked one. It was still warm!!! 

I shared it with my friend, and we both LOVED it. It was crunchy at the bottom and sides, and the inside was oozing with melted chocolate chips   Didn't have the time to take pictures of our order coz we were dying to try them, lol. 

Love the coffee, love the cookie, love the service! 


PS. They don't have a toilet. Just an fyi."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-08-31,5.0,"The cashier is very friendly. And it is a good spot for reading and study.

The menu is simple, not a lot fancy drinks, so for someone like me, I love these menu. 

Will definitely come back with my friends."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-12-16,1.0,"Better watch what you're being charged. I'm not one to hawk over itemized statements, but was purchasing a couple items for my boyfriend and me near closing time. The barista added an extra item and luckily I was paying attention because when the total is given, you don't see an itemized statement unless you get the receipt emailed to you.
Props on the eco friendly e-receipt, but think of how much of a pain in the ass it would be to get it refunded when you realize that after paying. 
Luckily I did notice he over charged me, made a comment, and he replied saying, as a joke (wasn't too funny), that he adds extra items onto late orders to pad the register at the end of the day. 

Didn't want to write this review, but I emailed culture at their email, and the owner or manager pitted it as a silly mistake. Doesn't really seem like one to me...but thought everyone should be aware to be wary of extra charges at this establishment."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-12-09,5.0,"One of my favorite midtown coffee places. They make espresso drinks that wake me up and taste good at the same time. The cookies are rich gooey, full or chocolate and almost have toffee overtones. And the coffee was exceptional, rarely have I been this happy with a cup outside of Europe. But the real compliment goes to the two gentlemen behind the counter. They were very engaging of every one of their customers. This place is one of my go to coffee shops when I'm in NYC. Definitely worth walking past Starbucks, etc to get to this place!!!"
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-12-12,4.0,"Culture is a nice little coffee & espresso spot just off 6th Ave.  Although about 100 feet from the noise and bustle of 6th, it is actually quite calm and peaceful inside.  It is a great place to take a break during the day for some caffeine.  The espresso is quite good and they have awesome cookies, too.  

One caution is that the space is not expansive, so don't come here with 10 co-workers and hope to find a seat."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-05-30,4.0,"No trip to NYC is complete without experiencing a little Culture.

Culture Espresso is a little coffee shop in Midtown.  I walked in around 9:30am on a weekday and the line wasn't bad.  But I did notice a steady flow of people after I ordered my Chai Latte ($4.75).

The inside is pretty small with just a few tables, an island in the center and counter top seating by the window.  If you can snag a seat, it's a cute place to enjoy your caffeine with the floral wallpaper and chandeliers on the ceiling.

Their menu of drinks is limited (it's definitely not Starbucks), but I enjoyed my chai latte.  It had a nice blend of spice and sweetness.   The chocolate chip cookies are supposed to be really good here, but it was early in the morning so I opted for a Berry Scone ($3) instead.  It was a little dry but fresh tasting and had a good amount of berries.  

I would stop by again if in the area and next time grab a cookie for sure."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-12-07,5.0,"We came here just before leaving NYC and because of that we had a lot of baggage with us. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of open floor space this places has. It's pretty unusual in NY.

Their coffee is very good and is one of the best I tried. Their vanilla latte was a perfect mixture of lightened sweetened with a good coffee kick. The texture was on point too!"
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,"Really wonderful coffee (I ordered a flat white with oat milk) and of course the chocolate chip cookie. How is this cookie even possible? I had it warm but even after it got cold, it still tasted warm due to the texture. The chocolate was still perfectly melty, and it was crunchy outside and chewy inside. I still can't stop thinking about this cookie, one of the best (if not the best) I have ever had. Please come to California, what am I going to do without you????? Anyone have a recipe dupe so I can satisfy my fix from afar?"
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-03-25,5.0,"Undoubtedly, one of the best chocolate chip cookies in NYC! It is that rare, perfect combination of crunchy exterior, chewy inside, and gooey, runny chocolate.
 
Great ratio of dough to chocolate chip (about 1:1). When you bite into it, your senses are overwhelmed with everything that's good in this life--crispy shell, soft & chewy dough, tons of melted chocolate. Seriously sinfully incredible.
 
Especially when warm, that cookie is as close to perfection as anything in this world can get! Recommend to warm it up a little if by the time you get to enjoy, the cookie has already cooled down.

Don't even want to imagine how many calories (or sugar) is in that confectionary delight. Shamefully admitting to eating the entire cookie by myself in one go. I didn't even feel it disappear in my mouth, that's how good it was! The size is larger than a standard cookie. Pretty hefty proportions and actually good for sharing (for those who can bring themselves to tear away from that heavenly manna). For $3, it's a steal! Especially for Midtown, where most desserts are double the price and mediocre at best.
 
Highly recommend to all sugar-holics and cookie enthusiasts out there!"
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2020-02-10,3.0,"The espresso is consistently under extracted thus sour. I returned 2 and eventually got a cappuccino. The croissants were appropriately priced but stale. 
They were nice to my dog that was in a bag. Not every coffee shop isn't like that. 
This place is ok in a pinch but wouldn't be an active choice."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-08-19,5.0,"I grabbed coffee with some interns as an afternoon break, and one of them suggested I should try the chocolate chip cookie because it is voted one of the best in New York City. I was skeptical because they looked normal, and I do not really have a sweet tooth, but I decided to splurge a little and try one. I thought I wanted to split the cookie with some people, but I actually consumed the whole thing without second thought. It was just so delicious: crunchy on the outside, melty chocolate inside. The cookie complements so well with the latte I got, and the latte itself has pretty good latte art; the latte art actually aligns with the logo of the cup, which is rarely the case in so many coffee shops. The place is pretty small, so in busy times, expect to get the items to-go. It just happens that the afternoon is less busy so we were able to grab a table and have a conversation."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-12-16,5.0,"If you see a Pink Panther sign outside where the panther's sipping on some coffee, you've come to the right spot! NYC Coffee scene is definitely on the map. This place didn't disappoint. I liked the cool cup art. I had a latte here and it was made surprisngly quickly. It tasted great. The menu is straight forward and offers most standard coffee shop items like small pastries, Americano, espresso, flat white, cortado, latte, cappuccino, etc. For add-on syrups, they have vanilla or maple. Seating inside is limited. They have high-bar areas and they're all communal. The cookies here looked yummy and really sugary but I didn't get a chance to try any. I had no idea they were voted amongst the best in NYC so that was a huge fail on my part! They sell their own beans and will ground them for you if you like. They had two types of beans for sale. They have 3 locations and you can even go online to pre-order your drink/food in advance if you want to save time."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-12-31,3.0,"I would have overlooked the fact that the almond milk in my latte tasted burnt, but considering how unfriendly the baristas were to me that morning, I don't want to forgive them. We stopped in hoping to grab something quick that would warm us up from the nippy December air outside and were treated with an attitude that left us colder. The coffee wasn't anything to write home about either. There are probably a hundred other places I'd try before returning to this corner coffee stop."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2020-01-12,4.0,"I come here decently often for a cup of coffee/to do some light work (It is a bit too loud for serious work.) Everything here is good quality, the workers are nice. The cookies are really good, although I still wouldn't say they trump Levain's. The chai latte is good as well."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-02-01,5.0,"They advertise their coffee but the real treat here is their chocolate chip cookies. They're big, thick and loaded with chocolate chips. Crispy on the outside yet soft and gooey on the inside. In my eyes the perfect cookie (sorry Levain!). I'm a purist when it comes to chocolate chip and these don't have nuts (yay!). Just need a glass of milk to wash it down...

Customer service is great too. I placed an order and paid for 10 cookies, but only ended up with 8. They offered to refund the 2 missing cookies or have me go back and get 2. So I went back and I was going to pay for 2 additional but the manager gave me 2 on the house for my trouble (so I ended up with 4 cookies - totally made my day!)."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2020-01-12,3.0,The seating was a bit small and the place was a bit hard to actually find. The cookies looked great and I almost got one. I order just a black drip coffee which was a bit underwhelming. It just wasn't strong enough for my taste.
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-07-03,5.0,"I love Heart coffee. While Culture is an excellent choice for commuter since it's relatively close to Penn Station, anyone who is walking by should also stop in. If not just for the cookies.

The baristas are awesome, well trained, and pour some excellent oat milk. I love that all of the locations smell like cookies all day long (but did I say there are home made, baked-daily cookies?)

Culture Espresso purchases wind energy to offset their carbon which is awesome to see local businesses commit to reducing their footprint. These locations are really neighborhood gems that care about their city and the quality they are able to bring.

Yum- go here."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-12-13,5.0,"Two different people told me that the chocolate chip cookie is better then Levain chocolate chip cookies, so of course I had to try them. Went in on a Thursday afternoon around 3pm and it was buzzing. There was a short line but it moved quickly. There is some indoor seating but it's not a good place to do work because is pretty loud and crowded. You pay first and receive your order. They do take credit card. It's close to Bryant Park so you could certainly order some cookies ahead online and then enjoy them in the park. The cookies were very large and thinner than Levain's. It's very decadent and the middle is almost completely filled with chocolate. It's crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. It's $3.50 a cookie which I thought was very reasonably priced. There's coffee available as well and alternative milk options (including oat milk). Overall I really do like the cookies (they're award winning!) and I really enjoyed how tasty they were."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-03-28,4.0,"If you're looking for a place to do some work or chat with friends, it probably wouldn't be a good spot with the lack of space this spot has to offer. BUTTTT this cafe is great if you're looking for the perfect cookie and latte. 

Drip coffee here is another average cup of Joe, but does the trick for you if you need a little pick me up. Chai Latte and hot chocolate are great to help you feel warm and fuzzy. The cookies here are definitely worth trying! Don't dodge it. It's perfectly crispy on the outside but gooey and soft in the middle. It honestly may be one of the best cookies I've had ever and well worth every $3 spent!

Service is phenomenal too! They're super friendly, quick and skilled at what they're doing! Highly recommend!"
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-06-05,5.0,Just get the chocolate chip cookie and die happy. So much better than Levains. Buttery goodness. Also they made a little design in my sons hot Chocolate which made him over the moon.
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-05-19,4.0,This was a great little coffee shop. I had the iced latte with homemade vanilla and man it was yummy. The maple flavor was on point as well in the second drink ordered. We visited around 4 and unfortunately they only had oatmeal cookies left so I wasn't able to try the cookies (not worth it if it's not chocolate chip) which was a bummer but no biggie. I would return if I can.
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-05-28,5.0,"If you're looking to pick up a cup of joe and a cookie, this is a great little coffee destination. I came on a Saturday afternoon to do some work, and it was pretty full when I arrived. I sat at their island bar, which was sufficient, but as people left I was able to relocate to a small table and enjoyed the rest of my time here. 

I love Culture's vibe, which was why I stayed as long as I did. The baristas were both really friendly, too. I had a delicious latte here and got a lot of work done while enjoying my coffee and the livelihood of the city through the big window."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-05-07,5.0,"Love the hip ambience, cool baristas, coffee and the location. The place is small with like 2-3 small tables and an island bar so it's not a good place to sit down and talk. People will hit you walking by left and right. It's more of a pick up and go place and surprisingly, it's not too busy in the morning or even if they are busy, their wait is bearable and they serve coffee quickly. 

I like their flat white and latte. Sometimes when I want something sweet, I add maple syrup to the latte. It's fantastic. I also recently tried getting latte with oat milk which seems like the next big thing after the era of soy and almond milk. I actually became a huge fan. It's oatty and heavy so some may not like it but it's good for the morning on the empty stomach. I didn't really like their mocha or hot chocolate as it was too light for me.

I never realized their cookies were famous. But reading all the reviews here, I'm definitely trying their chocolate chip cookie next time I visit."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-09-10,5.0,"They have the right espresso machine (Strada), the right coffee (Heart), and the right vibe (unpretentious). If you're an espresso drinker, you've found the right spot -- which is no small feat in NYC. Also the gluten free peanut butter cookie was fantastic. I dig this place. I'll be back."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-11-13,5.0,"I stopped in for a coffee to go. I ordered a cortado, which was delicious! The place was quite crowded and seem to be a popular hang out spot. The cups were cute and the staff were very friendly. I will definitely return if and when I am in the area. Only complaint is that someone had been sitting on a stool by the lids in stores, making it difficult to get these supplies for myself."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2020-02-28,3.0,"Chocolate chip cookie is SO GOOD, but just buy it and leave.  The people who hang out here are the literal worst."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-01-18,5.0,"I'm not a chocolate cookie kind-of person.. when there's free cookies out anywhere, I tend to pass.. actually I'm not even a carb-kind of person.

Which surprises me to say that I've been thinking about Culture's chocolate chip cookies for the past 2 weeks since I first discovered them. Best. Cookie. EVER.  Caramely and crisp on the outside, gooey and not overly cakey on the inside. WOW. I didn't even know they sold cookies here, I was in the area looking for a study spot with oat milk lattes and Culture popped up. But from the moment you walk in, the smell of fresh baked cookies is so undeniable, I just had to indulge and get a cookie. Best decision of the week.

Part of what made me fall in love with their cookies was that I did not expect to find such a magnificent cookie, so.. I apologize if I'm hyping this up for some of you and ruining the experience. With that said, still a great cookie. Better than Levain's in my opinion."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-02-23,5.0,"They make a wonderful chai latte here.
The freshly baked cookies are really delicious and makes for a great afternoon pick me up treat.

The foot traffic here gets pretty busy so not really an ideal place to sit down and get work done."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2020-03-02,5.0,"The best coffee I have ever had.  What is the secret of achieving this degree of flavorful?  Truly spectacular coffee.  And get this: Their baked-on-the-spot chocolate chip cookie was voted 'best chocooate chip cookie in New York City' a couple years ago. It's a great, great cookie.  And the things you can't help overhearing in this place are yet another reason to havva cup here.  The other day it was serious comedy writers working hard at the corner window table...a few days later it was a wacky job interview that had me painfully suppressing laughter for half an hour.  If only the comedy writers had been there to overhear the job interview they could have taken the rest of the day OFF!  See you there."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-02-28,3.0,"Culture Espresso is a really interesting little coffee shop in midtown! I walked in and was surprised to hear tons of emo music playing; it was definitely very nostalgic.

There are tons of people coming in and out at all times so it's not an ideal spot to sit and work or meet up with friends for a while over a cup of coffee. The coffee itself is pretty decent, nothing to write home about but not terrible. I'd definitely come again if I was in the area but not go out of my way for it.

The baristas were pretty friendly, but when I came they were having a lot of trouble with the wifi and it couldn't connect, which is why I wanted to come there in the first place. Not too sure how common of an occurrence that is but I would hesitate to come back if I need wifi for something while I drink."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-11-22,4.0,This is a very good spot to get out of the rain or meet a friend for a few minutes. The coffee is pretty good and great service! I'll be coming back soon!
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-12-27,4.0,"Great coffee shop for when I'm in this area.  Great cookies and talented baristas.  The baristas aren't super friendly, though. Don't expect a warm welcome.  Just a great latte."
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-06-28,5.0,Came here for the first time while visiting New York City. I ordered an iced americano and added oat milk and it was delicious!
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-02-09,4.0,"Such a cute lil spot for all of y'all that are swearing you're going to finish your screenplay in 2019. The staff is super sweet and the drinks and food are great. I've had an iced coffee, hot cocoa, and a chocolate chip cookie that would make Willy Wonka rethink his chocolate recipe. The hot cocoa is more savory than you would think, but paired with something sweet, I found it super enjoyable. I don't have a crazy sweet tooth so I was pleasantly surprised when this hot cocoa didn't over power me in the sugar. There is probably room for 10 people to sit in here max, so if you're serious about finishing that novel, you better get in there early and catch that cute booth in the corner. Small, but very comfy and cute!"
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-03-08,5.0,"Beautiful cafe with great customer service and a delicious variety of pastries. 

Our party of 3 sat down for a quick breakfast on a busy Tuesday morning. We were lucky enough to have gotten a table because as we sat and sipped our coffees, the cafe quickly filled up with patrons. 

Definitely would recommend!"
619,culture-espresso-new-york,2019-08-02,5.0,"One of my favorite places to go for a cold brew or a flat white. I love how they make designs with the foamed milk. I also love that their coffee and espresso is delicious and that they offer a wide variety of dairy and non dairy options. On a cheat day, I will grab a delicious cookie or almond croissant. They literally have the best treats. They also have a rewards system where you get your 11th coffee free"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2020-03-02,5.0,Came Saturday AM and had an americano and a gluten free coffee cake. Both were excellent  and service was quick and friendly. There are many places to sit in the cafe and the vibe was welcoming and chill. Highly recommend!
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2020-02-11,3.0,"It's a small, simply coffee shop with all the basics ... overpriced standard coffee, standard muffins and  so-so noshes. Bottled water. Three or four tiny tables.

Service is quite lovely, which is a nice surprise for Chelsea. And, it's convenient, whether you're at work, the LGBT Center, on the way to the subway or trying to avoid another (ugh) Starbucks run.

There's nothing overly unique or special. It's just simple, easy and there.

No WiFi. Nothing gourmet. No surprising finds. But, that's Chelsea too."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-08-16,5.0,"If you're around Flatiron/Madison Square Park area and willing to walk a few blocks, Birch Coffee is a pretty good spot for coffee. There's a decent amount of seating (although it was kinda busy on a Friday late morning), and a bathroom. Since they don't have wifi, I think this would be a better place to read a book or catch up with friends than to get work done.

Service is pretty friendly and efficient! My friend and I got flat whites (with oat milk for me). It was smooth, creamy, and had no bitterness that I sometimes taste with coffee from other shops.

Birch also has locations throughout NYC and offers a punch card so if you go to all their locations you can get free gear. I'm a pretty big fan of the Flatiron location though so I'm not sure if I would do that. Overall I would recommend Birch!"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-07-21,5.0,"I absolutely loved my morning at Birch Coffee. I got a dirty chai that was perfect. The shot of the espresso melted within the chai and no flavor was overpowering but mixed well. Will be back for more!

Also the hot drinks are cute with a ""Hello, my name is..."" and they write your name to add a personal touch. 10/10 service and very chill vibes."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-05-01,5.0,"Wow. Been here twice, and it did not disappoint. Really good cappuccino! Definitely in my top 3 favorite coffee shops. They didn't have almond milk, so I went for the oat milk instead. Delicious! 

It does not have the best lighting inside but the interior is still cute. There's a little library section. Good amount of seating. 

Glad I finally got to check this place out. Definitely recommend!"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2020-01-24,4.0,"Birch .. this location specifically is super cute, busy, and good for a afternoon coffee with a friend or a coworker. Coffee is okay nothing special but okay, solid. There is a lot of coffee places around that area but this one is worth stopping by in. Pastries are not great and I would stick to coffee"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2020-01-09,5.0,"Birch loves me and I love Birch.  I stopped in one morning when I was in NYC for a donut and a pumpkin spice latte and was really impressed with how nice it was inside.  The barista was super nice and helpful in giving me some gift ideas for my dad, and everything tasted awesome.  I love the little book nook in the back too, I wish I could have sat down there, but someone else already had the corner occupied.  I love the ""Birch Loves You"" theme throughout, and it's just a nice, positive, uplifting atmosphere.  Def a fan, and def will be back again."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-02-23,4.0,"Great coffee shop in Flatiron with lots of seating and a clean bathroom. I got a drip coffee, which was great. They didn't have almond milk so I got oat milk, the next best thing. It wasn't overly crowded like some other spots on a Saturday morning.

Not a great place if you need to study or do work since there's no wifi and I couldn't find any outlets but I'd highly recommend it if you're just looking to catch up with friends."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-12-25,3.0,Small coffee shop with a cute and cozy vibe. The cappuccino and lattes here are pretty good but I've had better. I think the best part was the giant donuts they have.
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-05-22,4.0,"Came here for an afternoon caffeine pick up with a colleague. Service was pretty fast. We ordered small filter and cappuccino, all in it was $7. The place was buzzing with people catching up with their friends and also people who are ordering to go. Not a bad place to go, bearing in mind there's also Seven Grams and Bourke Street Bakery around the corner."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-05-02,4.0,"Cute, little coffee shop with its unique branding. Very nice touch with ""Birch loves you"" in cups, walls, signs, etc. If you're looking for a study spot, this probably isnt your best bet. I didnt see outlets. Mainly stool chairs (not great for long hours if studying). Limited seats. From other reviews, none or little wifi? However, if you're simply here for a good book or catch up sesh with a friend, it would be perfect with its cozy vibe! I had the cold brew which was a little more sour than I like it normally but I definitely wanna come back for their other menu. The ""ignition initiative"" is also such a cute idea :) (see photo below)"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-03-13,5.0,"My first time here I just had a regular American coffee with soy milk and raw cane sugar.
Prices are normal not over-the-top.
busy line of people went fast, and everyone was in a great mood.
Excellent customer service!!
 great ambience, cool surroundings and vegan friendly desserts as well as regular.
love this place"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-09-13,4.0,"Oooh this cute little coffee shop is so great! So it was my first time going, during lunch time on a Thursday and it was quite full. Plenty of customers sitting down with their cup of Joe, laptops, and in conversations amongst each others. Pretty loud I must say, felt like I was in ""happy hour"" lol 

Anyways, Macchiato does not disappoint, very smooth, flavorful, yet strong and the perfect kick to have after lunch, being greeted by a handsome blonde barista even better! 

They have this cool game you play, ""starting a conversation with a stranger"" pretty cool and clever idea. See my photo below :)
This place is a nice, cozy coffee shop."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-07-14,4.0,"Great coffee, nice space but no WiFi? Really? Very odd for a cafe not to have it. But luckily, Link NYC connects from inside and it runs fast. Otherwise I'd give this review 3 stars. 

Besides that, coffee is incredible! Prices are average."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-07-10,5.0,"Absolutely love their cold brew coffee. It was smooth and tasty. I had cold brew with oat milk and it was a definitely good choice. 

There is always a line to get drinks but not too bad. I got soy cappuccino before and it was one of the best coffee ever. 

Cozy atmosphere and staffs are friendly and nice. 

This is one of my favorite coffee shops in NYC. 

Highly recommend!!"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-01-29,4.0,"This is a little gem of a coffee shop.  Best damn Oat milk Latte i have ever had.  Donuts are tasty, and not too big, which actually works for me because I feel no guilt in eating one.  

Not a ton of seating, but what they do have isn't supper comfortable so people aren't camping out all afternoon.  I have no had an issue getting a seat for a few minutes.

If you are staying in the area, definitely hustle over here in the morning instead of drinking that crappy hotel cup of joe."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-07-16,4.0,"First time here. I got the Black Passionberry Iced Tea, small. Pre-tip Total $3.25. It's subtle and refreshing, not deluged with ice, which I'm thankful for. I'd have ordered coffee but I'm already caffeinated for the day. By all accounts the coffee here is no joke though. It's lunchtime and the line keeps swelling and abating. That line gets long!

There are about ten or so delicious looking non-vegan pastries on display. I inquired, and apparently they do have vegan banana bread, but there is none anywhere in sight.

The interior is very considered and aesthetically pleasing. There's a large rustic communal table, and a counter with tall stools around the perimeter by the windows; plus a few small tables and another smaller communal table in the smaller side room, which also has shelves of books. Pretentiousness Alert. Or maybe just fetishization of books, and lament of their near extinction.

So, the service. Let me be clear; I don't expect genuine thrill at the prospect of serving an interminable throng of presumably caffeine-hangry New Yorkers, but the service was a tad awkward. Upon having given over the funds, there was no acknowledgement of any sort, no eye contact and no comment whatsoever. In fact, the person started squinting and looking at something seemingly far away, mentally absent while fiddling with the iPad.

Perhaps this was a beleaguered owner or manager, dutifully yet begrudgingly covering for a hangover-stricken barista. But yes, it was a little awkward.

Nonetheless I look forward to trying that alleged banana bread if it does in fact appear. Will update if so!"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-12-20,5.0,"I like this location better than the 3rd avenue location because:

1. It is bigger which means more people at the register which means you get your coffee faster

2. The same barista makes your coffee (at least Monday-Friday) which means your coffee is consistently awesome.  At the other location, the barista changes per day and although coffee is never bad, some times it is better than others.

3. More seats and they have a bathroom!

Their croissant is overprice but omg is soo sooo buttery. 

If you're vegan or gluten free they usually have 1-2  danishes to meet your needs.


Final verdict: Will keep coming"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2020-02-05,3.0,"Honestly overhyped! $6 for a cap with plant milk, no WiFi, no heat, and worst of all, mediocre coffee. Also only stools and no chairs. I did like the rustic wooden interior and bookshelf but with so many cafes in the area, I won't be back!"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-12-29,5.0,"Great service and cute little coffeeshop. I looked up coffeeshops to visit before visiting NYC and this was one of them that came up.

Loved the cozy feel in the back with the bookcases. Small but didn't feel overcrowded. On my visit I had one particularly nice and helpful barista. She really made me feel welcome with her friendliness. Much appreciated!

I highly recommend checking out this Birch coffee or any one of the other locations in NYC! I intend to visit the other locations when I come back."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-06-06,4.0,"Love this place. Only problem is that it gets crazy busy. They have iced coffee and cold brew on tap so at least that speeds things up in the summer. Truly outstanding coffee. I'm not a coffee nerd so can't really speak to all of the fancy pour over methods offered, but if you're into that I recommend a visit. There is room for laptops, but you have to get there early"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-05-15,3.0,"A friend and I decided to meet up here earlier this year because he didn't want to meet up at a Starbucks or a chain-focused coffee shop. As always, I'm usually early because I wanted to grab a comfortable seat. We were suppose to meet around 3:30PM on a Friday afternoon and boy was Birch Coffee crowded already!

I haven't been to any of the other locations yet, but this one seemed fairly small. It's pretty loud and chatty here too. There's also no WiFi here, so if you're looking to get some work done here on your laptop - you may want to reconsider. I liked how they have little conversation starters if you're coming here for a first date or to get to know someone. 

I tried their cold brew which I thought was about average. I've definitely had better. 

When my friend finally arrived around 4-4:10PM, it was still a little crowded and I began to feel a little claustrophobic, so we ended up taking a walk around the neighborhood. 

I think I would only come back to this location if I'm passing by the area and needed a coffee, but I don't think it would be the best place to meet someone to catch up because it can get pretty chatty."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-06-24,3.0,"I've been to different locations of Birch before, but this was my first time at this one. I came around 4 PM on a Wednesday and was happy to see that there wasn't a line, though all the tables were full. 

I ordered a large cold brew with oat milk. It was fine, but I definitely would have preferred more milk in it. It bothers me that Birch doesn't keep any milk on the counter here because I didn't want to have to go ask for more, since a decent line had formed by the time I tried my coffee. I hate being that person to interrupt a line just for more milk! So I just drank it as it was.

I was lucky enough to snag a small table and was able to sit down and get some work down as planned. Not!!! They don't offer WiFi here, though you can connect to a communal LinkNYC network (which honestly sucks.) I ended up just taking my coffee to go and heading over early to the location of my evening meeting where I had much better luck with the WiFi in the lobby there.

Overall I didn't love this Birch location for getting work done, and was annoyed that I couldn't just add milk to my cold brew myself. Props to them for not using plastic straws though!"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-11-09,4.0,"Great neighborhood coffee shop, although there is something to be said about paying $6 for a dirty chai and not blinking an eye.  The price we pay for living in Manhattan, I guess.  
Great service, nice baristas, delicious coffee with punch and small enough space where I can avoid the influx of laptop campers, but just enough space where I have room to navigate and enjoy my coffee without bumping into too many elbows.  
I'd recommend but expect to pay a premium (it's worth it)."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-04-12,5.0,"It does not matter where I am staying in NYC when I visit, I come here for my morning coffee and almond croissant. The coffee is exceptional, smooth and rich, and they use high quality milks and chocolate. They take their work seriously but clearly love what they do. The service is warm and friendly, and the walls in the back side room are lined with books. Always a good sign. Today I spilled my coffee everywhere and they came to my rescue with a sincere smile, ""no worries"", and almost before the last drop had spilled the barista wizard called my name for a fresh cup, without me saying a word. Next time you are in town, pop in and give it a try."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2017-12-19,4.0,"I actually didn't mean to come here. I passed by on the way to another coffee shop (I'm on a quest to try multiple coffee shops) to do work. I quickly Yelped this place, found that there was no wifi, and decided that I would be more productive here than anywhere else. 

I went in and ordered a cappuccino. It wasn't the cheapest cappuccino you can find (and not the biggest cup), but it was good coffee!!! If you're looking for a good place to meet a friend or go on a first date (lol), I'd recommend Birch Coffee!!

I also did end up getting a lot of work done! If you need a place to be productive without getting distracted by various websites dedicated to procrastination, I highly recommend this location. It has a really relaxed vibe, but not so much so that you don't want to do anything. 

OOH. And I really liked that they had little cards that you could take and put on your table as a way to start a conversation with someone you don't know. I wish I lived nearer because I'd love to come back!"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-08-04,5.0,"Nice little coffee shop! Plenty of seating, friendly staff. Got a cold brew and was nice and fresh, and only 50 cents more for a large! So $4.50 total, great deal. Definitely coming back.

Also, I love the napkins!! Lol."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-02-22,5.0,"Birch is an adorable, cozy coffee shop with the BEST dirty chai latte (do yourself a favor and order it). It has old school decor with book shelves and wooden tables - however, I'm not sure if they have wifi so it might not be a great place to work on your laptop if you need the internet. But the service is super friendly, the coffee is delicious, and they have lots of different milks and lattes to choose from."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-04-01,5.0,"Got a latte with oat milk and my boyfriend got a cold brew. Both up to our high standards of coffee. On top of this, the baristas are friendly and the atmosphere is nice for a coffee date or even getting some work done."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-08-19,4.0,"If you have been disappointed with flat whites (a style of expresso based beverage popular in Australia-NewZealand) in the US, then this place is for you. I really think they get the proportion correct and it reminded me of my amazing stay in New Zealand. 

They also had an almond tea containing roasted almond, beetroot and cinnamon which was interesting. One of the good coffee shops in New York you could rely on without going to hipster neighborhoods of Brooklyn"
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2020-02-18,5.0,"My absolute favorite coffee shop in the city. Their chai lattes are definitely the best I've had, albeit they use a syrup rather than actual chai but it just tastes so good I can't complain. The coffee is also so good when I go for a latte. Service is always friendly and fast, a plus is that they sell oatly barista edition so it's super convenient for me to go there and stock up for at home. They also sell these amazing granola bars and I've gotten straight up addicted to the peanut butter one."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2017-07-03,5.0,"Perch yourself at Birch for really good coffee and a nice place to sit. There's plenty of seating in this cute coffee place at a really central location and solid coffee. I came by to kill an hour before an appointment and was able to peacefully sit by the window and read for a while. There's one bookcase area with a longer table for larger groups and a few window facing tables. The setup divides a sitting area and a coffee ordering area so you don't feel overwhelming by people rolling through. There's mildly loud pop music playing, but not in an offensive way. I spent a very happy hour reading a book here and was thoroughly impressed with the vibe. 

What stood out the most was just how tasty the coffee was. I just had a small coffee with oat milk and in addition to coming in an adorable cup (there was part of it that said ""hello my name is"" and then they write your name. So cute), it just tasted really good! They also sell doughnuts and some other pastries and have a variety of milk alternatives. The service is super friendly and fairly quick. I'd highly recommend Birch to anyone in the area."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-01-15,5.0,It's a nice spacious coffee shop near the park. We had lattes and they tasted great. You can get your latte in a nice mug with Birch logo. Everyone was friendly.  They have a bathroom available if you need one. They don't have any milk out so you need to ask for it if you add it to your coffee.
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-07-14,5.0,"There's no other cafe in town that takes coffee this seriously. These are the OG third wave coffee masters. The service is always friendly, warm and welcoming (they make it a point to remember your name), the space is charming and the atmosphere is buzzing. This cafe is the epitome of NYC's energy - high vibe, people from all walks of life, and all connecting over a cup of coffee."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-01-13,4.0,"Solid coffee shop, very cozy atmosphere, and friendly staff. Great place to stop by for drink. Ordered their flat white ($4.50) which was good. The creaminess from the milk froth went quite well with the slight bitterness from the coffee."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-08-21,5.0,Go to spot for best coffee in NYC at all locations. I typically get iced latte with oat milk but their mocha is excellent.  No WiFi but the coffee is best.
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2017-03-19,5.0,"Very cool coffee spot with a unique, albeit, old school philosophy. I heard way back in the '90's there was no Wi-Fi in coffee shops such as this spot, but don't let that stop you from experiencing friendly customer service, a good atmosphere, seating, and a good cup of Joe. The space is very accommodating. A little on the cozy side as it probably seats 30 people comfortably.

What I most liked about this spot is that they have this Ignition Initiative, where you can put one of the small table tents on the table to start a conversation, see pictures. The barista said it works and it gets people talking. Oh, did I mention they do not have electrical outlets. Right, none. So lesson learned here, try to keep a full charged battery and laptop at all times."
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-07-05,5.0,Ordered a medium iced oat milk latte and had to wait quite a while (guy ahead ordered like 6 drinks) which is giving me a sense that their coffee is good. I'm not a fan of super milky lattes but first sip I took was a little on the sweet side. Finally realized that I didn't stir my drink properly. Omg the espresso had a great kick which balances the sweetness of the oat milk beautifully! So good!
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2018-10-14,4.0,Very cool coffee shop. It has a lot of character and is cozy. The lattes are really good and they don't have a bitter after taste. This is a very small place so expect a crowd.
620,birch-coffee-new-york-7,2019-07-12,2.0,"If u are coming to study at a cafe, do not come here. There are no outlets and no wifi provided. Otherwise, coffee is good and this place is cute for a coffee with a friend or intimate other."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-03-28,5.0,"I wish Bagels & Schmear was on grubhub, but I get why they're not. That said, they're part of the reason I keep cash on hand during times of pandemic, or when I'll be staying home for whatever reason.

My old office would order these guys a lot, and to be honest - I didn't get it then. This was mainly because by the time they got to me, my bacon, egg, and cheese was cold and ordered incorrectly. So, while eating it, I didn't grasp why this got so many accolades from my peers. Then, one day I ordered them in person and ate it fresh, and ordered correctly (and not one of 20 orders). This was the game-changer for me. The bagel was perfect, and everything else in my BECSPK was well done as well. It's one of the few BECSPK's I can order without everything falling out on me as I eat it. 

I've moved to delivery when I was homebound in what I call my pandemic test run when I couldn't leave my apartment for 2 months last November. Delivery was quick, usually within 30 minutes or less, and my order never came out wrong. The hardest part was keeping cash readily available. I do feel better paying in cash as I know that a) the delivery driver gets to keep his tip; b) the restaurant isn't being charged a commission; c) I'm not being charged 'service fees' on top of the commission they charge the restaurant. But, that said, I do wish they had a delivery service they worked with as I'd be able to order more often as I don't always have cash on hand. 

In terms of the food, beyond my BECSPK, I've had their monstrously large Buffalo Kick Start breakfast sandwich (Eggs + Ham + Bacon + Pepper Jack + Buffalo Sauce on Ciabatta), and their pumpernickel bagel with veggie cream cheese. Both are absolutely amazing, though I'm a creature of habit and the bacon egg and cheese, saltpepperketchup, is my standby. 

Everything is cheap, the food is great, and delivery is prompt. What more can you ask for in a bagel spot?"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-05-22,4.0,"Pretty good bagels, and a line that moves very fast! I was visiting from Austin and stashed a few in my suitcase to bring home (the garlic smell is still vaguely there...)

The schmear amount is plentiful (it IS New York after all) and the staff was happy to move you along without being rude. I loved the everything and garlic bagels, with scallion cream cheese of course. They had plenty of breakfast sandwich options too, with eggs, cheese and meats."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-03-20,5.0,"Now is as good of time as ever to catch up on reviews I've been meaning to write for quite sometime and Bagels & Schmear has been hanging in my drafts box for quite some time. That said, holy bagel! 

I was in NYC a few months back and was staying at a hotel in the area and turned to Yelp for some bagel help. This place popped up with great reviews so I figured I'd give it a shot. I grabbed a few bagels for me and a friend (buttered onion & onion with the works). All of them were delicious and the bagel was so chewy and soft. A classic NYC bagel. 

If you're in the neighborhood it's worth a visit :)"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-02-08,5.0,"I like you a lox, Bagels & Schmear!

Had to get a NY bagel while I was in town. Otherwise, did you even go to NYC if you didn't eat a bagel? The answer is no.

During my first visit, I ordered a lox on an everything bagel, toasted. Service was fast and pleasant. That bagel was loaded and tasty! Very filling, too. Soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside. I enjoyed the bagel so much that when I returned to NY a few months later I went back to B&S and ordered half a dozen assortment to take back to Atlanta with me. Boy was my family happy to see me home with a bag of authentic NYC bagels!

In addition to great bagels and schmear, they also offer yummy looking pastries. During both visits, lines were long which is a great sign. However, the biz has it figured out because I was in and in about 5 minutes or less!"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-03-03,4.0,"I was really hyped about this place because I don't remember the last time I had a bagel in Manhattan so I was excited to see this place close to where I was staying. I had the hyped Lox bagel, which was generously stuffed with smoked salmon and cream cheese and capers. Yum! The bagel itself was honestly not the best I had. But also I grew up being spoiled by amazing bagels back when I lived in Queens, so maybe I'm biased!
I can't complain though because the cream cheese and lox tasted really fresh!
The place is a squeeze though so be mentally prepared to eat standing up! This place gets busy but not to the point where the line went out the door"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-12-06,3.0,"Very tasty bagels: soft center and crunchy exterior. Why only 3-stars? They wrap the bagel in foil. If you got it toasted, and had a shmear of cream cheese, by the time you opened your bagel (even just a few minutes later), the bagel was a tad soggy, and the cream cheese had the consistency of whipped cream . . . bummer.

Friday morning at 0930 had a line to the door. They were taking orders, and you would receive your bagels while still waiting for the 10 or so folks in front of you to finish paying. Maybe their card reader was off, but cash was the way to go, or you waited 3-4 mins for card to go through.

Better bagel places in Manhattan, for sure.

Cheers!

621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-03-01,4.0,"Bagels & Schmear satisfied my NYC lox & bagel craving. There weren't many dishes that were on my list when visiting the city. However, a classic lox & bagel was a definite priority. Bagels & Schmear advertised their lox and bagel as a house special. I was also so happy to include their tofu cream cheese with my selection. It was very tasty and just what I wanted. There was a generous portion of smoked salmon and capers as well as tomatoes and onions. The onion bagel itself was very filling and kept me satisfied for the remainder of my day spent walking around the city. The process was quick and the employees all very sweet. The woman offered my sister and our friend a free pastry. I wish I had been offered one as well but didn't mind as the bagel had me feeling very, very full."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-10-25,4.0,"We finally settled on this bagel place to visit and while the food was pretty good, I wasn't totally wowed by it or the place itself. I had the house special (cream cheese, capers, lox) on the everything bagel and my husband had an egg, bacon, and hash brown on a plain bagel. 
I will say that this place had a constant line and crowd though and that the workers were very efficient. I didn't think the bagels were super delicious but wouldn't mind coming here again for sure."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-09-26,5.0,"If you want a damn good New York bagel, come here. 

They are freshly made on premises, HUGE, perfect texture and they have a variety of delicious spread options, including lots of cream cheeses. I love the everything and sesame, or whichever one is piping hot out of the oven.

This place is definitely mobbed at various times throughout the day, but the line moves quickly. The guys that work there are sweet and efficient. This what NYC morning deli fare is all about."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-03-24,5.0,"Oh only the best bagel place in the neighborhood, possibly the borough. Fast, nice, clean, and IDEAL bagels."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-08-08,4.0,"tldr: good bagel, cream cheese, come early

I got the 7 grain bagel with scallion cream cheese toasted. The bagel was great, crispy and salty on the outside and soft on the inside. I originally wanted the everything bagel, but they ran out. You should definitely come here early, as they were out of half the types of bagels by 11:30. The cream cheese had just the right amount of scallions, and was lathered on the bagel. I highly recommend this cream cheese!

The service was gruff but fast, honestly what I would expect out of New York (given I'm from Seattle). All in all, a great bagel place with equally great cream cheese."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-05-21,5.0,"I was looking for Bagels all day and came across this place! I had a HUGE craving for a Bagel and Lox and they make a mean one! I was so happy because they had that on the menu.

The bagels are gigantic but I'm not going to pretend I didn't eat it all... let's be real. I forced it down. It was almost too much food... almost.

I will definitely be back next time I'm in NYC."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-03-09,4.0,"This place is amazing. The bagels are fresh an delicious, on pare with some of the most famous bagel shops in NYC. The choice of fillings, spreads and protein are diverse and freshly sourced/ made as well (or at least seem like it). The staff who work the line are extremely kind and fast. However, I have had a few encounters with male cashiers who are rude and dismissive. I will sometime walk in and see they are working and will not order to avoid dealing with them."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-04-18,5.0,"I was staying at a hotel next door and decided to stop in for breakfast. There was a line already at 7:30 AM, so I knew the food would be good (plus, the reviews were awesome). Surprisingly, even with the long line, the staff was able to move it along extremely quickly. I ordered and got my food in approx 5 minutes! 

They had a huge selection to choose from and seem to be famous for the variety of cream cheese spreads they have. They have options for sandwiches, wraps, salads, and more. I decided on getting a whole wheat bagel with American and eggs along with a coffee. It was amazing and it was only $6.50! The bagel was big and fluffy and toasted to perfection. we enjoyed our food so much that we decided to stop here another day for a wrap and a salad. Everything was all I hoped for and more. 

The space itself is rather small. They have about 10 stools in total where you can sit and eat, so it's definitely more of a grab and go spot. If I worked or lived nearby, this would definitely be a go-to. Good, cheap, and fast. What more can you ask for? lol."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-10-22,4.0,"I will have to say that I was a bit underwhelmed by the lox schmear. That being said, I think this is probably one of the best bagels that I've ever had. It's the consistency, both dense without being too chewy and perfectly toasted on the outside. I'll be coming back next time I make it to the city.

Right now it's my Manhattan bagel spot, although I hear that across the river in Queens has some spots that supposed to be equally fantastic."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-04-03,4.0,"I loved visiting this small bagel joint! Though the quarters were tight and there wasn't many places to sit, they were able to move the line through quickly and the prices were super reasonable. The staff was extremely friendly and there is a flavor option for even the pickiest of breakfast go-ers. 

Small Tip - there's a park around the corner if you need a place to sit and relax while munching on your purchase."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-01-30,5.0,"Wow. If you're looking for an authentic New York bagel, this is the spot. I came here on a Sunday morning and the line was wrapped around the corner. Always a good sign. 

We had a big group so we each got to try each other's bagels and let me tell you, they were all amazing. I tried the house special (lox, cream cheese, the works), a classic toasted everything bagel with cream cheese (my personal fav) and a bacon egg and cheese bagel.

I will say -- there isn't much seating. This is definitely a grab & go type place.

I highly recommend coming to Bagels & Shmear. As someone who's lived in New York, you really can't get better than this."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,"Ok not to sound dramatic, but this is the best bagel spot in the city. Let me tell you, I've been to ALL of the ""best bagels in nyc"" joints and there are some close contenders, let's be honest, but this place is-the-best! I had my fav for a year now until this place just came in and stepped on my THROAT. I'm not gonna name drop any others bc that just doesn't feel right, but trust. I got you. 

If you want to try my order: everything bagel toasted, bacon-egg-n-cheese, with a schmear of avocado cream cheese. Yes, cheese and cream cheese. We treat ourselves in this house."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-04-12,5.0,"I admittedly an not normally a bagel person, I tend to go for sweets in the AM. But when in NYC, you eat bagels. And boy, am I glad that I did.

Toasted everything with scallion cream cheese was pure bliss for me this morning. Perfectly crispy outside, chewy inside, with a great scallion flavor."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-11-16,5.0,"I've had a few different New York bagels, but wow...I will not forget this place. I got the house special bagel and I don't think I've ever had anything with a bagel that can compare. Staff is super friendly and it's usually pretty crowded. Can't wait to come back!"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"I set out to try the best bagels in New York and I was pointed in the direction of this restaurant. I'm so glad I asked a local for their recommendation because this place lives up to the hype! It's definitely ""Mom-n-Pop Shop"" vibes, which is always my preference because I feel like the food will be more authentic. The line was out the door, which is another foodie tip I look for, because it leads me to believe the food is delicious. We ordered a plain bagel with egg, bacon, and cheese, and saracha cream cheese. It was EPIC. We split the bagel sandwich because it was huge, so I'd recommend this spot if you're going with another person or if you have a big appetite. You can have your bagels however you'd like, which is great if you're looking for a sandwich shop with options."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-12-10,5.0,"Solid bagels.  Solid schmear.  The line can get a liiiittle crazy, but it moves fast. 


The special - very special."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-02-07,5.0,"Perfect New York bagel! Oversized, flavor packed bagels with a crisp exterior and a soft, pillowy interior. Not too dense, or too chewy.  Just right. Delicious schmears with a lot of different options to chose from. My favorite combo is the salt garlic bagel with scallion schmear. The line can be out the door but always moves fast. Friendly staff and a superb product! I couldn't get enough of this place and brought 6 bagels home to California in my suitcase."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-09-02,5.0,"Delicious bagels! We stopped by this place twice while visiting NYC because it was close to our hotel. It was definitely a classic, NY style bagel experience. Lines were long but moved quickly. I've tried the sausage, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel and the scallion cream cheese and egg on an onion bagel. Eggs were omelette style. I especially loved the scallion cream cheese. Both bagels were great and portions were very generous!"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-10-04,5.0,"This is probably my favorite bagel spot in Manhattan. The bagels are always the perfect consistency, with the best flavor and always at the perfect temperature. I don't know how it is that they're always so hot and fresh without being toasted but they are sooo good! The everything cream cheese here is great too. 

My old work always used to cater them too and their lox is delicious. 

The line is always very long but it's absolutely for a reason!"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-08-05,5.0,Not only the bagels are fantastic. The employees are hilarious... they make you laugh!!! Luv it
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-07-20,5.0,"Such a good bagel place for a quick breakfast!!

This place was a block or 2 from my hotel when I was in town for work. Since it was so close, I HAD to stop in for that authentic NY experience.

This place gets busy, but they move fast. They are extremely friendly and have a ton of options between the bagels, variety of cream cheeses, wraps, etc.

My go to is either sausage or bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel and it was fantastic! The bagel was crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside with a really good flavor. And they pack the bagels here making a pretty good sized meal at a very reasonable price.

Perfect for a walk down the streets of New York!"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-07-02,5.0,"UNREAL. There is something so special about the cream cheese here. Even the plain cream cheese. The bagels are wonderful and the amount of cream cheese they put on is so wonderful. It's quick, cheap and delicious. Perfect for anyone who's trying to get a quick meal in the city. 

Please ask to get your bagel/sandwich toasted because they'll give it to you as is if not!"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-06-27,4.0,"I was on a solo trip in NYC and thought what better way to start by getting a NY bagel. There is some construction outside so it took me a second to find the location. It's a small place, good for on the go. There were maybe 5 stools. They also have muffins, sandwiches, and other breakfast dishes. I came around 11AM  on a weekday, so no wait for me. I knew I wanted an Everything Bagel with Smoked Salmon and Egg. It was huge and delicious! Definitely could have shared it with someone. The only reason it lost a star was that it was a bit pricey, $14 to be exact. I just wished that was posted somewhere."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-12-16,4.0,Great bagel spot in the area. I was looking for an early morning breakfast and this was the closest open spot near where I was staying. They had a large selection of fresh bagels in addition to selling other pastries and snacks. The place is small but I opted like most people there to take my bagel to-go. Servers were helpful and my bagel was quickly prepared.

621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-07-07,5.0,"Locals seem to love this place and I completely understand why. Went in looking for a classic NY bagel with lox and was not disappointed. Went with the house special on a toasted everything bagel which comes with lox, capers, onions, and cream cheese. It came to $13.01 and fulfilled every expectation I had. Great find!"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-07-01,4.0,"Beat bagels in the Kips Bay! Decided to come here because of the Yelp reviews and most of them were spot on. Things you need to know:

-Super friendly staff
-Long line on the weekends (was out the door) but moves quickly. I waited ~10 minutes
-No great places to sit inside. They have a bar with stools but since there is likely a line (on the weekend) you are right on top of people 
-They give the perfect amount of cream cheese aka don't slab too much on like other places 
-Toasted to perfection! 
-Conveniently located right next to 6 train at 28th St."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-04-16,4.0,"My previous office used to order Bagel & Schmear all the time for group meetings. Everything about them is quality! However.... Have a had a better bagel though? Yes. Have I had better cream cheese? Yes. BUT I really respect that not one order out of a ton of large pick-up orders have ever been wrong. Ordering large quantities and asking for special requests can be annoying for the business but they clearly pay special attention to all orders, large and small. Way to go guys!

Favorites: vegetable cream cheese, scallion cream cheese, pumpernickel & everything bagel. 

*I wish they offered more Lite versions of the gourmet cream cheeses TBH. I find it available at a lot of other bagel spots nowadays. Like their jalapeño cream cheese is amazing but soooo heavy. Would love a lite option!"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-04-08,3.0,"Solid bagel place. Kind of big. Maybe I expect more from a NYC bagel place. Got a bacon egg and cheese , toasted and scooped. It was good but not profound in any way. They were open at 7 and the ice coffee was good. $12 for breakfast. You could do worse."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2020-01-04,5.0,"Seriously an amazing bagel place. First time in NYC and went here, got the house special bagel that has lox, cream cheese, capers, onions, and tomatoes on an everything bagel. SO GOOD. So full, too! Super friendly and fast staff. They have a huge menu, but we were so impressed with the special the first time we went here that we ordered the same thing the next day."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-05-29,5.0,"Yes yes and yes!!!
All I can say is this place blew me out of the water!
I moved out of NJ over 10 yrs ago and still haven't found a good bagel place in Charlotte NC since!
The 1st thing when I visit home is a good bagel and slice a pizza!!!!
Great Bagel and Fantastic breakfast wraps!!!!"
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-04-05,4.0,"This place is fantastic across the board. Cupcakes are delicious, just old-fashioned not fancy chocolate and vanilla. 
The wraps are great. 
And the people are beyond friendly. 
It's near my acupuncture and the 6 train on 28th, which is how I found it. 

There are a million wrap/sandwich/salad joints in the city but this one is above average."
621,bagels-and-schmear-new-york,2019-08-01,5.0,"I'm still dreaming about this bagel and inexplicably amazing cup of drip coffee?! 

Be prepared to know what you want when you get there because the locals hate when you clog up the regular flow... 

Service is super fast!"
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-03-22,4.0,"Note: I'm catching up on reviews and got food from this location last week before the order was given for all restaurants to do take-out/delivery only. 

My brother took me to Cha Cha Matcha and at first I was confused by all the pink color on the outside and inside of the restaurant. I think of green with matcha, but the pink is eye catching which helps in Manhattan to stand out! Although it was a cooler temperature day, I felt like a cold drink and the matcha lemonade sounded perfect with yuzu and mint. It was a good balance of the grassy taste of matcha, tartness of the yuzu juice and mint. I'd definitely get this again. 

To go along with the lemonade I got the matcha croissant which is definitely a made-for-Instagram pastry. I couldn't detect matcha in the croissant until I got to the center which is filled with matcha cream. This was enjoyable and worth getting. 

As they say, don't judge a book by its cover, in this case the heavy use of pink! This fun and irreverent place has the taste to back up the flash."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-05-16,3.0,"This small cafe has a cool aesthetic inside, very welcoming. I got the nitro matcha that, hoo boy, packed a powerful matcha punch. Too much for me! 

We also split a dossant (that's a donut croissant for those who do not know). It was pretty good and featured a sweet pink filling.

By the way, LOVE the stencil work from the baristas."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-02-26,3.0,"Just grabbed a generic hot matcha latte while I was here and it was pretty good. 
However, they have a bunch of interesting drink options so I will definitely return to try some of the more adventurous drink options. 

They also sell matcha here averaging around $50."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-06-03,1.0,Never coming back here ever again. The owner is a trump supporter. No excuses. I'm taking my money elsewhere.
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-02-05,4.0,"Its my second time here and I would definitely  be back here the next time I visit flatiron district. 
I needed a caffeine fix minus being jittery after a long walk so I opted for matcha ice cream. 
I love the premium quality matcha they use. Their soft serve matcha ice cream has a fulL body , creamy vegetal taste to it and it's  not too sweet."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-01-03,4.0,"Ok, this shop is super cute and their matcha is amazing! I came here for the second time today and tried their iced matcha latte for the first time. They only had soy and oat milk today because they were out of everything else. I never had oat milk, but decided to try it in my latte. The drink was perfection! It gave me the boost I needed before my yoga class but was light and didn't make me feel full or gross. The flavors of the oat milk with the match really complimented each other and I would totally order it again and again! 

They have matcha soft serve here, and I was totally drooling looking at people eating it. I will have to try it next time!

Be aware that this shop is very small and there isn't a lot of seating. It is definitely more of a grab and go situation."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-11-30,5.0,"Just so you know, I love matcha in all forms so I was stoked to try Cha Cha Matcha. 

I thought Asians did matcha well but these hipsters left me dumbfounded after trying the nitro latte. I'll approve of cultural appropriation this time but I still haven't gotten over Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in the Shell. After one sip, I was hooked at the nitro-infused matcha with coconut milk and almond milk combination. Not only did this taste amazing, but hipsters found a way to put it on tap - my mind was seriously blown. It was so good that I came back the next morning to order another nitro latte but this time with an extra scoop of their proprietary matcha.  

To the owners of Cha Cha Matcha, please come to Chicago. Also please consider having larger options for the matcha addicts like me that will gladly pay more for a 20 or 30 once of your nitro latte. 

Damn, I love you so matcha."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-12-15,5.0,"Cha cha matcha is a staple in my life. This place plays the BEST music on full blast and the vibe is unmatched (makes you forget about the miserable winter for a split second). 

My go to's are the iced matcha latte and the hot turmeric matcha latte, both with almond milk. Soft serve is always a good move too. Sometimes they make cute designs on the lattes and they have amazing overnight oats in the cooler.

If you're a true cha cha fan, 10/10 recommend buying the clothing, it's super comfortable and CUTE."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-03-04,4.0,"With a chic pink decor, Cha Cha Matcha serves up matcha coffees/teas, matcha lemonade and soft serve ice cream. The coffees/teas are packed with flavor and all taste different from one another while the soft serve flavors change seasonally."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-12-22,4.0,"Great matcha spot, quick and delicious, and cutely decorated, and convenient to get to from the subway.

The matcha latte I got is creamy with heavy matcha flavour. Also they allow substitutes for soy milk if you're lactose intolerant. 

They make it quite quickly although they're busy. I got my order in under 5 minutes.

The decor is in pink and so it's very Instagrammable."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-11-06,5.0,"It was such a humid day when I visited this place. The iced matcha was the most refreshing drink to have with this type of weather. I appreciate how they don't add any sweetener to the drinks and lets their customers pour how much sweetener they want. I love my drinks extra sweet so I made mine just they way I wanted too. 

The interior design is super cute and very esthetically pleasing. Don't forget to take a cute picture inside. Also, the employees are very laid back and friendly. There's always a line out of the door but service went by quickly."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-10-22,4.0,"Came here specifically for the matcha ice cream and got the limited edition passion fruit flavor along with it. Both were tasty!

Matcha and Passion Fruit Soft Serve Ice Cream: 4/5
I have to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of matcha (mostly came here because a friend wanted to), but I can appreciate the skill and effort it takes to make an ice cream with such intense matcha flavor. But it's still no surprise that I liked the passion fruit ice cream better. It was more of a sorbet in texture (although still soft serve), and its acidic sweetness balanced out the earthiness of the matcha well."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-01-25,5.0,"Call me bougie or millennial or both. 

For a while I avoided this place. It was too pink. Too splashy. Too Instagram-able. Too ""give-me-your-money-right-now."" It was a matter of time before I succumbed, and now I can't help but like everything from the storefront to the tiles to the napkins. Just being inside this place is an aphrodisiac. Whoever is responsible for their marketing needs a raise. 

It's pricey, yes: expect to shell out $6-8 bucks for an 8 oz. drink. The drinks, though, are very, very good. Achingly good. My favorite is the matcha turmeric latte and the purple drink.

In the winter they have outside seating with a heated awning. It's nice to sit here with a drink and people watch. Just know you're probably getting gawked at, too."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-02-17,4.0,"My friend and I stopped here after a spin class and it was the perfect after workout pick me up! The place itself is instagrammable inside and out. They have more than just matcha, they also have turmeric lattes and a chia matcha latte it is so fun. The latte art that comes with the lattes is also a nice touch. The latte art varies depending on the drink and the barista. 
I also love all the milk options they have for their drinks. They have regular dairy alternatives like almond but they also have hemp and macadamia milk. The space itself if generally crowded but they do have some tables to sit inside, however when we were there all the tables were full. The whole decor of the place is just so fun it really adds to the experience! I wouldn't travel super far to go to this place again, but then again I am not a huge matcha person but next time I am in the area I would definitely make a stop here."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-09-30,5.0,"Tried this place for the first time and received excellent service! 

I wanted the matcha soft serve and about 2/3 way into the cup, they ran out of it. The worker asked if I wanted to add another flavor to it or wait another 20 minutes for the matcha). My boyfriend wanted to try their other flavor so we just opted to take another flavor. To be honest, I thought it was enough but apparently the servings are huge! They apologized and gave us a free drink stamp card that we can redeem on our next visit! 

Anyways, both flavors were great! Very cute ambiance and wonderful service from the workers. Serving size is definitely above average and the quality of the ice cream is amazing."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-08-03,3.0,"Location: Close to the Empire State Building and where I was staying so it made it an easy walk in the mornings.  The place has a handful of small tables for you to enjoy your matcha indoors.  The color scheme and decorations ooze IG selfie all over.  It's bright pink and matcha green everywhere (from the tables and chairs to the napkins).  The line can get long on weekday mornings as people are on picking up their matcha fix on the way to the office but it does go quickly. 

Staff: The staff is cool and laid back. They're good at providing suggestions or more information if you ask about how certain milks taste with the matcha.  They all seem very friendly. 

Matcha:  I ordered an iced matcha latte with macadamia milk.  I'm a big fan of macadamia milk as it has this richness in flavor without the milky tongue thing that happens with heavy cream.  I was actually very surprised that they even had macadamia milk as it's not common outside of the Hawaiian islands.  

The matcha itself isn't that strong of a flavor but it's good enough and better than what you'd get at a popular chain coffee shop.   Be careful if you order whole milk in your matcha latte.  The whole milk is extremely overpowering in the matcha latte to the point where it tastes like just milk.  Hubs made that mistake and ended up asking to add more matcha to his drink to try to balance it out.   I'd recommend either the almond milk or macadamia milk as their flavor profiles are more subtle."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-07-25,2.0,"I probably would maintain a low 4 if this place was consistent. On some days, the regular matcha cappuccino is balanced. On other days, it's way too milky.

 I also wouldn't mind if that light ice gimmick is mentioned somewhere also. I mean most places also don't make it 3/4 full with a barista who's smirking face is the definition of ""you already know you messed up."" Blank slate tea it is or some other place."

622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-06-10,4.0,"This place is instagram heaven for matcha lovers! I was visiting NYC last weekend and was really excited to finally try this place out.

They have some creative matcha drinks that are a mix of other types of lattes with the traditional matcha and I regret not trying one of these, next time! 

I got my matcha latte with coconut milk and my friends got a regular matcha latte (hot and iced). I didn't love the coconut milk as the coconut taste was too overpowering, but the matcha itself was good -- creamy and not too bitter. The iced matcha was tasty as well, it didn't feel too watered down.

Not sure how the locals feel, but as a tourist I loved the experience (even at $6/drink)!"
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-06-26,5.0,"This place is super hip and super tasty. Only downside, which is the case for many places in NYC: pricey.

DRINKS: I shared two drinks with my good friend. Beautiful latte ($8) and the Cha Cha Chaga ($8). Both were very tasty with interesting ingredients (reishi mushrooms in the Cha Cha Chaga! Not like you taste it, but it's still fun!). They have many types of milk, which is amazing as someone who is lactose intolerant! They have coconut, almond, oat, macadamia, and hemp for dairy free, and whole and skim for dairy. I highly recommend macadamia and oat -- both are tasty and creamy. I tried hemp milk while I was here and wasn't too crazy about it -- seemed too thin and not creamy enough. 

SERVICE: People are super nice and will answer your questions, even when the line is out the door (which it usually is, apparently). 

AMBIANCE: This place is SO CUTE. Like instagram worthy cute. And there will be women taking instragram photos. There's cute framed decor all around, neon lights in green and pink (their colors) and cute tables and chairs. Adorable. 

OVERALL: Wish they had places like this in Atlanta (my home spot)! Came in with a friend and loved it. Also they have outlets for phone charging!"
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-12-30,5.0,Great vibes and good quality matcha. It is about $5 for a matcha latte including tax but you can pick which type of milk you want. I went with whole milk and it was nicely frothed with a thick layer of milk foam. There are limited amount of seating as you would expect in a nyc coffee shop.
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-07-11,4.0,"Are you obsessed with that green powder? Does it make you go mmmmm hmmmm? This is a fun tropical themed matcha and cafe. Matcha infused pastries and plenty of seating available. They mix the matcha in big bowls and top your drink with a matcha powder palm tree via stencil art. 

The iced drinks are also beautifully crafted with many colorful ingredients. Their pride drink was just on point. I also like me some purple and pink drinks on occasion.

The windows are open to the street although it's only broadway in NoMad it's a nice cool breeze this odd July morning."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-03-09,4.0,"Finally convinced my girlfriend to try this place with me! I love matcha... she does not. But we were both super happy with what we got: nitro latte, purple drink, and a piece of vegan chocolate banana bread. Honestly, all really good, just a little on the expensive side. Also, I'm really surprised that a cafe that predominantly emphasizes vegan drinks and pastries, charges extra for non-dairy milk? It's a nitpick, but still, caught me off-guard. Definitely check this place out. I'm excited to try their other locations!"
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-01-04,4.0,"I have been to the other location in NoLita but this was my first time at this location. Be careful as you enter, I almost tripped walking in and there was no ""Watch your step"" sign. The place was pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon. 
Note: this place is like a bunch of spots in the area: credit card only. As the cashier took my order down, he also asked how to spell my name (and at the same time got it wrong). I ordered the Cha Cha Chaga special. The drink itself was $8, but I got it with almond milk. With taxes it came to almost $10, which is odd cause almond milk is only $0.75 extra. 
I probably would go back if I wanted another chaga latte because it was very good, but I might also want to start making them at home. For some reason I just got a weird vibe from the baristas here. Too hipster, if you know what I mean. Also, the area to get cup sleeves/straws/caps is very small and is easily over crowded. I had to wait for a couple to move before I could get to a cover for my latte. Again, not the worst but they do have enough space for an additional one."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-05-24,4.0,"Quality matcha, straight from the Uji region of Japan! Unlike the types of matcha we see in convenience stores here in the States, Uji matcha is richer and a bit more bitter. I ordered a Matcha Cappuccino with macadamia nut milk, and it was quite tasty. The mac milk is creamy, consistency somewhere in the middle on a scale of almond milk to oat milk. 

Half my drink was ice, though. Definitely on the expensive side."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-07-15,4.0,"Cha Cha Matcha holds up to their name of matcha flavored everything! The flavors are strong and they certainly don't skimp on the amount of green tea powder they use in every menu item. The $5 matcha soft serve is tasty and delightful on a hot summer day. They measure out accurately and precisely the amount of drink that goes into your cup. If you ask for less ice then it will seem like you're getting less drink in your cup. When in reality it's because that space isn't filled with ice.

Definitely an IG place with the color schemes, artwork, and napkins. However, for once, the price point matches the quality. Lots of seating inside and outside. They have a cool hipster crew working the counter."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-06-13,5.0,"I have come here several times and love it! 

The decor is very cute and cool. I love the vibe. Loud music and it's usually a good choice. 

The drinks are all very refreshing! I cannot stand coffee or the way it makes me feel but I love matcha. I come here when I am tired and dehydrated and always leave feeling better. The last time I came I got the new special which is a peach beverage with cbd. It had a subtle but good flavor, and was something I would order again. 

I also got one of the desserts for the first time. It was a croissant-(muffin?) hybrid with strawberry filling. Oh my gosh. It was perfect! The thing I love most about it is that it was sweet but not too sweet. It also had an amazing soft, airy texture. It did not feel too rich or too sugary. 

Be prepared to pay manhattan prices when you come, but it's worth it when you just need to treat yourself."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-05-15,5.0,"This place baffles me. I'm a skeptic when it comes to new trends and this place is riding high on the matcha train. I never even liked matcha before! I've tried Cha Cha Matcha once for the experience. You walk in, get your super duper pricey beverage (close to $10 for some post tax!), post to your Insta (the real reason you and everyone else are here at first) and move on with your life. 

But then, somehow, I kept returning. The vibe here is awesome. The people behind the counter seem to genuinely have a good time. And the beverages themselves are actually delicious. Try the Beautiful drink, it's got collagen (!) and perhaps some crack because my addiction is running strong these days. I'll be there in the afternoon for my 3pm pick me up. Also, their soft serve is THE perfect thing to have on a hot day. I love you so matcha!"
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-09-29,3.0,"Visited Cha Cha Matcha today for the first time. I've heard some hype for this place for a while now and decided to try it out. First off, the drinks start at $6 minimum and go higher from there. I ordered a $6 chai matcha drink with coconut milk and it came out to be $7.50 after tax. My drink was good and visually...it's pretty. But I'm not sure I would ever go back for a $7+ dollar beverage. I wouldn't knock someone for being a regular but personally there are so many options in the city that I don't need to pay a $7+ price point for."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-06-12,1.0,"I was walking over the Penn Station from 10th st and needed something to cool me off. This place looked popular and so I went in to grab a Pink Drink(with Hibiscus, Rose hips, Bee Pollen, and Maca)[$7]. I would say that the drink is refreshing, just like an iced water. It was a watered down sour taste with a hint of hibiscus, similar to Starbucks Refreshers. I'm happy that I purchased a cold beverage to beat the heat, but at the same time, I would have rather bought cold bottled water for a fraction of the price. 

I might come again to try their soft serve, but definitely not their drinks. It always arouses my suspicion when I see mechanical mixers for matcha. 

This is a great Instagram spot place for hipsters and trend followers with options including CBD, vegan milk, blue algae, and collagen, but I would never recommend this place to anyone who just wants a good drink."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-03-24,4.0,"Trendy little matcha cafe! I loved that this place had a simple and easy to understand menu. They don't do coffee, but they specialize in matcha and other latte and cappuccino style drinks with healthy supplements. 

I had a matcha cappuccino. It looked super tiny for the $6 it cost, but it was delicious! In addition to the drinks, Cha Cha Matcha also offers match soft serve and to go matcha products for home. I'd love to go back and try some more menu items!"
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-12-04,5.0,I loooove Cha cha matcha! As soon as you enter you are greeted by the happiest employees. What a wonderful atmosphere! And the place is seriously the most instagrammable. I had a hot chai tea latte and my cousin had an iced one. This place even offers matcha ice cream! It was too cold in New York to try it but definitely next time.
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2020-02-23,1.0,"Been going here regularly since last year, all locations in NYC (Downtown and Flatiron). Had no complaints until I ordered 2 matcha soft-serve ice creams only for the machine to run out while the casier was filling 1/3 of the first cup I had ordered. The cashier tried to convince me that the amount she filled before the machine breaking was the normal serving size (which it was not in comparison to the other times I have gotten the soft-serve and to my friend who has just received hers), and that she was still going to charge me full price. After quite a hard time convincing her to refund me for both ice creams, she told me that she had refunded the $11 back into my card. The money has NOT been refunded to me until now, 2/23. I have called dozens of times with no answer and emailed the company as well. 

This is not the first time this has happened. The Matcha Soft- Serve always runs out and has run out midway into my order. 

The cashier working at that time was extremely rude to me and gave me such a hard time to rightfully get my money back simply for the ice creams I DID NOT RECEIVE. After tax, each ice cream is $5.17 which is NOT cheap at all. 

I used to LOVE this place but now it has become clear to me that the rude and poor customer service, inability to do what it takes to reimburse the customer for their machine running out , and provide adequate service of making enough dessert to serve for the day is simply unacceptable. 

Above this, the workers are usually not on task, seen making ""Tik Tok"" videos on social media while on the job, and providing free drinks and desserts to their friends that go behind the counter. In my experience, I have seen a man who is a regular at the W27th and Broadway location, receive free drinks and drink containers filled with ice cream, as the lady working asked him if he ""wanted anything to take home."" All of this occurred without paying. 
The workers are being paid to give out free drinks to their friends and post videos to social media? This is extremely unprofessional. 

I am writing this extremely DISSATISFIED with the treatment I received and competence of the workers at the W27th and Broadway location!!!!"
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-10-25,2.0,"This place is comically expensive, and even funnier when you consider how there is a Starbucks a block over!!! Curiosity won the best of me when I walked my way over to try the ""pink drink."" To my dismay, it was tasteless, bland, having the faintest taste of hibiscus flowers. Blah. Why pay nearly $6+ taxes when I can get the same kind of drink, that tastes better, for half the price, with free refills, next door? 

Also, this place more recently started selling their house blend matcha in jars, for $50!!! I can't speak on how authentic the powder might be, but I have news for you. The one I buy in distributed by Korean and Japanese vendors never go over $10 for a standard 16 oz bag. I have no idea where Cha Cha gets its high horse from, but $50 ain't it. There is absolutely nothing special about their matcha to be pricing it at such a high point. But hey, I guess supply in demand? Maybe you're paying for the space you're occupying in this cute little Los Angeles themed cafe abundant with palm tree print walls and quirky/Instagram friendly light installations, but I'm going to keep my distance de this place. Cute, yes she is, but expensive and flavorless. And no one care for those kind of people, other than a benign and experimfirst date."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-05-07,5.0,"As an ice cream connoisseur, I was super impressed with Cha Cha Matcha's ice cream. $5 for this??! You can't even get a coffee bigger than your fist for $5! Thought I would hate the banana swirl because the flavor would be that artificial banana but it was nothing like that. It tasted like flambé bananas and the matcha was the perfect compliment to the banana's sweetness. 

Love this (did I mention I came back 2 days later for another one?)."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-09-05,5.0,"Matcha lattes are all the craze but mix that with a beautiful aesthetic and you have a winning combination! You could see the bright pink and lime green from down the street, we knew we had to stop in! C

haCha Matcha uses ceremonial ground matcha, so all the benefits of the calm focus and calorie burn without the jitters. There are various drinks with matcha from lattes, lemonade or chai as well as classic coffee drinks, cold brew and espresso. 

There are also sweets like match croissants, vegan banana bread and ice cream. I went for the swirl of matcha ice cream and lavender ice cream. So refreshing and delicious. 

Plenty of opportunities for pictures here so have your camera ready!"
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-09-02,5.0,"5/5 stars for overall experience. First of all, this might be one of the cutest places to grab a matcha in the city (perfect for instagram photos). The staff was friendly and helpful recommending beverages and preparing them quickly. As a first time matcha drinker, I had the matcha latte (they have tons of different milks to cater to any dietary restrictions). It was delicious- I am now hooked on matcha. They also have matcha soft serve which I didn't realize until after we ordered so will be back again soon to try it."
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-10-21,5.0,"First time trying a matcha with ginger and turmeric, and wow have I been missing out! Such a great mix, who would have thought?! I wish I could have tried all of their drinks, all such unique combinations and I'm sure quite delicious.

Also, who ever their decorator is, please come decorate my home! So obsessed with the pink and green vibe.

Stop on by for your next caffeine fix and IG pic ;-)"
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-03-01,4.0,"How could you resist this fun, colorful Matcha shop when your strolling through flatiron in the freezing cold of winter. I popped in for a hot drink and observed I had entered a super trendy spot. Tons of people were sitting, hanging, chatting and drinking Matcha. There was a decent amount of seating for a small shop despite the crowd, drinks were served up quickly! 
They have a list of Matcha combos + several milk options for those avoiding traditional dairy. A bunch of variations for the Matcha connoisseur or just a cute place to have a tea break with a friend. I got the regular matcha latte with coconut milk and I'll be back to try others!"
622,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-9,2019-10-23,2.0,"I do not understand the hype about this place. There are always lines flooded out the door at all of their locations and many people speak highly of their beverages. We got a matcha lemonade and a matcha latte and both of the drinks lacked matcha flavor. My drink tasted like watered down lemonade with a subtle hint of mint, while the other drink just tasted like milk. I'm not a fan of the drinks but I guess the aesthetics are nice."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2020-03-12,5.0,"HARBS is a favorite of mine, you really cannot go wrong. They make specialty cakes with Japanese influences that are cute and taste great!

Atmosphere 5/5

The interior is very bright and warm. I have had HARBS before, but this was our first time visiting this specific location so we were surprised to find that the dining area is behind the display. They asked if we wanted to dine in or if we wanted our order for takeout, which I did not expect because they didn't seem to have seating. We preferred to eat in and the staff directed us to another section of the restaurant with tables and the like. 

We also enjoy art and were delighted to see that the walls had art hanging on them.  They depicted beautiful plants and added to to the atmosphere of the establishment.

Staff 5/5

The staff was very friendly and they accurately answered our questions regarding the food they offer. I liked the vintage-like clothes that the staff wore because they also added to the style of the restaurant. It was also nice to see that the staff was always smiling and had very warm personalities who never let your glass of water run dry.

Food 5/5

The cakes tasted great, but I might be biased. I love cake and HARBS has some of the best I've had. We had the Banana Cream Pie and the Mille Crepes, one cake for each person, and we were full after a single slice of cake! The banana cream pie was truly filled with bananas! The Mille Crepe, on the other hand, had a delicious combination of cream and fruit that is to die for. You can taste each of its layers, which is especially good. Additionally, the cream is not like regular cream that people buy from the supermarket. The cream wasn't too sweet and tasted as if it were made from scratch in the restaurant (full disclosure, I am not sure if it is though). The milk was rich and fluffy as if you were eating a cloud. 

Many people like to compare HARBS to a similar Japanese bakery called Lady M's. Personally, I think HARBS' Mille cake is better than Lady M's. For the price, HARBS is a little bit more expensive than Lady M, but the cake size is larger and some might even think it tastes better. I'd call it a steal!

HARBS also provides Sakura cake in April when Sakura starts to blossom. I have had it before and am hoping to get one this year too. 

I highly recommend HARBS to anyone. We will most certainly return many times over."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2020-01-18,5.0,"What an amazing place to come!!!
Their desserts are to die for, accompanied with the tea and you will be there once a week at least. 
A family owned business, with friendly staff and an awesome menu. 
Awesome"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-12-30,5.0,"A really nice surprise, we ordered the chocolate custard cake and it was amazing
Great service, excellent cakes and coffee was delicious as well
For sure I'll coming back to try more"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2020-03-06,4.0,"Stopped in here at a whim and we were pleasantly surprised! Delicious Japanese flavored cakes that are a bit expensive but very worth it. Amazing service and a really cute cafe to attend. Nice place for a date or a hangout with a friend. I tried the chocolate cake that had cream puffs and loved it, my friend had the crepe cake and loved the fresh fruit inside of it. Can't wait to try the other cakes."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2020-03-05,3.0,Came for the tea but the cake captured us. The tea was okay. Nothing special about the tea but the sponge cake was really good.
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-12-19,4.0,"Not much to say, but this was good ol' Japanese patisserie excellence. Not sure how I feel about this versus Lady M's crepes - this has more cream between layers, primarily due to the inclusion of a variety of fruit slices between the crepe layers. That made for a very messy eating experience as layers collapsed all around and cream spilled out as we cut into the cake with our spoons.

Mille Crepes (six layers of thin crepes filled with fresh fruits and mixed cream)"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2020-02-28,4.0,"Cute and quaint! It's such a a nice spot to catch up with friends over cake and tea. They close at 10pm and we got there around 9:30pm. Fortunately, there were plenty of slices left, however, they informed us that the drink bar was closed. A little disappointed they couldn't serve us tea (since it's just a tea bag and hot water), but the servers were really pleasant and respectful. Bathroom was clean and there's a lot of seats inside the shop. Will definitely come here again!"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-11-06,4.0,"The mille crepes here are slightly different from lady M's since there is more cream in between the layers and has actual slices of fruit. The dessert here reminds me more of an actual slice of cake but still good nonetheless. 

This place is a good alternative to Lady M usually without as big of lines and multiple locations. I really enjoyed the crepe and the green tea we got as a side."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-09-07,4.0,"Interior--a lot of open seating and plenty of room. Counter/take out service by the entrance, and sitting area right behind it.

Service--pretty good, nothing in particular stood out. But since you're paying $11-13 for a slice of cake, the cake comes out HUGE!

Taste--I wanna say their crepe cake tasted really light compared to others'. It felt more like I was eating a slice of fruit cake instead of crepe cake, the fruits were overpowering. The Marron cake was better! Love the hint of rum. The chestnut though was overwhelmingly sweet so we couldn't finish the piece.

I read that their cakes are Japanese inspired, so if you like something lighter and different than the typical dessert, definitely try it out."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2020-01-02,4.0,"Finally decided on HARBS after an extensive yelp search of dessert places in the area.  My boyfriend and I just wanted to share a slice of cheesecake, but we were told there's a 1-item per person minimum.  I ordered a cup of tea to go with it for a whopping $9.  The tea was just about as expensive as the cake slice.  We ordered the Irish cream cheesecake because it was late at night and they were understandably out of many flavors.  The cake wasn't terribly sweet, similar to other Asian inspired desserts I've tried.  It was good nonetheless.  The whipped cream on top was what contained most of the Irish cream flavor, with not too heavy of a flavor in the cake itself.  I'd like to try some of the other varieties of cake, but I'm really not down for the minimum items and overpriced tea, so maybe I'll get it to go next time."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2020-01-19,5.0,"We were in the mood for a light dessert so we stopped by HARBS after dinner. They have a policy of one order per customer so we ordered the mille crepe and the mint tea. The mille crepe was very airy and fluffy with various fruits between each layer. I saw a lot of reviews that compared these crepe cakes to the ones at Lady M, and I personally prefer the crepe cakes at HARBS. The mint tea came in a glass teapot and we asked for a refill before heading out. The mint paired really well with the fruit in the crepe cake. We paid about $11-13 for the slice of cake but it was well worth it in my opinion. The slice came out larger than we anticipated and it was the perfect portion to share between two people. If you're looking for a lighter dessert option, I would definitely recommend this place."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-08-31,5.0,"Came in to cool off and enjoy some dessert. Interior is really nice (past the initial storefront) and has a modern cafe feel.

All we had were some iced teas and a slice of cheesecake but everything was all good. I like that the drinks came out in little carafes with labels. Cheesecake was fluffier than I'm used to but paired nicely with the teas.

Service was friendly but definitely a ""sit down and enjoy your stay"" kind of location. Wouldn't recommend if you're kind of in a rush. Enjoy every second of it!"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-12-08,5.0,"Whenever I'm in the mood for cake or just want somewhere spacious and quiet to enjoy some dessert after dinner, I end up at Harbs. The front of the store features various cakes that you can take out, while the back has plenty of seating where you can order through a server. I've tried many of their cakes and drinks, and they've all been consistently delicious. I think my favorite though is the strawberry sponge cake. It's simple, fluffy, and not too sweet. But whatever cake you decide to go with, you can't go wrong. Last time I was here, I tried the seasonal white grape jasmine tea, which had actual grapes inside the teapot. The subtle fruit taste went well with the floral fragrance of jasmine. Another interesting thing is that they use frozen coffee as the ice cube in iced latte - pretty smart / cool!"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-07-15,4.0,"These cakes are what dreams are made of. They're huge, they're fluffy, and they're tasty.

You definitely don't need one per person considering how big and expensive they are. Between 3 people we tried the Marron and Waguri tarte cakes. Both had alcohol in them. The waguri was really good and had an amazing whipped cream in it. The Marron wasn't a favorite for us because the texture of the chestnut was a bit of a weird coating.

Would love to come back and try the seasonal options and favorites next time."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-04-12,5.0,"Ever since I first visited HARBS a while back, I have become a big fan of their cakes. I also loved their omelet sandwich too. But after finding out that this locations offers pasta dishes for brunch, we headed over right away! They actually call it ""Lunch Set"" that is offered every day, and comes with a side salad, tea or coffee, and a slice of a cake! 

I chose Bolognese for my Lunch Set. It was large in portion, much bigger than I expected. It was delicious, comforting with a subtle sweetness. Each bite was pleasant, we really enjoyed it. And yes, it was quite filling!

My hubby went with a seafood pasta, Pescatora. This one looked great too, with a large shrimp placed on top like a shiny prize. It only had about a couple of each seafood and shellfish pieces, but somehow substantial enough. They were plump and perfectly seasoned. Tomato sauce had nice sweetness to it. It was really tasty!

As for the dessert, you get to choose from several ""today's cake."" The ""Lunch Slice"" that comes with the Lunch Set is about the half portion of their regular slice. I went with Green Tea Mousse, and my hubby went with Irish Cream Cheesecake. They were both really good, rich, high quality, flavorful and simply delicious. 

They had mostly Japanese staffs, and the service was polite, although not overly friendly. They have other cakes and Lunch menu items that I really want to try, so we need to make more trips to HARBS for some tasty brunch!"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-11-01,4.0,"On a weekday afternoon, you can linger in this spacious cafe for hours. We order one of many specialty tea that comes in their little glass tea pot, mine was a refreshing decaf mint tea. Their baked goods are to die for, all their cakes and pies are made daily with very light and airy cream, perfect amount of sweetness and freshest fruits. We shared a generous piece of yummy banana cream pie. Service was perfect, server come only when you get their attention, other wise they don't disturb your conversations."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-04-13,4.0,"TLDR: Sakura cake good to try but probs wouldn't get again. 

Came to HARBS for the first time and tried the Sakura cake since it looked the most unique to HARBS and was a limited edition ""cake"". This ""cake"" was probably more of a mousse with a little bit of cake on the bottom than an actual cake. Personally, I would've liked a bit more cake (at least 50/50) because the mousse became boring to ear after a while. The overall flavor is very light and airy and since it is limited edition, it might be good to try if you're into mousse cakes. 

The set up of the store is a little interesting. The first thing you see when you come in is a counter you can order at if you're on the go but don't worry because there is a sit-down area in the back."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-12-26,5.0,"We randomly passed by this cake shop while looking for desserts. Beware short people, their counter is really tall and the workers are really short. 

Food: Delicious. Light and airy without being too sweet. You can really taste the matcha flavor and it's packaged in a beautiful to go box and bag. 

Service: The cashiers were very attentive and they were ready to answer any questions we had. There is a dining area in the back (which we didn't know initially) and they immediately brought us glasses of water. 

Vibe: There's a big no photography sticker on the cake display, which was disappointing. We wanted to take photos of all the cakes and share with friends and family. The sign made it seem like they wanted their cakes to be private, which is weird. Also, as I mentioned earlier, there is seating in the back if you want to dine in. They also serve regular food, not just cakes. 

Overall: yummy and beautiful cake."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-04-17,3.0,"Stopped by on a hot afternoon while making our way to see the Vessel. Apparently this is the ""original"" Lady M of sorts, so of course I had to check it out. Inside is a little small but cozy and gives Japanese/Parisian vibes. Our waitress was absolutely adorable and friendly. Do note that it's expected for every person to order one item each. We were a little surprised as the original game plan was to get one and split it. Due to that, we ended up ordering the queen strawberry ($13) and the original Mille crepe ($13). The slices were delicate, light, and refreshing after sweating in the sun for too long. The layers melted in our mouth immediately. The Mille (their most popular one) was not my favorite. I thought it was pretty basic as the banana overwhelmed the other fruits. The queen strawberry was definitely the better of the two, but still not mind blowing. 

I enjoyed the experience, but I don't think it's worth it at the price point. I could get a lot better desserts with that money in NYC."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-10-12,4.0,"I first heard about HARBS when I was in high school ten years ago. My Japanese friend from Tokyo has highly recommended me of visiting HARBS when I'm in Tokyo. Consequently I didn't even have to visit Tokyo because, HARBS exists in NYC!

I became an instant fan of the generous sized cake slices at HARBS. I had the White peach cheesecake, which was pretty good but didn't become one of my favorite. The prices are about the same as slices in Lady M, but if you want more variety than what's provided at Lady M, I recommend giving HARBS a try. One good thing about HARBS is that when you get the cakes to go, the staff will provide ice packs for the cakes so that the cake will keep cool. It's a norm in Japan but I've only seen it done here in NYC.

It's too bad that the price is not cheaper than cakes at Lady M, but I'm curious how other cakes from HARBS are. I'm pretty sure I'll be back at least once to give other cakes a try sometime."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-11-11,5.0,"I've walked by this location several times, and always saw the cakes through the window. Little did I know that it had a full seating area in the back with proper lunch entrees in the back, as well! Came here on a Sunday afternoon with a friend and we were able to find seating right away. Service here is also very quick! I had the lunch set, which is a great deal: for $25, I got a generous cup of English breakfast tea, a starter salad, a choice of entree (I got the chicken and mushroom pasta - sandwiches or salads are $22 for the set), and a choice of cake (I got the renowned Mille crepes). The pasta was very tasty - I'm a huge mushroom fan, so I appreciated the generous helping and variety of mushrooms. The Mille crepes also live up to the hype - I really enjoyed the fruit pieces in the cake! Would definitely come back to try some of the other desserts, as well!"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-10-25,4.0,Loved how these cakes were just the right amount of sweetness. You can definitely eat one my yourself and not feel the heaviness of the sugar!
623,harbs-new-york-2,2020-01-23,5.0,I got cake here and it was amazing!! The cafe is cute and also has lunch options which I want to try out next time. I loved the rare cheesecake which tasted like a light cream cheese cake with some hint of zest (definitely yummier than I'm making it sound). The mille crepe cake was delicious and had a variety of fruit. I had the fancy strawberry cake and I wasn't a big fan of that one. It had some alcohol taste to it that didn't resonate with me. I'd like to try the original strawberry cake next time.
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-09-16,5.0,"I love Harbs. It's one of the must-visit dessert shops in Tokyo. They have 3 locations in the city and I believe the cakes are supposed to be the same as the ones in Japan. They sell pasta and other brunch items as well but the cakes are what they are famous for, especially the crepe cake. Crepe cakes are so fresh! The cream and each layer of fruits and thin crepes make an amazing combination and they aren't sweet at all. My favorite cakes include the japanese style cheesecake, chestnut cream and green tea, but you really can't go wrong with any of them. Japanese cakes are nice since their creams aren't as heavy and also not as sweet as american cakes.

They have sitting inside and actually a lot more tables that it looks from the front as it's a long narrow store. You can enjoy variety of tea they have with a piece of cake in a busy city."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2020-02-01,1.0,"The worst dessert place l've ever  been!!!!! first it's mandatory one item for each person and if you order a pot of Tea they ONLY gives you ONE cup. PLUS their tea taste like trash, ( like they got their tea leave from the side walk) lol, barely can finish  one pot of tea with four people. Definitely not coming back. Ewwww"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-08-07,4.0,"Finally!!! HARBS!!! Long review short - the cakes here are absolutely superb! Perfect portions by the slice, super yummy and not overly sweet at all! Usually with dessert, cakes tend to get too much towards the end, but not at Harbs! We had no trouble finishing down to the last bite!

Now the drinks...they are pretty and all, but honestly a little too pricy, they were equivalent to the price of a slice of cake...so, if you want a less hefty bill, skip out on the drinks.

BUT I would definitely go back for the other cakes!"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-07-06,4.0,"Stopped by here with a friend while we were trying to kill some time. We wanted to share a slice of strawberry cake, but they ask that each person orders one thing, so we ordered a Green Tea as well. The cake was good, but for the price should have been better, especially considering other Asian bakeries (Paris Baguette, Tous Les Jours) offer slices of cake at the same quality level for cheaper prices. I've had the strawberry cake at Paris Baguette and wouldn't be able to tell you the difference between that and this one from HARBS. The tea was quite good, but again, a little overpriced. 

If you're simply craving cake/dessert, I would skip this place for one of the aforementioned bakeries; however, if you're looking for a sit-down service place and don't mind spending a little more, I would check this place out."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2018-12-26,2.0,"Unfortunatley, I am on the 2/3 average star rating for this place. Yes, Harbs is a lovely ""looking"" tea room with decadent ""looking"" pastries to indulge in. The customer service was good and their To-go bags and boxes are adorable. However, that's where the admiration stops.

I was a little taken aback by the prices of the cake slices but withdrew my surprise and just decided to treat myself: $10/slice for the Marron Cake and $11/slice for the Chocolate custard cake. Both have rum in them so I expected the taste to match the beautiful ""looking"" cakes.

The Marron Cake was better tasting than the Chocholate custard cake but both were underwheleming and a waste of calories in my opinion. I love pastries and these were a large disappointment.  To assure you that I was not alone in this opinion I shared some of the cakes with my family and they too were not impressed by the taste but did agree they were pretty to look at."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-10-24,5.0,"Really tasty cakes. 

I am trying their Mille cake. The crepe one with a lot of fruit. (Stuffed from having a chicken noodle.) I am very surprised how less sweet it is! Some of the fruits like the kiwi and the strawberry makes this very tart. I can only imagine their banana custard pie would be good. They have a good custard cream that isn't too sweet.

There used to be this french bakery in Providence where I used to frequent. Their sweets were too sweet, IMHO. I am glad this is way better!

I have only had the green tea mousse- is very good. I do prefer Lady M's for more of their green tea sponge.

This is way better than Paris Baguette. 
I am glad I got to try the Mille cake. 

Only in the area would I go. Great place to stop after gallery hopping in Chelsea."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-07-05,4.0,"I came here for dessert after having lunch nearby.  The place is cute and there's a lot of seating.  We ordered the yuzu sencha tea, the fruit cocktail tea, and a slice of the mille crepes (layers of fruit and crepes) cake.  The yuzu sencha has a nice bitter finish whereas the fruit cocktail tea has a sweeter finish.  You can request as many hot water refills as possible.  After two hot water refill requests, the tea does get diluted though.  The tea is high quality and has a robust flavor.  The mille crepes cake was fresh and light.  There was a lot of fruit: strawberries, kiwi, honeydew melon, and bananas in the cake.  The cake slice was large enough to share between two people.  The place was a bit pricey but the quality was very high.  Service was attentive and fast.  I would come back and try their other cakes."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-06-15,4.0,"TL;DR: Japanese tea parlor inspired by the French serves deliciously unique cakes and soul warming teas. 

Step inside this tea parlor, and take a look around. 
The warm lights and wicker furniture will draw you in. 
Inside you'll be greeted with so many smiling faces,
It will be hard for you to not also grin. 

On the menu you'll find many teas and sweets, 
from super light and refreshing to something dark and deep. 
From a classic cup of English tea to a light cup of green, 
Harbs offers a flavor for every tastebud in between. 
The only time you'll really wait is for the time it takes your tea to steep, and you'll find the service is so attentive it might make you weep.

Our strawberry cake tasted like a strawberry pancake with whipped cream, 
The pastry alone would be no ones dream.
Thankfully though, it wasn't a disaster; the fluffy whipped cream was the biggest redeeming factor. 

The Irish cream was thicc with two c's, 
But somehow magically still as light as could be. 
The flavor was subtle and complex, 
Every bite was delightful and we couldn't wait for the next."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-09-15,4.0,"The café itself is pretty cozy and cute! They display the case at the front is really beautiful. The strawberry cake was pretty good, it wasn't too sweet which I did enjoy at first, but it was almost boring flavor wise. The green tea mousse cake was better, I really liked how the green tea flavor came through, and the red bean in the bottom layer was really nice because it added a moment of sweetness that went well with the slightly bitter green tea.

Service was really good, and I would go back to try their teas with their cakes next time."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2020-04-24,5.0,"I heard about HARBS from my friends who told me they were jealous of me moving to NYC because I have access to HARBS, so I came in with high expectations. It's a quaint dessert cafe that has multiple locations, and I was greeted by a full display case of a variety of gorgeous cakes. I tried out the mille crepe and the chestnut marron cake. The mille crepe (six layers of thin crepes filled with fresh fruits and mixed cream) and Marron cake (layers of white sponge, chestnut and sweet potato cream, and crushed chestnut with a hint of rum). The mille crepe was filled with fresh cream and a ton of fresh fruit. The chestnut flavour in the marron cake was mild and not overpowering. Both cakes were extremely light and fluffy, and the perfect amount of sweetness. I knew I had to come back to try out the other flavours so a few days later I tried out the green tea mousse cake (bittersweet green tea sponge and mousse with Dainagon red beans covered with fresh whipped cream). The green tea flavour was rich, the bitterness balanced the sweetness of the red beans. The sponge was fluffy and the mousse was light, an amazing combination. Looking forward to coming back and trying out the other flavours!"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2018-12-16,5.0,"I was only in NY for 5 days, and I came to HARBS twice! I tried both the upper east store and this location. Both had delicious cakes! 

This time, I tried the green tea moose and queen cake with strawberries and blueberries. The presentation is so gorgeous, and the cakes taste great! 

I love how they're not overly sweet like a lot of the American desserts. The cream is also very light-- and I'm not even a big fan of cream, but I love theirs."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-06-10,4.0,"Overall: 3.5; Food: 3.5; Atmosphere: 4; Service: 3.5

I come for the atmosphere. I like sitting in the tea parlor type environment and it's always a great place to catch up with old friends over a slice of cake or tea.

Food: 3.5
Good variety of beautiful cakes, but they're more on the light and airy side (Asian cake style). Even then they are tasty, but not incredible.

Atmosphere: 4
See above. It's large so there's almost never a wait and you don't have to feel cramped. It's a place where you can sit around for a while and just take your time."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-06-28,3.0,"I've visited Harbs multiple times from when they first opened their Chelsea location a few years ago, and have yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered. In Japan they tend to be known for their large cake sizes, but by American standards you could say it's average. My favorites are the strawberry cake and chocolate cake, neither of which are overly sweet. A majority of their selections have nuts though which limits my choices out of preference, but would be an even bigger inconvenience for those with allergies. As for their drinks, I'm a fan of their yuzu sencha tea - it's overpriced for sure (as with their cakes), but worth paying for every once in a while.

The interior of their Chelsea location is clean and pleasant, and can get pretty crowded on the weekends. Even when it's not busy though, it's not the easiest to get the attention of servers so I wish they could be a bit more attentive.

Another thing that irks me is their strict policy that their teas are for 1 person per order, and they refuse get you another cup to share. It's ridiculous being told what you can and can't share as a customer, especially if you're ordering so many of their other delicious food and drinks! It's not hard to find a way around this, so I don't know why they even bother enforcing this policy."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-07-28,5.0,"Super cute Japanese tea room. Great atmosphere, servers are attentive and food here is high-quality! The cakes are so fluffy, big, and tasty! My friend and i usually share a slice of cake and get a pot of tea. The tea list is extensive, definitely don't miss out on the tea when you come here. 

This place is a little overpriced, but certainly a good place to spend your afternoon with friends. 100% better than Lady M in my opinion"
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-12-22,4.0,I just love Harbs. Its a bit on the pricey side but the service is upperclass. The cake I always have is the regular sponge cake with cream and strawberries and DAMN its so good. Why? Because its so different from the overly sugared cream sh%#t American deserts mostly offer. So yes pay these few $ extra and sit like a Royal in a of course over simplified Asian restaurant ambience... lol
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-06-03,4.0,"Recently went to the other harbs, but since they are all the same, figured I would leave an update here:

Harbs is still a nice place to have afternoon tea and cake. My favorites are the strawberry cake and the banana cream pie. The chestnut cake is passable, but I probably wouldn't order this one myself."
623,harbs-new-york-2,2019-07-23,2.0,"This place came as a recommendation and my friends visiting from out of town really wanted to try it.  I immediately looked at the pics from Yelp and I already knew the place would be a let down, and it was.  One slice of cake is really expensive.  I have no issue with the price, but be good, and all the cakes were extremely flavorless.  From the pics, I could tell the cakes would be weak on flavor.  It was dry and not moist at all.  The lack of flavor and a high price tag makes this place a letdown.  

I will say, the actual restaurant itself has a nice ambiance and I had a great relaxing time with my friends.  But I wanted yummy cake bursting with flavor, and that is not what I got.  Tastes are subjective, so definitely check this place out, and make your own determination."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2020-03-23,4.0,"it took a pandemic crisis to understand how much i enjoy paris baguette and the whole wheat bread slices and the baguette loafs as well. not much open near my office and mcdonalds is only allowed once a week the most so having a pb on 32nd st and 5th ave is a short walk for me. a smart move by pb and i hope its a permanent one is the self pick  goodies are now each plastic sealed for freshness and more important for avoiding germs from dirty hands . love the chicken soup, the margarita foccacia loaf and the mini garlic crossiants. i tend to go a bit overboard and grab too much stuff but by the end of the day its all gone. the cakes and pies are a bit underrated and a  little pricey but order a few slices which will run you about 7 bucks (blueberry chiffon and vanilla creme yogurt are my fave). many good food items to choose from and the early bird gets the hot breakfast crossiants before they sell out. overall 4 stars on my yelp meter ."

Luckily, they have a coffee/tea menu so I ordered a cup of iced tea and it helped cut down the greasiness and the sweetness but it's a little overpriced. 

I love their birthday cakes cus it is very sophisticatedly made. The cream is very smooth and milky and the cake is very spongy."

624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2020-05-23,1.0,"Although I appreciate their effort & presentation towards trying to be ""French,"" it is far from the quality of actual French pastries you will find in quality French bakeries.  For one thing, a lot of their pastries are much sweeter than they need to be which ruins the taste instead of enhancing it.  Additionally, the quality is just not there compared to the French bakeries that have pastries that actually taste like authenic French style pastries.  I wished Paris Baguette would focus more on quality than capitalistic profit.  The ingredients they use are too cheap quality which ruins the outcome/product."

The taste was good - not too sweet, but I thought the consistency would be fluffier. It could have also been because we had one that was right out of the fridge, so if you do get it, maybe wait for it to get to room temperature? This location is also super busy since it's right in K-Town. Doubt I will be back. At least not to this one. I do love their curry croquettes though!"
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-11-15,3.0,"Though Paris Baguette is the gold standard by which other Korean bakeries are measured against, I had to demote a star, as I just tried to order two of their specialty drinks and both were unavailable, so I settled for a hot chocolate. That being said, everything I've had here is tasty and well-made. 
   It's near my job, so the convenience factors in to my score and it is usually less crowded than the popular Tous Les Jours down the block (though not tonight).
   My favorite are the sweet potato sticks (can't remember exactly what they're called), light and airy, sprinkled with black sesame seeds. They make for a nice light snack. The green tea latte is also pretty good, though some might prefer TLJ. Can't go wrong with the hot chocolate, though."

624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-09-07,4.0,"Paris Baguette is a pretty common chain that specializes in pastries and desserts. Everything here looks very appetizing and if you have a sweet tooth, you'll feel like you're in heaven. I always go with desserts containing strawberries so I went with the strawberry cream croissant and strawberry cream cake. The cake had a little bit too much icing for me while the croissant was not as flaky and fresh. Regardless, the flavors are still awesome and there were more than enough chairs to sit down and enjoy the food."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-12-02,3.0,"It's time to deliver a necessary years overdue recompense to Paris Baguette. Today's penultimate final straw was how when presented with the MealPal for the wrong location, the cashier (non-Korean, but ok) and the manager (non-Korean, but ok) both gave a wrinkled face as if they couldn't read though the actual issue was they neither took the time nor care to notice how it was the wrong location. Little matter as I made a successful MealPal pickup at the correct location, but it points to what is a lot of problems.

When I found out last week both their 8th Ave and Chinatown locations had both closed sometime ago, I was unsurprised as all Asians in the metro NYC area were observing if their aggressive expansion plans.

My longest running complaints over 3y is their cakes. From 6y to 3y ago, my family and I would for a nearly month pace of someone's birthday would get the blueberry yogurt cake ($36). It was a family favorite since it had rich cream, light blueberry taste, a difficult-to-control recipe, lovely consistency and texture, and overall stellar quality. A restaurant's ability to repeat a dish sets it apart from other providers. We noticed the rapid fall off of all those factors 3y ago and rapidly within 2 cake buys switched to the then rising and equally expanding Tous Les Jours. We've never looked back and after today's incident, am confident we made the correct choice. The total spend forfeitted is literally $100s, so Paris Baguette should take note of the scale of loss.

We also have complaints about their other goods. The problem is they ventured too close to the Chinese baked goods which so so many Chinatown bakers do better for literally 1/3 the price along with Bake Culture and a dozen competitive Korean bakers, big and small all. They also tried midtown Manhattan lunch goods but who'd pay $8-16 for a sandwich worth 1/4-1/2 that? They also flopped in the quality of service as staff clearly turned over quickly and now rarely have any Koreans which puts into question their adherance to their origins. The customers have waned noticably with copious empty space even in this original Manhattan location. Ominuous signs, management. Now usually just 1-2 tourists are spotted, usually from the NYCH physically adjacent, and few others. The throngs of regular Asian girls are gone and with them, a viable future. Paris Baguette tried some rewards program late last year which was namely my entering the receipt number into the app since the app never worked to auto-accept the register's purchase. I also remember 4y ago they gave a free annual print calendar which had 2 coupons monthly. Never used any of the 24+ coupons, even the free item ones, since they were either irrelevant (like some item which made no sense to their business model) or required such an unusually large purchase as would unlikely occur, say, $75 special cake order or $18 lunch item order. Neither mattered to save Paris Baguette's loyalty since they were both so poorly executed.

Paris Baguette's franchise controls have threatened its brand altogether now shrunk back to the basic core locations. Staring at numbers is laggy behind the real customer experience. The basics of business have been lost. How management feels about customers shows in the staff's faces as frequent readers of mine know from my reviews. When the staff are happy, we the customers are happy.

Yelp exists to discover local businesses. We hope namely to discover great ones, but when we write about not great ones, we hope management takes it as direct customer feedback to improve their services and offerings."

We enter the store and everything looks so appetizing! However, because I had such a heavy meal, I end up going with the vanilla and strawberry cake. 

The vanilla cake was very airy, but to the point of not tasting like anything. It felt more airy than an Angel food cake. I felt like the only real flavor was from the sugary whipped cream and some mild strawberries. I was disappointed in my order. 

If I come back to Paris Baguette, I will order something else with more flavor. The other treats look promising, so I wouldn't completely rule this sweets shop out."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2018-12-05,5.0,"Paris Baguette Boulangerie. (Boulangerie, a bakery that specializes in bread and especially in French-style breads).

This is an international Korean bakery-café founded in 1988 specializing in French-inspired breads, cakes, pastries, sandwiches and drinks.  Their pastries are pretty yummy.  They are all pretty yummy that I don't have a favorite.  For something heartier, they also have a sandwich selection, made with their own breads and croissants.  Also for those not into carbs, there is also fresh salads (no wilted greens here) with a protein like chicken or tuna.  I like their chicken salad sandwich, bites of tender chicken, perfectly flavored with mustard and dried cranberries.  And the bread it comes with is oh so good.

Their cakes are a good choice because its light and not overly sweet.  I always come here to buy their awesomely decorated holiday cakes.  Over a dozen designs to choose from.   At my holiday family gatherings, their Christmas cakes are always met with oohs and aahs.  (Truth serum here:  not every style of their Christmas cakes are awesome, some are meh...but I've always found one I really like.)  See my picture for one of this years Christmas decorated cakes.  This year, they are featuring some cakes with little houses that light up!

They have over 20 locations in NYC.  There's always new locations opening up everywhere.

Bonus:  During every Christmas time, they offer a free gift with your cake purchase.  It's different every year.  This year is a coffee mug that changes color when you add a hot liquid into it.

Bonus 2:  Cakes come with a free plastic cake slicer/server and candles."

I known Paris Baguette from Korea and I like their breads. I tried eat all kind of they breads but My favorite is raspberry croissant, pudding, strawberry cake, custard bread. Most of times I couldn't buy raspberry croissant if I went to night time. I love eat sweets and I was in this area so stopped by quick drink coffee and bought some of breads while waited get a table at Wonjo restaurant. 
I could tell you that you should give a try their strawberry cake if you haven't try yet. Even if you don't like sweets, you would enjoy eat that. American cake stores is too sweet but this place strawberry cake isn't like that sweet. If they don't have slices of cake then you can ask them to have it cuz I bought that when I asked them to that if I didn't see any slices of strawberry cake. Their blackberry jam was amazing good too. You should have it if you like eat toast. This place some of worker weren't friendly and I had been argued with one Korean girl who worked this place before. Also this place wasn't clean enough tho. I had to clean table by myself most of time before I seated. Breads was great but service wasn't great then their breads. Nice location but not clean."

624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2020-01-20,5.0,I was having a bit of a rough day and the staff here was just generally very helpful and friendly. They filled my water bottle and offered to hold my drink while I was in the bathroom and it was a respite from the cold. So great job on the customer service! All I drank was tea but the food looked pretty darn good too.
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-11-03,4.0,"I like Korean bakeries.
This bakery is very fun from the entrance to cashier.
There are glass cases with varieties of fancy breads on both side
I know & do understand It's narrow so we the customers in the bakery have to be courteous & careful each other but all those breads are too attractive and fully steal my attention....I tied to pay as much attention as possible around me so I successfully arrived check out counter, but omg, there is another glass case by the cashier with fancy cakes!!!!!!!! 
Anyway, bakes were soooo awesome. I also had 2 jars of pudding and they are soooooo delicious. Deep flavor, not too sweet and melty textured custard pudding!"
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2018-06-18,4.0,"20% off a drink? I'm in! 

Berry matcha latte was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! So refreshing and tasty. Place is busy as it's in the heart of Korea town. Huge selection of cakes, sandwiches and pastries.

There are some seatings by the entrance. Lines can be long at times but they do move fast."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-05-31,2.0,"Pastries are great but service sucks. Literally have so many workers standing by the register and only one is using the register. The other workers are either just talking to each other or are on their phone. Sometimes the line is long and there would still only be one person working at the register, and it would be a really long wait. You have two registers for a reason, use it. They have some many people but only a few are actually working meanwhile the rest are just chilling. I'm trying to get in and get out but because there's only one cashier I have to wait for a long time."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-08-24,1.0,"I visited early this week and they were setting out the daily pastries. Nothing was labeled and I asked someone who was putting them on the selves what they were. She said kept saying that a few of the pastries were the same but it was clearly not. Finally she said she didn't know and I asked her to find out for me. She goes back behind the counter and never returned. After waiting for 10 minutes, I eventually asked a manager and ended up buying one of the pastries. Of course it was mislabeled, hence the wrong one!

A couple other things to note: 

Food wasn't labeled so the manager took out all the labels to place them on the trays. She dropped them on the floor and continued to place them on the food.

Labels were dirty! I mean even before they hit the floor I noticed they all have caked on dirt in the plastic sleeves!

I knew something was off walking in because the whole staff was yelling across the establishment in Spanish with customers in the store!

Sad to say this was always on my way to work, but if I'm buying the pastries I didn't really want I won't be back!"
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-10-06,1.0,"Thief!!!Thief!!!Thief!!!

We bought the chocolate strawberry cake on 10/05/2019. They gave us the cake in the box. We came home and there was no whole cake. They put old bad and dry slices of cake pieces. Those didn't even make a full cake. Are you guys funny to give a knife and candles. This is my third time having bad experience in there. Never knew Paris Baguette are thieves like this!!!! I won't ever go back. Take my money as a charity since you guys are now cheap swindlers. Unbelievable and nastiest service in my life. A note to the owner, Close your store if you are up for stealing like this."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-08-28,5.0,"Omg this place wad amazing. I got the egg and bacon on egg bread. It was so good for a light breakfast. Had the blueberry cream cheese danish,  chocolate croissant, and this walnut covered pastry with cream in the middle. They were all so delicious. Vanilla coffee was bomb as well. If you visit new York,  this place is a must visit if you love pastries."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-01-08,5.0,"Large fan of this spot. Even though it's a chain, the coffee is always good, the cakes are GORGEOUS and the baked goods are delicious. Wish the seating area was a touch bigger, but a convenient spot and a delicious spot to start or end your day."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2018-03-04,4.0,"One of my go to places to buy birthday or just celebratory cakes. The cakes are oriented toward the Asian palette (e.g. green tea, sweet potato) but are generally fresh, spongey and creamy. 

There are whole sample cakes that are on display - so don't try to take them out! You need to wait on the line and tell the cashier which cake you want. The cashier will also ask how many candles you want (free candles yay). After paying, you step to the side until someone calls your number and bring you the cake. 

Paris Baguette also sells pastries, buns and snacks, which are self service! So, grab a tray if you know you want several items!"
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2018-02-15,4.0,"Great variety of pastries, buns, and cakes...sometimes hard to decide what to get. They all taste good so just get a bunch!  

Go there mostly to buy or order cakes...
strawberry shortcake is good, but fave is the blueberry green tea cake. 
All their cakes are very light and delicious. My friends and co-workers love the cakes and look forward to them each time a birthday comes around, or a special celebration! 


Tip: If you want writing on the cake, you need to pre-order at least 2 days in advance.  Easy enough to just go in and buy otherwise.

They provide cake cutter with matches and candles too!!!"
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2018-09-24,4.0,Wow! This was the first Paris Baguette I've been to in New York. This location is in K-Town. They had plenty of bread and cake compared to the one in Georgia. But the only thing that bothered me was that they didn't have Almond/Orange Velvet Iced Tea. I was a bit bummed but glad that there were so many different kinds of cakes and pastries!
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-04-12,4.0,"Their cakes and pastries are so cutee :3 It's like a cake paradise in here! Tried the Strawberry Soft Cream Cake yesterday. I love how light and airy the layers of the cake are. The cream is pretty light too, not overly sweet or heavy. Will definitely come back and try some of the other cake assortments!"
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2018-10-18,4.0,"I think the Paris Baguette concept is cool. This was my first time visiting the store and I was overwhelmed by all the delicious pastries surrounding me from left to right.

I picked 2 items and purchased them at the register with a cold green tea. Would definitely like to try some more items on the menu.

This is the perfect spot for people into croissants and baguettes."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-03-01,5.0,"This is basically my go to place to buy cakes for people at work.  Mostly because (1) it's close to work, (2) there's a variety of cakes to choose from, and (3) the cake comes with candles/cake cutter/matches.  Also, there's a Paris Baguette mobile app now so you can order it on the app and collect points for rewards (1 point per $1 spent).  You need to order the cake in advance (at least 1 day notice) if you want them to personalize it.  They usually will put any words on a lady finger on top of the cake.  They keep coming out with new cakes depending on the season which is great.  I do like the green tea blueberry chiffon cake, strawberry fresh cream cake, and their newest cake best of both worlds (half chocolate cake, half strawberry cream cake).  The cakes are decently priced and look pretty.  It does get packed here so I try to pick up the cake early in the day."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-12-30,3.0,I've been to Paris Baquette all over NY and quality is very consistent.  Typically very clean and food is high quality. I just wish they would try not to become another Starbucks.  Their selection (at least in NY) is not as creative as their locations on Los Angeles or Seoul which I've been to.  It's becoming very American food instead or more creative Korean pastries.
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-03-26,4.0,The aesthetic I'm sure is what brings most people inside. The desserts are very visually appealing especially during the summer when you need to cool down. I grabbed a strawberry cake and a strawberry custard pastry. Both were very good and light. They were also not too sweet so pretty well balanced
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-12-11,4.0,"Loved their bread and coffee. Especially, coffee taste and price of the coffee. The only thing that bothered me was the employees were not so kind or friendly. They were not rude, but not friendly or kind at all."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-11-24,5.0,I live in an area that is not heavily populated with korean people so we don't have anything close to a Paris baguette. It's nice to be able to pop in and instantly be taken back!
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2018-06-27,4.0,"I really enjoyed my breakfast here. It's the kind of place where there are little pastries for $3-5, so if you're eating with multiple people you can try a bit of everything. That way, you get a lot of variety. I love those kinds of places, variety is great.

The pastries are pretty light and airy. The flavor pairings are fun. Overall, the food is definitely good.

I had a really good time and find myself wanting to give five stars, but I just can't. The reason is because the food is not fresh at all. It's all on hot plates and you grab a tray and serve yourself like you would at a cafeteria. The food was still good, but it could be much better if it were fresh. You can easily end up spending $30+, and for that price, I think you can probably get more for your money at a more local family owned French bakery sort of place. Still, Paris Baguette is far from a bad option."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-07-16,5.0,"I have been to this PB multiple times for their banana egg tarts, cheesecakes, cheesy hot dog bread and many others. It carries a lot of memories of morning commuting !"
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2019-03-11,4.0,"This is an awesome spot to avoid the crowd of time square/penn station. The deserts are always good and the iced coffee (with milk and sugar) is better. For a sweet treat under $5, I honestly don't think you can beat coming here, or the other locations in Manhattan."
624,paris-baguette-new-york-2,2018-05-10,4.0,"Delicious quick spot in K-Town for a semi sweet coffee, and feast of the eyes on all the pastry assortments offered. I got the almond croissant which was baked to perfection and with just the right amount of almond paste for an affordable price too!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-03-19,5.0,"The food court is super crowded so it's great that they have their own dine in area. 

Keep coming back for their ""Matcha Lava Cake"". This stuff is DIVINE! Love how well the ooey gooey chocolate pairs with the light and refreshing matcha ice cream.

Enjoyed this so Matcha!

625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-03-14,3.0,"Dessert tasted great like in other locations, good selection and of course amazing look. 
I ordered tea and got plastic cup... they also gave all utensils plastic... I am not sure why... it was very hard and unpleasant to eat with plastic. 
It is not environmentally friendly and just not esthetically appealing."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-03-09,5.0,"Okay. This place ie stupid good. 
This was my first time at this location but second time at this small chain. 
I got monkey bread skillet with a thai tea syrup with coconut icecream and OMG I'm in tears thinking about it. 
Seriously no dessert has any business tasting that good. 
I also tried the oreo chocolate chip cookie, and 10/10 I would fight a child for that. 

This place is kind of tricky to find, enter a small hallway and take the elevator up to 2nd floor to the food court."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-03-08,5.0,"We came on Saturday night with a party of 7 and got seated after waiting 10-20 minutes. We decided on the 5-dessert selection since we were pretty full but wanted to try a lot of different things. We got:
- yuzu Eskimo - was very tart and cream cheese-like
- matcha lava - can't go wrong with this one. This was my favorite
- the harvest (the one that comes in a pot) - also very good
- the monkey bread 
- chocolate forest

My recs are Matcha Lava and The Harvest for sure."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-02-26,5.0,"INCREDIBLE. One of my favorite dessert spots in all of Manhattan. All of the options are so unique and flavorful. When I first moved here I had their matcha lava cake delivered to my place and it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. 
The famous harvest dessert is awesome too if you're looking for something a little on the lighter side. The cookies are also amazing, they are always warm and fresh and, in my opinion, better than Milk bar! 10/10 would recommend."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-04-16,4.0,Good luck finding a seat in the food court seating area we stood around for a little while waiting but the bubble tea was delicious and who could resist the light bulbs! Adorable! I'd come back if I'm in the city
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-01-05,4.0,"This is the original Sport Dessert Bar location and It is located on the third floor of Food Gallery 32.  While I prefer the Flushing location, I will sometimes come here after work when I need a quick dessert.  This location is usually packed.  So, if you don't want to have to hunt for seating, then it's worth doing the table service.  There's a small sectioned area next to the counter for table service. 

The desserts are very tasty and visually engaging.  They come up with some very cute and creative concepts for desserts.  One good example of this is The Harvest (or aka ""the plant pot"") where the dessert is made to look like a potted plant, and you water it by pouring milk over it.

They have three or four desserts that is offered year-round and a few that are seasonal.  My favorite item to order is the Matcha Lava cake.  It consists of a chocolate lava cake with chocolate matcha filling along with a scoop of matcha ice cream.  I've been ordering this dessert for a few years now and still have not gotten tired of it. 

I find it amazing that all the desserts come from their tiny kitchen behind the counter where you order.  Kudos to the staff who make all of that happen."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-01-10,4.0,"This is my second time at Spot, because I kept craving the desserts I got from them the first time! Located on the third floor of the cafeteria in k-town, it's a fun place to stop by whenever I'm in the area.

The first time, I came with two friends, and the three of us split the harvest and the milky puff. The harvest was pretty good -- the combination of the sweet earl grey, the tart raspberry sorbet, and the creamy cheesecake was an interesting one -- though I felt like it was something you ordered more for the pictures than the taste. I was more impressed by the taste of the milky puff. I really liked the combination of flaky pastry and ice cream with sweet honey and bananas. In fact, I liked it so much that I ended up ordering just that again, this time to share between the two of us.

They have their own private seating area, but you can also choose to do ""take out"" and eat in the cafeteria, as long as you can find a spot among the crowds. I remember waiting a bit longer the first time I went, but this time I didn't have to wait as much. Will probably be back the next time I get a craving for the milky puff!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-01-20,5.0,"I usually go to the other location on St. Marks pl. Didn't realize they had a location on W32nd St.  We went on there birthday special sale. which was an awesome deal: a drink, dessert & cookie for $10. Of course I couldn't pass that up. I ordered the Harvest dessert which was really good. The cheesecake & oreo combination taste so good together. Definitely recommend this dessert. 
The cookie champ is good too, would of preferred the cookie to be baked a bit more.  I also ordered the The Taro Milk Tea which was good & the Chocolate chip Cookie which i ate the next day & it was still soft. I wish I would of bought another cookie. 
Service was great, even on that hectic day.

Service - 5

Food - 4

The lovely restaurant front certainly catches the eye, but what is even more interesting are the elegant desserts. What I ordered, aptly named ""The Harvest"", is a classic example of this elegance. While having a cute display and great flavors, I see this dessert more as a way to ""impress one's non-NYC native friends"" rather than a weekly go-to. The price is a little steep for me to be eating desserts from The Spot unless someone is there to admire it first. #datenight"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-11-14,4.0,"Cute lil spot on the third floor of the plaza. They have table service or you could just order to-go at the register.

Tried The Harvest and really liked it! Adorable presentation in the pot but the dessert itself was very good. The cheesecake really paired well with the berries and raspberry sorbet.

Overall, a delightful experience and a great option to catch a dessert. I would try more options!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-11-05,5.0,"This place really hits the sweet spot! I've seen so many pictures on this, I had to try myself. This specific location in the KTown area is inside this small food court mall on the second floor. There is limited sit down seating or you can take it to go. 

We ordered the Harvest [layers of berries, soft cheesecake, oreo crumbs, earl grey milk tea served with raspberry sorbet], which seems like the most iconic item here. The presentation is very spot on! Crushed oreo and top garnish makes it look like a potted plant! It was recommended we pour the earl grey milk tea over the pot. I hope you are a little more graceful than myself because when I poured the tea, instead of staying in the pot, it glazed over the oreo crumbs all onto the plate below. Don't tell me no secrets because I will spill the tea. So anyway, my tip -- pour slowly. 

Even with this little mishap, the dessert was delightful. The cheesecake was incredibly soft and mixed in with the oreo crumb texture and some of the cheescake base was heave in your mouth. The raspberry was a breath of tangy air to the dish too. Would highly recommend!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-11-10,4.0,"Came across this place when we were exploring Koreatown! It's a bit hard to ""spot"" but it's on the third floor of the mini food hall. The couple flights of stairs is definitely worth the trek.

This dessert bar won several Zagat awards and I can definitely see why. The presentation is astounding!... as are the prices... We tried the Chestnut Butterscotch ($11.95) since we've never really heard of such a combination and it was delightful! The warm chestnut miso cake paired well with the light milky ice cream. There were bits of actual chestnut in the cake itself that gave a wonderfully nutty flavor. 

I had to knock one star due to cost and location. The smell of the chicken place across the hall kinda took away from the atmosphere but that's not under their control. The desserts are delicious but I'm not sure if the price is digestible for most people. But I'll chalk it up to being from out of town. I'm still not used to the NY cost of living!

If you're in the area and willing to splurge on dessert, I recommend trying this place out!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-11-10,5.0,"Tried Spot Dessert for the first time and I must say: (or shout) 
MATCHA LAVA CAKE.

Not only is the taste amazing, presentation is also on point. It's dark chocolate cake with warm & melted chocolate inside served with a scoop of matcha green tea ice cream on the side. Matcha ice cream and cookie crumbs paired perfectly. Although it's a bit pricey for the portion you're getting ($11.95), it's worth it. I thought Grace Street only served the best desserts, but I'm glad I gave this place a try; definitely going to try their golden toast next!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-11-22,4.0,"I've been a fan of Spot Dessert Bar since I don't even remember when.  I think when they only had their first initial location in St. Marks actually.  So awesome to see how much they have grown to add three additional locations.  This was my first time in the Ktown location and honestly only chose it because it was central for two other friends I was meeting.  We definitely shared the following:

Milky Puff
PROS:
- great quantity, especially to share and if you don't have a sweet tooth
- puff was still relatively crispy, light and airy
- ice-cream was not the kind that was grainy (it's ice-cream, not ice-ice!)
- decent seating area, bathrooms same floor is clutch.
CONS:
- given that the location is on the third floor of the food gallery, it is hot.  Heat rises.  Also, heat from ten other restaurants cooking full force will rise.  Our ice-cream was melting so fast haha, we had to eat it faster than the puff otherwise the puff would get super soggy

Pearfect: okay truth be told, they had actually ran out of my desired dessert choice (the chestnut one).  I was so so so sad haha because as much as I like fruit, pear is not my favorite.
PROS:
- still good quantity, esp to share
- cake was not dry! Moist and spongy but the outside was slightly crispy still (I suppose to hold shape).
- freeze dried pear slice was beautiful!! (and yummy)
CONS:
- icecream was dying a death faster than a super bad day at work. Same heat principle applies as mentioned above.

Would I come back here?  Only if I was already in the food gallery.  If someone really wanted dessert I'd recommend the original Spot and baby Spot in St. Marks.  To me, it's worth the wait...unless it's below 32 degrees and freezing.  At that point, you better be family if I'm going to wait out in the cold for you lol."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-05,3.0,"Always a decent go-to place to for dessert, but to be quite honest, their creations feel quite manufactured and standardized after a few visits. The quality is good, but not unique or outstanding. 

Each dessert was around 13 dollars, which made sense considering the location and the portion size. The toast was fluffy but a little too sweet for my taste. I enjoyed the pairing with the vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was probably my favorite aspect, because it was stretchy and not too sugary. We also ordered the matcha lava cake, which was rich but also slightly too artificially flavored. The green tea ice cream balanced everything out though."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-21,5.0,"Very creative desserts that are light and fluffy! My friend and I came here and tried the toast dessert and a croissant dessert both with ice cream on them. The toast was especially good because it was very crispy on the outside without being hard and overcooked, and the inside is soft and buttery. The texture of the toast is very special, like biting into a cloud that got roasted. The croissant dessert was also very good, though the toast was even better by a little. 

There seem to be multiple locations in NY for Spot. This one was very yummy, can't wait to try the others too and try some do the new/seasonal flavors. I wish one would open in LA."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-25,4.0,"Other than the loudness it is a fun place to eat and by looking at the menu, it seems a very authentic food place with great variety. 
This time we came for desserts. 
The desserts, served on the second floor, are amazing and their presentations is artistic! Can't wait till next time, good and desserts."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-22,5.0,"Located on the third (top) floor of the food hall serving cute and creative Asian desserts!

Golden Toast: 5/5
A delicious dessert with more subtle flavors. The toast was slightly crispy on the outside and extremely buttery on the inside. Its soft, springy texture made it difficult to cut with a knife, so I had to resort to pulling it apart with my fork (which I didn't mind although it made it a little harder to eat). The condensed milk ice cream complimented the warm toast well by cooling it down, and the strawberries added some needed freshness to the dish."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-01-08,5.0,"Hands down one of my absolute favorite dessert spots in the city! The amazing desserts are creatively crafted by Chef Ian Kittichai, the Iron Chef of Thailand, and what makes them all the more desirable is that most of the desserts are whimsically named and interactive adding a fun component to the already aesthetically pleasing dishes. Their Coconut Monkey Bread is one of my favorites as its monkey bread topped with fall spices and coconut ice cream which you can pour Thai ice tea over. It arrives to the table sizzling hot allowing for ooey gooey goodness in each bite! Fret not non-city dwellers as they also have a Flushing location you can visit!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-01-13,5.0,"I was not let down by the dessert here! I tried two of the most popular desserts- The Harvest and Matcha Lava and both were so good!! This particular Spot Dessert Bar is located on the third floor of the food court in Koreatown. The desserts were so creative, aesthetically pleasing, and delicious! If you're a cheesecake or sorbet fan, I would definitely recommend The Harvest, since it has sorbet, cheesecake, orea crumbles, and fresh berries. In addition, it comes with a cute pot of earl grey milk tea that you can pour onto the dessert, which adds such a great flavor!  The Matcha Lava was absolutely amazing and is definitely one of the best matcha desserts I've ever had. The matcha ice cream itself was very good and the chocolate lava cake was delicious!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-02-23,4.0,"Every time I went to New York, the Spot was always the place I needed to stop by was never able to. Fortunately the stars aligned today and we were finally able to go here!

We had the famous plant dessert, The Harvest. The aesthetic was definitely unique. The flavor was pretty good! The cheesecake itself was tasty, and with the creamer we poured on it the texture of a bite reminded me of a nice wet tres leches! It was pretty good! The fruit at the bottom of the cup was necessary. With all the creamy sweetness, the tang was definitely needed!

The sorbet was refreshing and not too sweet. Perfect to compliment the cheesecake. 

Overall I really enjoyed that one item! Definitely would come back again to try the different desserts."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-07-22,4.0,"I am very amazed at the desserts that they come up with. Even the presentation is on point. I got the Matcha Lava Cake which was a lava cake with melted chocolate inside the cake with matcha powder sprinkled on top. This was also served with a scoop of matcha ice cream on the side. I'd recommend eating them both at the same time as the flavors are amazing.

The only downside is the price. Yes, a lot of work has been put into it from the pretty presentation to the delicious taste, but it doesn't warrant such a price tag. The Matcha Lava was $12 alone. They also had bubble tea where they can serve it in a lightbulb which looked cool for Instagram purposes, but costed an extra $2.50. No thank you.

If you're planning on eating it there, make sure to do the self seated section (all of the white tables and chair) and not their seated section (their wooden section next to them) as you would be expected to tip for the service, unless you want the service then be my guest!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-09-29,4.0,"Came to food court on Sunday night.
Plenty of seats. Usually Friday or saturady night, super hard to find the seats.
We order the combo it come with 3 desserts. And I think the 3rd one is 30% off.

Matcha Lava: must order! Very strong dark chocolate with matcha inside. And eat it with matcha ice cream. OMG SOOOOO GOOD!

Golden toast: crispy honey buttered crumble toast. 
Crunch outside with little sweet honey taste, with soft inside. So tasty with vanilla ice cream!

The last one was coffee something, I forgot the full name. It basically tasted like tiramisu with coffe ice cream. Bit too dry. This is the least enjoy one from this 3item"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-07-12,5.0,"Let me start off by saying...THE HYPE IS SO REAL!
Always saw these beautifully crafted desserts on Instagram and other social media and have been telling myself for months that I needed to try this place and I'm so glad I finally did.

Food: 5/5. Best dessert spot ever. Guaranteed. A true dessert bar with literally nothing but dessert (and drinks) on the menu! And the presentation is just perfection every time. 
The Good: Matcha Lava, Cookie Camp 
The OK: Golden Toast (only cause I'm not a fan of butter toast that much)

Price was definitely high, $10-11 for one dessert item..but good serving size, impeccable quality, delicious taste. 

Location: 4/5. In the heart of Koreatown, service is quick but seating is very very limited! Probably only has 5 tables. So not ideal for bigger groups than 2-3 people. 

Recommend? Highly! You have to check this place out. They have several locations throughout NYC."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-01-17,4.0,"Very delicious and uniquely designed desserts located on the 3rd floor of a food court in the center of Koreatown. I ordered their lava cake paired with matcha ice cream. Lava cake was nice and runny in the center and the matcha ice cream added a refreshing balance to the rich chocolate cake. It was also not too sweet. 

Lots of seating available anywhere in the cafeteria. 

Overall, everything was good, but hard to justify the expensive cost. One dessert on average is already $12, which is quite steep...

One star off because I think my money is better spent on a meal than on specialized desserts, but still good to at least try once."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-07-10,4.0,"Lord knows I love Spot Dessert Bar, but if you're gonna head here, I would highly recommend going to a different location. The dessert was really good, I mean i loved the frozen summer dessert, but unfortunately because of the location, we all smelled like fried chicken cuz of the pelican chicken in the same area. 

Other than that the service was quick and simple and Spot Dessert Bar has one of the best dessert as always~"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-05-25,3.0,"I had an okay experience here. The place is in the food court so it's hard to find a seat if you have a group of friends with you. The inside was pretty small and cramped. The seating was overall bearable, but not the comfiest. I had difficulty debating where to put my jacket because I was seated on a bench. The appearance on the desserts are very pleasing and worth trying. They have a variety of flavors, but it is quite expensive. I do not have a sweet tooth, which is why I do not often come here because the desserts are way too sweet for me. However, they also have other menu items like cookies and boba that are worth trying."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-07-31,3.0,"I came here many times and I really love their dessert but the place is really noisy and hard to find a table so I recommend to visit other spot place. 
My favorite is Matcha chocolate lava, warm chocolate cake fill with matcha, it's so amazingly great!! We tried coconut monkey bread in skillet last time and we didn't really like it since the texture of cookie dough is too sticky and hard to chew."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-05-18,4.0,"This place is cool- it definitely caters to the social media world we live in. 

Service was okay- not bad, not great. 

I ordered the matcha waterfall, so fun, perfect for a boomerang. I remember thinking it was insanely over priced , but I don't regret buying it. It was tasty, and I'm just a matcha person in general. 

Glad I tried it. Probably wouldn't go back- but it was fun to try for sure!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-05-23,3.0,"Solid dessert place, but just a little pricey for dessert. They share the space with another restaurant on the second floor. One con of that shared space: coming home and smelling completely like food. The place was busy, but there was still available seating given people rotated in and out and the deserts came out quickly.

I ordered the matcha lava cake which was delicious. I really like lava cake, so I've tried it at tons of places. There was something that was throwing the taste off of the dessert, like a food dye flavor--possibly the beads on top of the cake. Other than that, it was just the right amount of lava and softness on the cake. The matcha ice cream was delicious, and the crumbs were a good pairing. Would go again, but probably to a different location!"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-02-28,5.0,I absolutely love Spot desert bar. They have amazing desserts that may actually taste better than they look believe it or not. I typically go for the matcha lava cake with green tea ice cream but honestly everything there is beautiful an delicious. The level of detail is amazing. I highly recommend for your sugar fix!
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-19,4.0,"My mom, fiance and I came here after walking the Brooklyn Bridge and lunch at Katz. We felt like we needed something sweet after our big lunch, so I found Spot Dessert Bar on Yelp. My intentions of coming here was solely for the boba in the light bulb cup but unfortunately when we went, they ran out and I was left to drink my boba drink in a regular plastic cup so no pictures of that. Other than that, my drink was good. I mean you can't really mess up a thai ice tea boba drink.

My mom ordered the matcha lava cake with vanilla ice cream for $11.95. The warm dark chocolate cake was dusted with matcha and oozes with chocolate. It was delicious! Probably the best lava cake I've had but then again this was my first time having something like this. Would I come here again? Yes, and I hope the next time I'm here I get my boba drink in a light bulb! I also will order the golden toast. I would have ordered it if I didn't have a big lunch."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-04-01,3.0,"Lava cake? Count me in. MATCHA Lava cake? Def count me in. 

Matcha lava cake $11.95:  warm dark chocolate cake filled with matcha ganache served with matcha ice cream. The outside was a bit ""play dough-y"" complimented by the rich oozing mix of matcha ganache. (SEE PIC FOR REFERENCE)

.:: Service/ Ambiance ::.
Unenthusiastic staff, she was not smiling, did not greet me. When I asked for her recommendations she just pointed to the menu and said the first three with no additional comments. If she was a bit nicer, would have been a 4 star.
They actually had a private dining area to the side but I did NOT know about it because the staff didn't even tell me. So I sat at the communal tables which were super dirty. 

Would not go out of my way for it again."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-05-29,3.0,"I much prefer this fast casual version of Spot instead of a sit down place just for dessert. The menu is on the wall or you can grab one from the basket.

We ordered a scoop of green tea ice cream ($5), the harvest $12, and matcha waterfall.

The green tea ice cream didn't have a deep green tea flavor we were hoping for. The harvest is an oreo cheesecake pudding with noncomplementary fruit at the bottom and paired with a very tart sorbet. The matcha waterfall was rather dry and didn't have a lot of custard as we believed the menu had depicted. It's basically a matcha lava cake without enough lava and whipped cream on top. 

Overall, cute but expensive desserts that did not satisfy."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-14,5.0,"It was bit hard to find them, but their employees are very kind. Dessert that we ordered was enough for 2, and it was very cute. I will definitely revisit them when I come back to NYC."
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-05-01,5.0,The matcha lava is the bomb! The presentation is beautiful and the chocolate oozes out (also matcha lover over here). I used to get it all the time when I lived in NYC. I will forever get it when I'm back in town. It's such a cute spot to go after a date night too!
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-13,5.0,"Amazing dessert!! The first location was in St. Marks but I'm so glad they opened this up in midtown right in Korea town. It is located upstairs and has a lot of seating. It is self serve which is great! I definitely recommend the matcha lava, the harvest and the golden toast! (Pic below)"
625,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-05-05,5.0,"So yummy. It's a little pricey for the main dessert, $11.95 without tax and $13.01 with tax, but well worth it. I got the matcha lava this time. This is one of those rare cases where the actual product looks exactly like the advertised photos!

This place is a hidden gem. Spot Dessert Bar is located on the upper level of a cafeteria in K-Town. Yum-factor is on par with other well-known NYC bakeries like Dominique Ansel"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-03-11,5.0,"Good service! Yummy churros. Insta worthy. 

Came here again and it's still good. LOL. I recommend the new Oreo churro!!! Really yummy."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-03-17,4.0,"Churray for churros! This nearly one-woman show puts out fresh piping hot churros and yummy ice cream. My kids enjoyed their chocolate ice cream while a Rainbow Churro with marshmallow icing and Fruity Pebbles had my whole fam going yabba dabba doo! With 6 choices of dipping sauces and chocolate/almond/strawberry/matcha/toasted coconut churros options, you can't go wrong.

NOTES/TIPS:
**A bit drafty at its location by the main door.
**Small tables nearby.
**Located just inside ""Food Gallery 32"" which houses mostly Korean eats and treats."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-02-29,5.0,"I love their matcha and taro swirl ice cream . If you don't want both flavors you can have just matcha/taro by itself. The other swirl they offer is chocolate and vanilla if you like simple and original flavors. You can try their ice cream flavor before getting it if anything. 

I love the churro and ice cream together it's like the prefect duo it taste so good. Their churro is soo big and crunchy I don't think you can go wrong with any type of churro."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-02-13,5.0,"My first time trying Sweet Churros and I was NOT disappointed! Coming from Boston there aren't many churro spots, so when I come back to New York Sweet Churros is on my list of places to revisit!!!

Food: I have a sweet tooth and love churros so I was excited to try Sweet Churros! I got the oreo churro and it didn't disappoint. They make it fresh right in front of you (fun to watch) and they were very fast! It was awesome that it came out hot and fresh (thankful it wasn't oily!), it was delicious for only $5.50. 

Recommendation: I would totally recommend coming if you have a sweet tooth, I recommend the oreo or the matcha! 
Location: Located inside Food Gallery 32 was really awesome because they offer so many different dessert/food spots. It was easily located as when you walk in, it's on your right."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-03-16,5.0,"My girlfriend recommend this spot, therefore we had to go and visit the place. I never had sweet churros before, so I did not know what to expect. We went on a Saturday night, and it was pretty busy.  I ordered the Chocolate almond churro! They had other flavors as well which I will try out once I am back in NYC. They are located within a food court, so they have sitting options as well even though its crowded on the weekend. The service was great and the food was fresh as well. I will be back to try out the other flavors."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-03-15,5.0,"Great and delicious churros!! I've tried every flavor now (the pieces are stuck to the churros using marshmallow fluff) and I don't think I've disliked a single one!! The strawberry is my personal favorite. 
Service is great and the food court is a great place to sit and eat it right away. Eating them fresh is the best but even if you eat them a while later they're still delicious!! Highly recommend giving them a try if you like sweets"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-02-16,5.0,"I saw this tasty treat on instagram and I immediately had to have one. I had a rainbow churro with vanilla ice cream. I love that the churros are made upon order because it tastes nice and warm and its a good combination with the cold ice cream. The ""rainbow"" part is fruity pebbles cereal and its stuck onto the churro by spreading marshmallow onto the churro. This was really worth the walk I did to get over there! I cant. Wait till the next time I have one."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-01-15,5.0,"Absolutely love these Churros! It's located right in the food court center with all different asian fusion cuisine. Our friend Geren is an incredible server! We tried four different kinds of churros: Chocolate, Strawberry, Oreos, and Matcha. The strawberry one was my absolute favorite. We were so full from dinner, but could not refuse eating these delectable goodies! They are crisp and sweet- absolutely perfect desserts! We love going to Ktown and this is definitely the spot to come visit for churros!"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-07-05,4.0,"I was in the area after dinner and wanted to go somewhere for dessert. Located in a food court type location, Sweet Churros was the perfect place. It's a cool concept, and we don't have any thing like it back in Seattle. 

There was no line when we got there around 8:30 pm on July 4th. Service wasn't super friendly, but the guy taking our order was quick and efficient. We got one of the churros covered in fruit cereal with vanilla ice cream. And a strawberry crunch churro with matcha ice cream. The churros were made fresh and took a little bit. 

They're instagrammable desserts. And it was very very good. The hot, crunch of the churro paired with the soft, cold soft serve was perfect. Literally could not stop eating it. Even after our heavy Korean bbq meal. The strawberry crunch was delicious. And their matcha soft serve had good flavor! My fiance ate most of his even though he was extremely full. I'm glad we checked this place out! Would definetely come back if we were in the area"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-09-22,5.0,"So yummy, I love this place! I've been here twice so far and loved it both times. The menu is really cool because you can opt for churros, soft serve ice cream, or both together! And who doesn't love that??

I went for the churro with chocolate and almonds with matcha soft serve cream. I didn't realize that there was a yelp check-in for a free dipping sauce, but if I did, I would have gotten the nutella dipping sauce.

The churros come out fresh and warm, and you can see them being made right after you place your order. It's actually pretty cool!

Overall, come here when you have a sweet tooth and aren't trying to spend too much. A soft serve with a churro is about ~$9."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-01-04,4.0,"Had the chocolate and almond churro! It was pretty good and a different type of churro then what you would expect. I liked it, it wasn't too sweet or anything but it did smell a little weird... i feel like that's mostly because it was in a food cafeteria area and the smells all mixed. Overall I really liked it  and would visit again. I would probably try the churro with icecream, mostly because just the churro is a bit oily. Recommend checking it out!"

You talk about things that nobody cares
Like me wearing out things that nobody wears
You're making fun of me but I gotta make clear
I can't say if I'll eat a Churro next year

Said come and have a bite so I did, hell yes
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar

Churronly as good as your last Churro.

What a lovely little Churro stand! Who would have thought that there would be churros being sold inside the Korean Plaza on 32nd Street. What's more they are really good ones!

I know it's somewhat hard to mess up churros but I've had some pretty average ones and this is a really really delicious one so well done to them.

The only thing that was a little bit annoying was that they were making fun of me and laughing at me because I was dressed sexy (aka slutty) and covered in oil. They were young and probably thought I couldn't hear the jibes and digs. I'm not as stupid as I look.

They were asking me what I was doing so I told them what they wanted to hear - that I had been dancing for tips. In any case they weren't too bad and it could have been worse and a lot more insulting and I really enjoyed the churro, it's not too expensive and absolutely delicious so five stars for sure."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-08-03,5.0,"What a fun menu! They have many different toppings for the churros as well as beverages. I came in at the end of the day and ordered mine with the strawberry crunch and soft serve. 

The churro came out fresh and warm. Since it was the end of the night it definitely had a little bit of that old-oil taste which isn't what you want, but can't really be avoided at that hour. I would like to come back and try it again during the day. I loved the strawberry coating. 

I would say skip the ice cream - it melts after a while because of the temperature of the churro and becomes a little greasy, and it costs a lot extra for it. 

Will be returning, and will give more stars if it is better next time!

Update: I came back on a Saturday earlier in the day and my churro was absolutely delicious!"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-05-09,3.0,"I've been this place since they're opened. This place was redmango ice cream place but they changed for churros. I loved they changed. 
I would like give this place 3.5star if I could 

This place churros were the best in the area or even in NY or in LA. I've been eaten churros multiple times at ny or other city but I could tell you that this place churros were the best I ever had. 
They have dipping sauce or some of different churros but I would recommend you that try to eat just regular churros without dipping sauce. You can taste only churros. Not too sweet and not too oily, hot and savory. Probably you can imagine of churros at playground in Korea. 

Me and my friends tried eat this 3times already at this visited in NY. We left few more days and I thought we keeping go back to this place for eat churros."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-11-21,5.0,"Definitely recommend the churros here! They're super fresh and the staff fries them to order, so you're eating churros that are still hot from the oil. The churro I got was perfectly crispy and browned; texture was wonderful and that delicious deep-fried taste came through loud and clear. I got the rainbow one, and I highly recommend it! Only thing is, the churros can take a while to make but I guess that's the price you pay for freshness."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-07-11,4.0,"I tried Sweet Churros for the first time about 4-5 years ago and I thought it was a brilliant idea. Today, I still think it's a brilliant idea. 

Order:
- Churro ice cream (4/5)
- Matcha crunch (4/5) 

Pros:
- Freshly made churros ~ yum 
- You can choose between a regular cinnamon sugar churro or get a sweet churro for extra
- A lot of coffee and tea drinks

Cons:
- The oil on the churro wasn't properly shaken/patted dry so it was kinda oily 

Overall:
- If you're a fan of churros, this is a place worth visiting"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-05-19,4.0,"These babies were a great find & an amazing twist to the classic churros we all see & eat! You can get one or you can get the sample box.

This sample box comes with the classic cinnamon sugar, matcha crunch, strawberry crunch & chocolate almond. Each one is just as good as the other! & the best part is that it's fresh since they are made right in front of you. But that down side is that the order takes quite some time to get. & the last time I went, they messed up my order so it took even longer :/"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-12-07,4.0,"This is a yummy dessert place tucked in K-town food court. I chose matcha ice cream and matcha churros. When there were too many flavors and I didn't know what to choose from, I always went with the safe choice (matcha). I paid $10 for the combo. I had to wait a while for the staff to churn out the dough and deep fry the churros. But it was only about 5 minutes. After that, we had freshly fried churros that are covered in matcha granules (tbh, couldn't taste the matcha bits). The churros were very delicious and not oily. The matcha ice cream was of high quality as well because I could taste the matcha, It was not overly sweetened with sugar to hide low-grade matcha. I also loved that it's soft-serve ice cream and not scoop because it's so much smoother and easier to eat with the churros."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-02-17,5.0,"This is a food court right by Grace Street, and is the first on the right. The line was kinda long when we got there, but it moved pretty quickly. Packed even on a Monday night. Went to the counter and ordered, and got to watch them make it in front of our eyes. It was Delicious and super fresh!! My churro was 10/10. Would definitely go back."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-05-30,5.0,"We decided to try desserts even though we dont normally eat them. 
We ordered a small box which has 4 mini churros with various flavors.  The chirros were hot and crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  They are not sweet but the toppings give it a nice compliment.   
We ordered the chocolate with almonds, sugar, green topping and a red topping.  I believe they are covered with icing and then dipped colored cereal. 
They are delicious and worth every cent.  I preferred them hot. Warning....when you take a bite while hot, you will end up eating them all.  There went my diet.  Lol. 

The young lady and guy working were friendly and very helpful."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-11-22,5.0,"Delicious dessert spot right in Food Gallery 32. It is located on the right as soon as you walk in. I got a matcha soft serve cone. It definitely satisfied my sweet tooth! It wasn't overly sweet or bitter which I find other places have trouble finding that happy medium. For $4.50, the portion is big and can be shared between two people. This place gets really busy during lunch time so it was an in and out experience for us. I have to come back next time for a churro!"

It was made to order so it was super warm and fresh! The workers there were great also, very friendly and attentive. I got the sample box and it was a little of everything, you could also subs out whatever you don't like for another flavor. For sure my favorite part of my trip!"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-03-16,5.0,"They see me churro-lin' they hatin'...

Churros are the best dessert. You got the sugar. And the sugar. Aannnndd. The sugar. It's great. 

The sampler is a fun way to try for flavors and split them with friends. You have Matcha (which was the unanimous fav of the group), Strawberry (tasted like captain crunch or fruity pebbles), chocolate almond and plain. I'm og Plain and matcha alll the way. I've also had this with the soft serve and it's the perfect combo!"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-03-02,4.0,"Nestled near the front of K-town's Food Gallery 32 is Sweet Churros, a wonderful churro spot with a plethora of churro toppings to satisfy your sweet tooth! If you're feeling bold enough, you could also pair it with their flavored soft serve. Churros are fried-to-order to ensure optimal texture and make it much easier for the toppings to adhere to! Definitely worth a try!"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-03-25,4.0,"If you are looking for a unique treat, this is your place. 

Soft serve was good and the churro was good. Not as sugary since it was dipped in the ice cream. Cooked fresh churro. The strawberry crunch topping was excellent."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-03-25,4.0,"Churros aren't my dessert of choice but this was one good churro. I got the chocolate almond churro with a free dipping side of Nutella from checking in on Yelp (because you can never have too much chocolate). I like how they only have a few signature flavor options so it doesn't take much to decide what you want. If you really can't decide, just get the box mini-churro variety option.

The churro was pleasantly sweet and not overwhelming chocolatey. It was decked out in almond pieces, which was great and the side of Nutella worked surprisingly well. The churro was freshly fried (we watched them make it) and so yummy when eaten warm. It can get messy to eat, especially with Nutella, so grab lots of napkins!

I don't think I'd come back and pay $5.50 for a churro again (although it was quite large) but it was worth the experience and it's super grammable."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-02-18,5.0,So tasty and delicious. Perfect treat during any time of the day. Freshly made in front of you and it pairs really well with the cold ice cream. Definitely coming back here every time I visit !
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-09-01,5.0,"Love love love this place in the food gallery! The churro is fresh and made at the spot. They do have different flavors; my favorite will be the rainbow churro with matcha crunch. If you're in the NYC of k-town, it's a must visit!"

626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-09-07,4.0,"pretty good! churros are nice and hot and crunchy on the outside while soft on the inside without feeling overly greasy. Check in on yelp for a free dipping sauce (hot nutella!). 
Can combine with ice cream or have a combo box. Pretty considerate menu for indecisive people like me. I enjoyed the original cinnamon (came with plenty of cinammon sugar). 
Price isn't exorbitant either. will say it takes a while to come out though if they're understaffed.
Think a costco churro but skinnier :)"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-08-15,5.0,This was a nice treat after Korean bbq. The churro was freshly made and paired well with ice cream. The downside is that the ice cream melts fairly quickly since the churro is hot. I enjoyed it regardless and would definitely return next time I'm in the area!
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2018-12-20,5.0,"Surprised to find this in Koreatown but if you think about it just about everything in Koreatown is good.  After we ordered our churros, they made them right there. Dropped the dough in the hot oil and a few minutes later, mine was drizzled with white chocolate and covered with strawberry crunch and it was absolute heaven.  

For the plain folk, you will fully enjoy the traditional sugar and cinnamon coating just as my husband did. 

*All churros can be served a la mode!"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2020-01-08,5.0,"I always visit the Food Gallery in K-town and my goal is to try every restaurant located in it! So, I tried the Oreo Churros from Sweet Churros and it was quite honestly the best churros I have ever had. I really love churros and I am picky about the sugar and the texture etc., but Sweet Churros really had it on lock. I ended up coming here twice over winter break and both times, my friends that I was with thanked me for putting them onto such an amazing dessert spot. The spot gets extremely packed, but the workers are so fast, it's truly commendable. I went right near Christmas time when tourists were flooding in and blocking the entire floor and still received my order in about 5 minutes. I am looking forward to coming back and trying some new flavors soon!"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-07-19,4.0,"Came back to try the ice cream churro and was not disappointed. Love that the churro is made to order, it definitely takes a little bit longer but this ensures that it's crispy, crunchy, fresh and the toppings stick accordingly. Got chocolate dipped with rainbow cereal which isn't an option on the menu but they have all the ingredients and happily obliged and paired with the matcha/taro swirl. I've never heard of blue marble ice cream before but it was good, flavors are subtle but still pair well with the churro."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-07-18,5.0,"I was just passing through the area, and I happen to find this place by chance. This place is part of a small food court in korea town. There was a good amount of seating. So I was able to sit and enjoy it. Other places in the food court also looked interesting at reasonable prices. Churros was extremely good. I went with chocolate and almond churros. They fry it fresh, dip it in chocolate and almond after you order. Dulce de lache sauce went extremely well with the churros. Ice cream and churros is just an eye candy and an instagrammable combination. I don't think ice cream goes well with churros. I took the ube matcha combination soft serve. Ice cream could have been better."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-06-07,5.0,"LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THESE CHURROS.

Churros are the one dessert that I love more than most things. Its up there with my love of elephants. It really doesn't help that this place is located in the Food Gallery in K-town because Spot Dessert is on the 3rd floor( which usually causes me to have an internal debate on which dessert to indulge in,) and every time it Sweet Churros win.  

What makes this spot great is that it offers different topping on churros. I am pretty sure I can name half of the menu. There are some that may seem overly sweet when you read them like the fruity pebbles churro, which is by far one of my favorites aside from there classic churros. It has a coating of melted marshmallow for the fruity pebbles to stick, and it is not overly sweet to the point where you feel like you need to go to the dentist. 

They fry the churro when you order, so its not in one of those rolling oven boxes that you see premade churros rotate in with premade hot dogs. Its always nice, warm, and fresh when you receive it. Personally  I think it fits the criteria of the best type of churro, they aren't overly thick, it has a crisp outside, and the middle is perfectly doughy. If you decide to go there with a friend or with a date I HIGHLY recommend that you guys get your own because I doubt you guys will want to share. If you decide against it then don't say I didn't warn you.  

If you love churros and are PICKY about your churros, you have to give this spot a visit. Seriously, if I could give them more that 5 stars I would. If you don't think its fits the bill then you need to suggest a spot for me to get a better churro, because at that point you're just being mean and holding out crucial information from me. 

My Favorites in order:
 1. Rainbow Churro - Marshmallow Coating with Fruity Pebbles
 2. Classic Churro - Rolled in Cinnamon Sugar
 3. Chocolate Almond Churro - Chocolate Coating with Almonds 
 4. Matcha Crunch Churro - White Chocolate Coating with Matcha Crunch 
Coconut Churro - Marshmallow Coating with Coconut 

*If you have a problem deciding ask the employee taking your order what's their favorite churro. I mean either way they are all satisfying."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2018-12-10,5.0,"After grabbing dinner, we all decided a churro would be a wonderful dessert to close out the evening. We came to sweet churros, which is actually located in an indoor area with several other food vendors. 

There are quite a few flavors to choose from such as matcha, cinnamon, and rainbow (covered in frosting with Pebbles cereal). You also have the option to get it with soft serve, which my friends did - they chose the rainbow churro with the matcha and vanilla swirl. It came out to about $10. I chose the rainbow without the ice cream, which was about $6.

This churro was probably the best I've ever had. - nice flaky exterior, with a soft, warm interior. It was also the right amount of sweetness. Gotta upgrade to the churro with ice cream next time I'm here!"
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-07-18,4.0,"Tried the matcha crunch churro- it was freshly prepared and delicious. A tad on the sweet side because of the white chocolate, but satisfied my craving for something sweet. It is a tad pricey imo, but definitely a tasty churro."
626,sweet-churros-new-york-2,2019-06-08,5.0,"Hands down the best churro I had! 
They are freshly prepared in front of you and golden to the touch.
I would recommend trying it without any toppings because it is very sugary.
FYI one is enough for two people."

They're also canceling all planned events through the end of April.  Seating has temporarily been removed, in order to comply with social distancing."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2020-05-09,4.0,"This is one of my favorite bookstores in NYC.  I used to come here to study for the GMAT.  The café is a little noisy though hence I recommend wearing earphones when you're working.   

These days, I'm reading eBooks on my Kindle.   I miss holding a physical book in my hands though.  Why didn't I purchase a Nook you might ask?  My friend's husband has Amazon Prime and he told me there was a prime day sale.  Moreover, Audible works with the Kindle app.  

I'm currently listening to Le Petit Prince on Audible.   It helps pass the time when I'm doing mundane chores around my apartment.  

Here are my favorite quotes:

""It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."" 

""People have forgotten this truth,"" the fox said. ""But you mustn't forget it. You become responsible forever for what you've tamed. You're responsible for your rose."" 

""Since she's the one I listened to when she complained, or when she boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing at all. Since she's my rose.""

""In those days, I didn't understand anything. I should have judged her according to her actions, not her words. She perfumed my planet and lit up my life. I should never have run away! I ought to have realized the tenderness underlying her silly pretensions. Flowers are so contradictory! But I was too young to know how to love her."" 

""But if you tame me, then we
shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world."" 

This Barnes & Noble is in an ideal location though.  Typically, I would wait for a friend in Union Square Park.  However, if I'm parch and I want to sit down and read, this is the place I would be at."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2019-12-06,5.0,"As you can see from my weird little 2009 Yelp review, I'm a big fan of the Barnes & Noble in Union Square. It's a great location, with four floors of books just a couple hops from the train station. I don't live in New York, but have been to this bookstore several times over the years.

I had a few hours to kill on a Monday afternoon in Manhattan last month, so I decided to stop by and scope the place out. I was on a little bit of a mission, to be honest. My new book had just come out, and it was part of a couple Barnes & Noble promotions, and I was curious how it would be displayed. The answer was tucked away on the fourth floor with most of the fiction (though I hear it has since moved to the first, hey-o).

I also had to get through a book that afternoon, so I figured I'd plop down and read for a while. There weren't many places to sit, I guess by design, because the few spots there were were swarmed. I found a seat in the cafe area, which was absolutely packed. I wasn't the only one looking to park for a bit.

Barnes & Noble is obviously not an independent neighborhood bookstore, but I'm partial to the chain (it was the one bookstore in the suburb where I grew up, and I was very sad when it closed and became a CVS), and particularly fond of this branch. It makes me happy to think about my books on these shelves, and I look forward to visiting again next time I'm passing through Union Square."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2020-02-29,4.0,"Had a great time going through some of the aisles. Customer service was great, everything was pretty organized , clean and quiet. Love a quiet place. My boyfriend was looking for a book he found only 1 copy and it was in bad condition. Only dislike is if you find your book and its in awful condition (idk why they would sell some that way) they no longer give you a discounted price only if there was an issue with the publishing. I came out with 5 books and he didn't want to pay full price for a damaged book but found it on Amazon for 10$cheaper. Win win."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2019-11-25,5.0,"I love the Barnes & Noble location in Union Square. It's not overcrowded like the rest of them, and there is unlimited space where you feel like you can definitely get lost here for hours. I find myself in the Funko POP section a lot. It's located on the 2nd floor and I always look to see the latest pops that come out here. They have the biggest selection I've ever seen in all the B&Ns. 

I recently found this awesome offer called blind date with a book. It's completely wrapped and you get a quick run down of what it might be about to peak your interest, just like a real blind date. I find this concept to be super cool, and very cute."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2019-10-12,4.0,"With four floors of knowledge how can their be a downside. They also have discounted items such as games and knickknacks. Its clean and big. Also right by Union Square so if you need a break from the quiet plenty of activity outside.

Mera's Tip: curl up with a good book."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2020-03-15,5.0,"So you're really reading reviews for a bookstore huh? Fair enough. This bookstore was pretty fire. Books? Got em. Cafe? Got em. Board games? Got em. Good vibes from this place, and there were a few people reading or doing homework around the shop."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2019-11-03,4.0,"LOLZ at some of the reviews complaining about folks sitting down to read here, or about the nasty bathrooms! This is New York, after all. And sitting to... well... read is part of the point of a physical bookstore in the first place!

In an age where Amazon is continuously tightening its grip on the retail industry, it's great to see that bricks-and-mortar stores like this B&N are still around. If you've seen your share of Meg Ryan / Tom Hanks ""chick flick"" '90s movies like ""You've Got Mail,"" in fact, you'll find it ironic that big-box outlets like B&N are endangered these days, let alone small indie bookshops. 

In a city as large and chaotic as New York, stores and venues like B&N are veritable refuges and outlets for the millions of apartment dwellers out there. While there are other plenty of other options like Starbucks here in Manhattan for folks who want to lounge around for a while, they're often tight, chaotic squeezes and aren't as inviting or spacious as in the suburbs. And yes, there are spaces like plazas and parks, but they aren't all necessarily climate-controlled or well-lit 24/7/365.

This is where this huge B&N branch comes in. I've had many fond memories of attending speeches and book signings here over the years, since the space is large enough to accomodate events like these. Even if you're not here for an event, it's increasingly rare to see multi-level bookstores with wide, mass-market selections like this one. One of my favorite things to do, in fact, is peruse the magazine racks and see what's on the cover of specialty or international publications.

Here's hoping large community spaces like this keep going strong!"
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2020-03-08,5.0,"Barnes and Noble used to be the hangout spot for me growing up, but as I started to get older, I realized that they were not as common or prevalent anymore especially as I started traveling to other states. This particular store has many levels and tons of books and a sit-down cafe section. I love that there are still book stores, where people can go in and sit and read and lounge and spend their day with friends or by themselves and just get lost in things, are special as a good book or magazine. They have clean bathrooms and there's plenty of space here so you can post up for long periods of time."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2019-06-06,4.0,"This Barnes and Noble was pretty great!  Several floors packed with books that will entertain you for hours on end. Books of every genre and subject that will fulfill any need that you may have. When you need a book and you need it fast, this is the Barnes to go to. 

I've also heard that they have a ton of book signings and is a popular host of many well known authors book signing events. 

The only downside that I noticed, was while I was in the cafe area there were quite a few homeless with bad hygiene in there. I have sympathy for their situation, but to deny the smells are unpleasant would not be completely honest. The cafe area was also kinda dirty, some seats had gum on them. 

Otherwise, it's a great Barnes and I highly suggest it."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2019-06-14,4.0,"A decent sized bookstore, 4 floors and lots of options. Reasonable prices and friendly staffs. Second floor restroom is closed so you have to use the one on the third floor, which have a camera before you entire. There's also a cafe on the 3rd floor. There's also a floor of all kids and teens items. Books, games, toys, etc. There's also a CD/audio selection on the first floor at the end of the store. They have some stationaries too. Literally across the street from Union Square so super convenient with the subway lines. Closes pretty late so I love hanging around there. Books make me happy and this is my place. Recommend to check it out and I'd definitely be going back again sometime soon!"
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2019-04-27,1.0,"On a recent visit to Barnes & Noble in Union Square I was appalled at the condition of the children's department. First, there are no tables or chairs or any sitting area for kids or adults. I sat with my granddaughter on the lowest level of a bookshelf to read a book to her and I was told by a staff member that I was not allowed to sit there. When asked where I should sit, was told ""on the floor."" 
(I have enclosed pictures to show why no one should have to sit on this floor.) If an establishment wants to attract children they should provide for their needs. If not they should shut down the department. 

They had a train table set, which attracted a lot of the kids, but there were no trains to use so all they could do is stand there and stare. I had bought several Thomas the engine drains previously and brought them with me so she would have something to play with. However, all the other kids wanted them of course so I had to take them away from her. 
I tried to put my granddaughter on a windowsill but it was peeling paint and filthy with dead insects.

 Do not, under any circumstances, take your children to this bookstore. Barnes & Noble should be horrified and ashamed at the condition of the store. And despite being spring break there were no activities or story times scheduled. Instead, they schedule them on Saturdays when no one is available. 

Overall, the worst Barnes & Noble I have ever been in. And I spend a lot of time in bookstores! Disgraceful. B & N should be ashamed."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2019-02-01,4.0,"it is neither a barn nor noble, but it is a very large B&N (in terms of Manhattan). 

multi-floor via escalator and elevator. not to cramped in terms of merchandise--fairly sprawling. fairly well-organized. relatively clean for all the foot traffic.

i don't come here super-often UNLESS i am looking to discover new authors (blame Amazon) or i am in the area which is actually pretty regularly. the first floor has most of the bestsellers and mainstream curated books. there's some impulse purchase items. there's a Nook (e-reader) section in the back, but who owns a Nooks (they corny & tres lame). above street level, there are a few floors. one has a lot of kids toys and books and story-time area for kids (the Harry Potter items are pretty extensive). there's even a giant chunky Batman made of LEGOS. another floor has a fairly large events area for when authors & celebs do reading to shill their books. the third or fourth floor has a fairly large footprint dedicated to scifi, graphic novel, manga, nerd, etc. books. 

i would say that most foot traffic at this B&N outside of shopping is bc it has public restrooms (STANK!), a good-sized cafe area where people can sponge wifi and operate their next great future failing start-up, or simply use B&N as a de facto library. LOL

overall this B&N serves multiple purposes in the Union Square area and i do hope it doesn't disappear. 

the staff on floor and info desks are superhelpful when you are looking for specific things or rec's.

drops mic cuz i'm booked
i out

stuffs are very friendly and helpful. Very quiet in the stores."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2018-12-04,5.0,"This is where I go to kill time if I'm in the general vicinity and don't feel like thinking too hard about what to do to kill time.

Aside from all the things that make any B&N store a good time, the secret (okay, maybe not-so-secret) reason this one stands out especially is that they tend to host pretty top notch book signings that are relatively accessible if you've got $20 to spend on a book and an hour or two to spare (ex: I once walked in when Tony Bennett just happened to be doing a Q+A/signing and walked out with an extra special Christmas gift for my mom). 

Keep an eye on their Facebook/signage at the store for a schedule of appearances and you're bound to run into someone you like."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2019-07-23,4.0,Four floors of books in Union Square for sale or for you to peruse at your leisure. You can spend lots of time in the bookstore browsing and you can go to the magazine area and look at the periodicals there. They have a coffee shop on the periodicals level in case you want to sit down and have a coffee while reading. There is a toy section on the children's floor that is filled with different games and toys but seems out of place in a bookstore. I'm not sure how many books you have to sell in order to pay the rent in this area but that really isn't my problem. I just enjoying hanging out here.
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2018-03-05,4.0,"In this day and age, it's such a treasure to be able to sit in a bookstore and be surrounded by walls and walls of books and magazines.

I've always enjoyed coming to this Union Square location for as long as I remember. It has three floors. The second floor is mainly children's section and the third floor has the cafe as well as the magazine section. Both upper floors have restrooms.

The cafe is very spacious and you can literally read for hours and enjoy some drinks and treats. It has big windows that allows so much natural light in and it overlooks the farmers market."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2018-10-30,3.0,"This Barnes and Noble is great in regards to size and content. The place is huge and they always have exactly what I've gone for, which is pleasantly surprising since I always go for the spiritually/new age books. I always leave with one of their books from the bargain section which are great priced gorgeous hardcovers. 

What I seriously dislike are the homeless that are allowed to freely walk throughout the store. The bathrooms are located right in the bargain section and no less than 5 homeless men passed by me in a span of 10-15 minutes. The odor was so offensive I had to leave the area. One man was in the bathroom screaming, obviously an EDP. They were obviously washing and using the store as a pitstop. Not sure why this is allowed."

Went to go pick up two copies of a magazine, and service was extremely slow when I asked for help. I'm normally a very patient person but for a location this large they were extremely understaffed. Could barely find anyone that worked on the floor, and when I went up a level to ask if they could help, they told me to go back down because there was surely someone working that department. 

When I finally went to check out, they couldn't even find a barcode on either item, and the cashier gave me attitude like it was my fault the item wasn't labeled?!? It took so long just to pay for two magazines. Finally, the cashier was rude when she asked if I wanted a bag. I've never been angry after a B&N trip, this was a first."

There is a Starbucks inside. If you buy anything from Starbucks you get the right to seat at any table and spend your sweet time reading anything you interested into. This is if you can find any empty seats... 

The staff are helpful and friendly

The only con of this place is its spotty Wi-Fi. Not sure if everyone around Union Sq is using this free Wi-Fi or the infrastructure of it sucks. Anyways, else is good. 

Def worth coming to this place to chill and relax!"
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2018-09-20,3.0,I've been to this establishment before. But this is my first book signing event. The reason I gave 3 stars is because I had been sitting in the area for the book signing for 3 hours with a great seat to find out that you need a wrist band. There is no signage or employee to say that it was needed when I arrived. When I first got there I had asked an employee where the book signing will take place and he just told me it was on the 4th floor but did not double check with me if I was aware of the procedure. I ended up having to go downstairs and buy a book to get the wrist band to secure a seat. If I had known I would've done it from the beginning.
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2018-09-14,5.0,"Yes, I'm writing a review for Barnes & Noble. Get over it. The age of bookstores is dying and they need all the help they can get. As of late, this place has become my second home basically because I have two hours nearly to kill after work and before I start orchestra practice. So, naturally I dork out at B&N instead of hanging with the homeless in the park. Actually, I remember coming here as a kid. It was the highlight of when my Dad would drive us from New Jersey into the city on weekends and I would demand to go to 'the big bookstore' (which was this one). I bought my first Berenstain Bear book here. It was ""And the Bad Habit"". The picture of Sister Bear going to town on her finger nails. So appropriate because I was and still will always be a nail biter. Don't ask me how I remember minor life events from when I was three. But so many memories. And being excited over the Jolly Postman! 

Needless to say, I'm happy this place still exists. Even though its negative 40 degrees in here even when it's slightly chilly outside, they have books I can browse through for hours, magazines when you're tired of reading and just want pictures, an actually pretty informative staff, a cafe, a reading section/area where minor celebrities do book promotions that I usually go to when the cafe seating is too full, and bathrooms. God bless those bathrooms."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2019-12-30,4.0,"The staff is always friendly and willing to help. The store has four floors and a massive variety of books. I personally go to this specific Barnes and Noble to buy mangas, mostly due to the variety the store has. I did, however, have a few bad experiences. The mangas are usually never wrapped, and you don't notice the damage until way after you bought the books. The manga section is sometimes crowded with people just sitting on the floor reading the books. Because most books aren't wrapped it's exactly the way they become damaged. My worst experience was when I came to the manga section and saw a homeless person sitting on a crate and reading a Naruto omnibus. He stunk up the whole isle and since then I only bought books that are tightly wrapped or simply order them online."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2017-11-05,4.0,"Are you a real Manhattanite if you read books and haven't been to this book store? I been coming here since early 2000 when the Y2k Millennium Bug scared everyone that the clocks would screw up digital life. I don't know how long it has been open but I surely consider it one of New York City's institutions that should be considered a landmark to be never demolished.

I have not been here in aged but today I remembered my old friend: B&N. It hasn't changed much at all. All four floors are practically still the same. I use to visit the 4th flour the most for the Fiction and Psychology books. Today that differs none at all. I even saw a handful of Marvel comics there today. The staff on the fourth floor by the elevator seem to know there direction on subjects. The third floor seems to be the teens and children's place with a mini-children's read hangout center. The third floor has so many toys, board games and such. If you like (and who doesn't) Star Wars, I saw plenty of related action figures there today. The first floor has the most popular books, often the Best Sellers. I browsed The Girl Who Takes An Eye For An Eye, the same author of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. I browsed it and not interested in reading it because it takes on a similarity to the first book. The movie wasn't as interesting. I think I'd prefer to read Dan Brown's Origin but again, is it worth the read? Robert Langdon running around again.

A few years ago I would have considered the Nook. But I have a Kindle Fire, so sorry B&N. It doesn't look very popular. The Nook is in the back of the first, ground, floor to check out and that's where B&N has all the gifts like Godiva chocolates.

The only thing I dislike is that in the coffee shop there are no power outlets. I guess it's to deter all the freeloaders that sit there all day, like in Starbucks. I do like that, to contradict my recent comment, is that you can sit there all day, which I have no time for and get free water. How's the Wifi? Beats me.

The free to use restroom is a plus. The escalators and elevators are a plus."

This bookstore is in close proximity to some of the best independent bookstores in the entire country and it really doesn't rise to the challenge, at all. It's sterile and could be described as an ad for itself what with all their ""10% off this or that"" posters blaring throughout the displays. And all this when mere blocks away there are bookstores that offer personality alongside their similarly-priced wares. I just can't understand how someone would choose this monument to corporate bloat over Three Lives and Company, BookBook, McNally Jackson, or even commercially-feminist stalwart The Strand. Try pretty much anywhere else in the neighborhood. You're in NYC, live like it."

The reduced price book section is great and I can spend hours there.
The employees at the Starbucks are so nice every time I go there... the checkout people on the ground floor should take some lessons from them. It really depends on who you get downstairs, some of them are not the friendliest. You work in a book store, be happy! But thankfully it doesn't really matter as you don't spend that much time with them anyway! They won't keep me away from my happy place!"
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2017-12-05,4.0,"Massive B & N, possibly the flagship store. Four floors of just about every category of books, gifts and accessories imaginable. There's a Starbucks cafe with ample seating. 
It's centrally located in the Union Square area."
627,barnes-and-noble-new-york-3,2017-11-15,5.0,"Who doesn't love Barnes and Noble? This is such a prime location for me and with it's 4 floors of books, music, toys and other products, I could spend hours browsing here. Everything is neatly shelved and the entire store's layout is well organized. Also the employees are super helpful in helping you find things, and if you don't want human interaction, they have computer kiosks that you can use to locate books in the store yourself by searching the title/author/isbn, etc. 

Despite the location being a place of high traffic, the restrooms are fairly clean too and there's also places to sit and grab coffee as well if you're tired. 

This is also a very popular location for author events which usually take place on the 4th floor."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-07-31,5.0,"As the reviews say, this place is a bit hard to spot because there's no big sign outside the shop, but luckily my cousin told me about this place so I was on the lookout. 
I walked in on a Wednesday morning at like 8:20 and the shop is empty, I order an iced coffee with ease, and the server brought my drink to my table as I sat and caught up on my studies. 
I think this cafe is really cute, and the interior is cozily decorated, if I lived in the area I could definitely see myself coming here on a regular basis to study or come with friends. The atmosphere is very relaxing, the music they played was soothing with no words, like instrumental, but then they changed it to a new playlist that had lyrics, I would've preferred instrumental but they're the ones that have to hear it all day so I didn't mind. 
I think because this place is kind of hidden away and not that easy to find, and the cozy, dark lit atmosphere gives it a more mysterious and appealing vibe."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-09-26,4.0,"Ordered take out on a Thursday afternoon. The cafe was quiet and slow during the time. This place is great for work too!

I ordered a matcha bomb ($6), which is a latte with green tea syrup. Sweetness can be adjusted. The drink was pretty good. The barista also made the drink very quickly. I'd come back for the drink! I also ordered their spicy chicken lunch box but waited at least 10 mins to get it.

The lunch box was very picture worthy! It came with spicy fried chicken, shishito, scrambled eggs, and side dishes. Taste wise was average lol. Price ($12) is fair for a lunch box like this though. PS, This is a cash only cafe!

Also at night, this cafe will turn into a restaurant called Take31. I'd recommend dinner over lunch:)"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-03-30,5.0,"A cute little cafe for some morning coffee. I took my cousin there. We ordered a regular and matcha latte and two plain croissants. The lattes were just as perfect as the art. 
The inside is dimly lit with some seatings in the front and back. They bring the food to you when it is ready. 
I was having a hard time finding the store and kept passing it because I didn't see any big store sign outside."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2020-02-10,4.0,"Super cute latte art and really strong matcha bombs. Good place to study early in the morning, but can get loud during lunch time. Wifi isn't always available."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-09-20,4.0,"Came here for an impromptu Friday lunch. It was pretty quite but I was there at 1:30pm. Turns out this place is cup&cup and a different place for dinner. Regardless I have been to both and love it. The lunch time special is simple, not trying hard to be something it is not. I ordered the crispy chicken with rice and some Korean condiments - well priced at $12 per dish. The chicken itself was very tasty and crunchy. My companion had the pork and overall I preferred mine. I was able to get there and back to work within the hour. Service was good and food was enjoyable. Will definitely be coming back. If I had a suggestion to make is to maybe use less plastic containers for those who decides to eat in?"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-02-12,5.0,"Super cute breakfast/lunch place in ktown. It's cash only and only open 8-4pm on weekdays. I wish this was open longer because it's hard for people to visit if they have a day job. 

The menu changes once in a while since there's a couple of previous menus posted on yelp so be sure to check the latest version posted. We got the roe cream udon and it was so delicious! I will definitely be back for that dish because it was so good! Utensils, water, etc are all self serve but they will bring out your food and take your plates from your table when you're done. 

There's lots of seating inside but the tables before the cash register can be kind of cold. Luckily, there's a sitting area past the cash register too where you won't feel the wind from the door."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-06-14,4.0,"I found this cute cafe near K-town and was delighted at the pretty good reviews on Yelp. I ended up going around 12pm and stayed until 4pm. Make sure you watch out with when Cup & Cup open/close because they are only open from 8am to 4pm and do not open on the weekends. Its more like a chill atmosphere where you walk in, order and sit down. The waiter or waitress brings your drink to your table while you enjoy your time there.
I ordered the green tea latte and received it with a cute bear latte art. It was $4 and take note that this place only takes cash! 
This is a super cute and lowkey place to get some quick work done without being bothered compared to the other busy manhattan cafes!"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-12-12,5.0,"Cup & Cup during the day, Take31 at night! I decided to this restaurants during the day around lunch time. Walking in, you got to the counter to order your food. This establishment is CASH ONLY. You have to self-service your utensils and cup of water, everything else is served to you. There weren't a lot of people around lunch time, so I am guessing this is the right time to try this place out without getting an overwhelming feeling. I know it gets busy in the evening and on the weekends. 

I order the Honey Chicken + Quinoa (minus this) bowl. I am on a low-carb strict diet, therefore I told the individual NOOOO quinoa, but you can substitute it with salad or more veggies. As seen in the photo that is how the bowl came. The taste is not overbearing with flavor, the honey gives it a little sweet taste but the garlic gives it a touching taste. I would recommend to prep the honey breaded chicken rather than store buying the already breaded chicken. It would give it more of a freshness to the plate. 

Had the Red Velvet latte as dessert, it's like taking a bite of a cupcake. So good and taste exactly like Red Velvet, I loved it! They have many other lattes and drinks to try. 

Overall, the dish and latte was delicious and worth every single penny. This first time experience was great and I'll be back for more."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-12-27,3.0,"Decided to get brunch here with my friend after seeing the cute latte art and having it on my bookmarks list (for some reason).

You order at the register and then they'll bring your food to you. It's a very self-service type of atmosphere (get your own napkings, utensils etc).

I got the red velvet latte and beef bibimbap. My friend got the cod roe udon and matcha latte.

The red velvet latte was superrr sweet. Like drinking a melted marshmallow? And I was sad to see only the simple latte heart and not something else. Oh well, guess I should've requested it.

The beef part of the bibimbap was pretty good. But I didn't really like the cilantro (I'm not a cilantro person) and the giant pieces of beets (it was hard to mix). I think I'd have preferred it all the vegetables were cut into the same sizes so that it'd be easier to mix. But it was a lot of food (don't know if it was $11 worth but hey it's Koreatown so).

I think if I went again I would choose the cod roe udon. It was creamy and had that cod roe taste to it but it looked really good. The matcha latte had a watery matcha flavor to it."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-06-12,3.0,"A little hard to find since there is no Cup & Cup sign hanging outside. Instead look for Take 31 which is where it's located. 

Most importantly: CASH ONLY!

I got the cod roe cream udon with a hot cappuccino. Odd combo, I know. For whatever reason, the cream udon took awhile to serve even after my friends got their drinks and rice dish. I did get it soon after I inquired about it and the workers were kind to check up on us once in awhile.

The cream udon was good but VERY rich. It's heavy like Mac and Cheese with a pretty strong seafood flavor. It has shrimp, squid, mussels and ofc, the cod roe. I enjoyed it, but it definitely feels too much for one so sharing it with a friend would be a better idea.

The cappuccino came in a very cute cup. However, I was disappointed when it came without the cute bear art which is what I ordered the drink for. I requested for the 'special art design' but I guess that was too vague. The coffee was aromatic at least. 

It's a nice place to chill at when you need a place further away from the midtown crowds."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2020-03-23,4.0,I was looking for a cafe around school to kill some time and stumbled in here. I got the lunch special box ($15~) and was pleasantly surprised. Portion size was larger than I expected and the bossam (korean toasted pork) was so delicious! There's also an option to add coffee for an additional dollar and the workers are extremely friendly as well!
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-11-06,5.0,"Having heard great things about the food, I decided to meet my friend here for lunch on a random Thursday around 11am. Lunch starts at 11:30 so we grabbed seats and had coffee (which was fragrant and strong) before ordering at 11:30 on the dot. I ordered the cod roe cream udon and the crispy garlic chicken, while my friend had the pork and garlic stem noodles.

This is a cash only establishment, and you pay whatever the price is on the menu! It's also self serve aside from staff delivering food and cleaning your table - utensils and napkins are on a table for you to pick up before/after your food arrives. Now back to food.

The cod roe cream udon was perfectly creamy with a healthy serving of cod roe. It came with mussels, shrimp, squid and perfectly cooked udon noodles! The noodles were able to soak up the flavor of the seafood and sauce - the sauce was so good we didn't leave any behind. 

The pork and garlic stem noodles were also seasoned and cooked perfectly - it also tasted good with the sauce from my udon! 

Lastly the fried chicken - not exactly the fried chicken we are used to. It's not breaded and fried rather it reminds me of tangsuyuk () where the outer layer is crispy and the inside is still tender and juicy, unlike the sometimes dry texture fried chicken has. I wish they had given more of the garlic sauce, but it was still delicious and perfectly seasoned!

Will I be back? 10000% yes! I'm almost hesitant to post a review since it'd be nice to keep this place hidden from the rest of the world for a bit longer.... but definitely give this place a try if you're in the area! It's a great place to study, chat, or get work done too!"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-05-04,5.0,"First time I've ever done this... writing a review as I am AT the location and eating as I'm writing this. Think of this as a live review and experience as I continue...

Started off with a matcha latte since lunch doesn't start till 11:30 so it was a good cup to kick things off.

But here's what propelled me to writing this review, right here, right now.

Their Cod Roe Cream Udon! First off, when I got my order, typically it's the camera that eats first but in this case, my sense of smell got to taste first! It smelled. so. good. As I'm taking a picture, I almost wanted to stop so I could hurry up and take a bite. It's packed with seafood: mussels, shrimp, squid and cod roe. Not only is it presented visually on point, it delivers on all fronts in taste. Creamy, flavorful, and a hit of spice and pepper in all the right levels. The noodles are also cooked just the way I like them. Soft, light and chewy consistency which goes perfectly with the sauce. UDON know how much that means to me!

Other places that do this tend to make the noodles absorb as much flavor as possible, but almost making it impossible to finish the dish due to its heaviness. But with such light noodles, I'm able to eat it all!

For only $12, I wasn't expecting to be so happy with this dish... I can see why they can get by in this modern era by only accepting cash (no card system here). On the plus side, the price you see is the final count so you won't be walking away with any coins.

PS good music here with sounds of a coffee shop in the background. Plus bonus points for playing my favorite Jay Park song :)"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-01-17,5.0,"I would rate this place 10 stars if I could.

Delicious food, great ambience, perfectly crafted lattes (& the most kawaii). It doesn't get better than Cup & Cup. Their sister branch Her Name Is Han is pretty damn good too.

I always get the cream udon paired with a match latte when I go.

Cash only."

The atmosphere is casual and comfortable. The service was friendly and welcoming. I ordered a matcha latte and it was good. I enjoyed my coffee break here."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-06-03,4.0,"This place is so cute! The staffs are very welcoming. Something to take note is that this place does not accept credit cards. It is cash only.

I got a matcha latte and it came with an adorable latte art. It was too cute to drink! The latte was not hot and was warm. It tasted like a regular matcha latte. There was nothing special about it."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2017-12-17,3.0,"The fam and I were trying to wait out somewhere before our tat appointment so we decided to come here. Unfortunately for us, lunch doesn't start until 11:30; so we only got drinks. Service is a bit slow and the joint is pretty small with limited seating. 

We got the HOT CHOCOLATE and it was nothing special. It tasted like the type you can buy at the store and make yourself, but the artwork was on point. It was so cute and unique! The CHAI LATTE was a disappointment. It was way too sweet. I only drank a third of it because I didn't like it very much. All I could taste was sweetness, it lacked the chai spice and flavor I was looking for. 

The price for drinks here are pretty good. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their food and other drinks."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-07-31,4.0,Very affordable and the atmosphere is very cool and relaxed. I love the decor. The garlic chicken was delicious! I also enjoyed a cappuccino. I definitely recommend a stop in if you're in the area.
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-11-16,4.0,"I was a bit salty that I didn't get a cute bear for my latte art, but my dirty matcha latte was smooth af and I still got some stylish hearts. The large-ish wooden tables make Cup & Cup a nice place to work too."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-04-16,4.0,"So I admit that I was drawn to this place simply because of the adorable latte art. Who could resist having the cute little bear face on your cup? 

In addition to having a nice warm cup of matcha on a rainy cold day, the grilled salmon bibimbap was a welcoming surprise. It was very tasty and I loved the beets that were added to the mix. 

Would love to come back and try the scone/pastries. The place is pretty spacious with front and back seating areas."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2017-09-11,4.0,"And the award for most kawaii latte art goes to ...*drum roll*... Cup&Cup!

Have you seen the pictures? The barista is very talented and even takes requests! Drink-wise, drinks aren't bad一neither too much milk nor overly sweet.

-!!CASH ONLY!!
-quiet atmosphere on weekdays
-perfect for catching up with friends
-free wifi for only 1 hr

628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-06-19,4.0,I did end up visiting again with my uncle after I told him what happened and he said he was very shocked because it is one of his favorite places to go for lunch. The second time it kind of felt like I was visiting a different restaurant. We both order the cod roe cream udon and it was delicious. The cod roe (fish eggs) was a good touch to the noodles and the food came out quite fast this time. I also ordered the red velvet latte which came out much later than the food. The latte art on it was super cute but the actual drink I felt was too sugary and didn't have any coffee taste to it.
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-10-23,5.0,"I have been wanting to come here ever since I moved to NYC and had Take31. Cup & Cup is the ""morning/afternoon"" restaurant that is in the Take31 location and they do breakfast and lunch along with cute lattes and other drinks. Everything is way cheaper at Cup & Cup (compared to Take31) but it's cash only and they're only open Monday - Friday.

@Cup & Cup management, if you're reading this please open during the weekends!! I will be there every weekend!!!!!

My friend and I got:
Kimchi Cream Udon
Cod/Seafood Cream Udon

Both are SO good. 10/10 would eat again and would eat once a week (or more if it wouldn't make me gain weight haha). A lot of their menu items are similar to Take31's dinner items. They also serve different bibimbaps, ramen, and other foods.

CASH ONLY! 
Open Monday through Friday: 7am to 4pm & lunch is served 11:30am to 3pm"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2017-12-27,4.0,"Came here for lunch with a friend. The decor is cute and spacious. I came here a bit early and got a cup of flat white, which was good. They have free WiFi, but it's only limited to one hour of usage. 

I got the chicken bibimbap and my friend got the seafood ramen. The food was decent, but probably more of 3 star than 4. They got one extra star for the chilled vibe and spaciousness, especially away from the midtown lunch crowd."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-09-14,5.0,Why have I not been here before? I walked by and found a relaxing coffee shop with Korean food. The music was relaxing and the atmosphere was cozy. This place is perfect for relaxing or doing work. I ordered ginger chicken for 5 bucks: the portion was plentiful and deliciously seasoned. I will absolutely be coming back in a regular basis.
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2017-06-21,5.0,"I go here pretty frequently, so needless to say, this is one of my favourite shops. It's cozy, has plenty of seating in the front and back, and is minimally decorated, which adds to the charm. The baristas are super friendly which made me feel at home. 

All of their drinks are really good! My favourite has to be the dirty matcha which is a matcha latte with a shot of espresso. Make sure you ask for a bear or they won't give you one (especially if they're busy!) They used to not have too many food options - only pastries and limited hot food items, but they expanded their menu. 

My friend tried the ramen, which she said was pretty decent. I love the Japanese French toast since it just melts in your mouth. The chicken and egg over rice is sooo good - so simple, but tastes like a home cooked meal. 

Tip: wifi is only free for an hour, so not a good place to go if you wanna sit down and do work for a long time!"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2017-07-13,4.0,"Not a bad place for lunch. You'll spend in the 10-15 range for something pretty filling that has all the basic food groups of rice or noodles, meat, and veggies. 

The $1 kimchee was on the sparse side. I feel like I only got 50 cents worth of this.

My spicy chicken wasn't very spicy but the chicken itself was good. It comes with this weird red cabbage slaw thing (American influence on Koreans is strong) and pickled radishes as well as a bit of salad. I didn't even finish it all but it was decent.

The matcha bomb is my favorite two things combined and In a way that tastes good. Most likely this means there is sugar in here in a decent amount but that combats the bitterness of the matcha and espresso really well. Almost too well.

The cafe has plenty of self seating. There is a laptop guy in the corner and a few latte drinkers and a few lunch eaters right now. 

I'd come here to chill out with a cute matcha latte with art next time. Goo goo dolls on the overhead speakers and all."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2017-04-22,3.0,"Sadly, I didn't get the panda bear art.  And since that was part of the reason I came here, when there are so many other great cafes in NYC, it was more than a minor bummer.  

But, I have to say, my matcha lattes were beautiful, & delicious.

Being right next to my hotel (The Arlo Nomad), it was really too convenient not to stop in.

The space itself is just as cute as everyone says it is.  And it is a cool vibe.  I didn't try the food, & I didn't come here at night when it transitions into a full service restaurant, so I'm only reviewing the ""cafe by day"" part.  I could definitely see myself perching here w my laptop for long periods, but I'm not sure how much this would really be welcomed given that they serve food in the daytime too.  I did see that there were customers working on laptops, but I didn't stay long so I didn't get the scoop.

Cash only.  Totally out of touch.  

3 stars."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-03-15,5.0,"One of my favorite places in NYC honesty,first of all their coffee/lattes is/are amazing and food is delicious and healthy,it's a self service kinda thing,you order and pay at the register but they bring you the food,decor is cute,cozy and inviting...Food is absolutely delicious and you can't go wrong with any choices you make...I love their regular latte as well as they new thing Orange latte,my two favorite things combined,Orange and
Coffee into one...seems like a dream land...it's simple and cozy either you are on a coffee or lunch break...there is only cash service and they close at 4pm"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2017-08-23,4.0,"Went to this place hoping for quiet and good wifi and I wasn't disappointed! I went around the opening time, not sure if it gets super busy later on. My only complaint is the place was very dark...but it adds to the ambiance definitely! So if you want to read or do something not on a computer or tablet, better to sit closer to the front where there are windows. 

Reason I came here was for the foam art on the drink! Not going to lie, it was worth it!! I got the green tea latte $5. Nothing too special about the drink itself, can get that anywhere.

I would come back here because I really like to the feeling of working in a cafe. The Wifi is ONLY 1 hour however, not 100% sure if there is something to bypass it or it just refreshes after 1 hour. (I didnt need the internet!)"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-05-18,4.0,"Such a cute little place. I came here to try their matcha latte (with latte art!). The guy barista took his time to ""draw"" my latte art, and I have to say I was impressed by his art work.

The temperature of the latte was warm, not hot. I assume that's to ensure the latte art stays. The latte was thicker than most matcha lattes I've had before. Overall, I really enjoyed my visit."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-08-16,5.0,The two ladies who were working today were the sweetest and super patient with me as I realized there is no such thing as a chocolate latte..............because that's a mocha.

Ambiance - I met a friend here around 3:30 so it was relatively quiet and empty. The cafe has a pretty cozy feel to it overall. 

Drink - I ordered a soy matcha latte, and not only was the bear adorable but the drink was delicious! It definitely falls under one of the best matcha latte's I've had in NY. 

Service - The staff was friendly overall. They also bring the drinks to the table once ready. 

They close pretty early at 4pm, and it's also cash only."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-02-17,4.0,"This place is a cafe during the day and gastropub (Take31) at night, which is pretty cool. 

Their lattes are pretty good and the latte art is very adorable. If you don't ask for the bear latte art, you get the flower/heart one by default. I tried the dirty matcha latte which has a shot of espresso. It's surprisingly pretty strong but it's masked by the matcha latte flavor. Overall very smooth. They bring your food and beverage to you as opposed to you getting it yourself, which is pretty nice of them. 

Wifi is only for an hour so not really a good place to do work here. A lot of people come here to catch up and socialize; it doesn't get too loud here and it's a very casual vibe here."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2017-01-20,4.0,"Woah! Cute matcha and red velvet lattes are the highlight of your Cup & Cup visit. 

The restaurant itself is transitioned from Take31's bar-like atmosphere into a well lit cafe, providing breakfast options from pastries to cooked meals. Cloud like decor surrounds you from the cloud above that changes light to the blue/white backboard for the bench seating area. 

Note that the matcha latte and red velvet latte is sweetened and it's more foam than milk so think cappuccino. 

I chose the matcha latte and a croissant. The barista placed the croissant on a table and gave it to me but brought my latte to my seat.

The croissant unfortunately was a bit stale. Maybe they were yesterday's leftover? 

On the bright side, it's a good spot to relax, read a good book or catch up with a friend as the cafe is relatively quiet. 

Definitely give this place a go! I'm marking it as one of my favorite places for matcha latte! 

Note: It's cash ONLY so make sure to stop by an ATM before your visit !!"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2019-06-19,5.0,"idk who chooses the MUSIC here but their PLAYLIST is ON POINT. Ofc along with appeasing my music taste, they also know how to make excellent coffee. It's hard to find places that make a really good almond cappuccino, but the baristas here do a great job and manage to keep the coffee flavor alive/ milk frothy even though almond milk is a bit hard to work with. I spent a few hours doing some studying/remote work here- they have outlets but take note the wifi lasts an hour- good for doing my readings. Also it is cash only!"
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2018-05-04,4.0,"I just come for the latte art (my stars reflect purely the skill rather than the taste) - I get that it's gimmicky but not many people are skilled enough to do it, so I just pay for that.

The matcha latte itself doesn't have enough matcha in it and it doesn't taste very special. So, if you're a connoisseur, I wouldn't recommend coming. However, if you're into cute latte art, definitely give it a go!

Cash only."
628,cup-and-cup-new-york,2016-10-07,4.0,"Cup & Cup is half super-cute cafe, and half Korean fast casual dining.

Came here to meet up with someone over coffee. You order at the front (cash only) and then you can sit anywhere and they'll bring your drinks over.  The back room is great if you want a little more privacy, hate sunlight, or just like the faux-rusticness of exposed brick.

Yes, they do silly latte art, but I went with the Matcha Bomb, which was a green tea matcha drink with a shot of espresso. It was definitely interesting. I think I liked it.

Their lattes are also huge.

Before I left, I also picked up a to-go order of their food. I did the pork katsu with onigiri. I thought it was okay. Nothing special, but pretty cheap and the portions were alright.

This place also turns into Take 31 at night!"

In any case, the ambience.  It was so so.  It was a bit dark towards the back, but at least there was an adequate amount of seating. Not too loud, not super crowded.  It was INCREDIBLY hot though.  For anyone that lives in the area, we all know how hot and muggy it gets and how unattractive these pools of sweat become.  No one wants to go into a facility for it to be the same or worse than the heatwave outside.  I couldn't wait to get out so much that I told my friend who was going to meet me here to choose a different place for me to meet them at.

The only way I can describe the service here is to call it awkward.  They weren't rude by any means, not nice, but for some reason people just seemed confused?  Then I got confused.  I also wasn't sure if I was supposed to wait for my drink, so I stood at the counter.  I realized later though that they will come and give you your drink (oops), which is nice.  

Granted, I only got the red velvet latte, so I suppose I don't have much to rate as far as food/drink, but I was pretty disappointed.  I was expecting it to be amazing based on reviews.  It was very plain.  However, I went for the latte art, and got the latte art.  It is a nice bright red, reflecting the bright red powder used for the drink, and has accents of pink as far as gradients of milk get mixed in to the strokes of latte art.

My biggest peeve about this place is that someone was smoking inside.  Why wasn't anything said about this?  Not only is this a health and safety issue, but if I'm not mistaken, indoor smoking has been banned by law... perhaps there isn't a distinction between cigarettes, vaping, etc, but still.  Not my preference... maybe something was mentioned after I left, but in the time I was there and it was (obviously) happening? No bueno."
629,luna-coffee-shop-new-york,2020-01-15,5.0,"Unique selection of food/beverages with tons of seating. A little on the more expensive side but worth it if you are looking for somewhere to do work or catch up with a friend. If I was just grabbing a coffee on the go, I might opt for elsewhere.

The staff was friendly & helpful in explaining beverage options. I didn't feel silly asking questions and appreciated that there was down-to-earth vibe, since some small artsy coffee shops can be more intimidating. 

I tried the turmeric latte and liked it. My friend tried one of the grilled cheeses with a matcha latte & both seemed good. I liked that there was the option of grab & go snacks as well as a food menu to order from. I would want to come back and try the vegan burger option. They also have oat milk, soy milk, and almond milk for dairy free options. 

Overall- worth checking out for the ample seating and relaxing atmosphere."

Reviews here are high, so we expected a good cup of coffee, but it was awful. It tasted like the burnt leftovers of coffee. Now, I'll drink most coffee, from super expensive awarded places to the instant coffee served by my senior relatives. I drank three sips of that ghost of coffees past and then tossed it out. My boyfriend also tried this place (led by reviews), and had a similar experience. Never again."

629,luna-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-10-13,2.0,"I came here again for a cupholder event and usually loved the special drinks that were offered. The special drinks were Orange Lemonade, Hibiscus Turmeric, Orange Spice Chai, and Golden Matcha.

I got the cold Orange Lemonade ($5.50) because I wanted something fruity. When I received the drink, I thought there would be chopped pieces of oranges, but there were none, so it made me skeptical about the taste of the drink. After taking a sip of the drink, it was upsetting because it tasted like water and I could not even taste the lemonade. It was like one of those powdered drink mix with water.

However, I loved how the drink came in a strawless sippy cup lid."
629,luna-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-09-08,5.0,"Came here in the morning, there was a short line but it moved pretty quick. I had ordered an oatmeal with three different toppings along with a caramel latte. 

The oatmeal to my surprise was a lot of oatmeal, you definitely get a generous portion which kept me full for half of the day! It was also very delicious with the chocolate chips the honey and the bananas. I would definitely get that again. 

The coffee was pretty good but I didn't really taste the caramel flavoring most likely because it's not the same as Starbucks where are you can taste the sugary caramel flavor. It felt as though it was a more natural type of flavor in which I liked. Overall a very nice experience and I would definitely come back."

BUT their coffee was a total let down. I got their large Iced Latte, which I usually get or Iced Espresso just to differentiate the coffee notes of all the coffees I try. This was the first time that I didn't finish my coffee, it taste so bad. Idk if I just got a bad shot of espresso, but it was not the good kind of bitter you'd like in your coffee. And I like my coffee strong. 

Again, I love their staff! They were so friendly and attentive to your needs."
629,luna-coffee-shop-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,"If you're in the mood for some pretty bomb grilled cheese, triple decker style, and a place to chill, you've found it. I stumbled upon this coffee shop/cafe last week while looking for a place to do some work and pass the time until my appointment. I decided to try the salami, muenster cheese and arugula triple decker grilled cheese and had no regrets! The salami to cheese to bread ratio was perfect; the arugula was minimal but is anyone eating this type of grilled cheese looking for it to be a healthy meal? I also got a matcha latte with honey and oat milk (24oz) which was also delicious and I appreciate the lid that allowed me to sip from without a straw. My total came out to about $19 for both things, which isn't too bad considering the size of the grilled cheese and the location of the place. I will certainly be stopping by again."

The bread in between is well-toasted, giving it a different texture from the other slices. It was a good grilled cheese. Quite large compared to the average coffeeshop sandwich. 

Seating options are diverse. There's a lounge feel to the place. I would definitely come here to get work done. Went in during lunch hours but the place was not crowded at all. The restroom was fairly clean."
629,luna-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-02-28,4.0,"Nice little coffee shop 2 blocks from Korea town - a much better option than the hotel coffee. Initially, it looks like a a small coffee shop with barely enough seating but there's a whole other seating area by the pick up counter.

The baristas were pleasant! 

I got a large iced coffee which came in a strawless sipping cup. The ice cubes were frozen coffee, so that as it melted it didn't get watered down. So smart! 
I also bought a double chocolate chip muffin and it was giant! Moist cake with lots of mini chocolate chips in it. 

The whole experience was excellent! I wish I this was closer to my usual haunts so I could come here more often."

I ordered an ice tea which was already premade but tasted like the mighty leaf tropical green tea over ice. They offer a variety of pastries and sandwiches. Music is a little on the louder side but mainly alternative/old school music."
629,luna-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-11-08,1.0,"Came in around the afternoon to meet up with a coworker (I do freelance video editing). I bought my coffee and sat down to do work. Please remember the fact that I BOUGHT A COFFEE.

Had a few friends stop by and they had also bought drinks themselves and they came and went. After working for a few hours, I step up to go to the bathroom but when I came back, the owner had told us to leave and never come back because we were ""disrupting his business."" My friend was trying to tell him that we had bought drinks and had also brought more people in who had bought drinks themselves, but he simply cut him off and told him ""not to talk back to him."" We were completely ushered out in disarray and appalled by the antagonizing nature he was displaying to us. Did we do something wrong? He kept an eye on us the entire time to made sure we left and kept reminding us that he ""had a business to run""

He told us to never come back and we most definitely will not. Let this be a warning to anyone who dares set up a laptop to do work in a coffee shop! We are disrupting business with all the other people we're bringing who buy their own drinks!"

Stopped by in the morning to grab a latte and a bagel and loved the ambiance in the morning. There was a steady trickle of customers and the coffee came quickly to each.

In general there's a large amount of seating in the front and in the back which is a plus for nyc where most places are a broom closet or just stands. 

I got their warm chai latte which is exactly what I wanted for a cool morning and a bagel with cream cheese. Although I would have liked the cream cheese spread on instead of dumped on, I can't fault them with the amount of customers. 

Whenever I'm in nyc, I'll hit this place up again."

They have an extensive menu which includes a variety of food and drinks. There Is also plenty of seating in the back. The back section is very New York. It has that grungy character which I live for. The paintings in the back are very unique as well. They have a photo of Spider-Man! My favvv! You get your dose of art while you're sipping on your cup o' joe.
The staff here is incredibly friendly. The guy who took my order was super funny and charismatic. I'll make sure to get his name on the way out. 

This is also a great place to work and study. It is fairy quiet and definitely spacious with comfy couches and decent sized tables.

I will definitely be making my way back here a few times a week!"

I got a hot latte ($4). It was pretty good but I like my drinks on a more sweeter side so after dumping a pack of sugar in, perfect. My friend got a iced pomegranate tea; she said hers was too sweet.
The staff were very nice and accommodating to the groups of female customers swarming coming into the cafe for the cup holders/photo cards.
I think it's really cool the cafe was down for this collaboration and I look forward to future possible opportunities like this!"

629,luna-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-11-17,5.0,Great coffee shop to hang out in. I met a friend here before an event. She was very excited because she's vegan and they had a vegan lemon poppyseed dessert that turned out to be delicious.I just got an iced coffee but was excited to find that their ice cubes are made of coffee! I love when cafes do that and you can take your time enjoying your coffee without it getting watered down. Their space is pretty large to be a cafe and we sat in a sort of back room where there was a piano and a long table where a few students were doing work. I will definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood.
629,luna-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-10-23,3.0,"Coffee and oatmeal before work. It was simple, just nothing memorable.

629,luna-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-04-24,4.0,"Luna Coffee Shop has the perfect feel of a local cafe. The front half of the cafe opens up to the street to let in light and breeze and sound on a nice sunny day while still providing that hole-in-the-wall distance from the city. The back space is cozier with a (unplayed) piano in the corner and couches. Iced coffee and Almond Croissant was the perfect light lunch pick-me-up. My only critique would be that outlets were hard to come by (though I could see a staircase going up, an entire floor I didn't explore). If you need to work with a laptop, I suggest you grab a spot at the high table in the front of the cafe, closer to the register. There's a power strip under the tabletop and as far as I could tell, that was the only accessible outlet."

I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't comment on their coffee but I do drink tea and they have a great selection from full caffeine to no caffeine,  I opted for a vanilla decaf tea with a little honey which I then topped of with some light sprinkles of nutmeg and cinnamon, it was so good 
Also had a gluten free freshly baked blueberry orange bread which was just so tasty and light and super fresh just like it says. 
This will be my new go to place whenever I'm in the area.

GREAT:
- the interior is spacey and cute. There's room in the front for talking and there's back of the cafe where it's quiet so people can do their study/homework. 
- the staff are friendly and patient. 
- the coffee is good! It's not too bitter (for those who don't like bitter coffee this is the place to go!), and the price is fair for what you get. I prefer to spend my $2.75 here than at Starbucks for sure (support local places!). 
- the food can be a little pricey for sure but you'll pay the same amount anywhere you go. Again, id rather pay for pricey pastries/sandwiches here than at Starbucks (local places FTW).

It was the holiday week and this bakery was super packed. Lots to look at and select from. 

Undecided about where to buy a dessert cake for post Christmas and switching things up from the reliable (but extremely delicious) Italian delights and treats I recently devoured, I peeked and poked around Tous Les Jours, left, then visited the other 2 bakeries on this block ultimately returning back here.

This spot was spacious for catching up with friends, grabbing some coffee and sweet or savory treats. As I looked over the pretty-as-a-picture counter display, I was clueless about the fillings per cake. The staff were helpful but I also bumped into a Korean customer who flat out asked if I ever had a Korean cake. I replied I've had Chinese which was always light as a feather and delicious. Does that count?

Still undecided because they all looked so good, the  worker pointed to the one I ended up buying saying it was the most popular. It was certainly decorative and at $29, I wondered if the filling matched the exterior. I threw caution to the wind and bought it.

It was delicately placed in a beautiful box with a plastic serrated knife included! How convenient. The size of the cake rendered 6 servings and it was a crowd pleaser. Lots of whipped cream, yellow cake and some fruit (but not a lot). It tasted like Strawberry Shortcake.
Delish!

I really like this bakery and could easily return to try other items, including coffee and to chill with friends. BTW, those pretty cakes are also sold by the slice.

Solid."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-12-23,3.0,"I came here on a Saturday night around 8p for some post-dinner dessert on my birthday. The place was mostly full but we were able to secure seats at one of the larger tables for four people. 

I bought a slice of the green tea cake and the souffle cheesecake. The greentea cake was pretty tasty, I wish there was a stronger green tea flavor to the cake but there was a lot of buttercream frosting compared to the actual green tea cake layer. I was severely disappointed by the souffle cheesecake that I bought. We could not cut into the cheesecake at all since it was mostly frozen in the center so we wound up hacking away at the cheesecake and making a mess in the process. The cheesecake definitely needed some more time to thaw prior to being sold to customers.

I'm attributing my disappointment to the two items that I ordered, there were plenty of other bread-based desserts and cakes which looked delicious, if I come back here I will probably opt for another dessert option from what what I purchased this time around."

Have you ever had too much filling?  Not that I was thinking there was too much, but there was a lot!  Smooth, not too sweet ridiculous ratio of red bean filling to fresh delicate slightly chewy mochi.  They were $2.25 each, but we got a 4 pack for $6.95, so we have mochi for tomorrow too!  There were lots of other tempting goodies that looked incredibly hard to resist, but they won't fit in my carry on luggage."

Bought a loaf of chestnut bread and mini danish bread. I love chestnut bread and only see them at Korean bakeries.
I also like the selection of bread and cakes."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-08-18,5.0,"I prefer Three Les Jours and Four Les Jours, but this will have to do.

Totally adorable Korean bakery right in the heart of Koreatown, that has public bathrooms that aren't even too horrible and pretty nice employees - some of them anyway - and some pretty good Korean goodies.

So most locations of this Bakery are more than just a little overpriced and not too exciting but this one is packed and thrilling and a vital part of Koreatown New York City."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2020-01-20,5.0,"A lot of people come here for their shaved iced and ice cream but I was feeling the strawberry cake and the tiramisu as well as the lavender latte.

The strawberry cake itself tasted extremely artificial but they use real strawberries in between the layer. The artificial flavor can be similar to strawberry pocky but much more overpowering. 

The tiramisu was great. Nothing to complain about. Same could be said for the latte.

Came here around 7:30 pm on a Friday so it was packed despite the size of the bakery. It was definitely loud but not too loud that you have to scream at each other. 

Overall, a good spot to go to for dessert  if you don't want to go to Grace St."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-08-24,3.0,"I have had some wonderful cakes at Tous Les Jours but this is the first time I went there for dessert.

Strawberry fresh cream cake - The cake unlike most cakes these days is too creamy. Makes the cake taste very average. I would definitely pass on it next time. 

Tiramisu - the tiramisu is good but nothing extraordinary

Chocolate cloud cream cake 3 - excellent choice! Chocolate and fresh berries blend very well! I ordered this for a party of 10 and it was over in a few minutes!"
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-08-24,3.0,"If you asked me where is the best pastries here in New York City. I will definitely tell you it's Tous Les jours.
It is not too sweet but yet rich in flavor. Always freshly baked and neatly arranged. Just be mindful,
Each pastries is pricey but if it's good, I really do not care.  I love that they have wide tables and chairs inside in their Koreatown branch.  You can absolutely enjoy your coffee and what ever you prefer croissant and a lot more.
One thing that I noticed, their main glass door are full of finger prints and sticky meaning it is clearly telling me that everything on that door is very dirty.  I don't think I've been to that bakery where it appears clean, thats the reason why I always hold with a napkin.  The business owner of this bakery should pay attention to its appearance and cleanliness. That's just one of my obvious observations."

Must visit :)

Customer service is good too."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-12-08,4.0,The only bad thing about this place is that it is always so crowded (which means it's good!) the cakes and desserts are delicious and it's always a great spot for a quick snack/dessert!
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-06-22,3.0,"This is a great place for a quick snack, there are plenty of options and the prices are reasonable.  The items itself are average, nothing tastes super fresh and the croquette and hot dog buns were not warm (guess you could zap it up in the microwave real quick).  But I like this place for the convieance and easy to pick out a few treats and eat it there or on the go.

The milk bun was definitely my favorite, it was very soft and the cream inside was good."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2020-01-15,4.0,"One of the best places for Asian-style bread and pastries. I've seen this brand in many cities. It's great to have one in New York. 

I have tried a bunch of bread and cakes. So, here are some items I highly recommended: 
Milky bread - super soft. 
Chocolate croissant - it looks different from croissants from other cafes. It has both a chocolate covering and chocolate filling. 
Chocolate cornet - sometimes it gets too sweet but overall rich in chocolate. 
Chocolate bread (Yes, I am a big fan of chocolate.)  
Tiramisu 
Custard cream bread

The cafe is quite spacious - you will find plenty of seats in the back. And they have a microwave in case you want to heat up the bread."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2020-02-21,3.0,"French inspired Asian patisserie. I came here twice so far. The first time I took the mango mouse and it was smooth and flavorful. The second time I took the same mango mouse and it was dense and bland tasting. The mangoes on top as decorations were dry and hard. Not pleased with the last experience. Whatever you get, make sure its fresh if you actually want to enjoy it."

The green tea shaved ice cream is soooo good. And a very shareable size. I am never let down when I visit here. Masheesayo!!! (Tasty)  stay blessed!!

Cons: not too many cheesecake options, the non cheesecake cake was nothing special, a lot of stuff was wrapped in plastic or didn't seem super fresh 

The experience was not terrible but not excellent."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-09-30,4.0,"I don't always go to Tous Les Jours, but when I do...I go absolutely crazy.

This place makes me feel like a kid in a candy store because they offer such a wide range of sweets and bread. It's hard not to buy extra things that you initially didn't intend on getting! My absolute favorite is the croque monsieur - it's super filling and the taste isn't overpowering. I usually take it home and heat it up before eating, which makes it even tastier!

Their drinks are disappointing (especially their milk tea which was really diluted), but I guess that's not their specialty so it's not that big of a deal. They're also a bit overpriced, so for basics like croissants you can find much cheaper options elsewhere. For their specialties though I'm always willing to pay extra.

It's usually pretty crowded, but there are a lot of seats so it's not too difficult to find a spot especially when you go by yourself."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-09-18,4.0,"I have visited this store several times, but doing this review for the birthday cake that we purchased particularly from this store. The Cloud cream cake. It was perfect not too sweet but light and the cake was fluffy and soft. A little bit pricey. But the store name explains it all. They serve hot drinks and have tables and chairs for customers in their 32nd Koreatown store. Keep your receipts cause code for  restroom is noted on that. This store is grade A!"
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-10-24,4.0,"Excellent.

Your typical Asian bakery offerings but stepped UP. Yeah, there's obviously the hotdog infused breads but there are also:

CROQUETTES

Hey, do your self a favour and buy one or two or many. Personally, the curry croquette is my favourite. Mostly savoury with a bit of sweet and spice, the hallmarks of good East Asian curries. The bread is fried just right and that panko coating sets it off just right.

I'm so sad that this doesn't exist north of the border otherwise I'd be eating these everyday. 

Actually no, it's good that they don't because this is a treat and my waistline will not be happy.

Anyhow, do yourself a favour and stop here when you need a break. Tons of seating, air con and oh yeah, good food. 

I'm now deliberating if I should get too much of a good thing or call it."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-01-17,5.0,"Omg, this is the best bakery I have ever been to. This is my favorite place in korea town. You cannot come empty hand from here. They have fresh pastries which I am a big fan of. They have huge variety of flavors in cake/slices like mocha, tiramisu, double chocolate, mousses and fruit pastry. I have tried each one from above and still cannot say which one is the best because I can eat all of them again. They are so light and fluffy feels like having sweet snow in mouth. They have so beautiful cakes for all occasions. I will definately order my birthday cake from here :)

Second best thing here is their different types of bread, what king of bread you want man? You will get it here. I have tried mocha, mochi, milk & honey, almond crust, chocolate flavored breads and they all are very delicious. You cannot stop eating after you taste. 

So many to-go items on display, puff pastries, rolls, donuts(savory & sweet), hot dogs, croissant(almond, chocolate), cream puffs. Ice-creams and sweet drinks are also available. I really like the staff they always give suggestions depending upon the taste.

Whenever I am near 33rd street, I always end of eating here.

******
Update : I bought a heart shaped cake, it was for a special occasion in my family and I wanted to buy the best cake for them. I was confused as I came to buy a tiramisu but seeing this heart shape cake distracted me. One of the staff member came to me and started suggesting me as I was taking a long time to order(:D). She told me that all the cakes on display are fresh. It tasted amazing and everyone in my family loved it. Without a doubt, this is my dessert/cake place for all occasions.

Service is 100% as always."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-12-15,3.0,"Review #346 - 2019

After grabbing our drinks at Kung Fu Tea a few doors down, it was still raining so I decided to stop at Tous Les Jours to grab a few pastries for my daughter so she could have something to snack on later.

I was kind of expecting them to have some similar selections compared to 85°, but sadly, nothing looked very familiar.  They're mainly sweets, not much savory buns.

My daughter ended up with three of their mini hot dog buns & three of the strawberry macarons.  Price wise, it's not crazy expensive, but paying well over a dollar for a tiny hot dog bun the size of my pinkie seemed quite outrageous, but it's NYC, I guess...

I didn't try any of the stuff she picked, but she seemed to enjoy the mini hot dogs; although, she didn't seem to like the strawberry macarons too much.  She only ate one in two days & she loves macarons.  She can normally eat three in one sitting.  The fact that she let two of them go to waste just means it wasn't to her liking.

I still appreciated the fact that we were able to find a table to hang out at while we waited for the rain to die down."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2020-02-08,5.0,This plaace was a recommendation from a friend. This is my first time here in Mew York. I'm not much of a pastry person but the croissant i had was on point. It was light and fluffy just like the cream inside. The environment inside is very nice. I think the wood trays are a very nice touch as well as the decorum. Nice job.
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2020-01-25,4.0,"Great option for bakery in Korean Town, Varieties are awesome pricing is reasonable  for NYC but it's a fast check out so no line :-) if your on the go!"
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-01-06,4.0,"Picked up a few pastries to go and while they were all good I truly enjoyed the fruit pastry the best. So light and just the right hint of sweetness. I think it was a blackberry with whipped cream on a light crispy pastry. Everything looks so good it's really hard to choose.

You walk in and grab a tray, a paper for the tray and place whatever items you want to purchase on the tray. They box and/or bag your items at the register. Nice vibe and cute interior, although really crowded so we got our items to go. 

I really liked the lemon macaron and the earl gray macaron was different (in a good way) - I loved it.  My daughter loved the green tea macaron. I must say I'm eager to go back in the near future because I didn't get nearly enough. I wanted to wake up and have something sweet with my coffee but we finished the few items I purchased the same night."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-08-08,3.0,"Mochi was slimy, runny, with the texture and semblance of a swamp. If the aesthetics weren't insulting enough, the outside green layer of the mochi was overly salty!! Perhaps they mixed up the labels of the salt and sugar when making it? 

Been here before and the cakes here are pretty good, but definitely won't be getting the mochi again."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2020-02-09,5.0,"I purchased a cake for my bf birthday because their cakes are beautiful enough to look like you actually planned the whole thing. He loved it, the cake tasted pretty good and $40 for a cake that size and how pretty it was I thought was a give away. I also purchased a castella and another bread roll thingy smothered in almond sauce. Everything tasted great, the place is just too packed but I'm guessing is because they are so good in cuisine."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-02-05,4.0,"Ambiance 4/5, Food 3/5

i love having Asian breads and pastries. The ones from Tous Le Jours are not the best - although they look pretty. They have a slight French influence with their pastries (lots of croissant based things). I ate as always the infamous milk bun (underwhelming since its really just some soggy bread with custard in it), and a cream puff. The pastry itself isn't crusty as a choux dough should be, and the filling wasn't awesome.

Ambiance however is a great place for meeting up in K-Town. It has high ceilings and lots of seating. If you order drinks for here, they will give you a pager, and you can go back up to the counter to get your drink. It gets a little hectic when this happens, but if you want your drink, you'll have to muscle through the checkout line to get it."
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-05-15,4.0,"Oh flaky Asian bread and Korean pastries, how I've missed you so. Fresh off a trip to Rome with decadent European cookies, I was craving these lighter snacks. This TLJ is super roomy, with bathrooms and a downstairs kitchen. Great place to study, chat, or simply watch carts of fresh bread come out! I want to try the rainbow cake someday!"
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2019-06-07,4.0,"Came here with my friend after we ate... just craved something sweet so here's my PSFP...

Place: kinda big. They were still open late night so that was nice. 

Service: was quick. Great because they were kind of busy. The place is packed because it was a weekend and I guess everybody was around Koreatown drinking lol

Food: love it! The green tea dessert I got (I forgot what it's called but I got a pic) and the icepops we got were yummmmm

Price: average. It's the price you expect from any asian bakeries"
630,tous-les-jours-new-york-4,2020-02-17,1.0,"I will avoid to buy cake from there. It takes 20 minutes wait without a staff help. If only few staff able to handle the cake and they are busy, management please get more staff to help people in front of the line. Not people End of the line to get the cake. Basic Management 101. Not just tell you customer wait until you free and people keep Line up to pay."

631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-11-15,4.0,"A nice stop in Chelsea Market for a quick bite or caffeinated beverage, especially if you are there before 10am. Amy's is one of the few places open early so get in before the hordes descend!

I had a ham & cheese biscuit that I liked - it was a buttery, crumbly biscuit aka perfect. And for less than $6, even better!

Nice staff, cute interior, support your local baker!"
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-10-21,5.0,"Amy is doing something right as this place inside Chelsea Market was hoppin' with folks getting all kinds of bread and deserts. Had a fabulous OAT SCONE with bananas and pecans. Even better when I heated this up at home and added some jam as these were not too sweet (which is a good thing). 

They have lots of other stuff we wanted to try -- but there are SO MANY amazing options in the market a scone was all we could muster."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2020-01-02,3.0,Just a review of one item today ... I'll be back to try some more. Had a hankering for a cupcake and went with their vanilla cupcake with pink frosting. The cake itself was a bit dense almost rubbery and particularly dry. Definitely not the  the light and fluffy cake I was expecting. The frosting is A+ . Will be back to try more items though.
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2020-02-23,5.0,I visited here for breakfast this morning. It was pretty busy for 9am on a Sunday. Line moved fairly quickly. Bagels were fresh and really good.
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-10-29,4.0,When into this place on a whim because they were a lot of people. I tried their famous sticky bun and the chocolate sourdough stick. I love sourdough and this place did not disappoint. The quality of the bread was really impressive and I really enjoyed eating the two pastries I chose. I recommend stopping by if you want to grab something sweet or something quick to eat (they have sandwiches and bread as well).
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-08-29,4.0,A great bakery with lots of choices. Came here for bagel and lox and it's great. Bagel is light and toast to a perfect crunch. Had coffee too it's delish!
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-07-17,3.0,"Maybe I went too basic, but I wasn't wowed by the baguette and plain bagel I got. The baguette was all crust and not very fresh, and the bagel was gummy... too chewy and not fragrant enough. They were just ok."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-02-16,4.0,"Fun little chain bakery in New York, this location is located within the famous Chelsea Market. 

Being one of the few options open during the wee hours at Chelsea Market, it only made sense to grab some bread and a coffee. They have a small variety of breads, sweet and savory treats, and a good drink menu. As mentioned above I visited during the opening hours, so the market and Amy's Bread was a ghost town, but plenty of seating to go around (Not sure during busy hours though). As for pricing, its New York and Chelsea Market to be more specific, expect about a 20% extra fee on top of everything you are accustomed to in your hometown bakery. That is not to take away from their fresh and tasty treats, but it is a tad expensive. Staff was nothing to write home about, but for a quick to go type order, I cannot complain honestly.

If you need a quick pick me up, Amy's Bread can definitely provide that at any moments notice."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-11-20,5.0,A beautiful and delicious cake for an important birthday. The custom 'bee' on top made my day. I'm now a fan of Amy's Bread and carrot cake.
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-02-15,5.0,"Excellent scone and coffee! Highly recommend, specially in Chelsea Market to recharge your energy."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-07-30,1.0,"I love Amy's bread! But after getting to know the Chelsea market Amy's bread manager it changed for good. I'm amazed how rude a guy in charge of a business could be after asking him that the beverage I ordered was wrong. Amy's bread owners should rethink if they want to keep a guy like this in their franchise. 
I'll definitely be back to Amy's bread but not to the Chelsea mkt coffee shop."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2018-05-29,4.0,"Had a delicious egg and cheddar biscuit sandwich here when roaming around for some breakfast one Sunday. I've had goodies from the other locations - the black and white cookie is so good - but I definitely want to return to try the famed sticky bun!

Edit 8/2018: came back to get the sticky bun and wasn't terribly impressed; I think balthazar bakery's is better. Still one of my favorite black and white cookies, though!

Edit 10/2018: almond brioche toast and topped focaccia disk were decent, if not the best things ever. Alas, I will probably keep trying everything this place has to offer, considering the proximity to my apartment."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2018-10-20,4.0,"Reasons to come here:
1. You're craving a homemade grilled cheese and want to make it on their incredible, thick, fluffy sourdough loaf
2. You kinda forgot to get lunch and want one of their delicious focaccia topped with bacon and mozzarella

Anything involving Amy's bread (it's in the name!) is top-notch at this place, anything where their fresh bread can shine as a crust or a sandwich. 

Anything in the pastry world, like cupcakes, cakes, danishes etc., is okay, but there is better in NYC. 

The secret is in the name. Get the bread!"
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-06-16,5.0,"I read so many good things about this place, and it definitely lived up to the expectations. Everything smells so good inside. I really love the dim lighting, it makes it so cozy- especially on a rainy day. The salmon bagel is to die for! So rich and fresh! I also ate their lemon (insert fancy french word here) cake. It was so delicious and moist! There was enough seating and though the place was petite, it made for a great sit down breakfast! I love this place so much, and I think you will too!"
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-11-27,5.0,"Yum yum yum. I had visited Chelsea market and was craving something sweet and stumbled upon Amy's bread. I tried their seasonal pumpkin donut. It was so soft and tasty, not too sweet. Just perfect."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2018-12-17,3.0,"Ohh Amy! Girl, no. 

I live in Hell's Kitchen and work in Chelsea Market, so you're a mainstay for me. Breads and baguettes are always lovely. But the baked goods and pastry, cakes specifically are fully 50/50 odds at any location .

Today I bought 2 pieces of unacceptably oily foccicia (and I get it, I bake too, a lot.. olive oil is a critical flavor and feature of the bread, but this... was way too far and fatty, with not nearly enough salt or savory or compensate). 

But the reason I'm writing this review is for the German Chocolate Cake, which was straight up inedible. I got a slice around 5:30pm, on a likely day old (or two) cake. No shame in refrigerating a cake, but ABSOLUTE shame in throwing it in a fridge overnight with savories, considering the buttercream frosting and base... it ALL absorbed garlicky-weird-savory-fridge flavors. My partner and I were both super confused by the flavors, but as seasoned bakers ourselves, the error was clear. Moreover, the crumb collapsed as it was an older cake and took what is usually a dense but moist chocolate cake to a mealy and fridge-stink infused cake and frosting. We threw the slice away :("
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2018-11-21,4.0,"A personal favorite as a pastry fanatic. Chelsea Market would not be complete even with its plethora of baked shops without the likes of an Amy's Bread offering their famous selection of cakes, breadsticks, and the incredible almond brioche. The quality of products and selections are on par with locations in Greenwich Village and Hell's Kitchen. The staff is wonderful and friendly to talk to and are extremely helpful with recommendations if you are undecided. Chances are you will end up ordering way more than you need. In this instance, that might not be a bad thing."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-09-15,3.0,"Great for a quick grab and go, but it's losing its special touch. I wish they would have had the chocolate chocolate chip cookies. If you only have one chance to go to Amy's while in NYC, go to the one in Hell's Kitchen."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-08-26,4.0,"We got breakfast here this morning. I highly recommend the seeded twist and the almond brioche. I wasn't completely thrilled about the egg in the bacon, egg, and cheese. And the ham and swiss croissant was good. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying other stuff on their menu."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-09-01,5.0,"Better run in soon to Amy's Bread in Chelsea Market, as their specialty Ecuador Sandwich will be gone soon and is not to be missed.  Don't forget complimentary hot sauce, and a great corresponding salad of greens, cannellini beans, zucchini, and much more with garlic lime dressing.  What a lucky find!  Enjoyed after entering High Line at Vessel, lovely neighborhood walk, and then this delicious lunch near the end!  Bought these two items and split between two. 
PS:  Amy's Bread makes the sandwich!"
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-02-05,5.0,Very nice environment great coffee and wonderful staff I would recommend this place to everyone
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2018-10-21,3.0,"The black and white cupcake I ordered was amazing! I was actually really surprised at its taste. I am a cupcake connoisseur, and so for me to really like a cupcake takes a lot. The inside decor was also very nice. I liked the blue walls and the wooden elements, I also enjoyed seeing ""Amy's"" picture on the wall. She was smiling while holding bread. I was like go girl, look at you making your dreams come true!

I rated 3 stars only because I did also order this olive bread twist, and I must say I was incredibly disappointed. It was hard and not very good at all. To be honest I threw it away. For the price I feel like it should have been in my stomach and not the trash. But it could be that they were made in the morning and by the time I arrived they had been out all day and stale. Who knows. But I would visit this place again to try some of their other sweets and maybe a different bread."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-04-13,5.0,"Finally got to try Amy's bread after all this time walking by it. It was delicious, I definitely recommend the cheese biscuit toasted. It just has the perfect flavor and it's reasonably priced."

631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2017-08-23,4.0,"This is a review based in their potato baguette. Went in with some friends right around the time they were about to close so the selection wasn't plentiful. I opted to try the potato one because carb upon carb-- I was up for the challenge. Smh at why the price was $4.75 but thought, well 1) location 2) touristy 3) Amy's so this better be worth it. Well the 4 of us ""broke bread"" literally outside the store and the bread was just this amazing deliciousness. Rye on the outside (a nice surprise, would've been a bit annoyed if not a rye fan as it wasn't mentioned at all when purchasing so be forewarned) and nice soft chewy bites of potato filling inside. Not to mention, there was a hint of a peppery aftertaste I definitely enjoyed. It was definitely yummy and still soft and edible the next day! In terms of taste, portion size and uniqueness of flavor, it was definitely worth the value."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-06-24,5.0,"Go in and try the chocolate twists! They are my guilty pleasure. Very friendly staff as well, especially with the high volume of customers."

631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-11-15,2.0,Slowest service in NYC and they don't care. Over 10 minutes for a toasted bagel. When I asked the manager just blew me off. Real NYC attitude.
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-11-24,1.0,"Over the years, I've frequented the Hell's Kitchen location. Without fail, the staff are always unfriendly, and often seem annoyed to be serving customers. The store always seems to be understaffed. For the prices they charge, service should be better."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-04-29,2.0,"Food items tasty,  customer service un-tasty! Then again it's Chelsea  Market and that would probably burn out the heartiest customer service person.  (Advice to them,  if you can't hear someone, don't get all pissy and hey funky with the attitude)"
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-05-11,1.0,"The most ridiculous, poorly thought out, time wasting ordering system possible. Even if you only want a tea or a pre-made item that's sitting right there on the counter, you have to line up with the people getting sandwiches and toasted bagels. Half the staff is nice, the other half is so up their own a** and rude, I wanted to remind them they weren't solving cancer. Just grabbing me a muffin. Which I would have appreciated had it not taken them 15 minutes and a whole lot of attitude. There are so many better and more affordable options at Chelsea market. Forget this place!"
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2017-10-16,2.0,Not hard to find and line goes pretty fast. Can be kind of crowded sometimes especially in the afternoon. Decent bread but nothing too special. I had to get just one dinner roll instead of the 6 because it's for a class assignment...the lady working there handed the roll to the man cashier while whisper how much she hate when people just get one and not everything...kind of rude and if it wasn't for the class I don't think I'd have tried it and definitely not going back.
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-10-27,2.0,Service was great but we came here specifically because another review said they had amazing hot chocolate...the hot chocolate was expensive and was honestly bland! Everything else looked good but the hot cocoa is a pass.
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2017-07-29,4.0,"Was craving carbs while walking around Chelsea Market and this pistachio croissant twist was just what I needed! The shape was a bit awkward to make it look good on this plate, but nonetheless the presentation was beautiful and it was the right mix of salty and sweet. Most of the pastries I saw while walking around Chelsea Market were really tiny portions, but I was glad this was a little bigger so I could share with friends and that the filling wasn't too rich. Would recommend!"
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2018-04-22,5.0,"This review is purely for the chocolate chip cookie. I had heard it was incredible and was in Chelsea Market so I knew I needed to try it. The cookie was soft but had a bit of a crunch on the outside which was phenomenal. There was a subtle but noticeable hint of vanilla in each bite that paired beautifully with the rich chocolate Lu flavor of the chips. A+ chocolate chip cookie that was equally delicious but different than the gold standard, LeVain. I can't wait to come back and try the cupcakes. THey looked AMAZING."
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2019-04-06,4.0,"Thank you Amy's Bread for saving my morning -- after a horrible experience at Davidovich's which should be avoided at all costs, the cheerful salesperson's smile cheered me up, and the lightly toasted everything bagel with cream cheese was tasty and just the right size.  Thank you Amy's Bread!"
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2018-03-13,5.0,"First time at Amy's Bread, which is inside Chelsea Market where there is a great deal of stores and boutiques. You can buy breads, pastries, cake, cookies, sandwiches, and lunch items . Amy's has an assortment of cold drinks and of course you can buy your choice of coffee, lattes, etc..Small space, but if you'd like to eat in, there is a small seating area with stools. I purchased a few different rolls which were all tasty, and the ham and cheese croissant was delicious albeit it cost 6.25, not sure if that was correct since my receipt said bacon and egg?? Hmmm? Didn't notice until I was already on the train, will check that out next time..I also bought a slice of Brooklyn Blackout cake, yummy!! The coffee on the other hand was not so great, but then again, I'm very picky about my coffee..I would recommend Amy's everything else was great!!"
631,amys-bread-new-york-4,2015-11-24,3.0,"Amy's Bread is a bakery located in the Chelsea Market (they have other locations as well). I tried a red velvet cupcake and a slice of the apple pie. I was a bit disappointed by both items!

The red velvet cupcake was a bit too dry for my tastes. The icing on the top tasted more like tasteless whipped cream to me. I was not a huge fan of this cupcake.

The apple pie was decent but definitely on the super sweet side. I had about two bites before I decided I couldn't eat any more pie. I liked the crust though. It was very crumbly."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2020-01-15,5.0,"This is part of my daily routine, and short of calling corporate to gush over how friendly the staff are, I'll leave this Yelp review! Everyone I chat with always puts a smile on my face, and their knowledge about each of the dozens of teas has left me with a home tea bar full of diverse recommendations! Alyssa is super chill and always seems to make great suggestions to other regulars and inquiring customers whenever I'm in there. Jen is also excellent at selecting teas based on caffeine level and my daily mood, so I appreciate the heck out of them. The storefront is always clean, despite the endless construction outside next door. Tea prices are very reasonable and their rewards program is pretty valuable. There's no bathroom, since it's primarily retail, so keep that in mind if you're grabbing a tea to sit along the window at the front of the store!"
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2019-09-26,4.0,"My first time at DAVIDsTEA. Walked in here with my sister both equally curious and confused. The lady who serviced us was really kind and helpful. We asked for loose tea recommendations and she asked if we had any preferences to narrow down the choices. She brought some loose teas down for us to smell, but it was kind of hard to choose when everything smelled so nice. The two of us ended up getting an Iced Organic Blueberry Jam and an Iced Pomegrateful, which were absolutely delish.

Signed up for a membership card. Will definitely swing around again when in the neighborhood."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2019-10-24,4.0,"I love tea and I love David's tea. If you're a tea lover the Frequent Steeper rewards card offers great perks like free 4 oz of tea (of your choice!).

This location is always helpful when I want to change it up bringing down tin after tin of tea for me to sniff but the employees are hit/miss. They are ESPECIALLY helpful when they have store visits and if you happen to visit on those days you're in for a real treat. The girl with the eYe BrOwSSsS who is usually so ornery is very pleasant. She still shouts at you but is very pleasant. 


Cardamon French Toast is my fave."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2019-01-31,5.0,"I love teas with a hint of almond, and their toasted walnut green tea really does it for me. I've also had their passion fruit and black teas, and love them. They've gotta have something for all, as they offer green, black, oolong, white, matcha, herbal, and one more I'll never learn to say or write (starts with a p...). Their tea selection is impressive, and their big wall is so pleasing to look at. 

Their staff is always so courteous and sweet. James gave me my birthday drink! Sign up on their website to get yours! They also do samples on a regular basis. 

Love David's Teas and hope they expand fast."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2019-06-13,4.0,"I'm sad to write this review because I've been one of the biggest David's  tea fans for nearly a decade. But my last retail and online experience has been so bad that I may never return. 

I ordered 2 cups of tea and on the posted menu it said 2 dollars per cup of tea sachet tea. I ordered two cups and some merchandise, a tea frother and reusable mug. When I sat down I noticed I was charged the price for a custom tea 3 dollars for both. I spoke to the woman and referred to the menu posted and she says dismissively, ""oh that's wrong, I don't know why it says that."" And walked away. I was shocked, who does that? Then we said can we speak to the manager and she announced she was the assistant manager. Then we explained that the price advertised is the price that needs to be honored, if it's incorrect please remove it. She continued to act unapologetically and didn't seem to see the problem. Then we asked for her to offer us a refund or something complimentary, mind you I had just spent $50 bucks on products. She said, ""you want two tea bags!"" Surprised and then explained ""each tea bag js worth $2.50!"" As if you add insult to injury, no actually we just were overcharged 3 per cup! She never apologized or removed the sign but smacked two tea bags on the counter as if we were asking too much. Then upon trying to call customer service I was disconnected 3x. Then upon attempting to write an online help request I was cut off by a 400 character limit! Then the 25 dollar frother? It's broken out of the box. 
David's tea: your a company I've spent thousands of dollars with and recommended to everyone I know giving gifts and merchandise. Your customer experience and support is so bad I may never return. Please act like you care or I'll take my business elsewhere.

While no one from the location had replied their customer service in Canada has made the effort to make things right and I appreciate that!"
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2018-08-27,5.0,"I love this place! The staff is always polite, helpful, nice and patient. The store is always clean and it is always smells great. They only have about 6 bar stools and a table to enjoy your tea. This store is kinda small but, they have alot of options to look at in this tight space. 

I am one of those customers who want to sniff and look at a handful of teas! I tend to refill my staple teas and purchase one or two new ones. I love to see a SALE sign on anything and I tend to get a little crazy when it comes to purchasing something on sale. Beware if you see a seasonal tea item now and you love it buy a large quantity because it may be gone tomorrow. This has happened to me in the past and it is makes me sad to see my favorite teas retire.

They also have samples of the new teas available in the store or outside (depending on the weather). If it is available to try it for free go ahead and do it - you just might like it!

I will definitely come back to this location if I am in the area."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2019-07-30,1.0,"Today is my first time visiting this location but i have been to few other locations before this, mainly Bleecker and 3rd Ave. I always have good experience in other locations, many times i didn't plan to buy much but always ended up buying more because of the friendly and helpful staffs.  However, I am very disappointing today in this location.  

First of all, it's very hot in New York today, the store A/C seems to be broken and there were few big commercial fans blowing loudly, it is hot and stuffy in there.  I am not complaining this, I understand things do break and today I just wanted to get some tea leaves that I have some ideas in mind.  However, not sure it's the weather making the staff there so cranky, the first younger lady was fine but maybe she doesn't know as much so another lady took over to help me, but she sounded so impatience since beginning, I wanted some green tea leave and asking what different type she has, but her attitude doesn't make me feel i am welcome to look at the selections before i decide, or she thinks I am just looking and didn't plan to buy so don't waste her time? when i was only seeing two of them only, not 20!  She kept point to the shelf saying those are all the green tea and there are 50 of them, what do you want!  I am not blind, you can easily tell those tins with green labels area the most around 20+ to 30 and some of them are powder or flavored.  I specifically asking for Japanese green tea loose leaves.  Even if the fans making too much noise and you couldn't hear me, don't need to be so rude.  I was the only customer in the store, are you so busy to rush me out?  I still spent $60 to get what i need, but now I think about it I should have just left and go to other store instead.  And ya her attitude got a bit better when i was making the payment."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2020-01-15,5.0,I love David's Tea on W.22nd Street.  Alyssa is great.  She has a great and warming personality and she is so great with the customers.  The staff is very knowledgeable about all the teas and I really enjoy coming to David's Tea daily for their great tasting teas. Alyssa you are the best.
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2017-12-13,5.0,"Do yourself a favor and head into Davids Tea. Just try not to get too overwhelmed by the plethora of options when it comes to filling up your glass.

Do, however, let the staff know what you're in the mood for and they can make recommendations based on your flavor preference. Fruity, hearty, warm, refreshing, this place has it all. 

If you're ordering tea to go, you can opt to get your tea hot or cold. Davids Tea also has a rewards program which is pretty clutch and you get a free tea just for signing up. 

As far as tea-related items go, you can find steepers, bags of tea and pretty much anything here that you'd need to make a strong batch. 

The employees working here are amazing and friendly and make coming in here a truly worthwhile and enjoyable experience. At this Davids Tea, you feel like you're talking with friends rather than random people working behind a tea bar."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2018-04-25,5.0,"Good local with a couple bus subway lines around making it very convenient. A nice sized DAVIDsTEA but a bit on the small scale.

633,davidstea-new-york-6,2019-09-13,1.0,"Terrible customer service! Terrible management! Garbage company! Only look fancy from outside. I should record every word that come out your store manager's mouth, people would be shocked by all these terrible things she said. You tell customer to get out the store!! How about your company get out my country! Go back to Canada! Respect is earned. You don't respect your customers. This is what you get!!!!!!!!!!!!! Same thing would never happen in a Starbucks. Go learn some lessons before you come or just stay in your country! We don't need you!!!!!!!!!"
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2016-03-25,5.0,"The workers there are really friendly and nice! 

So I came by here on a Tuesday afternoon just to try out their teas! Honestly, Their products made everything look pretty. 

I got the Strawberry rhubarb tea and my friend got the Passion fruit green tea. I honestly liked their Strawberry rhubarb tea because I love Strawberries myself! I got the Cold version because it was 60 degrees that day. The worker (he) asked if I wanted sparkling water with it and I said yes. It was a good combo with the tea. I honestly recommend it if you are a tea fanatic person and like strawberries. 

I would come here again since the prices are reasonable. Also, remember to get a card to get points whenever you go!"
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2016-12-07,3.0,"I'm glad my first (and many subsequent) experiences at Davidstea were at the Bleecker location; this Davidstea pales in comparison in customer service, seating and options. 

I dropped by for a pot of tea on a wintry day with the boyfriend, but to my dismay, I found out that this Davidstea only serves to-go cups of tea. I went with it and ordered my go-to, Forever Nuts. While I sat on the stools with Raymond trying to figure out where to go next (since this was no longer an option for chilling), my gaze wandered over to the board, which said that Forever Nuts was one of the teas of the day (aka $3 instead of $4). I got charged $4. It's only a dollar so it wasn't worth getting up to argue about it - especially because I said I didn't need the receipt - but it did make me smh. 

Although the people there were courteous and asked if I needed anything, they were nowhere near as enthusiastic and friendly as the people at Bleecker, who won me over with their passion for Davidstea. I'll definitely just stick to that location in the future."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2017-01-04,4.0,"Quality: 3.0/5.0
Service: 4.5/5.0
Value: 2.0/5.0
Decor: 3.0/5.0
Overall: 3.5/5.0 

DAVIDsTEA offers largely proprietary blends of tea with very non-tea ingredients which lowers per-oz cost but drives significant product uniqueness.  If you're a 'hardcore' tea snob (ie. source your loose leaves during your overseas trips and don't mess with Western value-added craziness), then this is not remotely for you.  But if you're that and try the dark side, or are a St*rb**** lover trying to ween off the beans w/something more leafy to drink, absolutely do it.  

The service experience at this chain is pretty unique thanks to the Canadian legacy of the business - a tea guide walks you through a bunch of different teas, and makes adjustments by pulling more options off the wall based on what you like/don't, etc.  But the actual quality of service you get will seriously depend on some combination of the guide, your attitude, how much basic tea hand-holding you need, and honestly how likely they think you'll buy (the company needs higher US AUVs).

If you like the idea of getting to try lots of fun fruity tea blends which the company is constantly rotating, and if your idea of value is a BLB rather than the cote de boeuf at M.T., then 100% this is for you.  Just don't go to Te*v***, those guys are evil!  (jk...but seriously, DAVIDsTEA is way better)"
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2018-05-05,5.0,"My absolute favorite David's Tea, I like when I have to meet a friend its very open and inviting if you want to by some tea to take home you can or buy one they can make right there for you!

Staff is very helpful and attentive. The window with seating is quite a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2018-12-13,5.0,This was my first visit. This tea shop has an amazing selection of teas with a staff that's so cordial.
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2016-12-01,4.0,"Staff was very helpful and they have so many tea options, it is amazing.

I gave up caffeine (Yes I am crazy, I know) and I read that Roobois is a good replacement.  

So far I have tried two Roobois: Carrot cupcake and super ginger.  The ginger is a bit spicy but so far I really like the carrot cupcake.  Can't wait to try out more flavors."

633,davidstea-new-york-6,2014-12-25,5.0,"Having been declined from nearby THINK Coffee as Jasmine Green Tea was out of stock, I hoped that Davids Tea can heed the hope within my mind.  Davids Tea understands and know what is Jasmine Green Tea.  It is specific to Chinese culture, which most Americans are too oblivious to know, origins from a jasmine flower tea (茉 莉 花 茶).  Jasminum sambac flowers are used to make jasmine tea, which often has a base of green tea.  Davids Tea offers two kinds of Jasmine Green Tea: Dragon or Butterfly. I opt for Butterfly $3.68 was worth the subtle aroma to calm the mind, body and spirit in stillness to achieve an inner calm.

Hands down for good quality customer service for their knowledge, attentiveness, and the warm inviting feel to newbies like myself.  They are ready, willing and able to answer questions of various teas, herbs, and its origins.  Loose teas are available for sale.  I prefer traditional Green Tea (non-flavored).  Davids Tea has a loyalty card program which automatically puts customers on their email list.  Turquoise blue surrounds this tea shop of a modern contemporary atmosphere.  Yes, a menu listing all their teas for sale is available.

Drink tea.  Live healthy."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2016-01-09,4.0,"Wow, the variety of teas here is a bit overwhelming. I walked in hoping to just pick up my favorite jasmine pear green tea but left with three different OTHER types of teas. The workers are super friendly and helpful, and you can pretty much smell everything. You can also order a cup of tea from any of the choices available. 

My favorites so far is the buddha blend, and the jasmine black pearl. If you're an avid tea drinker and lover, definitely stop by! They also have a great selection of tea pots and travel mugs, great for gifts!"

633,davidstea-new-york-6,2018-07-27,2.0,Walked in and noticed pending rating on door. The employees were complaining about customers who get aggressive outside over tea samples. Buzzards and flies were all over the place. Inside was dirty and unsanitary. My drink was an iced tea that was warmish. The Westport location and the upper west locations were and are banging. This one is a stay away.
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2013-07-07,4.0,"DavidsTea is like the rival of Teavana but w/ FRIENDLIER STAFF

the workers at this location were so nice & willing to help me find the tea that best suited me!
--$3 iced tea (although most people buy loose leaf tea to brew at home): for sweeteners they have honey, agave, splenda, & regular sugar.. unfortunately these don't live up to the amazing rock sugar at teavana !.. but if sweetened tea isn't your thing, than maybe DavidsTea is!"
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2013-06-12,5.0,"This is such an awesome store! My friend and I stopped by after dinner nearby and were immediately greeted by the guy at the counter, who asked if we wanted to try any samples. My friend declined since he already knew what he wanted, but I happily followed the guy to try three samples (served in tiny glasses, how fancy). The first was the bai hao yin zhen, a white tea that I found a bit too bland for my liking. The second was the coco-lemon Thai, another white tea that had hints of coconut, lemongrass, and ginger, and tasted like Thai curry. Definitely unique, but I wasn't a huge fan because the curry taste wasn't something I'd want in my tea. The third was the mint julep, a black tea in the summer collection that was refreshingly minty with a bit of citrus. I would've gotten a cup of this one had it not been for the fact that it was already close to 9pm and I didn't want any caffeine.

After much deliberation, perusing the menu, and smelling of the summer collection tea leaves that were on display, I decided to get a hot cup of the tropicalia, another tea in the summer collection. Like the description said, it tasted exactly like a pina colada!

You can buy a cup, hot or cold, for $3, and add sweeteners or milk if you want. They also sell a bunch of fun tea accessories in the store, like tea travel mugs and tea steepers. If you get an iced tea, you can watch them use the tea steeper which is pretty cool - they hold the steeper over the cup and press down so the tea comes out the bottom! My friend was so enamored with the steeper that he decided to buy his own. You can also buy tea samplers to give as gifts, which come with an assortment of mini tins.

Great place to check out, either for a cup of tea or gifts for tea-loving people! I will definitely be back to try their other flavors."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2015-12-05,5.0,"Love David teas!! They have amazing tea flavors plus a really great and friendly staff! 

The store can get a little cramped but it's worth squeezing yourself in to buy a nice cup of delicious tea or some loose leaf tea to bring home. Personal favorite- red velvet... Mmmmmm"
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2015-07-04,4.0,"What a fun place! David's tea combines a friendly/sassy staff with great quality tea in attractive packaging. 

The teas are on the higher of the price spectrum, but worth the extra cost. I will say that the iced tea I ordered in-house wasn't the best, but I've enjoyed the tea leaves I brought back to LA. 

Anyway, I hope this place never changes its character. The staff is super attentive and informative. 

Stay Cheerful ;)"

I don't know what they put in the 911 (even with the ingredients on the can) all I know is, it's the prefect Tea to have in your home during the winter. The best cold remedy available.

633,davidstea-new-york-6,2016-09-11,5.0,"I love David's Tea, and this location is a great example of how amazing this company is. The staff is always friendly and helpful-- I swear David's has the best customer service of any company that I've ever interacted with. And in each of their stores, including this one, you can buy a cup of tea to go, or buy loose-leaf tea and accessories to take home. And the best part? It's not that expensive! Forget Teavana or other pretentious tea shops that overcharge you. David's gives you great quality loose-leaf tea at reasonable prices. 

I should add that I'm a total tea snob, and this is my favorite tea company, so that is really saying something. Now I pretty much only buy my tea from David's, and I drink about 2-3 cups of tea per day. They have every variety you could want-- black, green, oolong, herbal, mate, white, rooibos. Straight teas, flavored teas, everything. They always have samples available, and they'll let you smell each tea before you buy it, so you get a sense of what it will taste like. Not only is David's great for tea lovers, I've also found that it's the perfect way to introduce loose-leaf tea to people who don't drink tea regularly. Once I got hooked on David's, I introduced it to my boyfriend, best friend, roommate, and mom. Now everyone loves it. They also have fun sets and packages that make great gifts. You really can't go wrong here."

Keep it up!!"

It's a new hobby; will definitely be back to this location!"
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2016-11-02,1.0,"Went into this location to get an infuser and some tea. Picked out the items I wanted and then waited while both attendants helped group of other customers around me (no worries, they were in the shop before me). 

Once both sets of customers left (only 1 person made a purchase)..not one person asked if I needed assistance. I already had what I wanted so I waited by the counter hoping to check out...the young lady behind the counter was having a conversation with a man about tea, never once looked in my direction. The young man behind the counter turned his back and never turned around again. I put my item back on the shelf and left. 

My advice to them would be...pay attention to everyone who walks into your shop. Doing otherwise will cost you sales."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2014-05-19,5.0,"They have a fantastic product.

More importantly the staff is knowledgeable, and have pride in the product they offer. David's is a wonderful business, I hope they open more locations.

633,davidstea-new-york-6,2017-08-22,3.0,"Very cool branding, tons of tea related items everywhere. More of a tea retail shop than a beverage spot. Very friendly staff.

The tea flavors are where I have a challenge with DavidsTea. Very adventurous but not very good."
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2013-08-18,4.0,"At first I thought this place was a start up, Like Gregory's Coffee where I saw Gregory himself checking things out behind the counter. 
DavidsTea is a corporate whore Canadian chain that are starting to branch out in the USA.

Didn't we invade Canada back in the day? LIke the British Invasion, Tim Hortons, TD Bank, now Davids Tea have hit my New York City. The more I think about it, Our beloved Chevrolet Camaro is put together in Canada. Hosers! Hey, at least we have Pam Anderson

Knowing this information, I already have a Moosehead size chip on my should when I walk inside. I'm seeing all these tea selections, ""The Happy Collection"" and ""The Romantic Collection"" (Friggin Canadians, stop being so nice!)

A cheerful counterperson says how may I help you? Do you have any questions regarding our store? Hmm.. I see how its going down.  Pronoun trouble..

Yeah, let me have that fruity little iced tea your brewing. And make it a large ya hoser!
(Damn, thats some good tea...)

Davids Tea? You're alright in my book. How about something free? Punch Card like Argo tea or... Free size upgrade with a Yelp Check in?"
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2014-06-13,5.0,"My absolute favorite tea in the world! 
I live I'm California and still have them deliver to me! 

My favorite is their milk oolong! It tastes all creamy and milky w/o actual cream or milk! 

They are also very well priced! The quality of the tea is superior to most others but they aren't the most expensive tea. Thank you David's tea for existing"
633,davidstea-new-york-6,2017-03-22,1.0,"Sales person called me hun which wasn't a great start. I asked the price of a tin of a specific tea and after being told the price I asked for half of that. Then I asked for a bag instead of a tin because I'm not into weird ""included fees"" and he filled the bags just about the amount of a full tin. I didn't think I needed to reaffirm the pricing and didn't see he had overfilled until after paying double what I expected. I don't appreciate the many hidden fees that I'm not supposed to worry about because he included them in the price of the tea when quoting me, that doesn't mean I want to pay $3 for a tin without realizing, thanks. I'll be returning the tea and shopping elsewhere. The sales people must work on commission to be that deceiving and pushy."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2020-03-07,4.0,"This review is only on their cookie!!

Super solid. Probably not my favorite, but still really tasty. 
The nutty chocolate chip has a loooottttt of chocolate, which I'm sure a lot of people enjoy about it. That, however, was what I wasn't totally crazy about. And I'm normally a chocolate slut. 
The chocolate to dough ratio was just too off in my opinion. 
Still tasty though! So if you like really chocolatey things, you'll love this. 

The ends of the cookie look burnt but they're not, I think it's just the dough and chocolate mixed."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2020-03-18,1.0,"This review purely for the service and how this place runs the business. In this time of situation while everybody avoids going out and selfishly fill up their pantry. We just live each day and trying to help local businesses by taking out. This location as I came there, there're already 4 customers inside and they didn't stand 6 feet of each other because apparently they block the seating area even though there're no seat anymore. Plus the register and barista so total of 6 persons in one room aside the chefs or persons in the kitchen. I waited for customers who were inside to finish and come out. Here I am ordering pistachio chocolate croissant, cookies and quiche. Upon ordering I asked how many type of quiche. I decided to get the ham and cheese. It came out $22.05. So I was trying to count on my head how much is the quiche as I saw the croissant and cookie is $3.75 each. I asked the barista because the register guy who helped me went to the kitchen. She said $14 as it comes with salad. So I thought ok. Afterwards I checked their menu online, salad is optional. The guy who helped me, didn't ask if I just want the quiche or the salad too. I feel like I'm being deceived! I literally asked for a quiche not knowing any salad option or balsamic green as an optional. So in this difficult moment as I feel like I'm supporting the local business but on the other side they're trying to rob you by selling you something you don't even want! 
Also I canceled the bag but he didn't change my bill so I still get charged for a bag that I don't get. 
So sad! I hope this issue is taken care of by the owner. 
On the other note: the cookie is really good!"
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2020-03-07,1.0,"Incredibly disappointed. I came in excited to try the double chocolate cookie I had just read about, especially since there's a shop in my neighborhood. And what luck, the guy at the front said I'd be getting the last two. I guess there was a reason they weren't on display. I took them to go and when I opened the brown paper bags I discovered burnt, rock hard cookies... why would anyone pay $4 for a burnt cookie?! And why would someone sell that to you? What kind of service is that? Is an $8 sale really worth it? If this were my business or I even worked here, as a decent human being I'd say, ""I have 2 but they're kinda burnt do you still want them?""

I'm honestly just shocked that someone would actually sell burnt food. I guess it's a good thing these cookies are ""limited edition""..."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2020-02-15,4.0,"I like lists. I enjoy making them, reading and rereading them, analyzing them. If someone were to make a list of their favorite things, I would be intrigued. If that someone is Oprah, and I saw Maman's nutty chocolate chip cookies on that list... Well let's just say I would suffer from a severe case of anxiety until I got my hands on one of these stat.

I hereby declare that these cookies are worth all the fuss around them. Crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside with plenty of chocolate chunks and a variety of nuts (think whole macadamia nuts, walnuts..). The first time I came here, I snatched up the last two cookies and greatly disappointed the lady in line who was behind me. The time after that, some cruel, evil man did that to me. Karma is real, people. Both times this happened around 1 PM so don't expect to stroll in for an afternoon coffee and a heavenly cookie because you will be greeted with a disappointing sold out scene.

I have also tried the Katie sandwich (chicken, pesto, roasted pepper, arugula) - it was quite tasty, and somehow I enjoyed finishing up the leftover second half of it cold even more than when it was hot. 

The waffle-iron hash brown salad is about as far as you can stray away down the rabbit hole of calling something that comes with two large potato hash browns a salad. This thing also comes with half of a perfectly ripe avocado, smoked salmon, cucumbers, a soft-boiled egg, and greens. Truth be told, I didn't enjoy the hash browns because they had wayyy too much thyme in them, but maybe that's just me.

The prices at Maman are a bit steep at a glance. However, I will say that their portions are huge, as in large enough to split with somebody or to have leftovers. Also, the service rocks, and the decor is too adorable, as you will see right as you walk up to it and see the oversized, ornate spoon for a door handle.

Personally, I'd come back just for the cookies alone, but I've got my eye on their daily quiche specials as well. Oh, and also they are on MealPal."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2020-01-15,5.0,"I have fully bought into the Maman craze. Ambiance, adorable. Service, fast. Food, delicious. Pastries, magical. Lattes, best in the city. Name, Persian. Style, French. What more could you want in a little cafe? 

I'm somewhat of an almond milk latte connoisseur, and they make my favorite that I've had as of late. It's so silky smooth and has that just-bitter aftertaste I crave. 

Maman has an ideal combination of healthy and decadent - wonderful avocado spreads, but irresistible almond croissants, too! I got to try their bourbon bacon jam, and holy moly, it was so good! The croissants go perfectly with their lattes. Highly recommend this particular pastry!

I enjoy the rustic and cozy vibe this place brings. Service is nice and fast; drinks are up front and food is in the back. Order up there, but they'll bring your food to your table. 

FYI, they don't have WiFi as a part of their ""be social"" theme. Thus, it's a great place to meet a friend or date. It is consistently full, so don't come in hopes of reading a book or doing work."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2020-01-15,5.0,"Came here for lunch and it was pretty busy. Can understand why though - I ordered this wafffle-iron hashbrown that had salmon, avocados, salad and hashbrown and it was delicious! At times I felt like it lacked a bit of flavor without dressing, but overall everything went well together. 

I especially loved how I was very full by the end of the meal but didn't want to pass out into a food coma."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-11-13,4.0,"Cute spot, clearly people who work in the area or are going out for a quick bite will come here during the week. It can be a lunch spot with your grandma or a cafe to catch up over a coffee or pastry with a friend or just a take out spot to bring your meal back to the office. A little small so I wouldn't do more than a party of 3 people, most of the time I've seen people alone like at coffee shops or just one other person. Staff here seem a bit young like it may be their first job, could be a little more alert with service but for the most part they seem friendly.

The front area is just for pastries and coffee but the back is where you can get all the food. I've ordered a soup, salad, grilled cheese sandwich, and their chocolate chip cookie so far. The salad was pretty decent size and lots of flavor in it. A little overdressed for my liking so next time I'll get it on the side. But their salads all have unique ingredients and names. You'll be full from the portion and the amount of flavors in these! The tomato soup and grilled cheese were just ok, they could've used a little bit more to them but for a small lunch and quick easy thing, it will do.

The chocolate chip cookie kind of surprised me because it was pretty good size and seemed very fresh. I'd almost say it was trying to be like the levain bakery cookie because it reminded me of it. I'd say it doesn't measure up to the famous cookie but still has a decent recipe. It just lacks a little bit in flavor compared to the real one but I think they could get it if they tweaked it a bit more.

Their salads will keep me coming back."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-11-24,4.0,"I'm going to start with the bad...I got the eggs ratatouille and there was goat cheese on it. I really despise goat cheese. It was not listed in the ingredients. Only feta was listed. There was feta as well but definitely a ton of goat cheese. It ruined the whole plate for me. 
Pretending like that wasn't there... the ratatouille had stewed eggplant, zucchini & tomatoes baked with two eggs & topped with
herbed feta, served with toast. Pretty good. Not mindblowing but healthier option. Not sure I'd get again.

5 stars for the croque maman (parisian ham, comté cheese
& béchamel on country bread, served
with balsamic mixed greens). It's everything you'd want. Not the healthiest option but very delicious.

My friend had the nectarine waffles which he said were pretty good although I didn't try them (buttermilk waffles topped with
fresh nectarines, cinnamon whipped ricotta & pretzel
pecan crumble, served with maple syrup).

The hashbrown waffles are good but I could pass on those...

Overall, a cute place with tasty options! I can't say it was the best brunch ever for myself but my friends all said it was a 5-star meal."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2020-05-24,4.0,"I love taking visitors to Maman for brunch. However, on two different occasions, the wait was over 45 minutes."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-09-07,4.0,"Matcha latte was good (slightly bitter which I enjoyed). Portions were quite filling and we struggled to finish our dishes. I got the tawni which was just all right- a little bland but the hot sauce and side of chicken helped.  Friends seemed to enjoy their waffle iron hash.


Get the pastry basket to share (our server picked out some good ones- a chocolate doughnut, croissant, matcha loaf?). 

Cute atmosphere and a good place to go to catch up with friends. However, they don't take reservations and our party of 5 waited an hour even though they kept telling us 15-20 minutes (15-20 minutes ago)."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-10-05,5.0,"Super cute and chic place!! All decorative on both the inside and outside! We got some croissants which were super flakey and buttery which were delicious! 

Also got an Americano. Best one we've ever had. We want the secret!!! Definitely coming back every morning for this drink!!! LOVE!"
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-09-03,4.0,"Stopped by here for brunch with the family and was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. The restaurant interior was decorated florally and had a bright ambience. We ordered the breakfast sandwich, croissant sandwich, Mediterranean breakfast plate, and Jennifer salad. The breakfast sandwich was great, especially the bread and the bacon jam. The hummus on the breakfast plate might have been the best I ever had. My parents also enjoyed their salad and croissant sandwich. 

We also decided to get dessert. We got the chocolate chip cookie and almond croissant. Both were delicious! The chocolate chip cookie rivaled that of levain's. I prefer the cookie dough base here, but there was too much chocolate chips for my taste. I do like the addition of macadamia nuts though. While the food was good, I have to knock down a rating because I feel that the prices are too high for the amount of food you get."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-12-28,4.0,"My wife and I were looking for some take-away pastries, you know, put some croissants to the face.  We stumbled upon Maman.

I had a piece of chocolate frosted loaf cake.  The slice weighed about 5 pounds and was absolutely dense and delicious.  My wife got one of their chocolate chip cookies (has nuts) on recommendation of the staff.  The cookie was excellent, too.  

One thing that stood out was the take-away counter staff.  The guy was super nice and answered all of our dumb questions about the pastries.  He was great.  I defs recommend this place for a grab and go coffee/espresso + pastry."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-07-10,5.0,"Loved it! The avocado toast with egg on the side was close to perfect... two toasts, with toppings on the side. I was full for a long time! 

Lot of tables and space (for Manhattan). Didn't check if WiFi was good but did see it was available. 

The cappuccino was foamy and not too milky."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-07-31,2.0,"I really adored the decor of this place. It's the cafe of my dreams -- almost. The flora that embraces the exterior and interior, super cute!

However the one thing that ruined it for me was the lack of customer service here. If I'm paying for an expensive breakfast and an expensive cup of brew, I'd expect some nicer personalities. But hey, it's NY I'm a west coaster lol

Ordered the avo toast which was nearly $15. Avo atop crusty slices of bread and a pico layer, it was delicious but def not $15 worth delish. The drinks here were also meh.

You're paying for the experiencing of sitting in a dashing New York cafe but I've definitely had better food and drinks elsewhere at cheaper locations."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-06-16,4.0,"I got a matcha latte and their nutty chocolate chip cookie. Both were delicious and their cups are so cute. Love the design since it's not just a regular white coffee cup. This place is your go to if you want cute photos on Instagram. Next time, I want to try their dipped croissants. We went around lunch time so I think they ran out of those because I didn't see any on display. Maybe next time when I'm in town. 

Also, I'm not really sure if you can buy coffee at the front. We headed towards the back of the shop where they prepared the food to actually order. We then picked up our coffee at the front of the shop."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-12-21,4.0,They were out of some of the other dishes since we got there around 3. But the eggs ratatouille was delicious and filling!
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-10-28,4.0,"This is one of my favorite brunch spots in the area. 

The coffee is great -bold, coffee-lovers' coffee- and everything on the brunch menu is delicious.

The waffles (which seam to change seasonally and were made with butternut squash this week) are always delicious and not overly sweet. On the savory side my favorites are the waffle-iron hash browns and the ""tawni.""

The decor is pretty and polished, with everything matching right down to the blue and white china, and the staff is friendly.

The only downside here is that the seating is a bit tight. We got stuck at one of the tables way in the back recently, and they are TINY. They are also ROUND, which, yes, is aesthetically cute and French café-ish, but if you are a nerd like me you know that an X"" round table gives you approximately 21.5% less space to put your coffee and brunch on than an X"" square table. B-)"
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-05-11,5.0,"Stumbled upon this cute place in my new neighborhood and I was so impressed by the decor and the food. 
I came here for brunch on a Sunday and there was a 10 minute way which isn't bad.
We had smashed avocado tartine with smoked salmon on the side, breakfast sandwich without bacon, and the egg ratatouille. All were delicious but I have to say egg ratatouille was my favorite, it was very flavorful. Of course in my eyes you also can't go wrong with avocado toasts with lime. I almost forgot, we also shared a squash, kale quiche. Yes we over ordered as the platters were huge but we devoured it all.
The service was also great, a very friendly staff.
This is a cute fun spot for brunch with your friends or family."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-09-30,4.0,"We visited Maman in NoMad/Flatiron recently for a quick, casual lite bite midday on a Saturday. When we arrived, there was a 15 minute wait so we went across the street to check out the flea market. Highly recommend if you're looking to pass time while you wait.

It's a charming space with an air of informal, femininity with its eclectic furniture, mixed matched vintage place settings and toile espresso machine.

I ordered the mediterranean breakfast plate, with roasted leek hummus, salad, roasted cherry tomatoes, mixed olives, soft boiled egg, herbed feta and toast. It was a substantial portion and overall very good. I would've preferred a chickpea hummus, as it had too strong of a leek taste in my opinion. But the herbed feta more than made up for my disappointment in the hummus, it was absolutely divine! It was so rich and creamy, I had to force myself not to finish it. 

My partner has a food allergy and they were very accommodating making scrambled eggs for her pairing it with balsamic mixed greens. The mixed greens are very good in their own right, and for the price you should definitely accompany them with your meal.

While I enjoyed the food, I felt underwhelmed if not disappointed by the dining experience. The tables are petite, and the space really does fill up, so you are nearly sitting on top of one another - which is to be expected of strictly a cafe, but not one with table service. In addition, it does get loud and the voices do carry so it's difficult to hold a conversation. Overall I'd give it another shot -  I mean how could I not - the display case full with quiches is enough to lure me back! But I'd probably try it first thing upon opening or strictly for to-go.  

In a gist, maman is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood for somewhere with delicious food when you want to be in and out, but personally I don't think it's designed to be somewhere where you'd really care to linger."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-04-09,4.0,"Came here for breakfast on a Friday morning and ordered a latte and waffle-iron hashbrown. The waffle-iron hashbrown was like a salad, topped with hashbrown, and smoked salmon, avocado, and a soft boiled egg. Absolutely delicious. I thought it was a great balance of rich, acidic, and fresh flavors. 100% would order this again! 

The latte was a pretty sizable serving and really good for the price. There's a fair amount of seating but is still pretty busy. If you're planning to work here with a laptop, the wifi can be a little spotty."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-04-09,4.0,"This place is like a page out of a children's book, whimsical decor and excellent brunch menu items. The first time I visited Maman was for a baby shower with the most beautiful table settings and tea sets! 

If you're coming during the weekend make sure you get a reservation first, this place gets packed! I took one star off because they have an open kitchen and the entire restaurant smelled like burnt toast. 

Maman's 'rabbit hole' (3.5/5) - we got this because of its name, probably should have gone with the popular Maman's breakfast sandwich instead (that'll be my pick next time)
Croque maman (5/5) - WOW, this was so so good! The cheese was perfectly melty and bread was crunchy. I recommend sharing this dish with someone since it's very heavy"
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-12-02,4.0,"A fitting beginning to my NYC chocolate chip cookie tour. This place was amazingly cozy inside with a kind staff and a hunk of a cookie. I wasn't sure it was Maman at first from the exterior because it is very unassuming, but the cookie was delicious. It wasn't in my top three cookies, but the satisfaction it gave was still high. I'd like to try some of the food options next time I come in- the quiches looked amazing"
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-09-18,4.0,"Super cute place for brunch. Service was attentive. I got the waffle iron hashbrowns and was super excited to dive in, but was very disappointed.

The dish was beautifully plated, with salmon, avocado and greens, but lying underneath the beauty were two tasteless, overly greasy and soggy hashbrowns. 

My husband got the croissant sandwich and it was good. 

I'd come back again but will order something different."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-09-03,2.0,"This place is fine for coffee and pastries to go, but the dine-in experience was horrendous. 

Positives include the aesthetic and almond croissant. The coffee / flat white was fine, but nothing that stood out. I've never tried their seemingly famous lavender latte, so can't vouch for it. 

The issue with their brunch service is that they are clearly not set up to deal with customer volume for several reasons: 

1) Kitchen is extremely disorganized: My friend and I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich and the Rabbit Hole and waited over 40 minutes for our food to come out. In the meantime, the tables next to us, who were seated 20 & 30 minutes after us got their food 10 minutes after ordering. Their excude was that the rabbit hole takes time to bake, but my Rabbit Hole was ice cold in the middle (so they clearly forgot to prepare this). 

2) Servers are clearly not assigned tables since the waiter who got us water / took our order never revisit the table and floated another section and we had to flag multiple people during the course of our stay here. 

3) The service people are not trained to think. We had ordered an almond croissant to split and no one thought to bring it out, even after I had asked them to check on our order 30 minutes in. Also, I saw a waitress pick up an order from the kitchen, knock over half the sandwich onto the counter, look at it, and picked it up and reassembled it with her bare hands. NOT okay especially in an open kitchen with customers watching, not to mention that is NOT sanitary.

Don't bother going out of your way to brunch here. There are plenty of French-inspired cafés in the city that are leaps and bounds better than Maman."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2020-02-16,4.0,"I came to the Nomad location as soon as they opened on a Saturday morning. Their pastries were fresh and delicious, we chose one with a pistachio cream inside. Their cappuccino was great too. We stayed as the staff set up what appeared a brunch with table cloths and silver ware. I can't speak for the full menu. The place inside is cute with Nordic wall paper."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-04-24,4.0,"This review is for Saturday brunch, but they also have takeout for coffee and pastries and such in front.

First off, this is the first place I've ever seen fresh squeezed grapefruit juice on its menu. I had to get it! Love grapefruit juice, love fresh squeezed juice, so this was doubly satisfying.

Second, their Rabbit Hole brunch item is so popular, they ran out by 1pm on a Saturday.

As for what we did order:
Maman's breakfast sandwich - B+ (definitely expect it to be on the sweeter side)
Waffle iron hashbrowns - A (hearty, nicely seasoned)"
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-02-14,3.0,"Ok so I stopped by this place to grab a cup of coffee, so disclaimer, this is just based mostly on a quick stop for a Chai Latte. 

So I was in NY for business and on the way to my office I decided to stop by and grab a cup of coffee. Normally I am a latte guy but decided to go with a Chai Latte. Unfortunately it did not taste good at all, the spice was overwhelming to the point I could almost not even taste the coffee in it. 

The staff were really nice and to be fair I would definitely come back again. They had plenty of seating and really nice decor inside as well."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-10-07,4.0,"Love Maman! It's the cutest little cafe with a great ambiance and good food. I usually get one of the quiches when I come in here. Their massive cookies are also wonderful. I've also come in for breakfast and had their breakfast sandwich and it is very good. 

I also love Maman as a spot to grab a chai (I don't drink coffee) and sit and catch up with a friend. It's my usual ""grabbing coffee"" suggestion in flatiron. 

PS - the walls here make for a cute Instagram backdrop!"
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-08-30,5.0,"What a cute place! I felt like I was transported to Paris! Down to earth and floral interior (without being stereotypical floral feel). The ""cafe"" order area is near the entrance and the food order is in the rear. You order and they bring the food to your table. I loved the food we ordered; I got Waffle Iron Hash Brown salad. It was packed with fresh greens, plenty of avocado, good amount of smoked salmon, nicely soft boiled egg, and tasty hash brown. It was so filling, but because it is filled with some good protein and carbs I did not get hungry for a while. My daughter ordered the Mediterranean Breakfast Plate and she said it was really delicious. It came with leek hummus which I regret not tasting it. I would definitely come back here. Although we came to the Flatiron store I would like to try their other locations."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-08-06,5.0,"I'm a big fan of Maman's.  It's open, airy, peaceful, and green. I've visited a few times and I always really enjoy working here. The Tawni salad is my favorite. and I hear that many love their cold brew. 

Also they have great customer service. Today, Mariah, the barista who greeted me when I came in, was on her own for the first hour. Still she did such a great job managing both the cafe and kitchen counters alone. Warm welcomes and lots of smiles."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2020-02-14,5.0,"Finding good brunch in the Big Apple for a vegetarian is surprisingly difficult. After looking through a number of options, we decided to go here for lunch and we weren't disappointed. 

Their menu is seasonal so they didn't have all of the options that we saw in the past yelp reviews. We ordered the Mediterranean breakfast plate and the Claudia sandwich. Both of them were amazing. Highly recommend."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-08-20,5.0,"Such a pretty place, I loved the flower decor on the door! This place has amazing chocolate chip cookie , warm and gooey and I love their coffees, lavender or vanilla latte. This spot has more space than the other Maman cafes, definitely try this if you love cookies, coffee and artsy cafe vibes!"
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-06-10,5.0,"My newest favorite brunch spot in NOMAD! Came here with my brother, his gf, and another friend for brunch on a sunday morning at 930am. Boy was the restaurant packed! We ordered a whole bunch of things to share, but I mainly took care of the waffle-iron hashbrowns ($16) that I ordered. 

AMBIANCE:
Trendy cafe/brunch spot! Go check out their IG page, they're store front is absolutely gorgeous! The interior gives it a rustic charm to it. Great date spot or a casual spot for friends and family to hang out. 

PROS:
The food is as organic as it can be! I'll be mainly reviewing the waffle-iron hasbrowns since that's what I ordered. That was an incredible food experience! In one big, filling bowl, you're served a whole poached egg, slices of cucumber, a big bed of salad, lots and lots of avocados, , a healthy layer of smoked salmon, and below the salmon you have a disc of hash browns. I must say this has got to be one of the healthiest brunch bowls I've ever had around NYC, and I find it hard pressed to find a brunch bowl that serves so much! I love the dressing that the salad came in, it was a little acidic and a had a citrusy sweet to it, its really hard to pinpoint what it taste like since it was so unique! There were lots of smoked salmon on the bowl, and pairing it with the avocados was very delicious. The poached egg really adds more flavor to the dish, and by the end of finishing the bowl I really wanted to order another one to take it for home. For $16, that's such a steal, and after eating that bowl I feel energized as opposed to getting a food coma from a lot of heavy brunches that I've had around the area. 

My brother, his gf, and friends ordered separately and they really enjoyed their dishes. Too bad I didn't get to sample their dishes. 

OVERALL:
Definite yes for me! Come here for their waffle-iron hasbrown bowl. You will not be disappointed!"

Most of the other guests looked like they were ordering real entrees, and the food looked fresh and tasty. Our cookie was pretty good- nice big hunks of chocolate, not overly sweet, and the macadamia nuts in the cookie really set it apart. Solid cookie, and I'd come back to this cafe to try out some of the other dishes!"

Words can barely describe the off the hook energy that abounds throughout.  Wish this were here when I lived in Chelsea back when it was just turning hip."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-06-28,4.0,"I came here today for lunch but was disappointed because of the unbearable heat. It was one of the hottest days of 2019 in the city and they had the doors open. There were 2 tables next to us saying how hot it was and we were as well. I cannot stress how important it is for a place to be comfortable if you are paying to enjoy the atmosphere.

I do think the food is good but it's pricey for the servings. In addition, their coffee is pricey for small drinks. I had the smashed avocado toast and a chai latte and that together was over $23. Like I said pricey, but it is tasty. 

They conveniently gave me a 20% off coupon for my next visit -- smart on their end because I probably will come back but not during the summer."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-07-25,4.0,"Lavender latte is more natural, while honey lavender latte is based on syrup.

Come after 4-5pm on weekends if you would like to use laptop. Otherwise, this is a pretty good place for one to work on a weekday afternoon (read: after lunch time), if you don't mind the 3pm coffee crowd that can briefly make this place kinda loud (but most people don't sit)."
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-07-25,5.0,After trying a lot of different cookies in NYC this was one of the best. The inside of the cookie was essentially a pool of chocolate which looked like it was made with chocolate disks rather than chocolate chips. It had such a good flavor. Great oat milk latte too. The interior was super cute.
634,maman-nomad-new-york,2019-01-02,4.0,"Really cute coffee shop with food in Nomad neighborhood. Actually feels more like you're at a cool cafe in a small city than in NYC - they're much too friendly and homey to be hardened Apple denizens!

Beautiful coffee art made with love. Very tasty latte with a lovely flower.

Food quite good.  Greek yogurt parfait was delicious with full fat yogurt, great berries, and good granola.  Smashed avocado toast was good; I added a fried egg. I wish the toast had been hot when I got it; lukewarm is not how I prefer avocado toast, but it was still good. Avocado tartine is actually made with egg salad, avocado and watermelon radishes. It looked pretty, but I don't like egg salad in the am.

You order at the counter and then sit down.  Definitely homey, no attitude, and they're super friendly. Much more fun than going to an overpriced, pretentious brunch place in the neighborhood to have ordinary omelettes at a more expensive price. But it was not my fave avocado toast of all time."
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2020-02-05,5.0,"Another good coffee place in Flatiron!  Love trying new spots so I was glad I stumbled across this place on my way back from lunch - the shop logo is quite attractive and colors pop out at you.  At 2:30pm, line was long, probably took me 10 mins or so to order.  Cashier was friendly and quick and told me the differences between the 2 drip coffees.
Coffee, location,service = A+

Will return!"
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2020-03-09,4.0,"Really solid cafe in Flatiron ... 5 reasons why:
1. They have caffeine. Quality caffeine at that. The cold brew really hit the spot.
2. Open space where you can crank out some work or talk to your friend without feeling crowded.
3. Service is friendly and prompt. 
4. Location is close to the train and bus stops. Pretty much dead center of Flatiron.
5. Did I tell you about the coffee yet? ... yeah. it's solid."
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2019-11-29,4.0,"Try: Iced Maple Shay 

Why: Smooth and sweet maple latte. 

Notes: I also got an Almond Croissant but it was a bit hard instead of flaky and buttery. I ended up dipping the arms of the croissant into my iced maple latte to lessen the hard crunch. The body of croissant where the almond is was tasty. It's a spacious coffee shop in the Flatiron District that takes you back in time in a vintage diner with black and white floor tiles with a jukebox! Friendly staff. Clean shop. Good amount of seating area. Looking forward to coming back to try other coffee and pastries."

Coffee is standard NYC coffee prices. Got a medium sized Iced latte for about $5. Iced latte was great and the coffee wasn't too chalky. 

Would come back again!"

I came across this last Thursday after work and decided to chill here before a dinner plan with a friend. This is a nice place to hang out in and do some work. The barista is very nice. I ordered a decaf mocha latte and I am a sucker for latte art  and I love that I can have a latte without worrying about sleep. The barista was pleasant and I look forward to trying more of their drinks. I also like the ambiance.
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2019-02-13,4.0,"Right off the 23rd st path, this is a perfect place to stop over for a coffee/tea before work. It is a spacious layout with some seating in the back. Not sure how they can afford the rent here only selling coffee but starbucks does it so you never know. I really enjoyed the service. The people here are very nice.  I ordered a tea like a rebel and enjoyed it.  

Cool spot for a coffee or tea. I would definitely recommend and I will leave the coffee reviews for the real coffee people but I had a pleasant experience between the service and the tea."

I ended up getting the the maple shay which is essentially a maple latte. The cashier ended up telling me about the history of the drink and how it was special to the owner.
The coffee was awesome and so was the service !"
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2020-01-28,4.0,This place is right infront of my work and my go to place for coffee. I mostly order cappuccino for me which is tastes great. Only thing is I wish the coffee is little hotter. Rest the place is great plus no wait time. Cheers!
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2019-06-15,4.0,"Cute coffee shop with lots of seating (which is sometimes surprisingly hard to find in NYC)! Came here for a coffee chat catch up and it was perfect in terms of space and noise level - I feel like it's also rare to find a place that's not blasting music nowadays! The cashier / barista at the counter was very friendly and efficient - can't speak to the coffee, but I enjoyed the iced passion green tea I had - perfect to cool down on a warm day. My only gripe is that some of the furniture seemed a bit old, and there was some empty space in the cafe that could be more efficiently used for more tables/chairs. Nevertheless, solid spot on 23rd!"

Every time I've walked by it seemed to be closed, but then again I was going at random hours and usually at night. So when I was walking by this weekend and saw they were open I knew I had to jump at the chance and I am SO happy that I did. My favorite thing about Brooklyn Roasting Company is that when you get a large cold brew for $5 it's actually a large. A lot of coffee shops will sell you a medium and charge you $5 saying it's their large. And while, yes, it's the largest cup they might have, it's never actually a large cup. Also, their cold brew is so smooth. Seriously delicious! We also picked up an Iced Oat Milk Latte  and that was amazing as well. Definitely planning on coming back when I can. I saw that they do a sampler pack which looks like it'll be a perfect Christmas gift 6 months from now."
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2018-07-27,4.0,"First off, the coffee is very good here, with always a clear clean light roast and a lovely richer dark roast, with flavors that are more elegant than popcorny.

However the second fantastic thing about this Location is the fantastically large and unusual for Manhattan, roomy space, with high ceilings, that gets fairly full but never feels overcrowded, and the careful simple decor choices, like small vinyl booths or a large working roulette wheel on a communal table,  that give it a mod 80s retro 50s feel.

The long wide black and white checker board floor invites you into an Alice and wonderland of film noir possibilities with an array of micro world seated vignettes of turquoise couches and mid century mod coffee tables, petit girls in smart dresses and bobs politely laughing, smart boys working together on laptops exchanging bright banter. 

Down that unaverage Joe and go up, Daddio."

They don't have matcha though and during their pick hours it gets overwhelmingly busy and ppl are fighting to get a table next to an outlet. The busiest time is from 12 to 3.

635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2019-11-10,3.0,"I want to like you because there's nothing else near as decent as you but I don't. The people taking my orders are always bored and unamused and I always feel like I'm interrupting their conversations when I try to place an order. When my order is complete, the baristas just places it on the counter without calling a name or what drink they made so I'm just left standing there with a few other customers staring at my latte for 5 minutes until they ask ""DID ANYBODY ORDER A LATTE."" Yes, but I would've liked it 5 minutes ago.

But huge plus for NO LONGER SUPPLYING PLASTIC STRAWS, always a clean environment and huge amount of work space + natural lighting."
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2018-05-20,2.0,"GOOD COFFEE, NEEDS MORE TABLES, GOOD SERVICE

The coffee at this place is really good, as well as the attendant who took our order, she was very nice, attentive and smiley. Another barista in the back with purple hair and big nose and ear earrings didn't seem too happy to see customers, she may have been having a bad day.

If you want to plugin for work, you'll need luck. The place is simple but it does the job. The thing missing is more power outlets. If you're lucky to get a table by a power outlet, you'll quick find out that some of them don't work, so you'll be limited to whatever battery you have left on your devices.

I ordered a mocha and it was surprisingly good, one can taste the properly roasted beans in there and good quality soy milk.

We sat at the bar by the window, where working becomes a challenge, not because of the power outlets or the space at the bar... But just watching everyone walk by in New York makes this an experience that makes you want to enjoy your coffee and relax for a while.

They have coffee beans to go, if you want to bring this to your office and be the hero of the day."
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2019-03-28,4.0,"Brooklyn Roasting CO's coffee beans are typically fruity to me. I was so surprised how well the Maple Syrup could reduce the acidity of the coffee. I LOVED IT! It's not overly sweet, but of course if you need to adjust the sweetness, you could always ask the barista. Also, I'm surprised they have so many vegan pastries!"
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2017-09-25,4.0,"I'm a coffee lover and on top of that I enjoy sitting in coffee shops with ample seating, good coffee, and of course WiFi. I typically don't  come out to Manhattan coffee shops to sit and blog in because there's a Caffe Bene not too far from my home where I've gone to pretty much every day during this past summer.  I found myself waltzing into Brooklyn Roasting Company to check it out and plus it was recommended by another coffee loving friend.

The entrance of the coffee shop is filled with tables and a generous amount of seating along with outlets lined up against a wall for your electronic charging needs. Brooklyn Roasting Company does sell some of their merchandise to the right of the coffee shop in a vintage-like shelf. The line can get long especially on a hot, summery day when everyone is thirsting for a cold brew, nitro cold brew, or even a cup of iced tea, I speak from experience.  The back of the coffee shop is quite spacious! One side has tables, booth seating and chairs. The wall has a few outlets lined up as well. The center and other side of the coffee shop has an interesting casino/roulette table (not to be touched), interesting vintage décor with a jukebox too.  

I got their cold brew which was actually pretty good and smooth! I liked it slightly more than Stumptown's cold brew.  Staff is very friendly and upbeat. I enjoy the music that's played at Brooklyn Roasting Company - from the 80's. Restrooms are relatively clean and spacious. There are codes required to access the restroom. 

Overall, a pretty good coffee shop to check out and a good place to stay in and chill out especially during a hot summery day like some of the one we've had this past summer. It can get loud in here at times, so I would definitely recommend coming here if you can withstand the noise. 

Looking forward to my next visit here!"
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2018-12-14,5.0,"Super good coffee! I got the latte with almond milk and was very happy with the quality.

My maple shay was a little too sweet for what I'd like, but hey I did get something with maple. The tres leches had a tasty creme filling inside, but lacked the moisture I'd been hoping for.

The decor inside is really cool,  like a casino table. Service was very lacking though. The cashier did not share my enthusiasm for the donut, and seemed annoyed when I tacked it onto our order."
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2018-01-07,3.0,"I used to go to this place on DUMBO. This looks like a much larger spot and lots more space to sit. Looks like it used to be a bar and they converted it. Seems to work!
The first time I came in here, I had a flat white. That was just fantastic. I cam in again and ordered a Latte the next time, and it was just lackluster. I barely tasted the coffee itself. I'm not sure why, but it just wasn't the same for me, as it used to be. I will stick with the flat whites! If only I could get the same flavor of the coffee in the flat white, with the latte, then that would be awesome."

The place is bustling and I'm happy to say the service remains friendly and personal, due largely to the charismatic and passionate Sabrina, who took my order and conducted business behind the bar with symphonic rhythm and subtle poise, keeping the line moving while taking her time with me. After some expert guidance from her, I ordered their Cortado, and it was a delight, I'd take it over a hot cocoa any cold winter day. 

Tipping this staff is a pleasure and serves to perpetuate the warmpth of the whole experience at BRC."

635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2018-04-04,5.0,"Good coffee, lots of space, and WiFi. Those are all the things I look for in a good coffee shop in the city, and I'm so glad there's a location in Flatiron. It's spacious with plenty of spaces despite heavy tourist traffic, and there are two very clean bathrooms! The girl who took my order put me in a slightly sour mood--she clearly did not want to work and barely acknowledged my (and other customers') presence when I wanted to place my order... but the other guy at the machines was sweet and polite when I asked for the restroom code. 

As for the coffee, it was robust yet smooth--I drank it like water (oops). I usually steer towards the Mocha Java for an afternoon pick-me-up. Despite the odd service today, this is definitely a great place to meet up with friends or get some work done in the area."
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2017-05-29,5.0,"By far, this location is the most spacious of any non-national franchise coffee shop I've been to in the midtown/flatiron area. I only tried the ""nitro cold brew"", which is on tap, and it was quite good. It's mild and not as strong as other places, but there is still a great flavor. 

Although I usually feel that I should wait to rate coffee shops after trying a few more cups, this place deserves five stars. It's a VERY spacious place and beautifully put together. There are plenty of places to sit (even with a few friends). I'll definitely be back!"
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2018-09-05,3.0,"I loathe sour coffee, other than that I have not much to say about this place.

On the afternoon that I was there, I saw at least two job interviews going on, and plenty of NYU students. I am surprised NYU comes up this far from 8th Street area. It's a lot of space, and it does get very noisy. Music is loud to make up for the yelling. 

It's a nice alternative to Starbucks, which has plenty of presence in the Flatiron neighborhood. On the other hand, I support Birch coffee, but they don't have so much of seating space. 

In case I'm arguing too hard for a city-goer's coffee shop, I did see a British man and his son having a tea. 

Coffee at BRC always seems brutally strong for me, peel the paint off of the roof of your mouth. And in case you're wondering if that's a bad thing, they don't call it the city that never sleeps for nothing. 

I doubt this is the place to bring a date ever."

The coffee tastes great, and the baristas are skilled, efficient, and the warmest. The space is huge so feel free to find the wifi password and buckle down with a coffee & pastry. I especially like the wide, semi-circle milk & sugar station with almond & soy milks.

Of the many coffee spots in Flatiron, BRC is a welcome addition and particularly spacey.

I got a decaf mocha and it was pretty good. Very strong aftertaste for the espresso (but not in a bad way). I didn't even ask for less syrup and I thought the mocha was at a good sweetness level.

The environment is okay for working - the music is rather loud so if you want quiet this is not the place. They have free wifi!"
635,brooklyn-roasting-company-new-york,2017-05-24,4.0,"Funny, I've never seen this chain in Brooklyn. Ah well. This coffee shop has a cool vintage, old-school-diner/bar kind of vibe to it, with a jukebox and funhouse mirror to boot.

The service is slooow, but that's because they're making sure you get a quality drink. I can't stand the taste of black coffee, so the maple shay is always my drink of choice. It has a good amount of syrupy sweetness without blocking out the coffee flavor. They also sell Doughnut Plant doughnuts (plus savory pastries). I feel like coffee shops usually run out of yummy pastries after the morning rush, but there were quite a few left in the display when I went in around 1. Sure, there's a Dough pretty close to me, but this is a convenient way to get my caffeine and sugar rush all in one visit.

They also have punch cards, whoo! I make it a general rule to hoard all stamp/punch/rewards cards like no tomorrow."

I got the "" Peru High Grown Andes"" FAIR TRADE CERTIFIED coffee. It is so fragrant! The difference of buying freshly ground, GOOD coffee vs. pre-ground/cheap coffee in a random store is monumental. I made it in my french press and it tasted amazing even just black.

This is my first time trying it. It was $15 for a tin (12oz). Whether that's expensive or not is up to you to decide how much you want to spend on coffee (at Eataly next door there was coffee for more than $100 a pound!). 

Anyway I will be back with my empty tin soon. I believe it is cheaper to get tin refills."

Located in Chelsea Market, it's a great place to stop and grab a few traditional style donuts dipped in the flavors of your choice. They come in bags of 3s and you can opt for 2-4 flavors depending on how many donuts you buy.

We really enjoyed the cinnamon flavor and the powdered sugar flavor. We also tried the lavender flavor and the cereal flavored ones. The latter were good but in the end you can't beat simple favorite tastes!"

636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-10-22,5.0,"Tldr: great doughnut place with fun and tasty flavors; on the pricy side (but hey, we're in Chelsea market, what did you expect?)

This is officially my new favorite doughnut place. Move aside Krispy Kreme, make way! Ok, maybe Krispy Kreme will always have a place in my heart, but these doughnuts from the Doughnuttery are seriously good.

I got 6 doughnuts in two flavors: coco loco and flower power,

First, I love that these are fun sized. The small size makes it so you get a punch of the flavoring coating the doughnut with every bite. Also, it's perfect snacking size. Yes, yes, overall I'm eating the same amount as of doughnut as I would with a single large doughnut, but somehow this feels extra indulgent.

Second, the flavoring are so good! I love the creativity not only in the interesting flavors like flower power or spicy rooster, but also in classics like chocolate. The coco loco uses chocolate cereal so there was some interesting texture and really enhanced the cocoa powder. 

I especially liked flower power. There is a strong kick of acidity, but the floral also come in strong, though not overwhelmingly so. It was a very elegant balance and I was seriously contemplating just eating (or saving) the leftover sugar at the bottom of my bag. It would be a great buttercream flavor for rose macaron. 

Luckily, they sell the sugars/powdered flavorings by the jar. I'll definitely be getting one next time. The base doughnut seems to be the same no mater the flavor you choose. They just add the right power and shake the doughnuts around until every available surface is covered. 

I'll be coming back to try more flavors in the future. It's definitely an indulgence given how expensive they are. The more economical decision is probably just buying the flavoring and incorporating it into your own baked goods. They even have bags of doughnut batter too (makes 20 for $7.99)."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2020-01-04,5.0,"Incredibly delicious mini donuts made fresh right in front of you! The glazed were delicious, and I also tried some seasonal flavors that were incredible. A must try in the Chelsea market! It will surely satisfy your sweet tooth!"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-07-31,5.0,"The peanut butter and jelly flavor was my favorite! We also tried the regular flavor and chocolate peppermint flavor.

I think it's so cute how they throw the donuts in a bag with the sugar flavoring and shake it up, simple but cute and creative concept! The donuts were freshly made, warm, and super fluffy. They are a bit pricier than regular donuts but you definitely come here for the experience, I recommend you try this place out."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2020-01-14,3.0,"Located in Chelsea market , this sweet treat spot is great if you are looking for just a quick bite of something sweet. If you are trying to have that ultimate decadent dessert, then Doughnuttery is not it...and that's OK!!! Doughnuttery still has it going on in terms of a quick sweet fix with hot fresh fried dough ( you watch them quickly make them) and a good selection of a few toppings they essentially sprinkle on . Chelsea market is somewhat of a maze so start looking for this towards the back ."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2020-02-23,4.0,"Our hotel was super close to Chelsea market and I saw they had a donut spot so I had to give it a try. They have a long menu of flavors with various toppings. The donuts are mini and made to order. I tried the chocolate glaze , vanilla glaze , coco mint pattie and lemon pop. I was surprised that they put the donuts in bags by flavor. They were pretty pressed together, wish they came in a small donut box. I also would have posted a picture to Instagram/yelp if they were presented nicer which would be great for business. My favorite was the coco mint. Great crunch and flavor. The lemon pop was over bearing. I love lemon but it was really strong. The vanilla and chocolate glaze were good also. I would definitely give this place a try if you pass it!"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-10-24,3.0,"I think it's fun to try Doughnuttery once, but I'm not sure it's something that I would keep coming back for.  FYI the donuts, which are miniature by the way, are all the same.  The different ""flavors"" listed are only different flavors of the sugar that get coated onto the miniature donuts.  There are some creative sugar flavors, like rosemary-fig or maple-bacon, but I feel like I am essentially trying the flavored sugar.  The donuts are not the star.

1 star off: The donuts are tiny.
1 star off: I'd rather eat maple bacon than maple-bacon-flavored sugar."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-05-12,2.0,"Really underwhelming. The donuts looked so delicious in the photos online. You also get to see how they make them as well which is cool. Needless to say, our expectations were high as we looked through the myriad of flavors on their menu to pick what we'd like. For 6 donuts, you can only choose 2 flavors. For 12 donuts you can only mix and match 4 flavors.

We had the coco one and the apple cider. The donut was served warm and very soft. The flavor is created by whatever sugar topping the donut is dipped into. For this reason, there wasn't much distinction of flavors between the two we got. It just tasted like a cinnamon donut bite. Either there wasn't enough flavor or it just wasn't strong enough, the donut wasn't as good as expected. If you do go here, the glazed donut seems to hold more promise because it's dipped into a sweet glaze instead."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-05-06,5.0,"Mark and I spent a half day eating our way through Chelsea market.  This place was our final stop and it was awesome!!!

The doughnuts are fried fresh and then tossed in your choice of flavored sugars and toppings.

The flavored sugars are incredible with unique flavors from different cultures around the world.

We ordered a bag of twelve doughnuts and it was plenty for us to share. We also ordered a side of the chocolate dipping sauce.

Ordering at the counter is quick and the staff is friendly.

Nothing like this exists in Atlanta and I am in love with these doughnuts and the flavorings.

I highly recommend this place!!!"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-11-03,4.0,"Visited NYC last weekend with a few friends and started exploring Chelsea Market. Found ourselves at the Doughnuttery and waited in line to order 4 different flavours of donuts. The donuts were very fresh as you can see them get made right infront of your eyes. However, the flavours varied only so slightly. The taste was very subtle but I actually really liked that. We accidentally dropped a bag of donuts before we could even eat and the staff were so kind to replace them free of charge. I would say I liked these donuts better than Tiny Tom's."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2020-02-17,4.0,Great arrangement for a small office gathering! They are small enough to eat in one go. Every body on my team loved them
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-07-06,5.0,"Delicious homemade donuts like you can get by the bucket at the Big E, yet available year round at the Chelsea Market! A girl at the register handed us the menus and we split our order amongst the four of us and all had no regrets other than we should have ordered more. So yummy! We tried cinnamon, vanilla glazed, orange creamsicle, and coco loco, these are the flavors of sugar they roll your bite sized fresh made donuts in, fanfreakingtastic!"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-09-07,4.0,"Yum. Yum. Yum. Who can say no to fresh doughnuts, straight from the fryer? These folks serves their doughnuts fresh, made to order with your favourite toppings. There are loads of different ones to choose from. We bought a 25 pack one and was able to select three different flavours. All were nice in its own way and all were gone within the space of 10 minutes. The kids also enjoyed the doughnuts being made and also how the fryer works. The only con with this is you have to find somewhere within Chelsea Markets to be able to eat it. The store itself is for takeout only. Enjoy!!!"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2020-01-09,4.0,"Small hidden gem! I am used to the larger donuts that you can customize, these were still good but they were a bit expensive for the size. Still a good fresh buy though!"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2018-11-16,5.0,"Loved their donut holes! My friends and I enjoyed the Paris and hibiscus ones! They were piping hot, but so delicious with every bite! They were sufficiently sweet with delicate hints of exotic flavors.

This is located in the far right corner of one of the food sections/courts in Chelsea Market.

Idk what else to say but that they're good lol."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-05-11,3.0,"All the donuts taste the same. They're yummy and fluffy and warm and cute and tiny, but none of the flavors matter because they all taste the same. They really shouldn't advertise different flavors if they're going to roll these dry donuts in various sugars because all the sugars taste the same. We got 6 for $6 and when you get 6, you're allowed 2 flavors. We picked apple cider and urban monkey which are extremely different and they tasted the exact same. The donuts were fluffy and yummy, but they may as well not have a flavor menu."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2018-09-24,2.0,"This place has. a lot of different flavors for you to try and a quick way to get something fried and sweet for your craving. But I won't be coming back again. A dollar a donut hole?! Mmm no thanks. 

The service was horrible too, not a single thank you when we left. When I thought we could have more than 2 flavors for 6 donuts, the guy handling my order was very rude and impatient and said uhhhh you only get 2, which 2?"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-03-25,3.0,"Ok I love doughnuts. LOVE doughnuts. But I rarely eat them because it's hard to find some that are fresh. Often if I go to (gasp) dunkin doughnuts, the doughnuts are always stale. That being said I found Doughnuttery inside the Chelsea Market.  

It's a tiny vendor shop much like every other one in the the market. They have a cool machine that makes the doughnuts perfectly. 

Now about the flavors they have:  it isn't like other places where the flavors are the actual doughnut. It is from the powdered sugar they toss them in. That was a huge bummer for me. 

I ordered three different flavors but I can honestly only tell you about one because I faintly remember it. It had sriracha and bacon I think. It was ok. The other two flavors I have no idea what they were. 

Did I enjoy the doughnuts? Eh. 

Will I go back? Probably not."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2020-03-03,4.0,So little but taste so good. I don't remember which one I tried but it taste like funnel cake. It was plain with sugar and I definitely want to go back and have it again. The location is so cool. Be prepared for large crowds and it's a little tight when standing on line. The line moves very fast. Also know what you want before you get to the cashier. I felt the cashier was a bit in a hurry to move on to the next customer because I wasn't sure which one I wanted to order. Other wise I would definitely come back to try something different. The price wasn't bad I guess; I mean if  you think about 6 for $6. They are small as hell but they taste so good.
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2020-03-02,3.0,"Ordered 6 tiny, tiny donuts. Like real tiny. It was $6.50 and im just not sure it was worth it. I ordered two flavors: the vanilla glazed and purple pig (maple bacon). I did enjoy both flavors, especially the purple pig as it was covered in sugar but the bacon flavor was infused in the dough perhaps (?) which was quite interesting. However the price and size of the donuts is just not worth it. It feels a little gimmicky and 1 small donut, smaller than the size of my palm (and I have small hands!) is a little over $1 each. I think that if they were cheaper I would give a higher rating."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-03-25,4.0,"The doughnuts were amazing! I got the vanilla and chocolate glazed, both with sprinkles, and they tasted delicious. They were fresh and you could see them making the doughnuts in front of you which was fun. they had some funky flavors to choose from so if you're feeling adventurous you can go for that.

The woman at the cash register was not super friendly. My friend asked if she could get chocolate and vanilla glazed (just a little of each) and the woman was angry  in her response ""They don't come like that"". We watched the guy making them separately put on vanilla and chocolate glaze. He could have EASILY done the combination my friend wanted. I think if we asked him, it would have gone better but the woman did not even try to communicate with the man making them.

They are a little overpriced - $1/ mini-doughnut but they did taste great."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-01-24,5.0,"So this place has got some great tasting donuts that i wish came in full sizes. Paris time and Rosemary Road were probably my top favorites but their honestly wasn't one i didn't like.  

I ordered them on postmates instead of in person so the size honestly shocked me when I got them. I ordered 24 and they came in mini bags. I expected a huge box. But since I ordered through a delivery app I can't blame them for my ignorance. 

The price tag on such small donuts is semi worth it because of the unique flavors but don't expect full size treats."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2020-04-14,1.0,Sent multiple gifts to Mr. David Portnoy. Unacceptable given the circumstances. You ruined it for everyone. Please do not send anymore packages to his residence
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-01-17,4.0,This place was packed and they had three huge orders going out and somehow they still kept up and kept the line moving. The donuts are small and perfect for the little sweet I needed after lunch. I went with the purple pig and chocolate drizzles with sprinkles. The purple pig with a hint of savory but will sweet and was so fresh they were still warm. The chocolate sprinkles was really good as well. A little pricy but a nice treat in Chelsea market.
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2018-12-03,5.0,"Here's my infomercial for the day:

How many times have you been faced with the question, ""what flavor doughnut should I pick?""

Well, because Doughnuttery serves tiny little doughnut holes, you never have to stress that decision again! You can get multiple flavors and boy do they have a lot of flavors!

But for real--they have a great concept and are definitely worth checking out.   When you order your doughnut you can choose from a variety of sugar flavors to coat them in.  I tried the ""Fruit Cereal"" and ""Chai Me to the Moon,"" and I thought they were both really good.  The doughnuts themselves were fresh, warm, and crispy.  

I'll definitely be back to try more flavors!"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2018-02-07,3.0,"Small stand tucked away in the corner of Chelsea Market. Their donuts are mini-sized, which I guess sets them apart from other donut shops.

My friend and I tried Paris Time, Purple Pig, Pumpkin Pie Brulee, Green Tea Buzz... The flavor selections are not bad, but honestly they all tasted the same to me, just rolled in different colored sugars. There was also no ""wow"" factor for me that makes me want to come back. 

It's also a bit expensive... $1 for that size of a donut? I'm glad I didn't have to be stuck in a long line for this, though, so that's an upside."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2018-10-18,1.0,"I made a order from postmates for my husband birthday. I order the box of 25 and and some Nutella. He received 4 bags with 3 doughnuts each... no is not a joke I paid 30$ total for 12 mini doughnuts... last time I make a order here. Ruin my gift for my husband... thank you for nothing 

Attach the ""box"" that I ordered for a nice presentation."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-03-18,1.0,"Doughnuts are yummy and adorable... over priced but nothing you wouldn't expect.

The angry woman making them that refused to make eye contact with me or offer any sort of guidance while i stood there staring at her- not so adorable."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-06-22,3.0,"Have to say, the most impressive part of this place is watching the automatic doughnut machine. The staff here are rude, and lack basic customer service skills. The doughnuts, while they sound delicious, are nothing more than a flavored sugar rolled on them. Really? Not to mention they are mini, like REALLY mini. With a price matching most normal size doughnuts. I think Dunkin' Donuts munchkins are bigger. Not impressed at all."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-02-23,1.0,"Okay donuts, but awful staff. I walked up and when it was my turn, I asked if they had all the flavors that day, since the menu had like 30 different options. 

The guy at the register was training a new employee and without acknowledging my question, plainly lectures her about ""annoying visitors that walk up to the counter before knowing what they want"". I took a few seconds to process, and asked again since I'd be ordering a mix of two dozen donuts for an office party. 

The guy rolled his eyes and then began lecturing me about some arbitrary space designated over somewhere else for people that had questions rather than orders. 

I'm sorry my guy, but tiny donuts don't consume my life in much the same way that they do yours. I stood in the 'right' spot, asked nine or ten meaningless questions and was on my way for the last time."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-07-29,3.0,"Nice spot for a quick fix of donuts. Some flavours are better than others, of course. Try pebbles! Chai would need a little upgrade. The donuts themselves are very tasty!"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-04-26,4.0,"How can you go wrong with steaming fresh mini donuts? Stopped by in the Chelsea Market and ordered simple cinnamon sugar. The doughnuts were nice and fluffy and not too cakey. The staff were friendly as well, even though the line up was crazy. Kudos to them!"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2019-06-11,4.0,"Had a sweet tooth after lunch while in Chelsea Market. This looked interesting and once me and my kids read the menu we were sold. My kids call doughnuts sugar coated lies, but we are on vacation and I had moment of weakness. 
The make these little doughnuts fresh right in front of you. They have a variety of flavored toppings including vanilla or chocolate glazes, sprinkles, etc. I got 2 fruit cereal and 2 pumpkin pie brûlée. Holy crap they were good. It's like a sugar type flavoring that the coat on the fresh donuts. The cereal ones tasted like fruity pebbles to me and the pumpkin pie was awesome too. They weren't too sweet, just enough flavoring and sweetness. You can order 4,6 or dozen with different flavors. Really enjoyed these little gems."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2018-11-11,5.0,"I want this again right now lol
We stopped by the location in Bryant Park! So so good probably some of the best doughnuts I have ever had! I had the cinnamon sugar doughnuts! They were so soft and moist abs just the perfect mini doughnut! 

I will definitely recommend and return!"
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2018-07-27,4.0,Donuts here so good!! My friends ordered some donuts but I was absent during their transaction so I don't exactly what they ordered but all I know is that it was super tasty! The flavors provided here are quite out of the ordinary. Very unique. You can watch the donuts being made fresh in front of you! I absolutely recommend this place when you visit the Chelsea Market!
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2018-09-07,3.0,"My friend and I got 6 for $6 donuts (came out to $6.50) and got Paris Time and Cinnamon Sugar. While tasty, they tasted almost identical. The Paris Time had a slight vanilla flavor (not so much lavender as advertised). The donuts were very small (could be eaten in one bite) and were a little messy because of how much sugar was on them. It would be more worth it if the donuts were bigger!!

While its expected that everything is expensive in NYC, this wasn't my best investment, but it was a nice little treat after having lunch in the market."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2017-10-25,2.0,"What I ate: Coco Loco and Speckled Strawberry Doughnuts
Visit date: October 15, 2017
First time? Yes.

The doughuts here are incredibly adorable, but I wasn't impressed. They had more of a funnel cake texture. We tried the Coco Loco and Speckled Strawberry Doughnuts. A minimum order is six minis and you get to pick up to two flavors. The Coco Loco dust was made of chocolate cereal and cocoa; I liked this flavor more than the other but it wasn't too chocolatey. The Speckled Strawberry doughnuts had strawberry, lemon-thyme, and rainbow sprinkles; except ours didn't have rainbow sprinkles and I was disappointed. In theory I feel like these could taste and look amazing, but the flavor just wasn't there and was overpowered by the greasy doughnuts. Womp womp."
636,doughnuttery-new-york,2017-11-01,2.0,"Glad the doughnuts here are small, so you can try the different flavors - because there are a ton!  The doughnut itself was good, as it's warm and freshly fried, and has a similar taste to a funnel cake.  However, the flavors simply are not executed well here.  

I was impressed by the exotic and range of flavors they had, but was disappointed once I ended up getting the order.  Instead of having pre-flavored doughnuts, they take the plain doughnuts and whatever flavor you request, they have a mix of flavor/sprinkles which they shake the doughnut into a paper bag with.  I wouldn't have an issue with this if the flavors had stuck.  Since the flavoring is all in sprinkle form - they do not stick on the plain doughnut, and it ends up all at the bottom of your paper bag.  Then they make you order a minimum of six donuts at a dollar each, so unfortunately, it was a waste of money.

If you're looking for flavors to pop with your doughnut, I wouldn't recommend Doughnuttery.  Although I appreciate the concept, it just doesn't seem to work."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2020-02-03,5.0,"It's renovated!  The staff is knowledgeable on queue, you love to see it

I choose a 6pack of the yummy goodness. They seem w/ the renovations to have expanded variety 

Have fun and be ready to wait. The lines get long as ppl grab gifts and treats for travel at this location"
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2020-04-30,4.0,"Krispy Kreme is one of my favorite donut chains in the tri-state area! There's beauty in simplicity such as the glazed donut which never disappoints with the airy, fluffy donut dripped in icing! I can eat 3 of these donuts in one sitting! 

I am also a fan of the chocolate filled custard, strawberry sprinkles, and chocolate donuts! Can't go wrong with their season flavors too. I also like the small donut bite size in a plastic cup. It's more sanitary than Donut Dunkin which they use a wax paper and dump the munchkins inside a paper bag.

My only qualm is Krispy Kreme should also make interesting flavors like their Asian counterpart such as iced strawberry, raspberry and blueberry glazed (Japan chain), matcha/green tea (Japan chain), and iced watermelon glazed (Philippines) etc. If you check out Krispy Kreme in Japan on IG, the donut designs are beautifully decorated and the flavors are pleasing to the palate than the typical flavors offered in the US. This will be Krispy Kreme competitive advantage in the US in the world of gourmet and artisan donuts. 

This location in Penn State was recently renovated. The donuts are generally 99.9% fresh due to the high turnover. I always see a fresh batch of donuts on the racks. The cashiers are very efficient; not a long wait."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2020-05-17,2.0,"I been hearing so much wonderful responses on Krispy Kreme donuts. I was so excited to finally go and choose my selection of donuts. All the donuts where fresh and available for my selection. I really enjoyed the glazed blueberry cake, glazed raspberry filled over all the doughnuts where fresh and all tasted good. The service I received could of been better. It was 10min until closing time and staff didn't seem to happy to server me. When I ask for certain doughnuts he said in wasn't available but once I checked the opposite side the doughnuts where available he apologizes for his miscommunication."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-10-19,4.0,"Krispy Kreme how I loved you so, I miss you from all those spots I used to go.

I still remember the WTC, with my face against the glass seeing doughnuts plop on the conveyor belt and icing being pored, the vision, the aroma, it was like heaven and I was really in love with doughnut dough. Oh how I wish it was still so.

Sad to say but that was then and this is now, I been to Dough, Doughnut Plant and Dun-Well too, and I am sorry but I can't go back to you."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-10-27,4.0,"Krispy Creme has always been my ""go to"" for donuts.   It's too bad they don't have any local places.  Unfortunately, they got a bad rap years ago and closed a lot of there locations.  Happily they left the one in Penn Station.  Being there recently I took advantage a bought a ""Chocolate Custard filled and a coffee for the train ride home.

The shop is just a take out place so there is no place to sit down and eat.  I mean, it's Penn Station, there is always some place to sit down, just not here.

Donuts are really fresh and tasty.  Great chocolate and custard.  I mean, it was a great train ride home.   These are not calorie free and while I recommend they they aren't eaten daily, it is definitely worth the calories for an occasional treat.  They have a hug selection of donuts here.  I honestly do not know if they're cooked in the back or they get a delivery daily.  

I certainly recommend that if you're a donut eater, you try one.   They're good.  I mean really, really good..."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2020-02-27,4.0,"Full disclosure I have not had a Krispy Kreme donut in years. There was always some novelty new type of donut to try and I don't prefer sweets so never got around to having Krispy Kreme. The employees were really nice, friendly, fast, and efficient. There were two people working they and they worked so smoothly together. The racks of donuts looked so beautifully displayed. The only thing I can say is that I feel the donuts are a little too sweet for me. If it was a little less sweeter then I would probably go back more often."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2020-03-03,5.0,"We had a heart shaped donut for its opening day near v day. It looked cute, tasted cute, and my boyfriend liked it! The line was long but it went by really quick."

637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-06-15,4.0,"Meandering my way through the weekday commuter crowd heading back home, I stopped by Krispy Kreme's lone NYC location inside Penn Station to satisfy my donut cravings.

With so many different donut variates, I settled on four:

1. Glazed 4.5/5.0: This is the classic Krispy Kreme donut and it's easy to taste why. Yes the honey-like tasting glaze was sweet, but in a very pleasant way. The donut portion was soft and airy; the way a yeast donut should be.

2. Glazed Chocolate Cake 4.0/5.0: This is one of my favorite donut flavors and Krispy Kreme's version was quite good, but not quite on par compared to the venerable Dunkin Donuts version. The generously spread translucent glaze weighed this donut to the sweeter side of the taste scale, with the chocolate flavor taking second place (BTW....opposite to the Dunkin equivalent with a predominant quite dark chocolate taste). Speaking on the chocolate flavor, it primarily tasted like a lot of cocoa powder versus say a milk chocolate taste. 

3. Glazed Raspberry Filled: 4.5/5.0: This one surprised me. I enjoyed it more than I initially thought. It had the same pleasant honey-like sweet glaze I mentioned on the Glazed donut, but inside was a yummy raspberry jelly. There was a strong raspberry flavor which was both sweet and had a hint of welcomed tastness. The dough was pillowy and had a hint of buttery flavor too.

4. Chocolate Iced Custard filled NA/5.0: I actually did not eat this one; giving it to a friend who really liked it."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-05-03,5.0,"Still the best donuts in NYC (best donuts in the world, for that matter).

Again, if you can make the trip to jersey city for the real experience, I strongly recommend you go. Still, even though this one is in penn, it doesn't a pretty good job overall. They have a lot of the classic flavors, and open early. 

Recently, I went here to get the limited edition donuts, which are the chocolate glazed ones. They are only served here on the first Friday of every month, so you'll only have like 12 times per year to get them. Luckily, they don't run out like within the first couple hours or anything (in my experience), since I showed up here like around 2 in the afternoon, and there were still quite a lot. I actually think they're slightly better than the original glazed donuts (surprisingly), but are additional 50 calories per donut. Still, I think it's definitely worth it to come and try them if you are a donut fan like I am."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-06-08,4.0,"Why is this the only Krispy Kreme in New York City!? We, New Yorkers, deserve more donut deliciousness in every borough!
I stopped by to pickup a dozen donuts, but luckily it was also National Donut Day, so they were giving out any free donut! I got a Glazed Donut with Kreme Filling.
I've had this donut before at a different location and it wasn't great, but I decided to give it another try! And I'm so glad I did! It was super soft and creamy! It was gone too soon. It was a great dessert to end the night.

I am not sure but I must've caught them at the time they had stocked their freshest donuts because they were melt in your mouth fresh. Especially their lemon and raspberry filled...even with not trying them until I got home about an hour later...
They were busy and fully stocked. Their staff was overwhelmed with the amount of people waiting for their orders...they messed up a couple of the people's orders in front of me. 
Lastly they are pricey. Expect to pay a bit but well worth it...not so much for health though. 
ENJOY!"

Although I didn't go to the place to pick the donuts up, luckily I had a coworker willing to complete the task. After eating various donuts (regular glazed, glazed raspberry filled, original filled original and chocolate Kreme, chocolate ice custard filled and glazed with lemon filling), they just aren't great. It's like a McDonald's to Shake Shack. It seems to be a fast food version of donuts. They also didn't have the new Reese's filled donuts, so minus points there as well. Overall, they are decently good tasting, just wouldn't go out of my way to get these over way better donuts around."

Especially on national coffee and donut day. Whats better than free donuts? The staff is always friendly and ready to take my order with a smile. Another reason why i like coming back.
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2020-03-10,5.0,I've been here twice at very different times of the day (7am and 10pm) and both times were the service and treats impeccable !!! So yes I highly recommend
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-12-23,2.0,"This location is unlike a regular Krispy Kreme, obviously, so don't expect regular standards. Unfortunately there aren't any others in the city but I hear they are building one in Times Square!"

LOL, the staff are always super friendly and helpful, the beautiful assortment of their patent glazed donuts are always super fresh and delicious!Pretty good Java also! Just be sure not to trip over the many homeless people as you carry your donuts and walk away!"
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-02-03,4.0,"Quick line,  lots of options! Got 6 donuts,  cost 9 bucks! Great deal.  Wanted to see if they were as good as I remember from years and years ago.  Can't say it was anything special but good for a big chain store. 

For people trying find it in Penn station, it's near the Amtrak side!! I thought it was outside.. oppsy"
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-09-21,5.0,Great donuts and such a different feel From Jersey. Never been to the jersey location but took a trip when i went to nyc and its was great.
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2020-02-21,5.0,You can never ever be disappointed in Krispy Kreme. ... and that's all I have to say about that
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2018-06-01,4.0,"June 1st is National Donut Day!!  Thanks for the free doughnut, Krispy Kreme (no purchase necessary; free until 11pm)!  Service was super friendly and the line moved fast.  They even gave out free doughnuts to people who were on line but were not aware of the free doughnut offer...how cool!  

There are soooo many doughnut options at Krispy Kreme, so the hard part is picking which one you want!  Sure, I could have bought additional doughnuts, but in trying to control myself, I picked a chocolate glazed one, and quickly got out of there before temptation took over!   Good Choice!  The doughnut was fresh and delicious!

Btw, I've always spelled donut as ""donut""; however, Krispy Kreme spells it ""doughnut"", so in their honor, that's the way I spelled it here."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2018-03-23,5.0,"I get donuts from here EVERY TIME I come through New York PENN Station. Ev-Er-y TIME. 

Diet? Still get the KKs... Sick? Still get the KKs.... Down to my last $5.... Still get the KKs.... Running terribly late.... KKs.... President requests my presence as I was cordially invited?..... Ya'll know I wouldn't go see Trump and I'd not only still get the KKs, but I'd stay and eat all of them so I wouldn't be in the condition to go anywhere. Ha! 

They have all the fancy flavors. Like all. This visit, they did not have jelly filled so I am beside myself upset (seriously.... what do you mean you don't have the raspberry filled? Didn't you know I was coming? Who is your manager's manager. The horror. The outrage? The tyranny!!) but.... they did have the others I like. They are always fresh, staff is friendly, service & quick and efficient. No complaints. Would I come back? I don't have a choice, the one in my area won't be finished construction until Fall 2018."

No matter what time of the day or evening, this Krispy Kreme always boasts a fully supplied counter of fresh baked donuts. I usually buy a three-piece box, with an original glazed, a raspberry filled glazed, and a seasonal donut (pumpkin/ jack-o-lantern, cinnamon swirl, etc.). The line moves very quickly and service is efficient so you won't miss your train."

1) dunkin donuts

3) McDonald's 

They nailed it on tatse!!!!!!!!
 Mix the flavors up tho for something different

Its not that strong, just a sweet treat"
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2018-06-23,5.0,"I really like their glazed doughnuts.  It's too bad, this is the only one in NYC.  Granted, I only go here when they email me a free birthday doughnut coupon.  

It's really out of the way unless you are in that area.  The cashier and server are efficient.  I rarely had to wait on a long time."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2018-01-27,4.0,"It's a late night must, especially if you're drunk! These donuts have always been fresh when I've purchased them. Great flavor, great quality, great all around donuts. Not as good as getting them from the factory but certainly delicious. 

I always go for the original glazed, Kreme filled, and raspberry jelly..... it's soooooo good! 

Enjoy your visit!

637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2018-10-08,4.0,I hate the location of this Krispy Kreme and I second guessed going because its buried in Penn Station. But if you ever had a Krispy Kreme it puts its competitors to shame. Honestly no matter where you go it tastes the same. I will probably get ripped by donut enthusiasts but its easily top 1/2 donuts I ever eaten. Only negative is its a bit pricey and odd location but that's me knit picking.
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-02-14,5.0,This place is heaven. We love the plain glazed donuts. They are so good fresh out of the oven or heated up for 5-10 seconds in the microwave. We also got the Valentine's Day donuts.
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-04-14,4.0,Yum.  I always grab an original donut before I catch the LIRR.  Light and chewy donuts that melt in your mouth.  My guilty pleasure.
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-05-01,2.0,"Haven't had Krispy Kreme in a long time. The donuts are mediocre at best. They are incredibly sweet, and not in a good way. I believe the donuts from Dunkin are a lot better. I absolutely love donuts, I'm always trying out new donut shops (usually not chain shops), but these aren't good ones. 

They are nice and clean though. Staff seems friendly."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2018-01-13,2.0,"Can someone explain to me why people go crazy over these donuts? I have tried many donut places and this is a step above Dublin Donuts. 

The prices are very inexpensive and the staff is friendly and fast but the Donut itself doesn't measure up. I decided to buy some for my boyfriend and I got 2 glazed, 2 chocolate glazed, their new Oreo cream one, and a sugar donut. 

After trying the Oreo one, the cream inside tasted like actual plastic, I have never had a filling so bad. Also the dough itself it's very soft and kind of tasteless. The glazed Donut was ok but I have had so much better. The chocolate glazed tasted so artificial and I was hoping it would make up for the others one! Haven't tried the sugar donut so can't judge that but I'm not expecting too much. 

I remember eating these as a child many years ago and it used to be 20x better :( all in all, try out other places like Dough (my personal fav), Doughnut Plant, or Underwest Donuts."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2018-03-18,4.0,"Had to stop by and pick up a dozen before heading to NJ. I've never had Krispy Kreme, so I had no high expectations.  Service is quick if you order a set assortment of donuts; if not you'll have to wait in line to pick each donut. I tried the original and thought it was light and fluffy. The glaze is a little too sweet though. My coworker recommended to microwave the donut for 7 seconds so that the glaze/frosting melts a little, but the donut is warm and soft. After microwaving it, I have to say it's really good.

The blueberry crueller type of donut was also way too sweet with the glaze. I love the donut though, but had to scratch off the frosting."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-04-27,4.0,Sometime the line is long but it moves very fast. The donuts are good and light. Thankfully they're an amazingly affordable sweet treat. There are no seats because it's more like a stand.
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2018-10-14,5.0,I truly love Krispy Kreme donuts always fresh . This locations is located inside Penn Station . I drive all the way from Long Island for them and I am never disappointed . They are always fresh and never saw them run out of any . Service is great and fast
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-06-07,5.0,"Nothing like the actual experience, South location . When ever I go South it's a must I get at least one glazed. I'm going to the movies at Penn so I will get some, didn't even know this one existed - NYC baby !!"
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2018-01-01,4.0,"I first learned about Krispy Kreme when one of my former supervisors treated me to Krispy Kreme's Doughnuts at the beginning and end of my internship. I also used to see the Kardashians post pics of their donuts from time to time. Naturally, I assumed this company was a high-end Dunkin Donuts. Anyways, I had a chance to try their chocolate doughnut and their regular coffee when I had to take the Amtrak to an office meeting in Albany. 
The chocolate doughnut resembles Dunkin Donut's Boston cream, except there is whipped (?) crème filling inside as opposed to the cream filling found in the Boston cream. It was actually pretty good. 
I felt their coffee was made just right (right amount of milk and sugar) so no adjustment was needed. The cost is not that much more than Dunkin in my opinion. I'm willing to try their other items if I get an opportunity to go to Penn Station again."
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-06-02,3.0,I gave it a 3 not because I don't like the store but the product itself. This is my first time try Krispy Kreme doughnuts and expected more from the store. Everyone's just tell me that is so good but when I try it all I taste is sugar sugar sugar. To be honest I'm just a Dunkin' Donuts girl. And the price is too much sorry
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2018-12-12,4.0,Awesome. You can't find better donuts.  I love glaze and Boston cream.  Place is clean. The servers are kind.  My glaze donut was succulent
637,krispy-kreme-new-york-4,2019-09-01,5.0,There's a reason why everyone loves this place. Its awesome. I just wish they had Krispy Kreme everywhere other than at Penn Station.
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-03-19,5.0,"As I sit here, in my room, quarantined from the world, thinking about where I'd go if there wasn't quarantine, I thought of doughnut plant. SIKE. People are going crazy over isolation, quarantine, wfh, losing their minds. I've been quarantined since 1994. Since I was born. Well that might be an exaggeration, but this place being the best donut in NYC is not.

I come here, once in a while. Like twice in 25 years. Oops, gave away my age. What's good with you though? Anyways, from the first moment I bit into this doughnut, 3 years ago, still a struggling college student with excess weight physically and from the baggage of life, I knew I shouldn't come here often. Cause of the taste? No. Cause you know, doughnuts aren't exactly the healthiest of food options though it has nuts in its name.

But it was good. Like mad good. Like wth is Dunkin donuts doing. The only thing they give me is a stale donut and a ""Hello Sir, Ni Hao!"" I swear, all these dunkin donut cashiers are racist af even though their English Accent...I'll stop there.

Tl;dr best donuts in NYC. Don't open shop in Flushing cause you know I'll go back to the 200lb club real quick if they come through. But I'm not from Flushing so wouldn't matter"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-04-22,5.0,"I was really turned off by what seemed to be $5 donuts, and a decidedly perfectly commercial retail space with a wall full of whimsical donut sculptures and a clean bathroom equipped with a disco ball.  
Even though a visit guarantees an up close view of the historic New York landmark The Chelsea Hotel, the juxtaposing of this artsy institution with a gimmicky donut shop straight out of a Simpsons episode seems a bit sacrareligous.  Or is it?

My first dip into the devils playground was a cup of coffee.   The cool woman behind the counter offered me a free donut.  It was at this point I became kidnapped and a victim of Stockholm Syndrome, seduced by my captor.

I chose Carrot Cake.  It was just under $5, ultramoist, gemmed with nuts and candied carrots, filled with cream cheese icing.

I wanted as long as I could for a second visit.  I held out for a few weeks. Second flavor choice was double dutch chocolate.   I think this was even better than carrot if that's possible.

These donuts are exceptional.  Think of them almost as in the food kingdom of designer cupcakes. Sure a cup of coffee and a donut will set you bac around $8, but trust me, the small splurge is worth it."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-03-22,4.0,"Note: I'm catching up on reviews and got food from this location last week before the order was given for all restaurants to do take-out/delivery only. 

I've had doughnuts from Doughnut Plant before and only writing a review now as I wasn't on Yelp. I came here with others to share a few doughnuts. We got vegan strawberry, lucky shamrock (Irish soda bread), peanut butter & blackberry jam, and Manhattan cream doughnuts. This visit was before St. Patrick's day thus the limited time lucky shamrock one. If you like Irish soda bread with caraway seeds then you'll like this one and the shape is fun! I had a bite of the vegan strawberry which was ok, light in strawberry flavor. The Manhattan cream was alright also, but my favorite is the peanut butter and blackberry jam. They go well together and like having a PB&J sandwich in doughnut form. I have had it fresher before with the peanuts outside being crunchy, but the taste was still good.

The interior is fun with the colorful doughnuts on the walls and the servers were nice. Also got a cup of regular coffee which was good, smooth and not bitter."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-04-13,4.0,"For me, it was a miss. But that might have been due to the exotic flavors I chose that day (I should have just tried a standard glazed donut). I thought the texture was excellent. Definitely my style of donut. I will try again if I ever find myself walking past one. But currently, Donut Pub is my spot for A+ donuts in the city."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-12-28,4.0,"I've tried donuts from Doughnut Plant many times before I had a yelp account. I'm glad I went back recently so I can share the wonderful customer service experience I received specifically at the Chelsea location. I pre-ordered a variety of seasonal donuts for my family. For myself, I wanted to try the vegan donuts which are made with sourdough (no commercial yeast). Before I arrived to pick up my advance order, I called to ask about flavors that were listed as sold-out online. The staff was kind enough to let me know they were expecting to restock and would hold that flavor once it becomes available (which it did, and I got to purchase!)

The reputation of fun, quality donuts from Doughnut Plant is true also for the vegan variety. I tried the dark chocolate sourdoughnut; the pistachio sourdoughnut; and the panettone. You should eat them fresh for the best experience. If you need to store them, make sure you wrap them completely in wax paper... because the donuts will get hard and lose their charm. Very pleased with how decadent and flavorful yet light and pillowy the donuts are... even the vegan ones!"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-01-21,4.0,"PB&J square doughnut is a bomb! Not too sweet with blackberry jello and peanut crumbs sprinkled for crunch
It was nice to see Valrhona chocolate one!  
As for Yuzu, it was nice and citrusy, not as good as others
Plenty tables for seating. 
Knowledgeable service"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-11-06,4.0,"One of the best spot  to pass by when in the area. Good selections of their specialty doughnuts. We tried 3 of their best sellers /red velvet, cream brûlée and tres leches - did not disappoint. I enjoyed much the donut that breading is like cake. There are so many options based on your likes. What an awesome treat especially to those that has sweet tooth. 

The decor inside is quite lovely , very creative and colorful."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-11-02,4.0,"We tried the Apple Cinnamon Yeast donut. The consistency was very good - light and airy for a donut. I guess the yeast really made a difference. The flavor was alright for a couple of bites, but I wouldn't order it again or crave it in the future. The Coconut Cream Filled Square was amazing. That's a high quality donut. Great texture and amazing flavor. Perfect ratio of donut to filling. The Coconut Cream filled square was still good the next morning after a night in the refrigerator.

Our party of two visited at about 2pm on a Saturday. There was a constant line but it wasn't too long. There are like small tables along one wall of the interior. All were filled when we visited. Seems like most people tend to grab and go. 

Service was speedy and to the point. Would return to this Donut Plant if ever again in the neighborhood."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-10-27,4.0,"These are huge and the quality is there! Love the sourdough element!!

I got 3 doughnuts here and I loved 2/3. The 2 I loved were the Peanut Butter doughnuts with raspberry jam filling and the other was a banana cream filling. Both were huge doughnuts meant to be shared with another person or two. The filling was a decent amount, the banana seemed like it was overfilled in a good way. It was quite a different experience than Krispy Kreme or a grocery store deli version. It was pretty worth it for me to try them! The one let down was the small chocolate hazelnut doughnut because it just seemed a bit plain. I'd say a fair comparison would be a donut hole but slightly more oval. The also have condiments here so you can put a syrup or topping on it too.

I'll be back again when I'm looking for high quality doughnuts or if they come out with a new interesting flavor!"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-02-17,5.0,"Last month, while in NYC, I made it my mission to walk like mad (34km a day!), try as many doughnuts and pizza slices as possible .
While passing by Grand Central Station we decided to give this doughnut place a go (they have several locations and they were on my hit list).
We ordered two doughnuts, one with banana and peanut butter and one with peanut butter and jam. These two delicacies were delicious and perfect. The dough is airy and fluffy, sweet but just right... The peanut butter and fruit combo does not get old. We had a black coffee with a little honey to accompany these delightful creations.
I cannot remember exactly how much we paid but I remember thinking these doughnuts are huge and are good value.
The gentleman serving was pleasant. I would definitely taste some more doughnuts from this establishment"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-12-15,4.0,"Walked passed this place last week while venturing around NYC. Went in- all the employees greeted me with smiles and warm welcomes. They had a dozen choices of donuts to pick from. I got red velvet. 

I thought it was going to be really sugary since it was coated with a layer of icing but surprisingly...not too sweet, the inside wasn't too dry either. I enjoyed my donut. 

I realized while eating my donut that a lot of people were there during break also just eating a single donut then leaving right away. I think it's a solid choice since I saw not just one person do this but two or three. Just came for a donut, sat down to enjoy it then went on with life"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-09-30,5.0,"I was craving some good doughnuts and figured it had been quite a while since I had come here. This Doughnut Plant is tucked away under some heavy scaffolding. It almost looks as if it's closed down with all the construction that's going on next to it. But if you keep going a little bit longer you'll see the colorful display of doughnut pillows on the wall. 

They serve all different types of doughnuts and run out of some very quickly. I opted for a couple of the Creme Brûlée's, the coconut cream square donut and a Valhrona Chocolate one. The Creme Brûlée was amazing! The cream filling was delicious and the outside was light and fluffy. The coconut cream one was good, but the cream tasted a bit off. In all fairness we did leave it out for a few hours so I wonder if it may have started to spoil. The Valhrona Chocolate was amazing too. It was a simple chocolate donut with a strong chocolately aftertaste. 

Their bathroom is also very unique. It has a disco ball on the ceiling and the walls, floors and ceiling are all made of reflective tiling. It makes you feel like you're peeing in the 70s. 

The ladies behind the counter were very nice and helpful. Whenever I am around the area I'll definitely stop in again."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-09-12,5.0,"MMMMMMM Doughtnuts.

Not just any doughnut mind you.  Doughnut Plant Doughnuts!

I have had the pleasure of eating these masterful creations many times over the years. Yeast is not used in the preparation and only the highest quality ingredients are used in their creation. Real fruit in the jelly etc.

Some of the doughnuts are not round but square shaped. This allows the jelly to be distributed around the entire doughnut as opposed to just the center. Jelly in every bite!

Not sure which one to get? My favorites are the blackout, the tres leches and the peanut butter and jelly. At 4 dollars a pop you may only want to grab one but back in the day my friends and I would buy a dozen (I believe they were cheaper then).  

Locations have popped up all over the city. D.P. is definitely one of the must stops in the city if you are a first time visitor. These doughnuts are one of a kind. One might say doughnut art!"

Definitely go for the PB & Jan filled square ($4.25). Its decently big and pretty sweet so share w/ someone! 5/5

Carrot Cake Cake Donut ($3.95), I just loved thsi because I love carrot cake but it was nothing extraordinary. 4.8/5"

When I walked in, I was overwhelmed with the different kinds of donuts they have The employee patiently explained the difference of each  donuts and their flavors. There are yeast, cake , filled , and gluten free donuts.  He also explained the process of how each donut is made. The flavors of the donuts are  fred velvet, fruit flavored, green matcha, cinnamon, tres leche,  I made forgot a few others. I got a raspberry cake donuts. It was sweet, but not too sweet. 

The bonus is that the place has great a/c and a clean rest room. As a tourist/traveler, I am thankful to find a clean rest room."

638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-01-16,4.0,"Stopped by Doughnut Plant to grab some food with a friend last September and thoroughly enjoyed the food! I ordered a creme brûlée doughnut and an apple cinnamon doughnut, both of which were excellent - the former I loved a little more just because of the novelty and the caramelization on the outside, but I would absolutely get both again if I had the stomach space! The horchata I got was a little too thin for my taste but still flavored well. I would love to return and try some of the other doughnuts too!"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-11-28,4.0,"Great donuts (with vegan and gluten free availability as well). I've been three times and the first two they were out of their vegan options which was sad, but this past time there were two vegan donuts available! I love a good donut so this was very exciting to me.

I ordered a dozen for a Thanksgiving gathering, but unfortunately they don't offer any sort of deals - so it came out to almost $50 for 12 donuts, quite expensive! 

The vegan chocolate and apricot were really solid, and everyone loved the non vegan donuts (carrot cake, tres leches, etc). If you're in the mood for a great donut (whether cake, yeast, filled, vegan or gluten free) this is a really solid option!"

My favorite thing about them is that many of them have a filling in the middle, they were one of the firsts to introduce this. They have other types such as cake and sourdough ones but their filled donuts will always be my favorite. Multiple locations in lower Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-12-11,4.0,"Part of my trip to New York involves looking for places to eat - this one was a request from a friend and I'm so glad we made it! Stepping into the store we're greeted by a wall of whimsical doughnut  cushions in colourful patterns, and otherwise muted and industrial style décor. No smell of doughnuts or anything baking, but maybe we just missed the fresh batch?

We quickly huddle around the display cabinet showing samples of all the different flavours of donuts. If names aren't delicious to you, seeing a real sample should convince you! They've got interesting square doughnuts as well as your traditional round ones, with and without filling. There's also slightly smaller sized ones that are great as a small snack - though pay attention! The shapes and sizes denote different flavours and textures, and it's not a build-your-own. We ended up getting a half dozen to share, and got a good variety.

One of my favourites was definitely the peanut butter jelly filled square doughnut. Crunchy on the outside, gooey on the inside, and a big doughnut so there's plenty! A great twist on a classic flavour, and just one level up really from your common jelly filled doughnut that's got powdered sugar or sugar glaze on the outside. Makes all the difference!

One downside is that the doughnuts are served cold. For some of the flavours I understand - warm would just mean messy gooey toppings going everywhere but into your belly - which is no fun. But even then I wish they were more room temperature than out-of-fridge - or maybe it was just a cold day? The price point doesn't necessarily make it an every day kind of treat either, so be warned! For the novelty, I will try to be back to try some other flavours. If it's convenient for me I guess. All in all - still a great experience and I commend them for the unique offering done pretty well!"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-12-10,4.0,"Came here, based on a recommendation from a friend. She originally was drawn to them since they were egg-less and stayed for their good doughnuts. And she wasn't wrong! I got the vanilla yeast doughnut filled with blackberry jam, and my friend got the red velvet cake doughnut. I loved my choice and there was a significant amount of jam in the doughnut, and the flavors complemented each other well. When we were there, it was around lunch time but there were a couple people seemingly coming in from their lunch break, for a doughnut! They have definitely built a brand based on good confections, and it shows."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-04-08,4.0,"Mmmmm mmm good! I looked at the menu before coming in and already had in mind what I wanted...though I will admit I was tempted by the Pb&j square and coconut cream filled square. Anyways, shop was empty when we strolled in around 750am, I was a little disappointed at how the donuts looked because they didn't look as fresh as other spots around the city. And I got a little crestfallen when I thought they had run out of the ones I had wanted and then I realized I was wrong and all was right with the world. Grabbed a passionfruit rose, yuzu yeast and strawberry jam filled vanilla glazed square. 

The square was good, with my first bite it didn't seem like there was much jam but that was because it was literally in the other corners, oozing out. The yuzu had a nice lunch of lemon flavor but it wasn't too overpowering. The rose had amazing layers and layers, the passionfruit being strong and persistent but similar to the yuzu not overpowering in the slightest. What I like most about doughnut plant is how soft and fluffy their doughnuts are. Like, literally, and with a chew!"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-04-20,4.0,"Came here on a rainy day with two friends. I've been to the doughnut plant in Brooklyn, so I only expected the best flavors.

The decor here is pretty dope. There's a cute quote on one wall to the far right corner with a bench that kind of reminds me of the Park Guell in Barcelona. On the left is a fun wall of donut pillows--very cute. It was a late night (around 10), and the best current r&b jams were playing.

I ordered a small masala chai latte --twice. One for there and one to go. It tasted almost as good as the chai I had from an Indian spot in DC. My friends had the hot and iced horchata lattes and enjoyed them! I tried the blackout, red velvet, peanut butter banana, and wild blueberry donuts. I really enjoyed the subtlety of the peanut butter banana donut. It wasn't too sweet at all. The blueberry and blackout donuts were delicious as well. I wasn't really a fan of the red velvet--it was a little too sweet with less layers of flavor on the palette.

Overall great spot: good vibes and delicious snacks."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-09-22,4.0,"Best doughnuts in Chelsea and the most informative and entertaining staff, doesn't get more NYC than this, after hitting up Lions and Tigers  Pizza  had to top off a cortado with the Brooklyn blackout  doughnut, if you don't like chocolate the red velvet or carrot cake are probably the most popular ones, they take cash or credit. There is a bathroom for customers and sitting area as well. Definitely would go back"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-03-02,5.0,"We have never left Doughnut Plant disappointed. Always fresh, always tasty and they usually have something new on the menu. Sometimes there's a short line but it's always worth it."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-05-09,4.0,"If you're looking for a place of ""firsts"", this is the place to go!! The Doughnut Plant is the proud title holder of world's FIRST square filled doughnut invented here AND world's FIRST crème brûlée doughnut.

I got the square doughnut and it was delicious!!! There were yeast doughnuts, cake doughnuts, berry ones, and so much more. The workers were friendly and the great variety of donut flavors serves to please a myriad of tastes.  My personal favorite was the vanilla creme square doughnut with jelly filling. 

I could not be more pleased. They matched our expectations perfectly."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-01-01,5.0,"Excellent service, product and location.

Would return."

638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-04-21,4.0,"A friend has been totally raving about the donuts @ Doughnut Plant, and I finally had the chance to visit the Chelsea location after our tour at The Vessel, Hudson Yards.

Wild Blueberry ($3.75)
Yuzu (yeast) ($4)
Coconut Cream ($4.25)

But, could not quite agree with my friend, though !!! Was it really that worth it ....... 

The yeast type was very chewy. 
Blueberry - cake type - very moist. 
I truly enjoyed the coconut cream one (maybe because I usually like coconut flavor).

The common ""pro"" for all three is that they are not too sweet at all. The chewiness of the ""yeast"" was very satisfying too. For me only since my husband only enjoyed the most Blueberry one !!!!!

Give it a try when you are near Chelsea !!!!!!"

Swing by after dinner if you're craving some sweets. If you like some Donuts, this is the spot!"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-01-11,5.0,"New York based donut company that makes delicious donuts. [This is one of their 4 locations.] Please don't ask me how to get here because I was/am a tourist myself, but google maps is everything and you'll find it in no time. 
Fun fact taken from website - ""We never use eggs, preservatives, or anything artificial...ever!"" No eggs? That's so crazy! 

There's a wall of... what else? Donuts! Donut pillow/decor! Such a fun and yummy spot. 

What do they sell? Why, only one of the most perfect pairings ever - donuts and coffee!! 

Their options for coffee are the usual espresso drinks - macchiatos, cortados, flat whites, cappuccinos, my favorite lately - Americanos, and of course, lattes. They brew, they also do pour-overs, have hot drinks, and cold drinks. The prices range from $3-6ish, which isn't bad for NYC. 

DONUTS. They have yeast donuts, cake donuts, filled squares which are exactly that, their popular doughflowers (donut pieces shaped into flowers.) I forgot what hubby chose, but I remember mine. The black and white cake donut, and the MATCHA donut. If there is matcha anything, I will choose it and it was one of the best. things. EVER. The donuts are a tad pricy but I think totally worth it. About $4 each. And again, NYC. 

I would definitely come back in a heartbeat and I highly recommend.  *Insert heart and donut emojis here*

Review #4 of 2019"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2019-08-05,5.0,"We got a sampler platter of four different donuts, all of which were delicious: cinnamon, blueberry, coconut lime, and the PB&J square jelly donut. The blueberry was my favorite! The donuts here are more dense and cakey rather than airy and puffy, but the way they are flavored matched well, and we promptly ate all of the donuts within five minutes. Although cinnamon is usually my favorite, it was actually my least favorite here. It was still pretty good, but the other ones were so stellar that I wish I had tried another flavor instead of gotten that one. 

Decor is also fun. The nice thing is that, because so many people grab and go, there were lots of seats available."
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-01-06,5.0,"One of my favorite doughnut places I've ever been to. Everything I've had is amazing and the service has always been top notch even during busier times. I love the Tres Leches, PB&J and the carrot cake and have never had anything there that I didn't like! This is probably my favorite doughnut spot in NYC!"
638,doughnut-plant-new-york-2,2020-02-22,1.0,"Honestly this place is bad. Tried 3 different donuts and they were all pretty disappointing. It had a weird texture and the icing was too dry and thick. Will not go back again.

*bought the peanut butter one, the cream brûlée one, and the chocolate one."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-12-26,5.0,"small and cute cafe. good vibes and a nice little stop in the city

Cappuccino- 5 stars 
Hot chocolate- 4.5 stars
Chai tea latte- 3 stars (it was good but it was very light and i personally prefer my chai to be really strong)

Almond croissant- 5 stars
Ham & cheese croissant- 3.5 stars (according to my sister, not enough ham and cheese inside; it was mostly bread. the ham inside was v tasty tho)"
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2020-02-26,4.0,"was waiting for my bus to leave from hudson yards and stopped here along the way for a morning drink and snack. decent amount of seating in the form of tables as well as a few right up against the window so you can easily people-watch. staff is super friendly and place felt nice.

my iced chai felt really watery; something i'd never order from here again. their pastries are really well done and tasty though and i absolutely loved mine. the chai was overpriced to me and the pastry was a bit as well but the portion was large so it's excused."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2020-02-26,4.0,"Descent capacino, I would have preferred a stronger roast. 

Well made personal sized quiche. Two issues:
1. Still mosly cold after reheating for 3+ minutes 
2. They only have plastic utensils, which are difficult to use with thick quiche crust

I'll be back, given convenience of location."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2020-01-25,5.0,"No nonsense espresso shop tucked underneath outdoor scaffolding. Nobody mad inside in terms of temper. They may be mad for the drinks made. They have an excellent selection of milk alternatives so go wild for almond, hemp or macadamia. Theres a big wooden antique table and four small bistro tables. It's catering to both small groups, duos and/or ppl to mingle with each other. The dirty Chai had some nice bite to it yet smooth and smelling original. 
Great place. BOOM!"
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2020-02-22,5.0,Have to give this place a  review cause the guy was so nice.  He gave us tips on how to get around NYC and let us eat our breakfast there with our delish coffee he made us.  I had the Cubano as I was running on 3 hours of sleep from the flight from L.A.   we love NY and Madman Espresso.  GO CHECK IT OUT!
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2020-03-13,3.0,"I tried getting work done here and it was practically impossible. Loud heavy rock music. I ordered a chai latte and it tasted like heavy milk. Could barely taste the flavor and when I informed them it tasted like milk, they made me another one that tasted the same. Just the ambiance is cute. Everything else is a no no"
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2018-10-19,5.0,"This was my first time coming to Madman.
I literally waited till it opened 7:30am..But I went in at 7:31 to not seem to anxious  

But I loved the vibes and look of this shop! The staff was really nice! 

I tried to take a picture of my coffee for you guys and my coffee spilled!!!  

I felt so bad because it spilled over their nice wooden table! But as soon as Meyer(the gentleman at the shop) saw the spill he instantly said to the lady ""make him a new one"" and started to clean the table. I also helped to clean! I really felt bad and the spilled coffee smelled so good!

I got my new coffee and it tasted so good! I got a caramel cafe latte! With nice coffee art! I will deff be coming back! =]

Btw their coffee lids are legit! First time I ever had a coffee lid as nice as the ones they provide lol"
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-11-21,5.0,"I come here in the mornings maybe once or twice a week and I always order a small, iced caramel latte. It wakes me up in the morning and plus their coffee is great. I truly love the service. The people here remember my face and will already start making my drink before I order. There are a ton of cafes but this one I think is special to me. It's the little things that distinguishes itself from other cafes. One large communal seating area on one side and a couple of tables on opposite end for a more intimate conversation. It's great, check it out!"
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-10-25,5.0,"If you're looking for a place near Penn station for excellent coffee, this is it. I am meeting a business associate here and they have a few tables to speak at. The staff is excellent, very friendly and no age bias which I always appreciate at these funky coffee shops."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2018-08-11,4.0,"I've been on the hunt for the best chais in town and stumbled across Madman!

It's a tiny coffee shop hidden off a side street near 8th ave. I've been here 3 times in the past 2 weeks and had the same experience each time. GOOD.

Every time I've come in so far there's someone already at the counter telling the girls their life story (regulars I'm guessing)

As for the chai latte it's delicious. I usually get it with a couple pumps of coconut to sweeten it up. I've also had the dirty chai by accident and it was delicious as well. I like how they give you your drink without a top so you can add in whatever you would like at the counter. (Simple syrup, sugar, cinnamon, etc) I do however wish the counter top was bigger or in a different area. I find myself waiting for people to add their fixings.. doing taste tests.. adding more fixings *rolls eyes extra hard* I got places to go customer people! 


Price wise expect to pay $5-$7 for a drink.


And did I mention that I had the BEST donut I've ever had from here! Almond sea salt caramel I think it's called  delicious!"
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2020-02-21,4.0,Grab a bagel across the street and head over here for a espresso or cappuccino. Matcha and turmeric lattes also great.  Nice laid back little spot
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-02-22,4.0,"Not the best coffee but in a super convenient location. Couldn't find many other good coffee choices around the area that weren't Dunkin or Starbucks. Coffee was a little burnt for me but they didn't charge extra for almond milk, which I always appreciate. For those taking it to go, the cups are solid and don't leak or randomly open up.

There's a nice little work area at the front of the store and ambiance is great for studying since it's not on a major road."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-09-25,4.0,Not a bad place to study or get some work done near Penn Station. No AC or bathroom FYI but not an issue if you just need a place for to focus with WiFi for an hour or so. Good coffee too!
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2020-02-04,4.0,Great espresso and delicious blueberry bread! Actually a decent amount of space to sit and work if that's your thing. Downsides: expensive and loud environment.
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2020-01-29,2.0,"MadMan indeed! $5.75 for a medium Drip Coffee?! 'Scuse me?! Not a Latte, not a cappuccino- a DRIP coffee! This is not a fancy sit down restaurant mind you, this is a coffee shop. Not to mention that the coffee was mediocre at best. I never mind the reviewers that complain about the price but this really felt like a rip-off! Go to Gregory's or Starbucks instead."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2020-01-06,4.0,This coffee spot has a good location and nice atmosphere . The service is pretty fast. My large cappuccino was cool. I liked their donuts. Tasty and fresh. The staff was very friendly.  As for my opinion a bit pricey but still recommend! Thanks.
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-08-13,4.0,Found this place on yelp and stopped by. Coffee was pretty good. Ice is extra like if you want ice water.

But I am not sure about it.
Nice small Coffee bar 
Coffee is ok to good nothing to rave about. 
I have order double espresso and banana chocolate loft.
The problem is that no matter if it is just you on line or more it takes for ever to order and to get it.
I was there more then ones and nothing change."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-04-08,4.0,"A pretty cool coffee shop hidden in the mist of Manhattan. I got the Chai Latte here which is phenomenal along with a chocolate croissant. The latte is made and served pretty darn fast too. Good shop if you're on the go. The space itself is pretty small and limited in seating, but it's a nice spot to get some work done."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-02-04,4.0,"Bumping up to 4 stars out of sheer appreciation for the serve-yourself milk & sweetener options. My go-to order is the cold brew, no ice in the cold months, with a splash of oat milk and drizzle of agave. At $3 for the smaller size, it's reasonably priced compared to other nice coffee shops in the neighborhood. The baristas are all super nice (and mostly women!), and there's usually plenty of seating in the morning and late afternoon. I usually order through the Ritual app, so I can do a quick grab n go, but it's nice that there's space to sit and chill."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2018-07-21,2.0,"I was annoyed by the ""barista"" who just took my order. I asked her if she could make a London Fog latte. She purses her lips and nodded with her eyebrows raised as if my question was stupid. First off, it wasn't on the menu so it wasn't unreasonable for me to ask. Second, there was no one in the shop except 1 guy whom already had his drink so what was up with the impatience?

When she gave me my drink, she gave me a regular latte. I told her I ordered a London Fog Latte to which she repeated my order slowly and proceeded to ask me what that was. I had to explained how it was made. I would have given this place 1 star for customer service but she did replace my order with the correct thing. 

I didn't stay in the shop to enjoy my drink as planned because her unfriendly vibe was not what I needed to start my weekend morning."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-02-27,5.0,"Excellent espresso coffee right near penn station. This place has been my go to for years! I also recommend the spinach pastries and vegetable quiches, which sometimes sell out by lunch, but if you're lucky you can nab one in the afternoon. Failing that, there are plenty of sweets to accompany your drink, including some gluten free. There's room to sit, but no restrooms unfortunately. Still, there's always penn station for that if you're desperate!"
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-09-30,1.0,"Worst customer service ever, the lady behind the counter doesnt know how to open her mouth and speak or say thank you and the coffee is pretty bad too. For $5.50 for a small latte that was extremely watered down... No thank you!"
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2018-07-20,2.0,"Ordered the matcha latte with oat milk and it came sweetened even though I never asked for added sugar. 

A pet peeve of mine is ordering a drink and tasting it to find out they've added sugar. So disappointing because it would have tasted great. Now I'm out $5.75 ... kind of crazy that a place would let customers spend money to not get what they ordered."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-01-05,2.0,"Too be very honest, not impressed. Very overpriced. Didn't even serve us in real glasses even though I told her we were staying in. She also didn't really seem to understand me. Also didn't know if a muffin was apple or what flavor it was. Skip this place."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2018-07-17,5.0,"They do a terrific job. Quick easy checkout. Great coffee.  Truvia.  Friendly staff. 

Good pricing. 

I wish every coffee house did the job this well. 

Not sure why people wait half an hour for Starbucks. 

I must be missing something."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2018-08-05,4.0,"Came in around noon on a Sunday, pleasantly surprised that the place wasn't packed. They have a couple of tables for casual conversation or work spaces.

Friendly barista, quick service. Ordered a small chai latte, in retrospect ordering a large cup would've been a better bang for the buck, but the drink was tasty nonetheless. Strong cinnamon flavor in the chai, which was a nice touch.

Swung by this place because it's close to Penn Station and was looking for a local coffee shop (tired of seeing Starbucks around every corner). Definitely will come again next time I visit the city!"
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-10-09,4.0,"Excellent cold brew. Friendly service 
 crowded and clean. I will be coming back.

My second time here excellent service. excellent Coffee"
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2018-11-12,1.0,"good coffee but unfortunately I will not be returning. I have been coming here for months ordering the same coffee for $4.50... one day I come in and all of a sudden it is $5 - I asked about the price going up and their reply was ""new price for this drink as of today"". I told them they should update the board and they said they will... hey, prices go up, I get it, that's OK. 

what is NOT okay is raising the price on select customers. I know this was done as I came in one time to someone who has never helped me and the price was $4.50 again hmm.. I came in again the next day to the person who usually helps me and it was once again $5. I had a coworker go in today and they got the same exact coffee I always get for guess how much? $4.50!! the $4.50 price was also never changed on the board (it's CHALK! c'mon) so I know in the end I was just getting shafted here. 

You must be a MADMAN to do this to your loyal customers, this espresso is not worth the stresso."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-09-04,4.0,"First day, amazing flat white, deep coffee flavors from a well made espresso shot and milk perfectly emulsified. Second day, poorly made flat white that was more like a Luke warm drip coffee with milk that had not been properly steamed. the potential is there."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2018-12-28,4.0,Walked from our hotel to this cute little coffee shop this morning. It had a great vibe and service was quick and efficient. The coffee was fabulous and we highly recommend giving this place a try if you love great coffee.
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-08-29,4.0,Great spot right down the street from Starbucks (which you should walk right past and come here!). Had a great iced latte....the staff is lovely and the baked goods looked fresh and delicious.

639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-02-02,3.0,"I had a very nice flat white in a proper cup when I said it was 'for here'. Nice area to hang out in.

Since it is on a side street, it is a bit more chill than a shop in an avenue.

They only do espresso-based drinks, no drip or pour overs. I am always a bit disappointed when a coffee shop has only one coffee bean, no choices for personal preferences."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-02-16,5.0,"Pleasent staff was kind and accomadating. Ordered a large cappuccino and the caramelisa orginial coffee. Coffee was the perfect temp, just hot enough but not so much that it would burn your tounge. Flavor was delicious, not overly sweet, and super smooth. This coffee house is a hidden 
gem of NYC."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2019-08-07,1.0,"Place is going down the drain. Today I got a cappuccino. The guy added a ton of sugar. The person before me stopped him from doing the same to his coffee. I should have paid attention :(

The staff is chatting amongst themselves, not paying attention to customers. I could go back and complain about the sugar but there are way too many coffee places in Manhattan to bother doing that."
639,madman-espresso-new-york-4,2017-11-09,4.0,"Manhattan seems to be a place where you cannot throw a stick without hitting a cafe (and then have said stick bounce off the window and hit another cafe before resting in front of a $1 Pizza joint).  However, there are certain odd zones here and there where they are not quite as plentiful and the way from Penn Station to the Javitz Center is one of them.

I went to Madman during New York Comic-Con since it was one of the few places to get a good Dirty Chai in the area.  Madman is not huge, but it feels comfortable.  There are some tables but mostly the crowd I saw took their purchases to go (as I did).  The baristas were nice both times I went (it was two different people) and I appreciated the speed at which they assembled my drink.  Kudos for quick service.

One day I had my Chai hot, the next cold.  Both times I enjoyed it but I think I got more of a spicy flavor from the hot version.  I found the Chai leaned a bit towards the sweet side, but that's ok.  At least I could taste the spices.  They do not fresh brew it, I'm pretty sure it comes from a premade box but they balanced the amount right with the milk and espresso shots and that's what matters."

640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2020-01-01,2.0,"Stopped by while needing to kill some time at the DMV during a 3 hour wait time (which hilariously has the balls to boast a ""people love us on Yelp"" sticker). 

I decided to order an iced cappuccino and was then asked what type of milk I'd like. I asked what types they had and was told whole milk, skim milk, and they can 'make' 2% (but not 1%). Okay, I asked for the 2%.

I then saw the cashier, who seemed to be training, pour indiscriminate  amounts of whole milk and skim milk into the milk frother and overhearing (""next time you should fill those to 'here'"" or something to that extent). No adjustment/correction made to my current batch though.

The drink itself never quite mixed well (even after substantial stirring), yielding either sips of either espresso or 'mystery milk.'

Maybe it was an off-day, but a pretty disappointing experience...especially when trying to seek a temporary escape from the joys of a DMV license renewal trip."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-12-26,4.0,"It can get pretty crowded in here, but usually I don't have a problem finding at least a spot for 2 people. Coffee is priced pretty on par with your typical bougie coffee place, they also sell nice teas though and their pastries are good as well! I got a cranberry scone once and was very pleasantly surprised (I think they order their pastries from some bakery). 

I usually will get a flat white, it's always made pretty well but also not the most memorable/best I've had. With high ceilings and a spacious interior, there's a good amount of people here doing work. The chairs aren't that comfortable so not really a read & sip coffee type of place.

Worth checking out!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2020-03-10,2.0,"Very cute and cozy place, but they made my latte with whole milk, even though I very clearly said ""almond milk."" These basic mistakes must avoided because you never know who is intolerant or reactive to what! Please be careful, King's Street staff! I was there for a business meeting, so I chose to not make a big thing out of it and just chucked it as soon as I realized what it was."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-06-27,5.0,"Allll the milk options--oat, regular, 2% and EVEN unsweetened almond milk which is almost never the case. The shop has all of the coffee offerings as well, and light food such as granola parfaits, Chia pudding, and some breakfast sandwiches. 


Inside was spacious and clean, and looked like a good place to do work. I look forward to coming back; their cold brew was great!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2020-03-19,3.0,Very sterile room. Didn't love the vibes of the coffee. All of the food is pre made. I felt like I was in a three star German hotel. Workers were friendly but apathetic and it took a long time to get my coffee. I would skip next time.
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-12-23,5.0,"This is one of my favorite places to study at! Not only is the coffee great, with a spectrum of dairy and nondairy options, but the atmosphere is also perfect to crank work out in. Free WIFI, ample SPACE (two large tables and another table against the wall with OUTLETS underneath), and a BATHROOM, what more could a student ask for? 

The music is always light and never distracting. This might just be me, but the decor makes studying less stressful, with its neutral wooden minimalistic design and array of houseplants. The workers are all very friendly and don't seem to mind when I camp out for hours. 

It's also tucked into the streets of Koreatown, so when you end up getting hungry, you have a great many options for food!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-10-08,5.0,"Big fan of this place... my usual coffee stop before work. Cozy coffee shop that can be great to get some work done in. They have small bites that are good such as avo toast. Friendly staff and good coffee- they also have some great unique pastries as well. Over all great place to grab some java or tea. 

One thing also worth noting is they have a rewards card, every 10 drinks the 11th is free!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-04-12,5.0,"Cute little coffee shop - perfect to stop in on the way to work. 

My favorite thing about this place this their milk/milk alternative options. I ordered oat milk with my latte since I'm not a fan of soy and some places don't carry unsweetened almond milk (not sure if they do or not). Service was relatively fast for a specialty drink. 

They have a variety of pastries and coffee to purchase, as well as long tables for seating."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2020-02-22,5.0,This coffee shop had delicious coffee and gourmet toast!!! The atmosphere is spacious and enough tables to do stuff. Friendly workers and a beautiful setting.
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2018-12-07,4.0,"This is a lovely addition to an otherwise unremarkable block. Apparently this shop had been here for about a year. I really love how this area has changed significantly, adding more trendy restaurants, bars and cafes. 

You should definitely stop by this coffee shop when in this area. Plenty of seating, nice selection of baked goods, and a pretty thorough menu of coffee and teas. Try the Avocado egg sandwich as well."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-12-06,5.0,"Cool spot, came in for two lattes to go, they were made very well. Well, they did forget to make my second latte but they were super apologetic after I asked them about it. The space looked nice to sit in and it wasn't too crowded on a weekday mid-morning."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-03-06,5.0,"Awesome spot! I've been here a few times in the mornings, so it's never crowded. The cafe is spacious and clean. Cute interior. I've ordered the almond matcha latte and avocado smash. Delish! I've also tried their avocado egg salad sandwich, which was pretty good as well. I have yet to try their coffee or baked goods, but I recommend trying this place out!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2020-03-05,5.0,"Great coffee, hip style and location, and really nice staff. Definitely check out their Avocado Smash toast and Flat Whites."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-08-18,4.0,"Happened to stumble upon this place and it has become my go to place whenever i need a place to study/do some work. The workers are so nice and the teas are so fragrant, unique, and strong. Their food is very reasonably priced and i was so happy with the avocado toast! There's a bunch of outlets by the bar and pretty steady wifi, and there hasn't been too many people whenever i go."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-11-29,4.0,"Wonderful place! I came in for some place to read and a good latte and it was perfect. The barista was helpful and informative. I got a latte with a little bit of mocha in it (they make their own mocha from scratch!) and a danish and both were delicious. 
The place isn't cozy at all but it's elegant. Clean design and lots of plants. I love their wooden finishing everywhere. All in all would visit again!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-11-26,5.0,"The best place for a lunch break! Everyone is so kind and the atmosphere is relaxing. When I go I usually get the avocado smash, which is delicious. The sweet potato salad is great as well. 

Also the ginger lemon tea is soothing and delicious! 

Pro tip: If you're getting a tea to stay, ask them to put it in a to-go cup and refill the water before you leave"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2018-12-28,4.0,"The clean, somewhat minimalist decor is a lovely contrast with the crowded, messy street outside, and the soothing music really turns this spot into an oasis in the crazy city that is New York. Expect a simple menu of coffee shop essentials such as drinks and pastries. The brevity of options means the staff know their craft well, and they present drinks that are attractive and well crafted. Rather than a dessert drink, the mocha is low in sugar and high on espresso, giving a stable charge of energy that lasts. The pastry selection was limited to three varieties on my visit, but all well crafted and nicely textured. An extra shot of friendliness would really round this shop out, bringing it to the coveted 5 star level."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2020-01-30,4.0,"Decent amount of seating and tons of outlets along the counter seating. Pricing is pretty normal, 4.36 for a small Iced Latte. Dark tone decor with plants. They also have a clean bathroom. Latte was pretty good. The espresso didn't have a very strong/robust flavor though."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-05-09,4.0,"O V E R A L L
It's a nice spot to work. They have a bar area and a couple of long, community, wood tables. The internet is ok. The coffee is good. I got an Americano.

Nothing to write home about, but it is a solid place to work. Especially if you sit at the bar, it feels a little removed from the business of the city.

Seems like they're missing a little bit of the vibe piece the farther back you walk in the store. Just seems plain, which could be what they were going for anyway. :)"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-05-12,5.0,"King's Street Coffee has never let me down. Minimalistic and spacious, the relaxed vibe of this place makes it very enjoyable to study. It does, however, get rather busy during lunch time on the weekdays. It becomes a place for people to grab a quick coffee and chat. When evening comes, it quiets down and it's easier to study. 

It has become my new favorite spot. I love their chocolate cookies and their fresh meals. All the avocado options are tasty!

My only thing is that when I ask for light ice they don't actually do that. And they do that CONSISTENTLY as well, haha.

But all in all, I love this place and I plan on coming back!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2018-07-28,5.0,"I found King's by accident while rushing to Penn Station.  Great find as they serve and sell bags a of Joe's Coffee.  

If you haven't yet tried Joe's Coffee on 13th between Broadway and 5th or any other other locations and call yourself a coffee aficionado, you need to try Joe's Waverly bean which you can do at King's Street.

Contemporary, clean, and friendly."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-11-09,5.0,"Great selection of coffee and tea with alternative milk options, with wifi and table and counter space to stay and work."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-08-19,5.0,"Love love love this place! This is one of my favorite cafes in the city to come to get some work done. The atmosphere is super chill; there's ample seating, free wifi, and the food and drinks are delicious. My go-to is a vanilla iced oat milk latte and it never disappoints. The staff is very warm and friendly, too!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-10-20,5.0,Best coffee in the hood with the friendliest staff and owner. And they play jazz! I wish they had more of a pastry selection but what they do have is good.
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2020-02-11,5.0,"Spacious, clean, with kind and friendly baristas, King's Street makes for a perfect daytime hangout spot. The lighting is nice and homey, as the space is open and decorated with plants. Good music choice on the day I went too."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-09-21,5.0,"Delicious coffee and what appears to be a pleasant atmosphere inside, although I wasn't able to stay. There were communal tables and it looked like a decent place to work. I liked that they had half-and-half available. The price ($3.00 for a 12 oz. hot drip coffee) was reasonable for the area--more than 7/11 or McDonald's charges, but less than Stumptown."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-02-02,5.0,"I often find it very hard to find good coffee in midtown that's reasonably priced and not awful. Kings Coffee nails it. Great coffee, fast service, BEAUTIFUL building, and great music playlist. Will be going back whether it's to or from work."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2018-03-31,5.0,"Update guys: This place has all the milks/non-dairy milks/creamers you could ever want and more. Wrote a review a few weeks back about how the coffee was sensational but was disappointed by the fact that they didn't have any unsweetened almond milk. Waltz in last week for my morning coffee and voila, unsweetened almond milk, a beautiful thing. Additionally, they have a whole cooler section of all sorts of creamers and milks, the biggest selection of additions I've seen at any other coffee shop. The coffee has been consistent each time I come in and their baked goods section always looks incredibly tempting. The place is airy, modern, clean and as mentioned before, the perfect place to post up with your laptop and get some work done. Bathroom is always clean when I'm there, staff is nice, it's my go to place!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2018-06-10,3.0,"A cool little cafe with heaps of tables , would be a nice place to hang out with your friends over some drinks.

I got a iced coffee/ latte to go. Staff was friendly and service was quick. But the coffee was disappointing. Maybe there was too much milk or something.

But i will be back if I need a place to chill or hang out !"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2018-05-20,5.0,"5 years ago you wouldn't have expected such good quality near Penn but times have changed! Came here on a snowy day in March (technically Spring) and had ordered a latte which honestly was one of the best I've ever had and I've been all over on both coasts. They young barista was really enthusiastic about the coffee and the shop. 

It has lots of seating, solid wi-fi, a clean bathroom, and very calming music to help you work and or study. Hope to see this place thrive!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2017-11-14,5.0,"It's a lovely addition to the hectic midtown area where there's always construction.

I LOVE the interior with high ceiling and chic/modern light bulbs/chandelier. The cozy feel created by sleek wood design makes King's Street Coffee an ideal cafe for cranking out emails (fast wifi is a huge perk)/reading/catching up with a friend. PLUS, the pastries here are from ChikaLicious, so you don't have to go all the way there for their famous desserts. 

My friends and I got the matcha latte and chai latte, and both were great! Not too sweet, with perfect amount of foam. Everything just feels very high quality. 

It's a very new business, so make sure to stop by before it becomes the hottest new cafe around ktown!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-06-10,5.0,"This is my new go-to study spot. They have great coffee and matcha latte(!). The staffs are very friendly, and the place is spacious and clean. It is a great place if you're looking for somewhere quiet for an afternoon read."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2018-02-25,5.0,"OVERALL GREAT: I have been looking for a nice cafe nearby and I finally found it! This cafe has everything I want - quite and cozy environment, location, wifi and good coffee. 

ENVIRONMENT: inside is very spacious and there are outlets and good wifi connections for those who want to study. It was also quite enough for me to concentrate. The tables are long wooden tables and are shared by 6 people. The restroom is clean. 

COFFEE: I liked the soy latte here. I don't really like bitter taste and this one has more milk in it. I haven't tried the other drinks but I'm sure they are good too. My friend had a tea and she liked it."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2017-12-07,4.0,"Immediately I noticed music was quite different here. 
Classical was refreshing. It was perfect and soothing as I stopped by to read and write in my journal .
I had rooibos tea. It was good. Had just the right amount of scent and taste. And water temperature was not scolding burning inside of your mouth hot. It was good kind of hot .
I wish for more caffine-free tea selection ."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2018-04-07,4.0,"Nice almond matcha latte! Plenty of work spaces, free WiFi, and clean bathroom, it doesn't get much better than that! Ladies, this place is super close to 260 sample sale and Nordstrom Rack!"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-07-01,4.0,Small and quiet coffee shop in Chelsea. Had the avocado smash and a vanilla latte. The avocado smash was yummy although a little salty (don't sprinkle the salt it comes with or you'll be sorry). My boyfriend had the ham sandwich with the boiled eggs and a vanilla latte as well. Clean store with an even cleaner bathroom!
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-11-16,1.0,"Service was awful, little kid behind the counter couldn't even make the effort to say good morning and thank you. Hard professional service is hard to come by. Coffee wasn't anything special, mediocre quality very nutty, but there's worst out there. Pastries were good but sadly they dont make them, they were in a box on the counter with another bakery's logo on it...probably selling at triple the cost...I don't blame them. Really a nothing burger here for W30th...definitely worth walking a block extra and actually get a good product and a better service. Wouldn't recommend scouting for it, or make a trip for it, unless really walking by it I'd get my coffee elsewhere."
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2018-12-14,4.0,"I decided to give 4 stars cause the standards here are high. cakes are very tasty, sandwiches are really nice and coffee is a bit sour-ish but that's a matter of taste, other than that the coffee is fresh, espresso and cappuccino are made well, ambiance is calm and relaxed.
RECOMMENDED"
640,kings-street-coffee-new-york,2019-05-07,5.0,"Truly lovely service and the coffee is the best within a 5 mile radius.  They offer a large variety of diary free milks and make all types of drinks including cortado's,Au Lait and Chai.  They use only the best brands and some are organic.  The tea variety is also very good.  Food menu is limited but good options for a tasty and healthy meal.  My favorite spot for my must have morning latte."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2020-02-28,4.0,"First time here and it will definitely be my regular spot to grab coffee and/or to study. It's a huge space with many communal tables and outlets with fast wifi. It's relatively quiet and music isn't so loud which I greatly appreciate. 

Service is quick and friendly. Prices are definitely a little more expensive than other areas in the city, but it's good! I enjoyed my caramel latte and the cashier was extremely helpful.

The only downside to this place are the uncomfortable stools that will make your butt hurt after an hour."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2020-02-29,2.0,"Staff is friendly and nice, and ambiance is spacious and quiet. I ordered the iced honey latte which tasted like an overpriced regular iced latte; extremely dull in flavor and had no hint of honey. Don't order it. 

Yelp and their front/side doors state that Bean & Bean closes at 10PM, but they kicked everyone out at 9PM. They should update their times and not trick customers. Food looks mediocre too, go to any cafe in Koreatown instead."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2020-02-16,4.0,"My favorite thing to get that may seem basic to others is a chai tea and bagel with cream cheese. Sometimes the simple things go a long way. It was my first time at this location. My church has just moved into the area so I wanted to visit a few of the cafes that are around the area. I like to have a moment to myself and God before I go to church. I lead the social media group there so often I need that time to center myself before all the moving around I do. 

I stopped at this Bean & Bean that was right across from where we are located. The staff was super friendly and flexible when I changed my order. They were patient when I ask for pricing and their experience with some of the pastries. 

The decor was true coffee shop styling.  The area I sat  in was by the window which I love. I like to stare out the window often when I'm somewhere else. There was a lady talking very loudly at my table so it was a bit distracting when I was reading. I try to remember you don't have control of things like that. I just she wasn't that loud in an open space like that. 

I got a cinnamon toasted bagel with cream cheese and a chai tea with steamed almond milk. They gave me all the options of milk I wanted. I appreciated that I also had the option of steamed or regular milk. It was really good and had a little spice which I love. Some chai teas are too strong for me, so I was happy this wasn't the case. For my bagel I had to put the cream cheese on myself, which is fine because sometimes they put too little. 

Overall it was a good visit. I would probably visit a little earlier so I can avoid foot traffic and noise."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-05-12,4.0,"Great spot for doing some laptop work here, strong wifi connection and decent seating arrangements. Huge space with many communal tables and chairs. 

Service is quick & friendly. Menu is pretty extensive for both drinks and snacks. Would definitely come back!"
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-02-26,4.0,"I like this place.  Coffees are just a little more expensive around $3 for a small maybe.   

The space is very big for Manhattan and has a cool industrial feel.   There are huge tables that allows you to have plenty of room to work.  I can even draw here on big paper.  

The place is overall a little dark - which I prefer - but the two walls are all windows so it gets enough light you can work. 

Lots of business conversations, people on laptops, students and a few quirky characters from the surrounding Chelsea neighborhood to make it fun. 

The coffee bar feels a little pretentious with special features such as a fountain to warm cups up before coffee is poured in and just about every coffee accoutrement such as oat milk. 

The place isn't in an obvious place and doesn't have a lot of signage and that keeps it from being very touristy - another perk."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-01-14,4.0,"I was excited to try a new coffee shop with my friend last night. We found this place on Yelp (obviously) and decided to meet here based on recommendations.

Bean & Bean, doesn't have a big parking lot but there was ample street parking. The coffee shop itself is modern, chic, and clean. There are mostly tables and bar tops. Great for working! We managed to snag comfy armchairs. 

The baristas were super friendly and seemed to enjoy working there. The drink selection is typical of a cafe, with prices similar to Starbucks but not as large of a menu. I'm sure they'd be happy to create a special drink for you though. One perk, which many coffee shops do not have, is you can also order wine! I went with a mocha cappuccino with almond milk and my friend went with rose.

Bean & Bean also has a snack menu: cookies, croissants, danishes, and avocado toast (how millennial, haha). 

I'll definitely be back soon!"
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2020-02-01,5.0,"Excellent coffee shop that is spacious, good coffee and lots of outlets and tables to use computers and wifi although wifi may be in and out. Staff are really friendly and nice. Believe or not, it's hard to find a place that you can quietly sit down and work for a few hours but this is oneof the rare ones. Coffee is okay but ambience and the space make up for it."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-05-28,2.0,"Unkempt (garbage sitting on our table for the duration of the time spent there), uncomfortable (stools) and underwhelming (my iced tea). I cannot rave about this place as other Yelp reviewers.

Walked in around 6 p.m. and there was no available seating until I spotted two stools at the communal table.  Garbage from previous patrons (shame on you) sat on the table which was annoying. But it also indicated the lack of frequency from the workers  in tidying up for the next person.

We ordered a hot Jasmine tea (one size) and a 24 ounce iced Serendipity tea which was supposed to be an herbal combination but didn't taste like much. 

$8.17 and a couple hours later, I left disappointed.
I'll stick to Starbucks---much better atmosphere and beverages."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2020-02-16,4.0,Cute industrial coffee spot in Chelsea. Latte was great and the barista was adorable.
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-01-20,4.0,"Coffee shops aren't just for drinking coffee. They're a place for friends to gather, for people to work, a place to relax.

Bean & Bean is amazing because of how spacious it is. There is so much room because the tables and seats aren't squished together like most cafes. My friends and I came after trying two other coffee shops, and we finally found space here. And the drinks and food are pretty good as well!"
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2020-03-08,5.0,Great place to do work. You can buy one thing and sit there all day working. The regular coffee is the cheapest item. They won't kick you out. Just don't bring any outside food cause that's when they get mad. Even if you're a customer who comes there everyday and no one else is in the store at 7am they will still make you leave to eat your food. But yeah but something and stay there all day. They love that.
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-03-07,3.0,"Came here once and never again. I ordered the matcha latte with almond milk for $5.44. After reading the positive reviews, I expected better. The matcha has no flavor, although the almond milk they use is the Califia Farms (Barista Blend), which is pretty tasty and caragenaan-free. The barista didn't even bother doing any latte art. She simply dumped the frothed milk and matcha altogether in 3 seconds. Money not-so-well spent."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2020-02-26,5.0,"My boss and I get our coffee from Bean & Bean every morning and I have to say, with a staff as kind as this one, I would buy anything here.
The espresso is delicious and they are more than willing to make any kind of odd request"
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-09-06,1.0,Said I would have to pay more for an extra cream cheese but what they give you doesn't even fill a full bagel. Ridiculous!!
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2018-10-20,4.0,"Bean & Bean is a huge cafe conveniently located in Chelsea by Penn and FIT. There are bathrooms, free WiFi, long tables and short tables, and low melodic music playing, making it a great place to read or study. It's a casual environment, so good for having a quick meeting, but not the ideal place to congregate with friends over, say, brunch. I do think they could stand to add some more tables; they certainly have the open space for it. 

They have a solid food menu that's sure to provide options for all sorts of eaters, ranging from avocado toast to yogurt to oatmeal. Their coffee is great; it's so strong, yet smooth and not bitter. They serve it extra hot, so be careful! I love that they provided soy milk out for people, but they do keep the almond milk by the counter with the servers. Their prices are a tad pricier than other cafes ($2.50 for a small black cup versus the usual $2). Food is pricier, too. But if you're looking for a spacious cafe to work in for a while, it could be worth it. 

Fast and friendly service from what I could tell  after the brief interaction I had with the barista."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2020-01-21,2.0,"The cashier was absolutely rude to the customer. Every time my friend and I walked in and grab a coffee before we go to work, she always ask ""are you going to eat here? Our policy is no outside food"" Because she see we carry a take out paper bag(we bought breakfast to office). That's very annoying. I won't go to this place anymore."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2018-11-18,5.0,"Great food first of all and decent coffee (first of all it's cafe, not a coworking space). Sandwiches are crispy and have fresh vegetables and delicious meat - many vegan options, btw - I find avocado toast dope as well. Coffee is average, IMO (if you're a huge fan of dark roasts like me - you would fine it the same), but great list of coffee-based beverages - cortado, for instance. Chai and teas are quite decent as well.

Speaking of environment - it's quite chill, straight-focused on MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS place, which I find great. Nice spot to have a short bite with a drink and then take a few hours of studies/freelance/whatever laptop-headphones-grumpy face stuff :)"
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2018-12-22,5.0,Great coffee shop that i stumbled upon while searching for bagels. The ambiance is calm and relaxing and the coffee was STRONG and delicious!! They can also accommodate to your different milk preferences as well.
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-05-01,3.0,"The place has some very nice seating and lots of outlets. The windows let in a lot of light which is lovely for the the overall mood and atmosphere, perhaps not for your computer screen however. My main issue is that I came here to work and the wifi doesn't work. The coffee is alright, but the pastries aren't really worth the price.  They do have bathrooms available. but, the downer is really the wifi not working. Because really, what was the point in my coming here now. 

I got an almond croissant and an americano."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2017-10-09,3.0,"Cold brew tasted like a super dark roast without any sweet or fruity subtle notes.  Kinda harsh like starbucks. The coffee only tasted drinkable with some half and half. On its own, it's not bitter but it didn't go down easy.


When coffee was ready they didn't bother calling out the order so drinks just sat at the corner."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-11-17,5.0,"Great place for use your laptop and doing some work! They have a good menu tho, and coffee and cappuccino is really good....it's going to be my favorite place to study."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2018-01-28,4.0,"B&B is a spacious caffeine stop with free wifi. Drinks are decent, on the upper end of the spectrum, but I'm not really a caffeine snob. The best part is there are many tables that you can sit and work at, and because the space is so large, it doesn't seem as noisy.

Ordered:
Matcha latte - pretty good, they use vanilla, well foamed, not too bitter."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2017-11-25,5.0,"Good place to study paired with good coffee! I love finding ample study space and outlets in New York coffee shops because its not easy to come by! 

I had the ice honey latte and the cold brew. The honey latte was the perfect amount of sweet and the cold brew was very strong. They had good looking pastries for when you need a snack during your studies as well!

My favorite part was the large tables, large windows, and an outlet at every corner. Almost everyone has a laptop out and sitting together to study. The noise level isn't bad either! However, their seats were just a bit uncomfortable because it was either wobbly or worn down. Other than that, great place to come by!"

Service is friendly and quick and the matcha latte was excellent and very potent. The barista offered to customize the level of sweetness which was nice. They are a bustling spot, but seem to have plenty of seating in an open large space. The only downside is it is more industrial than cozy."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2017-05-06,4.0,"I frequent Bean & Bean because of three very important reasons.
1.) FREE WIFI 
2.) Matcha Latte
3.) Ample seating 

This cafe is perfect for sitting down and getting your work done. For the most part it's clean, unless the ignorant person before you decides to leave their rubbish on the table. 

I'm not a coffee drinker so I'm always super excited when I find a cafe with matcha latte. Unfortunately the matcha latte here is just whatever. It's what I usually get but it's nothing special. You can barely taste the matcha. Some days depending on the barista, they'll ask if you want it sweetened. Don't get it sweetened. I believe they just add castor sugar. That's what it surely tasted like. Opt for almond milk, unsweetened if you must. 

Also, the hours on Yelp is wrong. Saturday they definitely close at 9 PM. At 8:45 the barista came around to all customers to let everyone know they were closing in the 15 minutes.

Note this isn't a cafe for those who want something quiet. If you want a quiet area to get work done, I suggest a library or maybe some ear plugs.



(Side note: today someone asked me to turn my music down ""just a bit."" My volume was at 40%. I have apple earphones. This lady, was arm length away from me. I was listening to So Sick by NEYO. Who doesn't like NEYO??? She was REALLY trying to listen to my music and ruin my mood. It didn't work.)"
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-01-18,1.0,"What I'm about to wright about got Starbucks in much scrutiny.  I asked the nice, tall, female barista nicely about 12:25PM what the code is for the restroom.  She said that ""I have to be a customer to use the bathroom."" I was planning to buy something after I used the bathroom.  Nature was calling.   Does she really expect for me to bring my coffee, or whatever I decide to purchase, into the restroom with me??!  Really?! 

This whole bathroom thing all over New York City and other major cites is just a way for companies, private and public corporations to squeeze revenue from people.  It is a practice that has got to stop!!"
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2017-04-29,5.0,"This should be featured on a ""places to study in NYC"" search/blog. I've been looking for a coffee shop/ space to do some studying and couldn't find one in my Google search, with the exception of some libraries and hotel lobby bars. (Yep, those came up in the search).

It was a lovely day and I'd carried my study material hoping to stumble on a good place to catch some studying post seminar and that's exactly what happened. I was walking from Times Square and walked past Bean & Bean and just happened to glance in. I saw what appeared to be a studious bunch with coffee cups and laptops side by side. So I literally stopped in my tracks and moonwalked right in. I ordered a multigrain berry muffin which was just OK, a little too dense for my liking. Also ordered an iced cappuccino, which was good and reminded me of a Greek frappe. 

As far as the space, it's an open layout, spacious, concrete walls and wooden tables with ample, diverse seating arrangements. Decent, just loud enough music and some nice tunes (Snow Patrol, M.I.A, etc) and tons of charging outlets. The patrons here seem to all be on the same page--laptops, study materials, and periodic refills of coffee and snacks. There is also avo toast (of course there is) for the larger cravings and other delectable pastries/croissants, organic coffees and teas.

A few do come to chat, but the noise level remains modest. I was able to knock out a decent chunk of studying. I'll be back soon."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-07-01,5.0,This place holds a special spot in my heart! It's where I host a monthly book club with friends and strangers who become friends alike. It's where my fiancé and I went on our first date. I love their matcha lattes and little pastry treats. Always very nice and welcoming. It's like a second home. I especially love quiet mornings there.
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2019-01-24,4.0,"Major starbucks drinker and have tried many of the new boutique coffee shops around town, but have generally been disappointed - except today at this place.

Tried their daily large coffee and it was actually better than my usual pike and the only complaint is that they need to offer an XL (similar size to starbucks venti) because their large cups were too small for venti drinkers like ourselves."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2018-10-02,5.0,"Came here twice & I was really impressed both times. It's really clean, huge & not overcrowded or loud so it's the perfect location to get work done or even have meetings. The employees are really friendly & really good about refilling the milk/sugar on the side. Great coffee shop !"
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2018-09-22,2.0,"Does it mean that I don't have a sophisticated palate if I say I don't like this place? Probably... The coffees and teas are never the right kind of sweet, even with the all-you-can-pump simple syrup. This place makes me feel like a philistine for wanting caramel syrup in my coffee. The gluten-free brownie is great but expensive. Gluten-free products usually are super tough, like cardboard, but Bean & Bean's is soft and delicate. I'm pretty sure it's like $4 though. A coffee and a pastry should not be $8-10. I'd rather go to Starbucks, where I can be uncool in peace. 
Also there's never any available seating!
Great bathrooms though."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2017-04-24,3.0,"Bean & Bean has a pretty decent cup of coffee in a very convenient location. The store itself is very large. The staff was very friendly from my albeit minimal interaction with them. I have no complaints about the coffee itself, though it definitely gets crowded in here, so even considering how many seats there are, you might not always be able to get one.

I didn't get food here but saw the oatmeal and granola they were selling at prices far too high for the amount of food you normally get. Come here for drinks, eat elsewhere.

I highly recommend the Kona pour over for those of you who also love strong, black coffee."
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2018-12-16,4.0,"First things first:  good coffee and friendly service. I've had a couple of their pour-overs (most recently one from Tanzania) and found them to be flavorful and complex. The space is great--lots of room and plenty of tables--sit, stand, low tables, high tables, they have a space for you.  Even some comfy armchairs to curl up in. 

Giving it only 4 stars because in the three times that I've been there, the WiFi hasn't worked.  At least one of the networks they identify doesn't even show up and the other one never connects.  That makes the experience less pleasant for me. 

Still love the coffee and the people who work there!"
641,bean-and-bean-new-york-3,2017-09-02,4.0,"It was pouring rain, I was on my Citi Bike and I had to stop somewhere. This place looked welcoming and I needed to finish some work. Welcome to Bean & Bean. A coffee shop where you can do all this and much more! 

I grabbed a soy cappuccino and sat at one of their wooden tables. I was here for another couple of hours. What does that tell you? 

- it's a great coffee shop to work 
- plenty of seating 
- baristas are all easy to talk to 
- cappuccino was well made 

Will I be back? 

Absolutely! 



Also, WiFi is strong. Just like the coffee."

Once seated I had opened my laptop and didn't want to leave it unattended so I called to ask for the WiFi password.

Lily answered and said she wouldn't give me the password.  Said it was only going to be provided if I went to the register.

Really lousy customer service Lily. 

Wouldn't recommend to anyone."

642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2020-02-28,5.0,"I've been working nearby for 20 years and have been to ALL the coffee places within a 10 block radius. Since this place opened, it's been my favorite, not just because of the great coffee but also because the super friendly staff. Today, they were extra nice to me, something I won't forget."
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2020-03-11,4.0,"My first experience was a bummer for sure (see my old review) but I've been back 3 times since to give the place another try and because it's close to my apartment!

My pick: (+) Pistachio cardamom bread loaf -- love how the spices shine through! good alternative to your classic banana bread 

(-/+) Cold brew -- got it twice now and I like it but it isn't necessarily the best ever but still satisfies what I look for!

(+) Staff is super friendly each time 

(-) Still don't recommend anyone go for that purple latte (it truly tasted like milk haha)

(+) stable wifi 

Tip: space isn't huge inside so get here early to claim a seat"
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2019-05-21,4.0,"Cozy cafe with solid coffee! My go-tos are the almond milk latte and the oat milk latte.

My major gripe is the plastic cup for cold lattes. Instead of a plastic cup with a straw, you're given a plastic cup with a lid that you can sip out of. The concept is meant to be eco friendly but I constantly find coffee dripping outside of the lid onto my shirt as it is not as secure as a normal paper cup and lid."
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2020-01-10,5.0,"So I was disappointed to find out they only serve the coffee in ice cream cones during winter months (boo, also was here in August and forgot to review til now, elite fail, whatevs, y'all will still thank me for my recommendation) but the barista was super nice and after I described what kinds of coffee I like, she recommended the mocha coffee, and holy mocho choco deliciousness!  One of the best mocha iced coffees I've ever had, it was absolutely divine.  I'm intrigued now to stop back in for more flavored options, since this one in particular was so flavor forward."

They had some free samples of their baked goods out near the counter, and the baristas are some of the nicest ones out there. They welcomed and thanked everyone that came and left the store, and were super quick and efficient with ordering/making drinks. 

I cannot wait to come back and work on the weekends!"
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2019-12-16,5.0,"Cute little coffee shop with such good coffee. I have tried their latte,cortado and flat white. I love the flavor of their coffee and their banana flax seed bread. This is a very nice space to work, meet people and just hang out."

Not to mention - the staff was incredibly friendly! 

Cannot wait to be back in NYC to stop by my favorite coffee shop."
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2019-11-20,5.0,"Flew into Manhattan looking for someplace to get my caffeine fix after a red-eye flight.  Dropped in here to this small yet spacious coffee shop.  They have a decent amount of seating, especially considering the size of the place.  It was fairly quiet for the most part, but there would be constant rushes of people probably from a recent subway train that had just stopped nearby.  But it would suddenly become quiet again as they all got their caffeine and left.  The workers here are super friendly and everything was great!"
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2019-08-04,4.0,"They ran a Macchiato waffle cone special on Valentine's day which should be permanent.

 The lattes are good, but they don't have any signature or unusual coffees."
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2019-03-13,4.0,"Great place!

Hubby and I was doing an intense amount of walking on our last visit and, with the time zone changes, the red eye flight, and being overall butt-tired, I needed caffeine.  Badly.  Looked at the Yelp app, found this place, and we were (thankfully!) just around the block and could pop in.

We walked in, was immediately greeted with a ""Welcome"" and a smile, and was able to order our drinks after asking a few drinks.  Despite being super-tired, we didn't want to get too caffeinated, so we opted for iced tea instead.  What I like is that they actually brew the tea for a few minutes, and then place it over the ice.  Correctly done!  So, we paid for our order, was asked if we wanted a stamp card (which we declined since we don't live in the area, and unsure on when our next visit would be), and then waited a few minutes until our order was called.

Drinks were great!  No issues with our orders, it was prepared exactly as requested, and it tasted good.  

Employee was awesome!  Very nice, very helpful and accommodating, and was overall a cool guy.  

It's a cute cafe and while there are barstools looking out the window, it's still a small street, so there isn't too much people-watching going on.  Place was relatively clean, and there is a bathroom available (we quickly found out that not all cafes have bathrooms...).  There aren't too many tables, though, and plenty of customers that are studying or working and won't be budging.  

Overall, a quaint cafe and we were happy to make a visit!"
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2018-08-03,3.0,"Typical cafe for coffee. The coffee was pretty good, definitely better than Starbucks. 

The desserts and pastries looked delicious. My friend got the lemon blueberry donut and seemed to enjoy it a lot!"
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2018-12-19,5.0,"Adorable coffee shop. I got the waffle shot- a combo of bitter (coffee) and sweet (chocolate). They also have pastries like croissants, cookies, donuts, etc. The workers were super nice and friendly."
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2019-11-02,4.0,"I've been to Black Press a few times and one thing is for certain, their regular drip coffee is outstanding. I mean, really delicious. I'm a simple coffee drinker, no sugars, syrups, creams or funny business so I know a good cup of coffee when I taste one and this place is the real deal. Not sure if they brew different blends or if they have one signature drip but it's creamy, not bitter, just delicious. For me personally, it's not the place I'd come to spend time in and get work done, it has sort of a cold vibe to me. All of the seating is in the perimeter of the shop and in the center is where people can stand and wait for their drinks along with a few high top tables without seating if you wanted to post up there and enjoy your drink while standing up. It's not cozy and warm, it's more modern and functional if you will. If you're looking for a really solid cup of coffee come here, the staff is a little on the rough side, not the friendliest. A medium coffee is $3.00 even but it seemed more like a small to me."
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2020-01-21,5.0,Excellent soy lattes. Extremely well made with just the right % of blend.
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2018-03-23,5.0,"A nice place to sit down and do work in, limited in seating though. Clean bathroom is a plus! Came and tried their waffle cup macchiato. I think the chocolate from the waffle cup kind of masked the espresso flavor a little bit causing it to taste more sour than bold. They can also do the waffle cup without any coffee and just a shot of milk. I wanted to sit down and get some work done so I ordered a cortado as well because the macchiato is pretty small ($5). Cortados are usually what I get when I'm in the mood for a stronger latte (aka less milk, stronger espresso flavor, or maybe even cappuccino with no foam) this did not disappoint, the espresso flavor in this was pretty strong and bold.

The barista was super nice and worked quickly. I definitely will be back if I'm around the area and craving a good cup of espresso."
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2018-10-24,1.0,"Got the dirty chai and it unfortunately tasted like only milk. Very little chai hardly any espresso.. will be going to another coffee shop immediately after to grab another! 

Also got the chocolate almond croissant which was very mediocre and a bit stale."
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2018-03-16,4.0,"I call myself Coffeeholic, and I really adored their latte. And, look at this adorable latte art

Pro
- not a big fan of columbian beans as they have a sour end to the taste. I still tried it as the barista stated their beans were different. They were bold and yummy!
- cute place to study. Great wifi and very quiet. Most people were studying or doing work
- quick!

Con
- its hard to get a seat :( we waited by the high table for like 10 mins to move to an empty table"
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2018-07-13,5.0,"Points for fresh clean dogwater outside the shop on a summer's day! In fact, a hot doggo was lapping some up when I arrived.

This morning was my first time here. I ordered an iced cold brew and a vegan chocolate chip cookie. Both were very good. The coffee stayed strong through some ice-melting, and I detected no bitterness. The cookie was tasty and fresh with no lack of chips, if not particularly large. (My hips thank you)

Service was friendly and quick. In my pre-caffeinated state I was unable to open the simple syrup bottle, but the barista didn't try to make me feel like the simpleton I was, instead she kindly opened it for me with a smile. :^)

My pre-tip total for the iced cold brew and the cookie was $7.25 so not cheap; but we knew that going in, didn't we? Precious Manhattan cold brew comes at a precious Manhattan price.

A bright clean slick interior; a brick wall. A pleasant and non-distracting backdrop for a superior brew. Let the coffee be the star here, it seems to convey."
642,black-press-coffee-new-york,2019-03-07,3.0,"Last time I was here, I was on crutches. Ordered a mocha. They serve their coffee without a lid on it, to show their coffee art. That's great, but I was in crutches, so I politely asked for a lid. 

The Arista looked at me and looked at the condiment stand and said, ""the lids there"". I showed him my crutches and replied ""I am in crutches, I don't want to spill the coffee all over the floor"". He looked at me for a few seconds and reluctantly handed me a lid that was right in front of him. He must have spent more energy trying to get me out of his face than just handing me the lid to begin with. 

The coffee was not memorable. Service was sub-par. Probably not going back again."

They are so flavorful and not too sweet. I moved but they started shipping macarons (!!) so I ordered 6 of the cassis.

As for the person claiming that they use regular flour instead of almond flour... that's absurd. These are completely gluten free. I have celiac disease so, if these had regular wheat flour in them, I would know because I would have gotten super sick every time I had them."

Con: They were on the dry side (I prefer chewy macarons) but the fillings had good flavor, especially Coconut and Coffee. Instead of buying 4, I got 2 more and a pretty free box. Service was good but after buying my treats I saw there's a Carvel on Level 7! Next time!"

I like macarons and I also make them too. 
Her macarons are seriously dry and taste terrible. 
You have to use Almond flour in order to make macarons but she used a lot of regular flour. I could tasted it immediately. This isn't macaron at all... It's just macaron bread... 

And the macarons were super dry.. Baked them too long.. Also, the fillings tasted just okay. 

I was really disappointed... I can definitely make better macarons than here even though I am not a professional baker. 

Not recommended."

643,made-by-pauline-new-york-2,2019-04-22,4.0,"One of the better macarons in the city. It's a small outfit on the first floor in Macy's (which was tricky to find at first) so no seating, just take-away.

Generally, the macarons I've purchased here have been fantastic: a perfect pillowy meringue cookie that gives way to a tasty ganache or fruit filling! Every so often I've tried one that was a little too dry or crumbly, likely because it was past it's prime (macarons start dry out of the oven, moisten after being filled, and then slowly get dryer over time), but it's on the rarer side. 

I think many people underestimate how tricky it is to make and store and sell macarons; there's so many factors that contribute to flavor, texture, softness, crumbly-ness of this specialty meringue cookie. (I've made close to a thousand of my own macarons, so I'm personally familiar). And to that end, Made by Pauline does a great job at maintaining quality!"
643,made-by-pauline-new-york-2,2018-10-30,4.0,Pretty good!! My fiancé's favorite dessert is macarons and he says these macarons are some of the best he has ever had! The flavors are quite unique and the fruity ones are quite potent. We tried one of each flavor and my favorites were rose and almond. I would say that the macarons are a little on the sweet side for me personally but I'm sure anyone with a sweet tooth could appreciate that. Make sure to take advantage of the Yelp check-in offer!

The macarons were baked to perfection and if anything comparable to laudurée flavor wise!  The macarons' shells are nicely crisp on the outside but when you bite into it, it's really soft and cake like.  The flavors of the filling really punches through to my tastebuds and nice texture and thickness.  I enjoyed them very much and the colors and box is just super cute!

I would recommend the banana Nutella (omg i could eat a gazillion of these!), pistachios, passion fruit, and chocolate.

The hazelnut was not as strong as I'd like it to be but still good, the coconut was a little milder as well."

Made by Pauline is nearly impossible to locate inside Macy's flagship Herald Square- 1st floor near fine jewelry/ watches adjacent Sunglass Hunt and Burberry.  I walked in continuous circles on the 1st floor searching for Made by Pauline.  Made By Pauline is a small brick and mortar booth utilizing retail space from Macy's.  The female sales person is very personal, helpful and friendly.  A very large selection of macarons in various flavors.  At $2.75 each, I opt for one of each:  vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, lavender, almond, and hazelnut.  Very fresh and not overpowering sweet or heavy.  I am truly enamored of macarons!  Vibrant and bright colors.  It reminisce me of my previous Parisian visit of French pastries.

Sales receipts are paperless and sent to customers' phones with a link.  It was an accomplished visit."

A secret gem tucked in the Macy's building. These macarons are really delicious. Pricey but in my eyes worth it. It's a shame that a bundle isn't cheaper than the buying them individually. Then I might have bought 6 instead of 4, but maybe that's for the best because I would have eaten them all in one-sitting."
643,made-by-pauline-new-york-2,2020-02-05,5.0,They're simply the best in NYC. I get them every week for a customer and they're always a hit. It helps that Sophia is simply the best
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-12-23,5.0,"Why do I love Lollino? Let me count the ways....

- Definitely one of the best espressos in the city.

- Vegan love - the sorbets (especially the hazelnut) and the vegan cornetti

- Neighborhoody-everyone-is-a-friend-here vibe

That's why I stop here everytime I'm in Chelsea."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-11-10,4.0,"Went here after hearing rave reviews. Tried a couple of flavors--the limit is two, which I guess is reasonable, but I always hate tasting limits.

After trying a couple, I went with the dark chocolate and espresso--both were decent, though I wanted them to be a little bit more flavorful. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable and reasonably priced and the staff was quick and attentive."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-12-15,5.0,"Stopped by for a quick pit stop, had macchiato and a couple of tiny cookies. Beautiful little jewel box of a place with friendly baristas. Macchiato was the best I've ever had outside of Italy. Gelato looked delicious but it was a cold windy day so skipped that. Sparse seating but I managed to nab a comfy stool near the window for primo Chelsea dog watching. Excellent experience."

644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-09-07,5.0,It's the cutest coffee shop! I'm glad I stumbled upon it on my way walking to Chelsea market. The affogato I had was delightful!
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2020-02-23,3.0,"It's good but not that good. It's def that expensive though. The ice cream tastes ok. You can taste the ice in the gelato and that means that they probably use water in the prep. In the stracciatella they use little drops of chocolate. Nooooot cool. Real Stracciattella has fine bits of chocolate throughout, which results in a smooth texture with just the slightest crunch in every bite. For the average is good. But Not for that price!"
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-06-13,5.0,"This place is my favorite place for gelato. The owner makes gelato and sorbet homemade daily, and you can taste the freshness. The shop is tiny but well lit-up and bright, so it has a welcoming atmosphere. 

My favorite gelato flavors are straciatella and chocolate, and I usually pair the two together in a cup. The gelato is so smooth and creamy, I always die when the cup is almost empty. 

You can also taste test two flavors of your choosing, and the other flavors are great. 

The shop also offers some pastries and cappuccino. 

The staff are very friendly, including the owner."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2020-02-29,5.0,Having lived in Italy I know good gelato and coffee and this place has both! Seriously the best gelato I've found I in NY with great natural choices and friendly staff an a stylish setting. A neighborhood gem!
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-08-25,5.0,"Vegans rejoice! This place has a wide variety of sorbets including chocolate and hazelnut which are totally non-dairy. I confess I have only tried those two flavors (mixed together, obviously) but the fruit ones look good too. 

Cute space with a few seats and friendly staff."

644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-04-02,5.0,"My experience was perfect. The employees were kind and sweet and the gelato was delicious. 

I got the strawberry sorbet and banana sorbet and they were fresh and fruity. Perfect balance of sweet and fruit. They tasted just like real fruit. 

My companion ordered a cappuccino which was cute and even came with little cookies. 

The shop was clean and very pretty. The overall vibe was calm and relaxed, setting the perfect mood to enjoy gelato and coffee. 

The girls that I ordered with were so sweet and helpful to what I wanted. 

If you want delicious gelato and a relaxed setting, I urge you to visit LOLLINO!"
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-07-13,5.0,"Best gelato. Hazelnut actually tastes like hazelnut. Pear, amazing. They have new concoctions every now and then - today we tried a lemon/bergamot combination. Will be back."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-06-14,4.0,"Pleasantly surprised with this place. It's a cute spot in Chelsea, with mini couch-like spots at the shop. We came here for a quick dessert and we're greeted by generally friendly staff. 

There are about 16-20 flavors to try from, but there's a sign that indicates that each person can only sample two. This is probably the only negative part about this shop. If you have an icecream / gelato store, let the customers try as many flavors as they want. Most people won't try over 3 or 4 flavors, as most people are mindful about that. However, this gelatoria has a sign that you can only test two flavors. A little stingy and not a great look. 

Let's get to the quality of the gelato -- phenomenal. It's not as good as Dolce Brooklyn, but probably the best I've had in the city. I had a milkshake with the banana sorbet and the straciatella and it was very good. They don't give you an enormous size as most parlors do which I appreciated, and each flavor came through. It was very light and fresh. I'm usually not a sorbet person, but the banana sorbet was the best sorbet I've had. My boyfriend had the pistachio - creamy, light, and not too sweet. 

I'd recommend this place. I'll definitely be back for more."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-08-18,4.0,You can taste how fresh their product is. Very friendly staff and a nice sitting area. The Petra and pear sorbet are pretty good. The golden lime sorbet was more on the bitter side but and is definitely unique flavor
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-06-15,2.0,"Unfriendly staff who was clueless with Ritual app.  Most of low rated comments were all similar in this aspect.

Two fruit flavored gelato wasn't great either.  It wasn't half and half.  More like 1/3 & 2/3.  I should have just bought a pint from supermarket.  Other gelato place nearby on 8th Ave is much better.  I have a feeling that the owner's response was posted by Ritual or a 3rd party hired by the owner.  Owner mentioned a ""team"" so I might try again when there is a different team member then remove this comment if next experience is better."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2016-08-11,4.0,"My friend lives less than 10 feet away from this gelato store, making it almost tempting to go every night. 

We came in 5 minutes before closing and they were super kind enough to let us order. We opted for hazelnut and  strawberry.  Definitely not a pairing.

While the hazelnut was creamy and truly tasted like hazelnuts and not the artificial crap most gelato places use, I would say the star of the show was the strawberry.

Each bite had little seeds that tasted like actual strawberries. The gelato itself reminded me of a strawberry jam but not as sweet. TRULY DELICIOUS. 

Definitely will be back to try other flavors."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-11-03,3.0,"Pleasantly surprised. 

I was walking around in Chelsea after dinner and ran into this place. I love it's cute and comfy interior decor, and I think it'd be a great place to hangout with a few friends. I like there wide variety of gelato flavors, but I think it could a bit cheaper.

644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-09-07,5.0,"Best gelato I have ever had! 

Food: (in this case, gelato) for everything I have sampled and ordered was amazing! I asked for cantaloupe sorbet and their special to try. Cantaloupe sorbet was nice. I can actually taste cantaloupe. Their special flavor was truffle. I think it is pretty unique and different. For me, I really liked it because I love truffle and I can put it on everything. My friend had tried it as well but he did not like it as it gave a feeling of eating a savory food. However, I got this fantastic yogurt-fig. The tartness and milkiness of yogurt went well with the sweetness of fig. DELISH! 
Proved point - 10 mins after we had left, we went back again to get another yogurt-fig ice cream cause it was irresistibly good! 

Service: nice and friendly

Atmosphere: nice designs and decorations. Even though the shop is pretty tiny, they use white color to make the place look more spacious. There are a few tables in the shop as well."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-05-12,5.0,Great service and probably the best gelato I have had in North America. You can tell their ingredients are very fresh; their gelato and sorbet is packed with flavour.
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-08-09,3.0,"Not bad...

They only let you sample two flavors (probably thanks to the losers who have come in the past to sample and leave). That's probably the only con. The flavors on offer are really delicious. I highly recommend the pistachio; it was really, really pistachio-y.

It's a cute location with a bit of space if you want to enjoy your dessert indoors. I did think it was a bit overpriced for the quantity served, but it hit the spot."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-08-19,5.0,"Authentic Italian gelato (the banana gelato is brown) and it tastes like it.  Calm, casual, comfortable atmosphere."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-08-05,5.0,"The guava, passion fruit and the banana flavors are perfection. This is my favorite gelato place in NYC, and the space is very clean and cute. If you're in Chelsea gooooo get this gelato."

644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-06-14,5.0,"This is delicious!  Better than Grom.  So light, but wonderful flavor - the pistachio had an intriguing saltiness and plenty of pistachios for crunch.  The cone was a treat all by itself.  No doubt, I will be back."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-11-25,5.0,Cute little shop. The hazelnut sorbet or Coconut gelato are my favorite. This is my new favorite gelato place.
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2019-05-25,5.0,Amazing gelato! My favorite is the hazelnut. It's so light and packed with flavor and I don't feel bloated after eating it. Love the service here as well

644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-11-26,3.0,Knocking off one star for the unfriendly service and another for how overpriced it is. The gelato is good but not worth $5.95 for a miniature scoop. Stick with the sorbet - the Strawberry is refreshing.
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2015-12-06,5.0,"Randomly stumbled upon this cute establishment while walking around one day... So glad that I did!!

I have to admit I'm a gelato snob -- yet I LOVE their earl grey gelato (which they don't have daily but there are several flavor options to choose from)... Friendly Italian woman working behind the counter... Chef is kind as well"
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-07-20,3.0,Not too bad but miles away from many others where the flavor are richer and texture creamier. This isn't bad a place but mediocre at best.
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2018-03-31,3.0,"A small, yet good spot. The earl grey gelato, when they have it, is one of the best flavors they offer."
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2017-02-02,4.0,"Best gelato in the city. Especially dairy free hazelnut sorbet!

644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2016-03-20,4.0,"This is a very cute place with great service. The worker was so friendly and helped with choosing the flavors. You can sample as many flavors as you want so that you get the flavor that you like. You can also mix flavors. I got the Hazelnut and Almond mixed and that was really good! Even though, I've had better gelato, this place is definitely worth checking out!

The inside of the story is very modern and has pillows which made the store look very comfy. Overall, I had a great experience!"
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2015-06-27,3.0,"Skipped the ice cream on brioche and tried 2 flavors but was impressed by neither, so fought the urge to just walk out and forked over the average crazy price for a CUP (SMALL) $4.20+tax = $4.57 -- standard nocciola, but at least the pistachio truly tasted like it, nuttier than your average. Sadly the best part of my visit was the quick tips infographic over the display that described the difference between gelato and ice cream, which I'm surprised you don't see more often.
PS what an awkward address"
644,lollino-gelateria-and-espresso-bar-new-york-4,2016-12-04,5.0,"Gelato here is better than in Italy! The owner is very friendly, a nice place also for a coffee, sandwich and relax in Chelsea."

645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-12-04,5.0,"This place is such a cozy and moody hole in the wall gem! The prices are cheap for the quantity that you get and the interior is everything! 

It's a really cool spot to do your work. It's relatively lively but if you prefer a quieter workplace there are seats near the front where you can do your work."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2020-02-22,4.0,"Paper Coffee is located in the lobby of a hotel, and is definitely a cozy cafe.

Pros: There's a lot of space! Even though I came during a busy time, I was able to find a seat. The drinks are also pretty good, though on the pricier side. Free wifi is also available for customers.

Cons: It was pretty dimly lit, so not ideal if you're trying to get some work done and need more light."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2020-02-16,4.0,"Good coffee shop inside a hotel, really awesome for those staying in the hotel and seems really popular even with those aren't staying here, which is also kinda the issue. We never were able to find somewhere to sit while here and the whole place was overrun with locals. Probably the most popular inside a restaurant coffee shop I've ever seen.

Cappuccino was great but the latte was my personal favorite. They do great foam art as well!"
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2020-01-09,3.0,"Strong nitro for $6 a glass.

It's a cute spot located in the MADE hotel but easy to spot from the street. 

Can get pretty crowded. They also close at 5pm on the weekdays."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,"Great coffee and food here! The ham & brie sandwich was delicious although the size was pretty small. The sitting area was a little confusing as one half of the space was reserved for table service so there were only 3 or 4 tables available (but it's unclear whether it's a weekend thing). Regardless, it's a nice, cozy place to study with great service as well! Highly recommend."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2020-03-10,4.0,"Cute spot to come grab coffee, a bite, or do some work on your laptop. The cappuccino is delicious and the ham and Brie sandwich on a baguette is great. I've also had the chia pudding which is very good. Quiet little outside area where you can sit up the stairs. This is attached to a hotel, so some of the seating is reserved for guests only."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-09-06,5.0,"Great space to have a quick coffee break!
They got great coffee! I like their honeybear, it supper smoothly.
For the environment , is bright, and lots of seats.  
Sometimes it's quit slow, sometimes is supper crowded, very depends."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2020-01-21,4.0,"Paper Coffee is a great spot in the lobby of the Made Hotel. They serve the breakfast menu from the hotel restaurant Ferris, and while it took a semi-long time to get, I loved the egg sandwich I ordered. Drip coffee was also good."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-08-24,5.0,"Wow!  Great coffee in the Chelsea District. I walked here from my hotel down the block to bring coffee back to my sweetie who was still resting in bed. The atmosphere here is minimalist chic with lots of attention to detail. 

The coffee was excellent. I ordered two whole fat lattes to go, and they were artfully prepared. I also took two croissants to go, which were buttery and flakey. The lady in front of me wanted to order breakfast about 10 minutes after the cutoff. I watched as the staff brilliantly met her needs despite the turnover to lunch downstairs in the kitchen. 

Don't mess around with Starbucks!!  Come here instead."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-06-28,5.0,"What a cute little find! The wooden interior and surrounding plants give off a warm, friendly appearance to the hotel and cafe. I was a little confused upon entering as I didn't think the lobby of the hotel and the cafe would be directly connected in an open space (they're in the same room), but I quickly got the gist of it. Also, the staff are pretty friendly so don't be afraid to ask questions in case you feel lost. 

The entrance itself is low key because there is no sign on the building itself, but they have a sign outside by the sidewalk you can't miss. 

Their menu isn't expansive but they have everything a coffee shop needs: good quality coffee and staff.

I only had time to drop in and get a coffee to go, but I will definitely be back to study!"
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-11-22,3.0,"Beautiful place. It looks like it could belong to a section in Muji. It was quite hard to find from the outside. We did not know that it was a hotel. 

After going inside, the coffee part is mainly in the corner. There was only one, unkind, employee behind the counter. He did not seem friendly. I asked a question about if we could sit anywhere and he replied back dryly, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. Anyways, didn't understand anything and didn't really feel like asking him again. 

We went to the bar side. Mind you, there is a check in desk in the middle for the hotel. After finding an outlet to plug in my laptop, we sat down. After a few minutes of settling down, a nice gentleman assisted us. He explained to us that if we were to be seating in the bar area, we would have to order something. Due to lack of space & frustration to the organization of the place, we just stayed and ordered fries and a drink. 

Andrew Hojicha cocktail, nicely done.
French fries were nice and crisp.

Prices were alright. Cafe barista, not recommended. Hopefully one day he learns to be kind to his customers.
Bar service, he was lovely.

So, it may have been common sense to others but to me, i had no clue about the seating arrangements. Ask before you sit in case you just want to sit down and enjoy your coffee!"
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-04-07,5.0,"Came here on a Sunday morning to study with a friend and there were a good amount of empty seats to sit. The place is pretty cute and very aesthetically pleasing! It is located in front of a hotel lobby so it sort of gets distracting and loud with people checking in and out of the hotel.

It was also loud from people who were casually chatting and catching with friends but it didn't bother me too much because I had my earbuds on.

I ordered the Honeybear Latte for $5.99 (including tax). I thought it was okay! It wasn't sweet, which was perfectly fine for me, although I was expecting it to be sweet because of the name. Nothing too special about it but it wasn't bad either. 

Staffs are all friendly!

I stayed there from 11AM - 5:30PM. The coffee bar closes at 5, and the menu also includes a few food items as well! I got hungry around 3:30pm and ordered fries and a ""Way to go Burger"" (I think that's what it was called) and both my friend and i devoured it as soon as the server/bartender brought it to us. Food was pretty pricey as it came out to be $34 (including tips) and it was expected because it's located right in a hotel, but my friend and I were both enjoyed the food.

The place did get a bit chilly after an hour or 2 there so bring a extra piece of clothing for warmth!

Overall had a great experience at Paper coffee! Will definitely come back!"
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-02-27,4.0,"I had this place bookmarked and after a meeting I decided to stop by for a latte.  The entrance is very nice and the interior is dynamic.  When you open the door on the left there are plants set on three layers of wall shelves.  The interior has art on the wall and next to the register and barista is seating.  

Unfortunately, when I got there all of the seats were taken with the exception of one right next to the barista area.  My seating had lumpy back support, but I was content sitting down because I wanted to drink my coffee.  I didn't have a coffee table and ended up up using the barista's area as placement for my coffee.  The latte was good and the service was good."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-09-16,4.0,"A good space to get work done-- not a ton of natural light, but some spacious tables and outlets. The coffee is okay, it tasted a little burnt to me. And the ham&brie sandwich was $16 though (!!!!!), so maybe eat before you come here to study!"
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-12-20,3.0,"Atmosphere warm and cozy and cool. I'm not sure I'd say this coffee is my favorite. Hard to determine but bitter a bit? Anyway, great hotel lobby space to work with quiet but crowd of that makes sense."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2018-10-26,5.0,"Super cool hidden coffeeshop in MADE hotel. Didn't realize it was in the actual hotel, but Paper Coffee is in the front section of MADE. The coffee is great and strong and can be taken in the lobby of MADE. Lots of seating inside including the outdoors area upstairs. If you love a lively coffee shop with other young professionals, this is a great place to chill and chat or work in while enjoying a hot coffee. They also make a great latte with fun latte art. Hip interior and ambience. 

Accepts card.
Stamp card available!
Bathrooms downstairs.

Drink up!"
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-05-22,5.0,"During my week visit to NY, I visited about 1-2 different coffee shops everyday to study. Paper coffee was one of my favorites. The coffee shop is located inside of a hotel, and I didn't know what to expect. To my surprise there were a bunch of many others also working on their laptops. The decor and seating is really beautiful. It doesn't feel cramped or anything. There are two bigger tables, two couch areas with coffee tables, bar seating where the coffee is being made, and they also have seating off to the side near the windows which they opened up in the morning while the heat was still bearable. 

The coffee was great. I had an iced americano which was very smooth, without that acidic aftertaste. I love the cups they put their coffee in. My friend had a hot black coffee in a beautiful ceramic mug while I had an iced coffee in a slim glass cup. Idk, coffee always tastes better to me in a pretty glass lol. 

I also had a ham sandwich with the Brie which was so tasty. I'm not even a big sandwich fan, but that sandwich hit the spot. 

Would definitely come back."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-11-22,4.0,"Cool coffee spot in the lobby of a hotel.  I passed it though upon entering as it wasn't obvious to me.  I walked to the bar in the back by accident.  It was really busy when I came here with lots of people working or relaxing.  The coffee itself was okay, it wasn't too memorable, but if you're looking for a decent cup of joe, you can find it here."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-08-26,1.0,"I used to come by every morning for almost two years because, as others have mentioned, the ambiance is terrific and the coffee is solid. However, the hotel has recently made it so that only guests at the hotel can use any of the tables outside of the main coffee bar which means there are only about 6 spaces to sit. And they will definitely chase you away if you are not a hotel guest and force you to sit by the coffee bar for which there is never any space - even if you've been a paying customer of the coffee shop for years. 

There has been a huge drop in the number of regulars and people waiting for coffee since they've implemented this change. Don't bother stopping in if you want somewhere to hang out to do work, to chat with friends, or even just to enjoy a nice book. They won't let you.

Try going to Stumptown half a block away and take your coffee to the adjoining Ace Hotel lobby. You can sit where you like and you won't get a ""friendly"" reminder that you can only sit at the coffee shop with your coffee is you're a guest of the hotel."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2018-09-09,4.0,"Paper Coffee is the coffee shop located in the very cool Made Hotel just north of the Flatiron District. It's pretty large and its wooden design and large windows invite customers to stay for awhile to work at one of the several tables.

They sell morning baked goods and really good coffee. The baristas know what they are doing and my latte was one of the best I've had in NYC (and that's saying a lot for a city with great coffee shops). 

I brought my 19 month old daughter and the staff were looking at us weird. Great coffee vibes, but they are definitely pretentious."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-11-08,4.0,Pour over was a little small in portion. Avocado toast was very tasty! Vibe of the place is interesting.. maybe a bit more inviting from the street than it feels in here. Service was awesome. Friendly staff everywhere.
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-04-15,5.0,"Great coffee shop in the neighborhood. We come here every morning for coffee. The espresso is done just right and the milk is frothed perfectly. We always order a macchiato which is a difficult drink to get a good latte art going, but they are able to do it perfectly. I also especially enjoy the serveware they use for the coffee and pastries. They always look like a piece of art.

Admittedly the baristas are not as approachable as what we used to in the village but that's almost the by product of being in the hotel and in the area.

The Maître D' is very nice and friendly though. She recognized from dinner a week ago which I was quite surprised by."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-01-13,3.0,"Disappointed.

Was initially excited to check out this schmanzy coffee place with wifi. It was clearly was popular/crowded. 

After placing my belongings down, I approached the barista to order a small coffee and matcha. I asked what was in the ham sandwich and (he begrudgingly answered as if I was asking unecesarry questions) there were two kinds: ham and veggie. So I asked again and another barista stepped in and the bill came out to $15 something, and gave a tip after he complimented my nails.

I waited for 10-15 min and wondered where my drinks were so asked about it until I learned that the sandwich was the only thing they placed the order for. It was a medium sized sandwich for $15. I was annoyed and asked them to cancel my order. But the sanwich came out so I said forget it. And one of the baristas said they would comp my matcha. But a third barista ended up double charging me for a coffee and a matcha. Someone had to refund me and then instead of comping the matcha. They comped me for the coffee.

Annoyed I asked to just give me everything and walked away. 30 minutes later, one of the baristas came up to me to give me the receipts reminding me of my (still) wrong charge and a comp card which seemed useless because at this point I didnt plan on returning.  

I think what was most disappointing was their initial snark attitude of the 2/3 baristas until they epically messed up my order.

The food and drinks were very good, but was it worth a $15 dining sandwhich experience? Absolutely not. And the service was immature and unrefined relative to the cost and interior.

It was disappointing."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-02-01,4.0,"Nice space to relax. Pretty quiet, saw people with their laptops here. Latte was pretty good and served in a nice cup if you stay."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-03-29,4.0,"This is such a lovely place to grab some coffee and work! This place is located in the front lobby of a hotel. The coffee bar is to your right once you enter the lobby, and they have a small menu of various coffees/lattes as well as some pastries. I usually get their lattes and they're pretty good! Good quality coffee beans with the right ratios of milk and coffee.

The space overall is very suited for studying or doing some work. There are couches, sofas, bar seats, as well as wooden stool and desks. The only issue I have with this space is that there aren't a lot of outlets at the wooden seating areas, which I prefer since it's my preferred area of studying. So my seating is usually restricted to a specific part of the wooden seating area. 

Otherwise, this place is fantastic and conducive for studying/working. Would highly recommend coming here!"
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2020-02-12,3.0,Very beautiful coffee shop. My friend and I stopped in mid afternoon on a Wednesday and had trouble finding a spot to sit. I'm not a coffee drinker so I got the hot chocolate and was disappointed for $5. It tasted like hot water and wasn't even made with milk. I should have asked them to make another but didn't. My friend enjoyed her latte.
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-09-30,4.0,Visited this cute little coffee shop when I was in NYC. Didn't realize it was connected to a hotel but the bartender was super friendly and helpful. I always order fries every place I visit and theirs were pretty good. Of course I had two glasses of wine and finished my day with a honey latte (judge me). Definitely worth a visit.
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-02-21,4.0,"Latte here is great! I had Honeybear and, although I usually don't enjoy honey in my drinks, honey was blended well and I liked it a lot.

I also like that there are many seating available in the back, which is the lounge area of the hotel where the coffee shop is in. Little sofas and cushioned seats are cozy and I would be able to spend hours here with friends. It's very generous of the hotel to let outside guests hang out.

To-stay cups were beautiful. I wish I had those kind of cups at home."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2018-11-18,5.0,"Great quiet spot on the weekend to grab a cup of coffee and read or catch up with an old friend. Seating specific to the coffee shop is limited (couple of cozy window tables that in theory can seat a couple groups of 2-3, but individuals will bring work and the tables are small enough where it makes it impossible for others to sit around that same table even if there are stools across from them that are empty)- but paper coffee is located in the lobby of the Made hotel so there's more seating in the general lobby area that you can grab if the seats are all taken by the coffee counter. The cappuccino and lattes are served in the cutest mugs if you stick around vs take the coffee to-go. Will be back."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-06-05,5.0,"Cute Coffee Shop with Lovely Study Space Interior!

Although I hate to admit it, I am a regular in Koreatown area of Manhattan and if you know me well, always on the hunt for cute coffee shops.  I came across this by wandering the streets, since Stumptown (my usual go-to) was way too crowded.  And it was only a block away!  I was immediately in awe of its large space and ""hipster"" vibe, with a community table, lounge areas by the windows, and a larger space in the back complete with a bar.

The coffee itself is marvelous!  With strong espresso, it reminds me a lot of my Manhattan favorites-Third Rail and Hutch & Waldo.  This was a huge plus for me!  They also have decent baked goodies/pastries.  It's always so out...but do try the black sesame croissant if it's there!  It's superb and such good flavor!

The only downside is that the coffeeshop closes at 6pm, but the space remains open as it's a hotel lobby, as mentioned.  So, no late night studying... Another downside is that I did notice it getting a little more crowded in the last few months-my secret find is being discovered!"
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-05-09,5.0,"Listen, 29th Street is full of good coffee options, but Paper Coffee stands out.

O V E R A L L 
This place has speedy internet, which is a HUGE plus in my book when I'm looking for a place to set up shop for a couple of hours. There are 3 different levels of options for seating. 

There's a roof area, seems like more of a one-on-one talking spot, more intimate (but I mean, hello, they have a garden rooftop area. Sick!). The main floor is the most spacious and has many options as far as high top tables, regular tables, couches, etc. Don't be fooled by the coffee bar when you walk in, there's tons of seating in the back. Then there's the basement which seems most quiet (and also the coldest) on the lower level with the bathrooms.

Very hipster vibes.

F O O D  + D R I N K
The coffee is delish. I had two Americanos. I also ordered breakfast, which was very hipster and tasty. I got scrambled egg whites with toast and breakfast sausage. The meal also came with ""hashbrowns"" which were more like fingerling potato wedges. The potatoes had some sort of spice on them which I didn't particularly enjoy (a little too much for me), but the toast and jam were to die for.

Would definitely return. Solid workspace. It is a little pricy."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-01-12,5.0,"Cozy space in a hotel, the street view is not great but the interior is very nicely decorated (especially during the holidays).

They have pour overs! I get that a lot of people out there is all about their espresso based drinks like lattes, but some of us love the heck out of quality made, 3rd wave, black coffee where you can really taste the flavors. 

5 star in my book, for making pour overs with decent beans in a nice setting and central location that doesn't take an hr to get to (cough Bushwick)."

Paper Coffee is the answer. The perfect blend of taste and ambiance, Paper Coffee boasts classics like Espresso, Matcha, and Vanilla Lattes with plenty of alternative milk options offered at a reasonable price. With delicious drinks, warm interior tones, and ambient natural light, Paper Source is the perfect café for a cozy NYC morning."

Great spot to study, the coffee bar does close down after 5pm, but the drinks bar will start serving in full force. Study areas tend to get quiet after 5pm, so it might be a good place if you have some late night work around the area."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-04-24,4.0,"I am conflicted on the ultimate star rating. The skinny rating
- 4 to 5 stars for quality of coffee and service 
-but 2 to 3 star for pricing

This little coffee space is a relatively new find [compared to various coffee shops that I frequent throughout NYC]. Their drips have been consistently good and their nitro [only cold brew option at the moment] are decent as well.

In terms of price, I would classify this as a relatively expensive coffee place, which does not surprise me since it's located inside a hotel and ergo, probably charges a premium for this reason.

While I would love to make this a daily/weekly stop, I must say this is a splurge if i have to spend over $5 for a cup of coffee. For some context, $5.50 for a nitro that's only 8oz is a hefty premium. The price should reflect what is being paid for. The nitros that I have had are already cold so it doesn't make sense to pay for a cup of ice. From a customer's perspective, if I pay $5.50+ tax, and see a small cup in front of me, it is rather dissatisfying.

As another example, paying $6-7 market price for pour overs where most places charge $4-5. With pour overs, quality is variable so l will just leave it at that. 

I now must think twice before making this visit because :
1. The price 
2. I would rather not be that customer causing a scene

To mgmt - I was trying to write this in an email but didn't see an email for this shop and didn't want it to get lost in the hotel reviews."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2018-11-04,4.0,"Randomly stopped by because we saw a sign for coffee. Spacious and many people were on their laptops and working. Definitely a great spot to relax and do work! Had a relaxing and chill vibe. 
The coffee was pretty good! Next time will definitely try the espresso/other drinks. 
They only take CC/ no cash! 

Had clean bathrooms!"

Located in the Made Hotel, this coffee shop offers elegance and great coffee. I had a cappuccino to stay. The espresso was rich and perfectly pulled. The milk foam was silky, smooth, and delicious. I enjoyed too quickly at their large communal table.  It was a busy but beautiful."
645,paper-coffee-new-york,2019-07-13,5.0,"This was a very nice place within a hotel for some coffee. I ordered a regular sized latte and took it to go. However, there is seating if you were with friends or needed a place to get work done :)"

I got a coffee and a lemon bar which was delicious. I was even more impressed with the friendly service. When I asked for a to-go cup to take my leftover coffee, the barista topped it off with fresh coffee before giving it to me."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2020-03-12,4.0,"Really cozy feel. Welcoming inside with more seating that it appears from the outside might hold. Music is Italian and such a nice touch. 

This is such a nice place to hang out and chat or read while enjoying a beverage. Little place but so well decorated to be cozy and comfortable.

Came to reading and have some tea and cake for a while during my vacation here in NYC this week. Great little find among the towering buildings and scaffolding that is permanently found as part of the city infrastructure."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2020-03-05,4.0,"Mostly a fan because of the location. Hudson Yards has far too many undistinguished places that cater to the mass-market crowd that lack character and flavor.

Old Country Coffee may cater to the hotel tourist crowd that they are literally next door to (and of which my group was a part of), but they manage to have enough character, both in service and decor, to feel like a pleasant experience.

The pastries look solid, especially the danishes, although we refrained. Ditto for the quiches. The bagels were not impressive looking, but managed to still feel like a solid New York bagel through the hours of jet lag the entire group was experiencing. Considering how unpleasant the weather was outside, to find a place with a little charm right next door was a pleasant discovery."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-12-15,2.0,"Very nice baristas. They get 4 stars. The low stars are my estimation of the coffee, which is, after all the primary reason to go. 

The house blend drip taste as just okay--which in NYC means go somewhere else if you want great coffee, and it's too weak. Should have brought my headphones: can't stand the music. the music. 

It is, however a pleasant workplace because of the plethora of outlets."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-06-04,2.0,"Most of the time I agree with my fellow Yelpers, but not this time.  The coffee here was poor quality and expensive.  I think Maxwell House tastes better, and I am not exaggerating.  I understand that the location in Midtown Manhattan, and rents are high, but better coffee can be had elsewhere.  

The prices were high.  For that high of a price, I would have expected free refills of regular coffee or at least a reduced price for a refill.  That was not the case.

The mug was dirty that they gave me.  The rim had crust on it from other people's usage.

The atmosphere, however, is very nicely done.  So, I will give them 2 stars instead of 1."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-05-15,5.0,"Love this hidden gem of a coffee shop. Steps away from Hudson Yards and service here is very friendly! 

This shop has a really homey Italian vibe. Played a lot of soothing foreign music and baristas did their best to be quite conversational with every customer. 

Great selection of teas and coffee here as well as small breakfast, lunch snacks."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-11-10,5.0,"Pros: coffee/tea offerings, fresh pastries/sandwiches, free wifi, decor
Cons: usually full, a bit pricey

TLDR: cozy, relaxed, worth stopping by. The Nutella mocha is a must for chocolate fans.

I've come here a few times already and I always enjoy my stay. Particularly when I find a place to sit. This place has old-school country decoration on the walls and it has that kind of relaxed, chill vibe that a lot of us look for in a cafe. Unfortunately, the cafe is rather small and people know the stuff is good, which means you need luck to find a free chair depending on the time of the day.

I've tried their cappuccinos, lattes, cakes and regular coffees. It's all delicious, and if you like cafe-style foods and drinks, this place won't disappoint. Pro tip: try the Nutella mocha if you are into chocolate. It is incredibly delicious.

They have a bathroom for clients but will need to ask the barista for the 4 digit code to use it. I didn't put the wifi to the test, but for browsing and stuff it was fast enough."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-02-03,4.0,"This place is a great place to grab a coffee/quick breakfast before catching a Mega Bus. We were looking to escape the cold, so stopped by here for breakfast and got the avocado toast. The cafe wasn't too crowded, but saw a diverse group of people there (some people studying, others waiting for a bus or stopping in for a quick coffee). 

We ordered two avocado toasts, which actually took a while to come out but it's because they prepare it on the spot (including mashing the avocado, etc) it looks like. When were were there, it looked like there were two people working (one person at the register and another one preparing food). Luckily there wasn't anyone ahead of us who had ordered a longer prep time food, so we waited less than 10 minutes, but I could see the line getting pretty long after us. 

Overall, I would suggest this place as a warm and quiet place to wait and grab some food or to study."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-09-19,5.0,"Are you around Hudson Yard early in the morning? Check out Old Country Coffee!

I came to Old Country Coffee on a Thursday morning for some coffee. I couldn't help but notice the quiches on display. I ended up getting a mushroom and artichoke quiche for $7 and it blew my mind. The crust on the outside was flakey, crunchy and buttery. The generous amount of mushrooms in the inside was warm and smokey. I got a piece of artichoke which was enough to satisfy my tastebud. I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant for the road but I ended up getting a sausage, egg and cheese on a croissant. It's okay that they messed up because it still tasted better than the ones I make at home. 

The cafe is about 8 small tables big. It can seat about 2 guests per table. There is also a bar table where you can enjoy a quick bite. Those small tables that could seat 2, had people on their laptops typing away. To sum it all up, there is free WiFi and the register accommodates Apple Pay. 

Enjoy if you are around."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2018-12-25,5.0,"Unassuming, easy to miss entrance out of the well-defined touristy regions of midtown but boy, am I glad I found this place. It has everything your looking for in a great coffee shop. 

They were up and operating on Christmas Day and the two men who were running shop were so friendly and made everyone feel at home. The interior had such a cool, rustic vibe with wood floors and cool, old-timey decorations. The bathroom even had old fraternity memorabilia, very cool!

The location is quite close to all the bus stops so it's a great place to stop by if your a little early for your bus. Overall a really good experience and great coffee! They really try to make their customers happy and they even warmed up our danish for us, which was delicious also."

I love places with eclectic decor for my eye to explore while enjoying a great cup of coffee. The barista was absolutely charming and after a long cold day of finding things to kill time this was the best stop of the day. 
The menu was fairly priced for location and choices. There are several pastries, muffins, and cake options. Quiche and sandwich choices that looked tempting, but I decided on lemon pound cake and white chocolate mocha.  I was so pleased to have a place to charge my phone, relax, and be rescued from the cold in this charming coffee shop."

646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2018-08-25,5.0,"Delightfully unexpected neighborhood coffee joint serves up tasty java as well as local baked goods!

Some people wonder why a five star review for some of my venues, but I believe that ratings should reflect how excellent that particular establishment is, in its ability to get five stars for what it has to work with (resources/location/servers), so I'm not necessarily rating it against other similar establishments that might have some sort of advantage.

In this case, Old Country Coffee does not have a full kitchen, but they manage to have delicious fresh baked goods including fluffy croissants, tasty fruit tarts, more than a few bites of deliciousness sandwiches, fresh fruit and even yoghurt/granola cups, all procured thanks to their relationship with their mother restaurant across the street.

What makes this little joint such a pleasure are the delightful staff who populate it.  Special shout out to sweet and funny Pete! All of the staff here make me always feel as though I am welcome into what seems like a delightful second home for me (but much larger than my current apartment and with a better food selection!)

They are participants in the Cups program (check out the App!).

Although they do not stay open late in the evening (which I hope someday they will) they do open early enough in the morning to attract a broad range of different folks from business people to construction workers, delivery man and upscale women.  It's a lovely place to sit and enjoy a moment of respite with, fresh music and good cheer.

This neighborhood treasure is a tasty gem worth popping into!"

646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-04-21,3.0,"I love finding hidden gems, and this one almost made it. The coffee and ambience is top notch,  it the food and price were below average. This place should be a 3.5 but we're limited by the whole star system. 

Coffee: 5/5 - had the drip coffee and espresso here, both were great. Not over roasted and had subtle chocolate and plum notes. 

Food:  3/5 - I checked the refrigerated display and noticed the sandwiches (with bread and croissants) were pre-made and looked less than fresh. I chose the tuna avocado melt and that was a major disappointment. It wasn't toasty or melty, and the tiny amount of avocado was barely detectable. And it cost $10! 

Ambience/service: 4/5 - this place is very rustic and cozy in the best way. It's tucked under some scaffolding and hard to spot, and is calm for a place near Hudson yards. Ideal for a quiet convo. The barista was friendly and fast but a little overwhelmed with 10 customers in there. 

Price: 2/5 -   $3 for a 12 oz coffee and $10 for a terrible toasted sandwich? It's Manhattan but its not gourmet! This was the worst part of the experience, I felt like they fooled me on price. The food items were not listed with prices, so it came as a surprise when I paid. 

Overall, a good spot that could be great if it was cheaper for the food."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-03-16,4.0,This is a really cute place in hudson yard. I had the Nutella frap and cheese cake. Both tastes really good. And the 2 guys who were working on a Saturday at 6 were just great. Very welcoming and friendly people. The coffee was a bit pricey but other than that it was all good. Will be back soon to try more.
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2018-04-16,4.0,"This place is near the Megabus stop, making it a great indoor place to wait. 

Basically in a construction zone with scaffolding, bulldozers and men at work, Old Country Coffee adequately pulls of its name with a true homey feel. 

Mismatched wood tables and antique chairs beg you to sit a spell in this not too small space, while the young man behind the counter was as gracious as an Inn owner, making concerted effort to be both friendly and welcoming.  

Coffee, $2.75, was tasty and not bitter at medium strength.  The mushroom artichoke quiche, $7, was as delicious as it looked with a buttery crust.   

This modest coffee shop goes out of its way to be better then average - and it succeeds. 

Maybe 6 or 7 tables the place had a few working on laptops while the clock moved as slow as a Tennessee sunset."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2018-04-09,4.0,"Had an early bus to catch, so needed a quick breakfast spot in the area before leaving. Early Saturday morning, plenty of table space available in this cozy coffee shop.

Lots of delicious pastry options to choose from - decided to share the Tomato Spinach Quiche ($6.75), Lemon Pound Cake ($4), Banana Nut Bread ($4), and Blueberry Muffin ($4). Quiche is eggy and easy to eat. Pound cake has an intense lemon flavor with icing on top. Banana Nut Bread is soft with more of a subtle taste. Muffin is fantastic; loads of blueberries and a moist interior. To wash it down ordered a large latte ($5)- standard fare that couldn't quite keep me up on the long bus ride.

Despite only one person behind the counter, the line moves along fairly quickly. Definitely a nice relaxing place to enjoy a cup of coffee before starting the day."

(The Starbucks in javits was sold all the coffee they had!) They had different kinds of cocoa but I just got a regular one. It was ok. I also got white chocolate and macadamia coockies those are also just ok. The cafe is small but cute and cozy. I will try their coffee next time.
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-05-13,3.0,"To keep this one short and sweet, I feel as if Old Country Coffee was too highly rated for what it is. The service was average if not below, as they simply forgot one of the food items my father and I ordered. After reminding them they then remembered to put it in the oven. The coffee was decent for sure, but the sandwiches were below par. They tasted fine enough but the bread was as hard as a rock. If you have any teeth issues or if you enjoy your pallet without deep cuts, Id steer clear. Nevertheless it was a nice, quaint atmosphere and an enjoyable place to sit and get out or the rain. I likely wouldn't go back, but if I wanted a quick coffee and was in the area I wouldn't necessarily avoid it."

It definitely wasn't what all the rave is about.

The atmosphere is amazing, I wish we had had time to hang out for a little while longer.
I had Cafe Au Lait and a pan au chocolate, and the husband had a Nutella blended thing and a blueberry muffin.

They have flavors (vanilla!) for their coffees/lattes as well as a very nice variety of flavorful treats that pair well with coffee in general. 

Besides the very unique, homely style of this cafe, which stands out amongst the hustle and bustle and clean designs of the city, there's a warmth here that is unmatched. I adore it. Will be back for sure!"
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-02-18,5.0,I loved this little hidden gem! We walking in here trying to warm up and get out of the cold for a bit. The atmosphere in the place is so inviting and cozy. The place was full but people are in and out for the most part so we were able to sit down and have some peace and time to talk and enjoy our coffee and tea. I love the vibe of the place so much I will definitely come back here. It is the perfect little place to hang out and chill
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-06-04,4.0,"I came here for a quick lunch before taking the bus. The place is very cozy, with wooden floors, cute chairs and copper pipes on the walls. The interior design and the vibe makes you forget what is going on the area around you, which is quite nice.

I ordered a Chicken Mozzarella baguette, the Mozzarella was on point. I also ordered an Iced Nutella Latte, which tasted less like Nutella than I expected, but it still satisfied my craving for a sweet iced drink. 

There are many power outlets to plug at, which is very convenient. Overall it is a nice, cozy place to grab some food or drink with your friends, or to go alone do some work."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-04-16,4.0,"Small coffee shop which, true to its name, has a quaint, old world charm and is a calm getaway from the Hudson Yard hubbub. Menu is standard coffee shop fare with good, strong coffee. Seating options include two comfy lounge chairs."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-10-25,3.0,"Slow service with average food and coffee at premium ""Hudson Yards"" prices.  Got their bagel and coffee ""special"" for $7!?  Took 10 minutes.  Coffee was ordinary, bagel was below average. Decor is nicely done and they offer WiFi. Overall ""okay"" but certainly not worth a trip and better options are available."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2017-09-09,5.0,"I'm so glad I stopped in! A rustic and cute spot with good coffee and pleasant baristas. It's fun to see this kind of decor in the middle of the city, especially because it doesn't feel ""themed"" it just feels decorated and lived in. 

I got a cold brew, which was fantastic. The baristas were nice when I talked to them but I didn't feel like I was being accosted when I walked in. There was a pretty decent amount of seating for midtown. I'll definitely be back here!"
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2018-08-20,5.0,The cutest coffee shop! Very delicious pastry and delicious coffee. It is worthy to walk over here to have a rest or work at here. The people working at here are super friendly too! Love it.
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,"What an adorable stop for coffee and relaxation.  It would be easy to walk right by, but don't.  I stopped for breakfast- delicious bagel, fantastic latte.  Two delightfully kind ladies behind the counter."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-02-02,4.0,"Visited Old Country Coffee for the first time yesterday (Friday) around 6:30pm. Not a lot of seats, but it wasn't busy. Decorations made the place feels warm and cozy. Barista was friendly and helpful. I ordered the Nutella Hot Chocolate and it was delicious. It tasted like dark chocolate mixed with Nutella. I don't think it was worth $7 dollars though, but it was definitely comforting especially for the cold NY nights."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-11-14,5.0,"Great coffee and baked goods, cozy rustic charm,  friendly staff. A great place to escape the urban noise and read or chat."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-09-30,5.0,Cozy place and great espresso. Reminds me of the places back in Europe. Definitely I will come here again. The baristas have great personality and they pay attention.
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-09-30,5.0,"Just popped in for a quick bite and cup of coffee.

Opted for a Nutella latte, a berry Danish, and a goat cheese quiche.

The latte was creamy and decadent, like rich hot cocoa full of flavorful coffee. The Danish was bursting with fresh fruit flavor in the center and rimmed by flaky, golden croissant crust. The quiche was packed with tasty goat cheese and herbs.

Highly recommend checking this place out!"
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2018-05-25,3.0,"Based on my experience this probably should be a lesser star rating, but the place has such charm that I know in my heart if my order was different I could have been much more satisfied. I hope. 

I saw this pop up in my yelp search for coffee spots near the north end of the High Line. Even the name sounds adorable. The inside is truly ""Old Country"" as opposed to most modern looking coffee shops popping up all over. 3 reviewers claim the cold brew is awesome. They are either liars or something has drastically changed in the recipe since their reviews. Or they like bean water. I took a sip, it filled my soul and my stomach with sorrow, I took another sip to be sure, and as I approached the nearest trash can, took a third and final sip to be POSITIVE that this was as disappointing as I knew in my head it was...and tossed a 90% full cup of iced coffee right in the garbage. It was flavorless and sad. 

Service was flat as well. I can handle that, though.

Like I said...something about the place is leaving me with a hint of hope. I will re-review when I'm back on caffeinated beverages w/ anything that contains sugar. But for now, very eh."
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2019-10-21,4.0,Went on a Monday afternoon and got a seat plus there were many more open. Perfect place for studying plus free fast wifi. Such a cute establishment! Also very friendly staff. Only reason I gave 4 is because the coffee wasn't my favorite but it's hit or miss
646,old-country-coffee-new-york,2018-04-21,4.0,"Overall - fantastic boutique coffee shop if you are in the area

What I got - Nutella latte and mushroom artichoke quiche, banana bread, and a coke

Taste - Very good. The crust on the quiche was flaky and buttery and the filling was flavorful without being overpowered with egg. I was a little disappointed that the quiche was not warmed all the way through and I would have liked a few more artichokes. The latte was fantastic! Nutella complimented the nutty flavor of the coffee and added all the sweetness you need to take the bitterness out of the espresso. It was served hot but not so hot that I burned my tongue. I really liked that it didn't taste like a Starbucks drink that was overly sweet or filled with flavored syrup. Wife said the banana bread was very good. 

Value - Average, $21 for a breakfast to go seems a little high at first but it was worth it because the flavors were on point

Service - good, counter service, friendly staff

Atmosphere - quaint, quiet, casual, great to lounge and read a book 

Facility - tables and chairs with a couple of couch seats, will maybe seat 20 people

Need to know - N/A

Would I come back - Yes

Would I go out of my way - Probably not for a coffee, but yes if I wanted to lounge

Review - You should probably know that I am not a very big fan of coffee and especially not quiche. However, the quiche looked so good that I had to try it and I was extremely satisfied. In fact, as I was eating it a passerby commented on how good it looked. The Nutella latte was the perfect complement to the quiche. I was in the area for an event and if I am ever in the neighborhood again I'll definitely be stopping by."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-02-23,4.0,"Malibu Diner is a solid diner in Manhattan. 

Service was friendly and efficient.  The place is clean and low key- exactly what a good diner should be.  

The food was good, too.  I tried their smash burger with onion rings and it hit the spot. 

Recommended!"
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-01-31,4.0,"Came here recently for a quick lunch and the staff  were great and fairly attentive. I was with a group of 11 and they got everyone's order done quickly and correctly. I ordered pancakes and eggs. Pancakes were pretty good, not as fluffy as I'd like but it got the job done. Eggs were simple but still effective. 

The price of most of the menu options were over $12 which is a bit overpriced for diner food to me, but then again it is New York. 

FYI: 

This place has a pretty wide variety of items. 

I was told that this place offers menus in
Braille if anyone in your party needs that accommodation."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-01-15,3.0,"I hadn't realized before today, but there are lots of diners in this part of Chelsea. 

The food here is good, I would say very much average. 

Servers are attentive, has a good feel, appear to be lots of regulars. 

A safe choice for breakfast."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-01-07,5.0,"Just walking around the city and we saw this place. I love diners and small eating establishments. 

The server was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad and it was so big! It was just a salad, and I couldn't even finish it. It was so good though. 

My friend got meatloaf and he LOVED IT. I am so glad that we stopped here and I look forward to going there again when I am back in the city."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-11-23,5.0,"Yes, I did have chicken soup and calamari. Yes, that's a weird combo lol. Needed the soup for the end of a cold/the fact that the wind was out to get me, needed the calamari because of a craving I was having. Calamari was surprisingly good for a diner? They added a little blue orchid which was literally the cutest thing. Soup was really solid, regular ole soup. 

Service was prompt and super friendly. Loved our server, I literally felt like he was my grandpa lol."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-08-29,2.0,"Extremely overpriced breakfast specials. Eggs Benedict was $18 !!! That's more expensive than several brunch joints in the west village. 
Ended up getting chocolate chip pancakes ($14.50) and an egg and cheese sandwich ($8.50). Service was decent for a Thursday morning and coffee was the best thing I had at the restaurant. They must have regular customers here. I was very surprised by the prices for the ambience and food.  Definitely a diner vibe, but not diner prices."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-02-08,3.0,"Mannn, I wanted to post a five star review, but of all the spots to snag breakfast in Chelsea, this is just not it. I really wanted to go inside and sit down somewhere on a rainy morning, and everywhere else was so packed, so I settled on this place. I had the eggs Benedict, which was slightly overpriced, and not fantastic. The Hollandaise was just kind of weird......like they left something out. The ham had a sweet flavor that didn't mesh well with the other ingredients, and I couldn't even really eat the English muffin. It did come with coffee and a small grapefruit juice, which may have been the best part of this meal. The potatoes weren't bad, but needed some serious salt and maybe a little bit of hot sauce.  Service was good, but everything else was pretty mediocre."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-11-28,4.0,"This place has so much seating!  If you have a big group and want a NY diner experience this place certainly fits the bill as  they  have ample counter bar service and booth seating.  Stick with the basics here -can't go wrong with coffee, omelette or bacon egg and cheese sandwich.  The French Onion soup was ok but would not order again.  See the earlier comment about sticking with the basics.  Service was fast, efficient and friendly.  Worth stopping in If you are in the neighborhood."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-10-20,5.0,"Had a wonderful NY traditional diner experience. Fresh donuts in abundance. Service was friendly with a little football razzing about our favorite teams. I ordered the asparagus omelette with hash browns & coffee. My friend ordered the thick French toast, bacon & eggs. Fast service at reasonable prices located right across from our hotel & many NY tourist attractions."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-02-24,5.0,Authentic 24 hour city diner. I love coming here as it's close to my late night job and the service is always swift and on point. Lots of table and counter space as well. Can't go wrong with a warm blueberry pie on a cold winter night.
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-06-25,3.0,"An a-okay diner. Fast, friendly service and plentiful diner food. Plenty of countertop seats and small booths."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-05-21,5.0,"I've been dining here for over 20 years. Always consistent with quality service and food. I don't live in the area anymore, but when I'm in NYC for work, I always make it a point to come here to eat."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-05-14,2.0,"Not. Great. The ambiance is cute but pretty normal for a diner. 

The service was pretty bad and we had empty water the whole time. 

But the food is why it has 2 stars. The worst eggs Benedict I've EVER had. Ever. Super bland and very fatty hollandaise. The English muffin was burnt and soggy(???) by the time it got to the table. And the potatoes were really bland and clumpy even though they were supposed to be home fries. I was disappointed. Not a huge fan. The French toast was really good but not making up for that atrocious hollandaise good.

Oh well. Just get the French toast"
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2018-09-22,5.0,"Incredibly fast and piping hot delivery. I religiously order the hungry man breakfast with the French toast. At $15 or so, it comes with either French toast, pancakes, or a waffle, eggs your way, home fries, ham, bacon, and sausage. It's a total steal. Aside from the home fries, which, despite having a good flavor, are always soggy/overcooked, the whole thing is so incredibly delicious. 

I find that other menu items are a little overpriced for it being a diner (it's like $6 for a side of bacon!), but the food is delicious, and as aforementioned, the delivery is reliable and timely. Will definitely order again. My favorite breakfast in the neighborhood."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-11-04,4.0,Went here for breakfast was ok nothing special but not bad either. Service was ok and the  prices are fair.
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-11-30,1.0,Super disappointed. Food was very low par. The quality of everything was lacking and overall not a good decision. Not worth it. The bagels taste like cardboard and there was zero grains of seasoning. The mash had uncooked(RAW) potatoes. Gross.
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-11-02,5.0,From San Diego and this place was such a gem of a place with great service and food. George was the first person who greeted us! I love him and his spirit! The food is good comfort food. I just want to say thank you George for your warm welcome to NY!!
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-11-02,5.0,Random breakfast pick.  Good choice.  George was a friendly guy and made breakfast so enjoyable.  Food is comfort food and good deal.  Unpretentious and totally down to earth place.
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-03-15,5.0,"Nice little hole in the wall type diner just a few blocks from MSG. Did a yelp search for diners and it bought me here. Glad I stopped by. I was craving a big man breakfast for dinner and the hungry mans breakfast didnt disappoint. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and taylor ham wow! The taylor ham was thinly sliced and the bacon was cooked to perfection. Eggs were the right temperature and the pancakes were great too. 

Loved the quick service. As soon as I sat down I got a glass of water and got my drink order in. Looks like a small place, but there are plenty of booths and a good amount of seats at the counter. If youre still hungry they have a nice selection of desserts too."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-03-08,5.0,Elizabeth our server was sweet and knowledge! The food came out quickly and hit the spot. Big portions! And there was no waiting in line!
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-02-09,1.0,"Worst food and service ever!!! Bacon must have been days old. Brittle and gray! We waited 20 minutes before getting our check. They didn't even refill our coffee. For the only diner in Hoboken, you need to step it up!!"
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-02-08,5.0,"I ordered a ham and cheese omelet, the best omelet that I ever had, the consistency and texture is perfect.  The coffee hit the spot when you had a bite of the omelet.  What else can you ask from the waiters, Roberto and Pedro, courteous and accommodating.  Perfect in every way and five star food and service.  Loving it."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-06-23,5.0,"Malibu brought me great comfort in a time of dark (hungover) need. Got the hungry man's breakfast w/some perfectly fluffed pancakes, 2 eggs over easy, home fries and breakfast meats. Everything tasted homemade. My friends enjoyed their eggs Benedict as well. This place is no fancy establishment but it was everything I needed for revival after a long night out."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-12-15,2.0,"Way overpriced, even for NYC....especially for average quality food. My scrambled eggs were initially runny, and when sent back they came back well done (neither of which I ordered). Home fries were bland. Husband's tuna wrap had barely any tuna in it and his salad was wilted. I expected better for those prices."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-01-02,5.0,This is such a wonderful gem! We are visiting they delivered to our hotel room and gave us a great deal! We got tons of food that was amazing and fresh. The price is great we all eat super well 5 of us for 120 with a good tip. Plus we had desert and all kinds of extras! They had all the silverware napkins and condiments ready and in the bag with extra. They even  brought it to our hotel room! You will love this place for some fresh food at a great deal. They where so sweet on the phone and when delivering!! I only have great things to say!

647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-09-01,1.0,"Really overpriced for what you get. Ambiance is non existent and really out dated. Now, this wouldn't be bad if the prices reflected that, but the prices are what you'd expect at a much nicer establishment. $19 for eggs Benedict with greasy spoon presentation. Walked toward the park and passed several charming restaurants with better prices and decor - we were really bummed that we wasted our breakfast here."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-11-17,5.0,"This is our favorite restaurant. Our home away from home. The food's fresh, the staff is awesome and it's affordable. Our waitress Lilly is always on point whenever we come we look for her."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-08-02,5.0,"I ave come here after seeing my doctor for years since beating cancer. Another good report and another delicious breakfast. Chocolate chip waffles are SO good. Fresh squeezed orange juice is the best and the coffee is slways terrific.  Nice clean place, comfortable,  affordable,  big portions and A+ service. The waitress is friendly and does an excellent job. Come here. You will come back!"
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2017-06-01,4.0,"24 hours... Check.
Standard selection of diner fare... Check.
Order prepared crazy fast... Well damn. Took two sips of the water that was promptly put on the table, and my BLT was in front of my face. 
I know it's an easy sandwich to assemble but our entire order arrived so fast our butts had barely warmed the seats. 
Also, the dinner specials are good until Midnight. Good deal. 

Seriously, it took me longer to write this short review than it took for our food to come out."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2017-05-27,3.0,"After a joke of a job fair I attended in the area I was hankering for some lunch in an air conditioned joint. Wearing a suit on a 90 degree NYC day really sucks!

Decent diner with plenty of lunch special options.  

Typical huge diner menu.

Fairly priced for the area. 

Plenty of seating as this place is large for a NYC diner space.

Attentive service.

Open 24 hours a day.

Hit the spot on a warm NYC afternoon. Soup and sandwich combo was just what I needed.

Bathroom could have been a bit cleaner. Even though, I still dropped the kids off at the pool after my meal here, then headed on out into the big city feeling as if I dropped a weight class."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2020-02-09,5.0,"Loved it! Had a fantastic veg omelette that came w potatoes (fresh--not your typical greasy, dry, diner home fries), juice, and coffee. Attentive service, good coffee, big/clean/bright space w  lots of seating---extensive menu."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2018-03-18,4.0,"We ate an early dinner there today and it was mostly a very positive experience.  I ordered the eggplant & shrimp parmesan and my husband ordered the chicken fajitas, both of which came with soup (it was stated as a ""cup"", but it was almost as big as a bowl).  We had the vegetable soup, which was tasty - and our entrees were delicious, plus the portions were generous (mine also came with two pieces of delicious pita bread).  The diner's interior is larger than you'd imagine from the street and it was very clean & comfortable (lots of booths in the front half and tables in the rear).  Also, they have an ""A"" rating from the Health Dept.

Our original server was pleasant when bringing us water, but then it became impossible to place our order because she was too busy having a lengthy conversation about computers with another customer.  Finally another server took our order and she was *very* friendly.

The cashier was UNfriendly, plus there was literally no space where I could even sign my credit card receipt; they had a huge pile of postcards in the very tiny space by the cash register, and the cashier seemed annoyed when I had to take the receipt elsewhere to sign it.  Still, the positives certainly outweighed the negatives."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-07-06,5.0,"This breakfast hit every tasting note I could have wanted. I ordered from the brunch menu in a Saturday. I picked the strawberry Sangria to go with my greasy fruit cup as well as iced tea. That was followed with my build your own 3-egg omelette. I chose bacon, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes. It comes with potatoes and your choice of toast but I swapped that out for buttermilk pancakes. The omelette was perfect with all ingredients in every bite and I think it was more than 3 eggs. The pancakes were fluffy and brown. The sangria was perfect and I enjoyed eating the fresh strawberries when I finished. I can't say enough about the service. Everyone was friendly and helpful and the place is clean. My entire meal was part of the brunch combo for $22.95 including the drinks, a bargain for  NYC. I will definitely return!"
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-12-27,2.0,This place has great reviews and I went with a friend to have lunch.  The fish and chips was not great and appeared to be cooked in a hurry. The food overall was okay but not great.  This place is a local neighborhood favorite with high prices for lunch!  I was not impressed by the service.  I doubt that I will be going back.
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2018-01-28,3.0,"Fast service, plenty of seating (no, really, this place goes back and back), clean bathrooms (I want the sink in the ladies room), and decent food. 

We came here after noshing on tots and drinking beer at Trailer Park Lounge down the street. This was the perfect ending to the evening with breakfast for a late-night dinner (I went with the Greek omelette which was good but not the best I've ever had). The homefries were okay but could have used a bit more seasoning. Overall, it's cheap diner food that is great for coating your stomach after destroying your insides with alcohol. If you're coming here looking for a 5-star meal, go elsewhere."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-07-25,2.0,"Great customer service. The food is regular for the prices. I could get a $6 chicken over rice at the gyro carts or $10 salad at a just salad store. It's awesome that it's opened 24 hours, great place to pee at 12am but you have to buy something get like a shitty coffee. Cheap prices for beer/drinks (not sure) double check."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2019-04-28,5.0,"Great food served by a friendly and professional staff. I grew up in the NY area and have some experience with diners, and this is one of the best. They offer a panoramic selection of breakfast choices, as well as sandwiches, panini, traditional entrees, salads, and everything else you expect at a diner. If you're not getting breakfast, make sure to order something with coleslaw because it's just right. 

Our group included a rabid carnivore, a dedicated vegetarian, and some in-betweens. Everyone left happy, full of juicy burgers, veggie omelets and sandwiches, and dessert from the almost hallucinatory selection of pastries in glass showcase. 

All the staff are great, but see if you can watch Sandra do her job. She gently but firmly takes control of the situation, collects the orders with high precision, and switches effortlessly between English and Spanish (maybe other languages too, I didn't hear any more while I was there). If you want to know how it's done in the big leagues, that's how it's done."
647,malibu-diner-new-york,2017-07-26,4.0,"Stopped by here right after my workout at the gym. I was starving, so I ordered the Eggs Florentine plus a large side of scrambled eggs. My waitress was very kind and attentive, and brought out my food quickly with a warm smile. 

The eggs were nicely poached, and when I broke the yolks they ran over the spinach and sliced English muffin. A warm, hearty breakfast indeed."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,I absolutely LOVE this place! I've been coming here since 2012 and it's remained a favorite despite working in various parts of the city. Best cappuccino in NYC and those almond croissants
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2019-10-15,5.0,"Really cute coffee shop with standing tables. Very cute fall designs! 

My chai latte was EXTREMELY hot that I burnt my tongue. So be warned. Pretty good though! 

I got the matcha cake which was good and almondy, the sea salt brownie which was SUPER good, the coconut ball which was good, but the SHOWSTOPPER WAS THE FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE. It was basically fudge. Get this."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2020-03-10,3.0,"Ordered a Dirty Chai and the expresso wasn't shining through, but fighting the mild spices. I did feel warmed after a sip of my drink and there was a lingering comfort which was pleasant."

This place is very nice! Not too much sit in space. But if you catch it at a down time it's perfect!

Lee one of the guys that works there is very nice! Check our their Instagram page and you will get a really good vibe of what they are about and how great their coffees and teas look. 

I'm deff going back. Actually as we speak I'm on my way there now."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2019-03-07,4.0,"Very small and cozy cafe with very limited seating. It only has a couch and few stools. I had ordered a small almond cappuccino, and it was pretty good. Not as good as Stumptown but I enjoyed it. I was hoping to try the green tea matcha cake but they weren't ready yet, since I came a half hour after they opened. I would definitely come back to try their matcha baked goods and latte!"
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2018-11-03,3.0,"I finally got a chance to stop into Ramini since I've been on a hunt to try chai tea lattes all over the city. The place is small. The crowd when I went around 7:30 wasn't bad. 

Customer service wasn't that friendly seemed more focus on getting people in and out. I get that. The drink I tried however I didn't like. The chai was not good to me and I think priced a little higher than other coffee spots in the area.

It was interesting to try but I won't be back..."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2018-08-10,3.0,"I liked this cafe, but had a really odd experience. I wanted tea but as one knows, the office is freezing in the summer and didn't want to have ice in it. The man behind the counter was nice, but said if he filled the cup all the way it would be an extra $2. I understand how ice does take up volume in a cup, but $2 ?!? It was almost as expensive as the tea itself. 

I tried the almond flour vegan (I think ?) matcha cookie as well and enjoyed it. It was crumbly, yet still moist and not too sweet. I would think about coming back if I were in the area, but would probably go to other places with more reasonable conditions first."

gluten free pastries! (ask, they aren't always labeled!)

coconut chia pudding!

Cashew milk yogurt !(didn't even know that was a thing)

Plus good coffee, all the milks, and super friendly staff!"
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2018-06-06,5.0,"Enjoyed their rose latte- warm, smooth, creamy. Also, I love the whole set up of the place from the walls to the tables and to the plants. It is quite small and gets busy around 10-11am. They have a few seatings, but Saturdays are usually for to go."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2019-02-21,5.0,"Possibly the best latte I have ever had and I'm a coffee snob. Perfect temp, perfect espresso suspended in the foam for that perfect first sip. Was only in NYC for a few days and went out of my way multiple times to go back. 

I was a barista at one of the first NorthWest style coffee shops opened on the East Coast back in the early 90s, went through a home roasting phase using multiple methods, etc. I know good coffee, this place has it. Go out of your way, it's worth it."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-12-12,4.0,"I really enjoyed my cold brew from Ramini. It was strong but smooth, with hints of chocolate. I also tried a green tea almond cake. It was a good treat - not too sweet but the almond provided a good flavor and richness to it. The best part was that while there was a line of about seven people, it moved very quickly. I was in and out with my order in less than ten minutes, unlike other swamped coffee shops. There aren't many seats, but it seemed like there were quite a few regulars stopping in on their way to work and the friendly staff knew their orders."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-08-16,4.0,A cute spot on 37th with good coffee. I needed to wake up and the caffeine kicked in nicely. I LOVE that they have brown sugar syrup. That is much needed on a hot summer day when your iced (insert coffee/espresso drink of choice) needs a lil sweetness without the granules sinking and staying in the bottom. I am certainly coming back here for my New York coffee fix.
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2016-02-03,4.0,"Ordered a iced soy chai latte.  It was ok, but i will not order it again.  It has a strong cardamom and cinnamon taste.  I prefer more of a ginger taste, but that's just my personal preference.  The baristas were nice and made sure to remind the person making my latte to use soy milk as I mentioned my milk preference later. 

I've had their cold brew before, and I like that so much better.  The cold brew is very smooth and less acidic then regular coffee."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-05-07,4.0,"The latte and matcha latte are pretty good, macarons are nothing special. But the service was nice when I went during a snowstorm. The barista was friendly and gave me an extra stamp on my loyalty card for coming out in the snow."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2018-06-12,5.0,"This is one of my favorite coffee places in the area. It's super welcoming, they open up the front so ppl can sit and enjoy the nice weather while sipping on a nice espresso. They also have vegan option bake goods and the staff is always so friendly. I'm hoping they'll get oatmilk as an option soon though :D"
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2018-01-23,4.0,"As it's right near work, I've been here a few times. Their matcha latte is excellent. Easily the strongest/best in the area. Cakes are fine. Macaron was fine also. Nice staff. Coffee is also good though I am generally not a coffee drinker."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-12-26,3.0,"Came in here on the run to a meeting. The coffee was pretty good and the service was nice. I was terribly impressed with the coffee and the latte was sorely lacking the good creme on top. I did not taste the food, but did see some people sitting with some food. There isn't a lot of space but it does seem like a convenient place to sit."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2015-09-08,4.0,"Nutella croissant was delish. Iced latte was too bitter for my taste. Daily samples on the counter and helpful staff but - $8 for the meal, which I believe to be overpriced.

Edit: the vanilla latte was amazing!"

NY Midtown West 
4pm Thursday 2nd April 2015
3 Stars

It's a pretty small space but there was a decent dozen people waiting in line. The girl in front of me said that she likes artesianal coffee but is only willing to pay $4 a cup because $5 and over is too expensive. Her friend was just smiling and nodding because she went next door to Dunkin. The line moved very quickly. I ordered the Kyoto instead of an espresso drink because of the 50 degree weather outside and the novelty of it. It costs $6.25 for 22 oz, which was like $2 more than the standard iced coffee). Kyoto Coffee is a super slow drip coffee that takes about 12-14 hours to brew. It supposedly less acidic and more aromatic. Unfortunately I am was underwhelmed by it. It was still astringent but less oily. I think if I go back I will get a cappuccino.

They offer two sizes for the pastries, regular and mini. It's a brilliant idea since everyone was just a little snack. I had a mini Nutella croissant. It was a bit hard and not very filled with the delicious hazelnut chocolate I was desiring."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2016-09-30,3.0,"3.5 stars for pretty good Iced Sattwa chai with almond milk ~$4 - though it pales in comparison to the Bakhti Chai served at Coffee Bar in SF. 

Will need to return soon to try their coffee!"
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2018-10-30,5.0,One of my favorite places for a cup of joe in the city. The owner Rami is very wonderful. The lattes here are smooth. I recommend tumeric latte as well. The prices are reasonable and staff is friendly.
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-02-19,4.0,"8th avenue in city can be a bit of a culinary wasteland so when Ramini opened my fingers were crossed. There is OK coffee in the neighborhood with Starbucks and Guy and Gallard but nothing that hits the high bar. Ramini hits that high bar, it is delicious, professional and nice. And to top it off the baked goods are excellent: cookies and sea salt brownies were amazing. if you're in the area, definitely worth the visit over those corporate coffee shops."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2018-06-12,4.0,"This place is definitely different and the guy who took our order definitely had knowledge on coffee to share! The hot mocha was a awesome and next on my list to try is the Kyoto coffee (good story and process behind it). The sea salt, peanut butter brownie was so on point and my friend who had the chocolate banana bread and share it with me loved it!"
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-12-21,4.0,A great spot for coffee and lattes done right in a small quaint space using quality coffee and ingredients. Festive with Christmas tree cheer and decorative Latte art blower your order the guys here know how to get you ready for your day. I had the Kyoto coffee which had a smooth yet citrusy taste to it which by the process is supposed to give you a sustained feeling of caffeine and it did all of that as i was powering my way through Timed Square enjoying the sites and eats.
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2016-08-09,5.0,"My coworkers and I come here a lot for coffee breaks and pre-work coffee. I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I do like a cold brew every now and then. Their cold brew has a nice slightly bitter taste, which I love. It's really good and the caffeine amount is good. 

I've never tried it, but I've heard their Kyoto coffee will really wake you up if you think you're ""immune"" to the caffeine in coffee from drinking it all the time. Also try their baked goods - they usually have a sample tray near the register, and they have croissants, macarons, and other yummy goodies.

What I love about this place is that the workers are super efficient and the line moves really fast!

Tip: don't forget to pick up a coffee loyalty card - any 10 drinks you buy gets you one free one!"
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2014-07-03,4.0,"Good spot for a coffee date, or for your morning/mid-afternoon perk.

Ramini crafts delicious espressos ($2.75; credit accepted, no minimum) and lattes ($4 for 10 oz.).

Mornings expect a little wait, as they get a lot of foot traffic. The line moves fast, thankfully. Friendly service."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-11-04,5.0,I had an amazingly smooth Kyoto drip yesterday and today had a wonderful latte.  The owner and his staff were very nice and the atmosphere was clean and neat.  I had the salted Caramel macaroons and they were great as well!
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2016-11-02,4.0,Very cute fancy coffee date style place. Coffee was very good chocolate chip cookies are amazing $2 each and cappuccino is $4 each for small. Coffe was a bit bitter for my taste but had a great taste. The guy very quickly makes an awesome effortless design with the milk in your coffee such an unexpected surprise. Only open till about 5pm.
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-07-10,4.0,"Got an iced latte with macadamia milk (I love how there is no additional charge for replacing it with regular milk!). The pastries, especially the orange almond pound cake, look delicious and I will definitely be back for those. I also liked the decor on the inside with the handwriting on the walls and the marble tables. There's enough sitting that it's a great place to catch up with friends, than just a grab-and-go coffee place.

Would give this a five stars if there are more selections of cold drinks (ie: matcha latte comes only hot)"
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2016-04-21,5.0,"Since last weekend I began to really fall in love with flat white and am trying various coffee shops these days to look for a better one comparable with laughing man in TriBeCa. Ramini definitely belongs to that group.

Got in right before 720 so there aren't that many of people. I quickly got attracted by their inside decoration - with broken wall and mirrors, interesting! The skinny flat white smoothly melt in my mouth the second I took my first sip, however the scent stayed. It was definitely the top three flat whites that I have tried.

Haven't tried yet but their macarons also look delicious to me."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2018-06-19,5.0,"I really appreciated both the strong flavor of the coffee but also the ambiance of the cafe. I got to the cafe pretty early in the day but a lot of their baked goods were already sold out, which I think is a testament to how delicious their baked goodies are. But honestly, their coffee is good enough to keep you coming even without the treats. I was most pleased with the fact that the barista made sure my cafe late was finished off with latte art even though it was in a to go cup and was going to have a lid on it seconds after I received it. I do think it's a reflection of the kind of pride and ownership baristas have when they do the little things right. Even aside from the coffee, I really liked the decorations and furniture and succulents / plants that littered the cafe. It definitely brought a happy and one with nature kind of vibe."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2016-06-10,4.0,"Really classy, rare find in a mostly desolate, Starbucks-filled neighborhood. 

We ordered a gen mai cha green tea and a a latte with coconut milk. They have so many non-dairy milk options which is awesome (including macadamia milk and coconut milk). Both the tea and the latte were a little weak. 

We also got the sea salt brownie which was an amazing combination of really light and really chewy - highly recommended. 

The seating situation is a little sparse - they have two tall tables in the window (8 seats total) and two park-styles benches inside. Better than nothing! We enjoyed people-watching behind the plants."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2018-06-13,5.0,"My favorite coffee spot! Their vanilla iced late with almond milk is my go-to, but their cold brew is great as well. Would recommend the croissants (if they're available-they sell out very quickly in the am) or a scone. They're all homemade and absolutely delicious. In the afternoon, they switch over to desserts so another excuse to go back. The chocolate chip cookie with sea salt is my favorite. I go here almost every day!"
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2014-01-23,4.0,"This place is a godsend since it's the only respectable coffee joint in the area. It's a coffee desert in Midtown West, man.

Anyway, the space is small (only two or three tables), but that's to make room for all the equipment and food (just some light stuff).

Good cappucino, but I've also tried their Japanese style cold brew and wasn't too impressed.

If you're into coffee, definitely check them out!"
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2018-09-04,1.0,"I used to love this place where there were tables and seating for people to talk and work and enjoy their coffee. This past year, the owners have continuously redesigned their layout to discourage people from sitting. Despite all the space, they insist that customers grab their coffee and go. I am disgusted by that. Also, the coffee is too bitter."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-02-25,4.0,"the cafe is hidden at the corner, a little difficult to find it. do remember turn around the corner, and look for a white big shop sign.
I ordered a small soy latte as usual. Definitely the best latte art by using soy milk that I've ever seen. Coffee is too strong to my taste as they added two shots of espresso in the small latte. The aroma is not as perfect as seven grams coffee. but I guess it's a personal taste, some people may prefer Ramini's boldness and intensity.
The overall store decoration is chic and cute. Will try work/read over there on a weekend afternoon :)"
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2015-08-07,5.0,"Really beautiful spot for a very solid espresso right in the Garment District. The inside of the bar is beautiful with patchy exposed brick. The counter staff were quiet and reserved but very friendly and knowledgeable. All of the espresso drinks were comparably priced with high end craft coffee bars ($4+) and they even have a large Kyoto! The pastries looked wonderful and I will definitely be coming back for that espresso brownie...
I personally got an iced mocha and it was WONDERFUL."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-10-01,5.0,Giving all of the stars for this place. It was such a lovely environment and the coffee was top notch. I had a macadamia nut latte and it was superb. Hands down one of the best lattes I've ever had. I come to this area every week for auditions and had no idea this place existed until yesterday. I will be going back!
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2017-03-06,4.0,"Excellent espresso. One of the best in the city.

Zero seating and no bathroom have me giving this place 4 stars instead of 5."
648,ramini-espresso-bar-and-cafe-new-york,2013-03-06,4.0,"I definitely would have missed this place had I not known to look for it. A cute coffee shop in an otherwise bleak area surrounded by tacky fashion stores and chain restaurants.

There is a wide array of pastries (macaroons, croissants) in addition to their impressive coffee options. I opted for a latte. At $4 for a small latte, it was a bit pricey but it was actually very delicious.  Plus, there was a cool design made with the foam. 

If you're willing to shell out some money, check this place out. It's a nice alternative to Starbucks."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-09,4.0,"Cute little place. Warm and comfortable. Indoor seating in nice with bar, large table, littler tables. Love the windows as this is a corner location. Sit and relax with a drink and watch the city buzzing.

Having ginger green tea unsweetened with actual peach slices in it. I like it."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-08,4.0,"This place could have gotten a five star.  

The mood: great. 

Seating: adequate. 

Service: good. 

Bathroom: available. 

WiFi: free

Drinks: all right (I got the rose latte) 

Issue: after placing my order I went to sit down and I guess they didn't put that in since I saw other people who ordered after me get their drinks and I was just there waiting. If I didn't go up and ask, I felt like they never would have made it. 

But after telling them twice, the drink came and it tasted pretty good."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-23,4.0,"Small cozy coffee shop. Average prices.
Stopped by to get some work on my laptop done. The sales associate was very friendly and had beautiful accent (possibly British). She confirmed they had WiFi available.
I ordered a cup of ginger tea and avocado toast. The tea was good even though they use tea bags (not loose tea). The avocado toast was OK: (a) instead of actual avocado, they use guacamole-looking mush, (b) there were three tiny pieces of salmon on the top - I was expecting more, (c) they did have some sour cream which seemed to be a nice touch, and (d) the toast itself was pretty good, had some seeds in it.
The internet ended up not working, so I just enjoyed the toast and the tea and moved on to Starbucks, that has working internet... oh well."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-13,3.0,"FYI to the Yelpsphere:  they no longer have the cool drinks served in the lightbulb.  If that's the reason you wanted to go here, they don't have it anymore.  When I asked about it, the barista was kind of rude about it.  Oh, I'm sorry y'all had a cute marketing thing going and it drew me in.  The coffee I got was just meh.  I just got an iced vanilla coffee and there are better ones out there.  I might come back. I might not.  It was just a meh experience."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-10,5.0,"Yes. Yes. Yes.

One of the best cappuccinos I've had! Very smooth! Definitely one of my faves. Now that's it's getting hotter, I'm loving their iced oat latte! I find myself coming here almost every morning. 

Avocado shake (minus the bananas, almond milk instead of coconut milk) and avocado toast are on point too! 

Staff is always friendly and service is quick. Love this spot."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-28,4.0,"I had a good time at Idea Coffee. I stopped by around Sunday noon to get something to eat after a workout. There were plenty of seats to choose from. I ordered a bagel sandwich and a chocolate  croissant, and the staff was nice enough to warm up the croissant. Coffee is pretty good and you can choose from various kinds of milk alternative. The iced tea section looked pretty good too. I'd like to try some other drinks next time I'm here."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-11,5.0,"Honestly this is one of my favorite cafes in the city right now, they have good coffee and free wifi so you can do your work with no problem. 

I tried their caramel macchiato and it was really good. It had just the right amount of sweetness and it was at a good price. 
Their staff is friendly and really attentive and thats a plus! 

I also like how they have events like BTS birthdays and anniversaries and their special drinks like the (bts latte) vanilla latte, kookie latte (beetroot latte), purple monster latte (blueberries, raspberries, and milk) and their blue latte was very good. 

I would definitely come back for another grab of coffee."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-15,4.0,"Good atmosphere to catch up with a friend or get some work done. 

I ordered the green tea latte with almond milk and it was good. Note: it doesn't come with the sugar content that Starbucks dishes out - it's true matcha!"
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-10,4.0,"One of the best hot chocolates I have ever had!  If you like cocoa-y hot chocolate that actually tastes like chocolate then idea coffee is where it's at.  The toast I had, on the other hand, was just ok.  I felt it was a little on the bland side and even though I saw them put cream cheese on it I could barely taste it.  The portion size was great as they loaded the toast with greens, tomatoes, and mozzarella.  The effort was definitely made!  The service was quick and the staff was average friendly.  

The coffee shop itself is cute with a cool vibe without being overly pretentious.  I would definitely come back and likely pass on the food but sample other beverages!"
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-07,4.0,This is a good place to get work done. I am always at my maximum productivity when I work here. No wonder it is called Idea Coffee. A lot of tourists stop by to look at their paper maps and find out where they want to go next. Unfortunately the food isn't great. But you go for the seating and the ambience!
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-02,3.0,"This coffee shop is POPPING I couldn't believe how busy it was! There were like no seats available and not much room to stand because people were waiting in line to order. 

The design includes large high ceilings which reminded me of an upscale log cabin in the woods. 

I wouldn't come here for the food. It's pricey (almost $10 for bagel with lox!) and I'd say they're known for their drinks more than a few baked goods. I tried the everything everything bagel (~$3 with cream cheese) and it was alright. I expected it to have a stronger flavor, be warmer, and just overall taste better. 

I also cracked and got the green light drink, and considered a special drink inspired by a kpop star called the kookie latte. The green light drink was refreshing and healthy, and surprisingly sweet given the fruits and vegetables it contained. Do it for the 'gram and keep the cute bottle and light--people kept asking where I got it! 

Service was alright. They seemed harried and busy, and weren't very personable for a Saturday afternoon that seemed like prime business time. I probably won't be back given the large amount of coffee shops in Manhattan to choose from, particularly ones with better service and food."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-17,5.0,"I came here because I saw they had Light Bulb Drinks. I was disappointed when I found out they no longer sold them after arriving.

Despite my disappointment, I still managed to find Joy in my cup of joe. I ordered a regular drip coffee with oat milk. Came out to $3.70. Typical NYC price.

The space is small, but intimate/cute. There is the right amount of noise to get work done but also feel nobody is listening into what you are doing. I like how there is a diverse range of people here. It's not like a hipster ONLY cafe. There are Wallstreet bros, Creatives, Freelancers, Families, Young/Old, Couples, you name it.

I found a cute little nook staring at the urban jungle as I got work done. Highly recommend and did I mention the WIFI is free and pretty fast?"
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-19,5.0,"My favorite cafe in town--a secret oasis. They have high-quality matcha and fresh mixed tea drinks & smoothies. Also love their avocado toasts and pastries. Miamiam. Spacious (!) with large tables and window seats.

I met the owner when helping with an event for NYC BTS ARMY (kpop intl sensation!). She was so helpful, thoughtful and creative. She's an army herself and genuinely cared about everyone who came to the event."

649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-10,3.0,Typical coffee shop experience.. nice place to work and chill. A bit rough on the edges
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-14,4.0,"I saw reviews on the ham and cheese croissant being cold in the middle, sadly mine was too. Guess they need to toast it a little longer, still tasted good! I also got an iced coffee. Coffee was nice and strong, not bitter."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-26,5.0,Excellent tasting coffee and cute home-y atmosphere. The avocado toast was a bit oily but I enjoyed it!
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-01,4.0,"This place had been on my list for the longest time and since I was in the area, I stopped by. There's plenty of seating, from smaller tables to larger ones and stools along the wall. Service was super quick--I ordered a golden latte and it was ready almost as soon as I got settled into a chair. The golden latte was made of almond milk, turmeric and some sweetener and I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it. It was my first time trying one and I was afraid that either the turmeric would be overwhelming or it would be too heavily sweetened to counteract the turmeric but everything was very well balanced. My only qualm was that I asked for it 'for here' but I was given a paper cup. But besides that, I enjoyed both my stay and my drink!"
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2017-12-22,4.0,"You probably don't expect something so cute and cozy in midtown Manhattan.

Idea coffee has careful  style, with a large high ceiling space  warm chocolate brown wood walls,  and digitalizes screens imaging heaters there was an easy ski lodge motif escape. 

The space is large and there are plenty of tables but space was fairly popular and full. 

Idea coffee is like a Starbucks with a little more personality.   Coffee is decent and at about the same price point as Starbucks.

Food is a side note with muffins and stuff.

If you need somewhere to rest in this area - this place works - it has a restroom too. 

Summary -
Large space 
Lots of tables 
Mainly coffee 
Restroom 
Fast service"
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-10,4.0,"Conveniently located cafe, not too large but several big tables make it easy to find a space. Large selection of coffees, teas, frozen shakes, as well as typical cafe foods such as bagels and avocado toast. Not a bad choice if you're in the area."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-13,3.0,Idea is a nice well run coffee shop. They have some food and a good amount of work space. I ordered the green smoothie which was on the thin side but pretty good and made with coconut milk. That alone would have warranted 4 stars but I also order avocado toast and it sucked. It was $10 it was on the small side for the price and as good as it looks it was pretty bland.
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-01,4.0,A great spot for your morning almond latte and croissant.  Take it to go or grab a seat at one of the communal tables.
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-17,4.0,"Nice coffee shop, decent coffee, nice tea and smoothies. Love the Avo-holic Shake! Decent prices and fresh ingredients. Very nice service, friendly staffs and decent speed. Not crowded at all so pretty quiet and chill. Good to read and relax, study, work, or catch up with friends. Quite a few tables and seats and welcome to take them to go as well. Nice and cute interior."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-20,3.0,"After passing by this shop many times on my way to work, my friends and I decided to stop in and order the lightbulb drinks.

Although I'm aware that these are mainly for show, I would expect a better tasting drink when I'm paying that much. It was an odd consistency. Sort of like juice, sort of like a smoothie.

I will have to go back in and give their coffee a try, but would not really recommend the lightbulb drinks unless you're a huge foodie and have to try it!"
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-04,5.0,"This little cafe is really nice, even though its always busy.. the food is good, the coffee is great and the atmosphere is pretty nice if you aren't in a rush. 

The staff is friendly, helpful, fast and are attentive to guests, as an avid coffee enthusiast I dislike going to places with burned coffee beans.. but in this place, everything is fresh. 

This is definitely a must if you are in the area."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2017-10-24,4.0,"We stopped here on a whim and I'm so glad we did. While waking around we kept spotting people holding these smoothies in cute light bulbs that had straws attached with a removable flashing light. 

We finally found it right across from the Museum of Sex! We ordered the Green Light and waited. The ambiance was similar to a coffee shop - (note: only one bathroom and code is given by the front desk). 

The Green Light tasted very refreshing and surprisingly sweet for the amount of veggies they put in. I would recommend this pricey drink (minus 1 star) for people that want to detox but they are definitely playing to the novelty of drinks in a light bulb with unnecessary flashing lights."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-24,5.0,Great place to grab a quick coffee near K-Town. The staff are very well trained and brew very meticulously. Layout is really good and surprisingly spacious given the location. The baristas regularly place in competition so have them whip you up a latte with next level latte art!
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-12,3.0,"The teas were very good, vibe pleasant, the place is cozy.  I was disappointed by tea being served in disposable cup. Even though we stayed in and didn't have takeout. What a waste"
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-18,5.0,Came here for BTS event ^-^ this is my second time coming. The special drink for J-Hopes birthday was Green Hope. It was very good! I also recommend the Berry blush tea! The employees are very nice and the whole cafe was decorated for J-Hopes birthday. They also decorated everything for Jins birthday too!
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-19,5.0,"Came here for  BTS bday event hehe and it was so cute. It's cozy and everyone was nice despite the place being busy for the event, which is often rare in NY.. would highly recommend. I had the speciality latte for that day which is not something I would normally order but it was good. Hope I can stop by next time I am near Ktown to try out their regular offerings.

There are plenty of tables to work from and chat."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-15,4.0,"Did I really just pay almost $7 for an iced vanilla latte? Yes. Did I also just maybe have the best iced vanilla latte I've ever had? Frankly, yes."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-16,4.0,The location is at a very convenient location.  The clientle is more civil than the vagabonds found in the chains.  The latte I had was very tasty and the beans were not burnt.  I plan to come by every time I'm in K-Town for dinner.
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-19,5.0,One of the only coffee shops that has sugar free almond milk! Love the atmosphere and the vibe. I sat and worked using the city free WiFi (theirs wasn't working) and had a great experience
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-11,4.0,"I stopped in while I was early for an appointment across the street. 

It was an early Saturday morning and I was without my coffee fix of the day. 

It's a cute space with surprisingly a decent amount of seating. I ordered a small black coffee with a ham and cheese croissant. 

The croissant tasted fresh and was super flaky as it should be. 

The service could have been better. 

Still, this place is a great place to sit and relax before starting your day."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-10,3.0,"The coffee is good but expensive, even compared to high end coffee shops. Almost $5 for just a ""large"" medium-sized iced coffee is too expensive, as the Cold Brew is even more. 

I also don't like that they add ice to the milks and cream on the side. I get why they do it, but it severely dilutes the taste as the whole milk tastes like skim milk. This is just lazy as no other coffee shop does this."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-02,1.0,"Horrible service 
Got my order wrong after asking 4 times
Gave my order to another person
A stupid ham and cheese croissant
Then it was cold inside 
Never again!!!!!!"
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-17,5.0,"What this place has to offer when it comes to food/coffee, is just beyond great! I just stopped by casually this past Saturday 6/15 and got just a simple Avocado toast to go and it's really worth trying. I really didn't expect, but it's really fulfilling and very delicious. That was my very first visit and the staff was friendly as well. That experience brought me back today to get an Iced Macchiato to go and its taste is so unique and if you're thinking about visiting this place, you really need to give it a try. I'll definitely be back and refer it to others. Great coffee spot!"
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-19,5.0,We walked in on Wednesday night. The place had plenty of tables available. Our decaf latte was delicious. It was smooth with nice foam. Service was quick and friendly. I went back for regular latte and it was also amazing. They take Ritual app.
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-14,2.0,"Good coffee, but don't expect good service if you show up relatively soon to when they close. We made sure they knew that we were aware of when they close and would be gone by then, yet the staff seemed oddly pissed off. They were  slamming chairs in around us, loudly complaining about us in the back, and locked the door behind us as soon as we stepped out (before they were even closed). It's not my problem if you don't like the time your shop closes, I know the service industry sucks (been there) but it's easy to not be a prick especially when the guests aren't being assholes in the first place."
649,idea-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-27,4.0,"Got a ham and cheese bagel from here and preferably would rather have scrambled eggs on there, I'm sure I could've ordered it that way. Ordered two coffees and added coffee and flavoring to them. Cute spot that even a lot of locals don't even know about."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2020-05-02,5.0,"The rose matcha latte is something ELSE. It's very pretty, floral, and spacious inside, and I've come here to work on my laptop a few times and always end up with a few tea beverages. Their rose gold dip is excellent- cookies and fresh strawberries to dip in a sweet creamy pink sugary dip, it feels very decadent. They're always so sweet at the counter and they always get my order right. Delivery is crazy fast and always packed well and neatly, no spills. One of my absolute favorite neighborhood spots."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2020-02-17,5.0,"Small tea shop that has more of a take-out feel to it. They have great selection of teas and tea lattes. Some of them are pretty trendy like matcha lavender and turmeric flavors. Their rose tea latte is excellent which is my favorite. 

One time I also tried their afternoon tea. Some may not like it since it's not traditional afternoon tea options as it doesn't have scone and jams or finger sandwiches, but more like real deal sandwiches. It's $30 that easily fills up 2 people but unlike other places, tea is not included. Sandwiches are decent. What I liked the most about it was they added their own creativity to it like the multi-grain granolas and pink hummus. The tower is decorated with real edible flowers. They were amazing."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2020-02-20,3.0,"Bland.
Average latte. 
Wouldn't spend $11 on the toast here again.
Or the tiny waffle. 

The latte art was nice I'll give them that."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2020-02-01,4.0,"Sometimes I am a sucker for looks. Blank Slate Tea is a girly lunch spot in a very random neighborhood. It's got those beautiful pastel pinks all over the place and the attention to detail is insane. There's vintage kitchen ware spread around. These places are the kinda joints I throw money at. They're my kryptonite. 

The food is also in that girly, trendy and west coast vibe. You still have your avocado toast, healthy bowls, kombucha on tap and cookies enhanced with rose or matcha. Shut the front door! I can't get enough of this girly heaven. 

I want for the $13 turmeric quinoa bowl. It comes with an egg and avocado, two ingredients I live off of. I really wanted that kombucha. Treated myself to a rose cookie for later. I would add more rose, still beautiful and a classic sugar cookie. 

Would love to come back with a cute gang of anime kids that are super into health and pink lace. 

I'll see ya next time I venture back into the hood. A hidden little morsel that it not easily forgotten. And I hear the banshee screams of kombucha on tap. Bahahhhaha."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-09-10,5.0,"Such a great place for a tea date, business meetings, or in my case - celebrating my mom's engagement! 

I planned a mom + daughter date and our first stop in the morning was here to get tea and to try out the tea tier. We'd both never had high tea (or afternoon tea) and felt super fancy eating small sandwiches with our pinkies up. Haha! 

The service was lovely as Ashley, the co-founder, greeted us and the staff took our order, ensuring we got the rose tea that we wanted (they offer so many different options of rose tea!). They also offer a variety of milk options (including oat milk). 

For our order, we got rose tea, matcha tea, and the tea tier which came with [Tier 1] macarons, brownies, strawberry slices + [Tier 2] pink hummus toast, avocado toast + [Tier 3] 6 sandwiches (2 of each variety, my favorite was the caprese sandwich with fresh mozzarella, tomato, greens, and balsamic vinegar). For breakfast or brunch, I'd say the portions were enough for 2-3 people. We had leftover sandwiches and dessert and got it in a to-go box. 
Their matcha tea is strong, pure matcha (not the sugary dessert kind) which we loved!  

I met Ashley at a female founders event a few weeks prior and learned of her story co-founding the business with her husband. She's super awesome and I got to say hi when I came in. For quality service, tea or coffee in a cute cafe, stop by and you'll probably see Ashley behind the counter greeting everyone with a huge smile."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-08-08,2.0,"I have been wanting to try this tea spot for a while, due to the many specialty drinks and all the Instagrammable photos I came across. The decor was pretty in pale pink and the exterior had a full-length mirror with the words ""Hey there Beau-tea-ful"" in gold letters. The wallpaper was covered in light purple and yellow flowers, green leaves, while the cushy couches were pink. Another part of the cafe had varying shades of pink with cool lights, tall square tables with clean white counters and tall chairs with shiny gold seats. 

To order, you have to do so in the front, grab a number and the staff will bring it over to your seat. 

I ordered the Butterfly Lavender Lemonade, which was almost $6! I had Butterfly Pea Tea while in Thailand, which is purplish-blue in color and tastes absolutely delicious, so I was expecting that flavor mingled with delicate lavender and refreshing lemonade. The Butterfly Pea Tea, which was a dark blue shade and Lavender Lemonade which was white, were served separately. The idea is to mix both liquids together to make the drink turn purple in front of your eyes. I thought this was a really unique and fun way to enjoy a drink. Unfortunately, the taste wasn't there. The Butterfly Pea Tea was nothing like it should be and there was absolutely no flavor of lavender. There was a very light bit of lemonade taste that I was able to discern. I was disappointed by the drink and thankfully, I was allowed to have something else. 

I decided to try one of the desserts: Rose gold dip with strawberries and cookies. At $12, the cost was quite steep and overall not worth it. I did like the presentation though. This came on a black rectangular black plate with 8 strawberries and 8 cookies. There were flecks of gold on the plate and a sizeable pentagon-shaped bowl with rose-flavored dip with edible gold in it. This was by far the best part! There was a delightful, strong flavor of rose and was beautifully smooth and creamy. Both the strawberries and cookies were not very good. The strawberries were not completely fresh, red and sweet. As for the cookies, it's the cheap store-bought butter cookies. For the price, I expected gourmet cookies of different kinds. 

The folks behind the counter were pretty nice and friendly. The atmosphere was lovely, but the quality of the drinks and food was not there, especially for the high prices being charged. I don't plan on coming back."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-12-10,3.0,"We came in to Blank Slate Tea after having a quick omakase lunch a few blocks over. There was a nice corner spot that fit 3 people, so we ordered and snagged the table. My cousins split a pot of tea and I had their matcha rose latte.

My cousins really liked their tea and it was an excellent value - I think it was a whole pot for about $6. I didn't really enjoy my matcha rose latte.  I've had matcha rose lattes before and in the past it has always been a hint of rose with matcha being the predominant flavor. The rose was a punch in the face here and I struggled to finish my latte.

I'll definitely be back to Blank Slate if I'm in the area, but I think I may make a slightly different drink choice next time.

Staff were very friendly and nice - service was efficient and quick."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2020-01-03,4.0,"Super cute decor. They also have a lot of non-coffee choices, which I love because not everyone drinks coffee! Looks like they have a solid food menu but I didn't get to try it. I would return if I am in the neighborhood."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2020-01-28,3.0,"1st time here. I was very excited before coming since we planned it for a birthday celebration.  My friends and I thought it was a bigger space judging by the photos. It's actually pretty small and they sat us at 2 small round tables placed together. However, we really enjoyed all the teas. Would recommend this as a casual place to sit in or order tea to go."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-09-11,3.0,"I have heard great things about this place, particularly their matcha beverages. So I went there to try matcha latte. The place is charming, small but cosy, decorated in a light pink palette. I ordered matcha latte and in a few minutes it was served in  a paper cup without giving me an option. I truly hoped I would sit down and enjoy my 5.17$ ( plus tip) matcha but alas:-) matcha latte was good but not better that I've had elsewhere"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-04-19,5.0,"Comfortable spot to hang out for a bit or just grab a drink to go quickly. 
Very wide selection of teas, and the cold brew is pretty good if you're more of a coffee drinker. 
Food looked great, but portion sizes seem fairly small for the prices"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-01-27,2.0,"Two stars for the friendly service and cute/pink interior decor.

However, the food and drink are not that great. The blueberry waffle had a purple sauce that tasted like some sort of lavender-scented paint. The turmeric quinoa bowl had no flavor (I had to constantly add salt to make it somewhat edible). The rose latte had a perfect presentation, but was very watered down. Grace St's rose latte is much better.

Overall, do no recommend."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-02-12,4.0,"Very aesthetic, peaceful little cafe with some delicious items. The decor is white and pink and the entire place is adorable. This page says it's good for work but I would disagree with that. I came here to get some work done but in the 2-3 hours I was here, it seemed more like a hangout spot since I was the only one working. The tables were pretty small especially if you're using a mouse (my laptop was half off the table in this picture) and there's no bathroom which seems a bit counter intuitive for people doing work. 

I got an iced rose tea latte and a matcha yogurt bowl. The iced rose latte was delicious and not too sweet, which I liked. The matcha yogurt bowl was very filling and tasted really great. Contrary to the name, they also serve black coffee which was pretty solid."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2018-12-26,5.0,"This place is...incredible? Which, given my dining predilections, is a particular compliment. I'm so not into the avo toast/instagram-picture friendly breakfast spots, so I ordered from here really reluctantly. Also, I've ordered from Blank Slate Coffee + Kitchen a bunch and have been disappointed, so I wasn't expecting big things. 

Boy, was I surprised. I had the toast with beet hummus ($9) which was filling and absolutely delicious. It came with radishes, goat cheese, mint, and black sesame artfully arranged on top. It was a little mushed from transit but still looked beautiful when it arrived. And god, I can't stress enough - it was GOOD. 

I also had the matcha soda with boba ($5) which was citrusy, refreshing, and didn't have the bitter dirt taste that I find matcha frequently has. It was also a good portion - they didn't fill the cup up half with ice like most places are guilty of doing. 

All in all, yum. I'm excited to order again and try some new things on the menu (or not lol, the beet hummus toast was amazing...)."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-03-10,4.0,"I came here for breakfast with my friend on a snowy Saturday morning and this little cafe was a delight! We were lucky to find the last seats in the super delicate pink space. We ordered a rose latte, blueberry lavender waffle, AEC, and avocado burrata sandwich. 

The blueberry lavender waffle was my absolute favorite because of the earl grey syrup! It looked beautiful and tasted as amazing as it looked! The AEC was my second favorite-- the avocado and cheddar egg sandwich was really nice on the everything southern style biscuit. The avocado burrito sandwich was also delish with a nice serving size of avo. The rose latte was probably my least favorite-- I wish this was a rose coffee based latte instead of a tea latte. However, it looked beautiful!

Overall, this is a great place for a fun lunch to go with gal pal. There's not a ton of space so I wouldn't bother going with more than 1-2 other people. Definitely worth a visit!"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,"I adored stopping in here for my rose latte and dinner one afternoon.  I'd recommend making a rezzie through Open Table because they're always busy, but if you're in the city alone for a business trip, I'd recommend still going and getting the tiered tea for two and make it a tea for one and bring your leftovers home because you'll definitely get several meals out of it.  The avocado and hummus toasts weren't just pretty, they're some of the best toast I've ever had.  The finger sandwiches were super flavorful and delicious, and I was pleased that my rose latte wasn't toxic tasting, sometimes places just don't make them correctly, and that wasn't the case for here.  Def def def going to come back, they have the cutest to go cups for lattes too.  My service was also awesome, just a pleasant experience all around."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-08-21,4.0,"Very cute place. As someone whose favorite color is pink, very matched my ""aesthetics"". I had their avocado toast and it was so beautiful and delicious! Will definitely come back again sometime to try some of their other foods and drinks!"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2018-11-25,3.0,"I only came here because the pink lattes lured me and I was pretty disappointed.  I had expected a mind blowing latte because of the rave reviews, but I feel like the packaging/presentation is more emphasized and disappoints when it concerns the overall important qualities such as the drinks, pricing, and etc.  I think I spotted about ten girls oohing and ahhing over the place.  YES, it's pretty inside, but the drink thoroughly disappointed me.  My eyes were feasting, but my palate said it needed more creamer or milk in the latte.  Also the smell of the rose bits reminded me of rose scented rosaries.  I didn't bother ordering any of the food because for the prices it didn't seem a good exchange.

If you're a Instagrammer or someone who likes to pose annoyingly sexy with your food then you'll like this place because I could see a diehard photo whore liking this place despite the prices."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2018-11-26,4.0,"Blank Slate Tea is an offshoot of a popular similarly-named Murray Hill coffee and brunch spot, swapping out the former's cappuccinos and exposed brick for matcha lattes and pink couches. Though it may be Instagram-bait, it delivers surprisingly satisfying food and inventive drinks, and it's entirely welcome in the aesthetic desert of the East 30s.

They offer several iced and hot teas, including some premium single-origin teas, alongside kombucha and cold brew on tap. I went for a matcha soda ($5), which was citrusy and refreshing, and my boyfriend had some kind of forgettable oat milk-based tea latte.

I had a turmeric quinoa bowl ($12) which was very good despite its ubiquity-- the kale was treated right and not too bitter, the poached egg was perfect, and the coconut-turmeric drizzle was quite tasty. My boyfriend had a smoked salmon sandwich ($12) that was well-executed.

Service is counter-based, friendly, and quick. Though the space is composed and photogenic, it's really more of a fast-casual setting. Drinks are a bit overpriced, but food is reasonable. I predict I'll be having more brunches here in the future."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-06-19,5.0,"Great coffee and tea place.

Blank slate tea is really nice tea place near 31-madison area. I ordered coffee by rirual application. They prepared well and flavor was so good.

Kind employee and I saw lots of intereting menues here. I will be back soon!"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-06-27,3.0,"I've gone here before and got a rose tea latte, which was sweet and good. The spot is really cute and aesthetically pleasing... good for the instagrammers. 
I went here today with my friend, who got a cold brew, and the guy working behind the counter was so odd and off-putting! 
We asked him what his favorite drink was as we were studying the menu and he replied ""here?"" we were like.. ummm yes here! Obviously we aren't asking your favorite starbucks drink.  And then he said there isn't much to choose from. 
I was thinking about getting one of their drink specials, which was a ginger something latte, and he told me he didn't have the ingredients for it. Just very odd service."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2020-01-16,2.0,"It's pretty place the dishes look really beautiful it's very Instagramable but the food is not really that good. But if your taste is more ""if you like avocado toasts and stuff are you might really like it personally I did not really like it I ordered the tea tier and lavender Macha late. The much are late was pretty strong, about the lavender was a really strong the latte was okay the tea tier not a big fan."

(But the rose tea latte is super pretty and tastes delicious!)The zatar salad was kinda bland and the veggies tasted a bit old. The avocado toast was okay, nothing really to write home about. Just mashed avocado on bread -- nothing special.

Still want to come back and try their other offerings! I feel like maybe it was just a one of thing."

I'm a huge fan of rose but it definitely needs to be done the right way- it's not an ingredient that can be experimented with. I think it was a little too much rose in the drinks. I got a rose drink and a chocolate rose snack platter. The platter had some strawberries- that were almost rotten, and some very basic out of the box cookies. The drink had *too* much rose- it was actually undrinkable and after trying to force myself to have some I had to call it a quits after the third sip- it almost tasted soapy. My friend who was with also wasn't a fan and couldn't stomach her drink as well."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-05-23,4.0,"Went to Blank Slate Tea by accident in route to Blank Slate Coffee + Kitchen. They are a smaller coffee shop version of their parent shop one door over. The main difference if they don't serve coffee, but you can do next door and bring it into the cafe. We got the avocado toast and the pink hummus toast and neither disappointed. The avocado toast was hearty, great avocado portion and spices for the the $10 price point. The beet toast was great too but the avocado toast was the clear winner. They have a cute indoor seating area and the staff is friendly!"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2020-02-12,1.0,Overrated!! Came here cause of the good reviews but ended up not enjoying. My toast was burned and it did not taste good at all
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-04-15,5.0,"This is a must go to spot, I'm a avid coffee lover and the selection they have is very extensive, especially the sandwiches, I had the roast turkey sandwich and I have to say one the best turkey sandwiches I've had in the Manhattan borough. Not to mention that I'm a huge advocator for same business like this, I got to see the owner and he even said hello. The counter girl was very excited to work and overall  gave a really good impression. Not to mention how beautiful the interior is, down to the hand drawn table signs. Will for sure become a regular ! 


Ps. super cozy and very quite and peaceful to stay for hours !"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-04-10,4.0,"If you are looking for great drinks + an IG worthy picture, look no further.

I went to Blank Slate Tea with my friend and we ordered the following: 

- Iced Rose Milk Tea Latte - This was refreshing and I recommend it if you want something that isn't overpowering and not too sweet. 

-Rose Matcha Milk Tea Latte W/ Oat Milk - I loved this drink because it was airy and neither the matcha nor rose tea flavor overwhelmed each other. The only irritating thing was the petals on top, but you know what they say... Do it for the gram.

- Lavender Earl Grey Cookie Skillet - I only got this because there were no more waffles. This was OKAY. Not too crazy about the taste. The earl grey flavor was slightly overpowering. 

I would definitely go again."

My husband and I order the breakfast sandwich once a week and we truly look forward to this moment. It's the best breakfast sandwich in NYC. The combination between this bun with everything bagel seasoning, gooey sunnyside egg, cheddar cheese, avocado, and hot sauce is the perfect bite. I may have to start saving for this weekly habit but worth every penny. Thank you Blank Slate...for everything."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2018-09-02,3.0,"This place is so small and cute and aesthetic, I loved ordering online via the Yelp app and then picking it up on my way to work!

Service was very friendly and helpful. Based on other Yelp reviews, I had to try the iced rose tea latte. It was so flowery and good and refreshing, I loved the rose tea petals on top! My one gripe was that it seemed like there was too much ice which was disappointing considering it was over $5 I believe. 

I also tried the matcha yogurt bowl which was very tasty but small given the price. I loved the chia seeds, berries, and nuts, but thought they scrimped on berries. The matcha tasted good but it wasn't very strong. 

Overall, I'd be back but only when I'm in town on business and in the area (great location by Madison Square Park.)"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2020-03-07,5.0,"Amazing tea spot that is chic, elegant, and cozy. The offerings are all homemade and delicious, while the service is always gracious and done with a smile! Lovely.  Dairy free and vegan options available."

Sandwiches and treats.  The avocado toast I had was the best I've ever had - and I've had a lot!  Flavorful bread does not overwhelm the avocado or its toppings of crunchy seeds, delicate sprouts and radish slices. Perfection!  I also had the rose latte which had the perfect amount of rose in it and not too sweet.  I highly recommend this place.  Especially good vegetarian optio"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2018-08-03,5.0,"Yes, this place is ""cute"" looking but I'd go here for the tea beverages. The prices in terms of breakfast/lunch are similar to their regular kitchen next door, around 8-12, which means I probably won't be getting food here soon as I am a bit too far away for lunch.

I've had a few drinks here. The Rose Tea Latte, made in house, was really, really good. Barely sweetened with a nice strong rose flavor but you can still taste the background tea. The milk is light, my preference. Maybe a bit too much ice but it was refreshing all day at work. 

The Matcha here is similar to the one found at Cha Cha though this place uses a slightly less quality one (but at the same time, they use bamboo whisks so give and take and I have found Cha Cha to be more inconsistent with astringency.) While their matcha is OK, I am a fan of their Matcha Soda specifically. While I usually prefer straight up matcha, this adds some nice extra flavor (lemon and seltzer/sparkling water) while still keeping a good matcha background. I'm happy the staff recommended this:

TL;DR: Excellent Rose Latte and Matcha Soda. OK Matcha. Outside of what I have ordered, they have a good selection of loose leaf teas ranging from an aged pur-eh (!) to a good mix of black/oolong/etc.) Food is pricey for breakfast but fine for lunch. Good place. 4.5"

Love their decor and presentation of teas and other food selections! Will go back to try the different teas they have since their is such a big variety! I definitely recommend the 3 tier tower to have a try of their amazing food!"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-03-13,4.0,"I absolutely love this place.
 
Ambience is cute, cozy and comfy!
 (perfect for insta) 

While I haven't been able to try too many food options on the menu yet, every drink I have gotten has been very good.

They have some unique flavors and provide fast and efficient customer service.

The only reason why this place doesn't get a 5 for me is because I wish the sizing was better. I don't mind paying $5 for a drink, but it has to be bigger than a kiddie cup. ( though I do understand that NYC rent is crazy and it's hard to keep afloat.) 

Regardless, I still love this place and their neighboring business as well. I will continue to dine here

4.5/5"
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-01-17,5.0,Cute little tea place.  The Rose Latte is amazing.  I like coming in here a couple of times a month and having a tea latte while working as they have free Wi-Fi.  It doesn't get as crowded as their sister restaurant next door so if you're looking for a place to sit down and relax come here on the weekdays.
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2018-07-11,5.0,"A very pink, cute place to go with your girlfriend/s or even your bf. Staff is so nice. I came here with my sisters for brunch and the food was so delicious. We had avocado toast with salmon, turkey sandwich, and the blue berry waffles. Thank God we all share and loved all of it. Their pink rose drink literally tasted like roses. 
We also tried the pink custard dip with cookies and strawberries, that looked really picturesque but it was okay. I wasn't that crazy about it. 
Yup, will go back again."
650,blank-slate-tea-new-york,2019-08-03,4.0,"Smaller than expected but food and drinks were exceptional. Staff is 5 star. Options are 5 star - everything is iced or hot, and oat milk and almond milk are readily available. We got the tea tower which was absolutely amazing - and honestly a steal for $30. Pink hummus, avo toast, endless mini sandwiches, and macarons and brownies that were honestly some of the best I've ever tasted. The tea tier could definitely be shared among 4-6 people, but we were 2 and basically had it for brunch. Love the pink interior, but the AC could've been a little colder and the seating was overcrowded - they should fit less tables in the reservable booths for a better customer experience."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2020-05-29,5.0,"I was biking down 40th St in the hunt for an open coffee shop, when the sunniest smiled man ever said ""good morning! come on up - we're open!"" Sometimes we look at chains and only see the big business, but this location, with this staff, made this major cafe chain into a warm and inviting space, which can be hard to find in these times. Their cold brew with half and half is some of the smoothest and well roasted in the city, not to mention it comes in a fantastic biodegradable cup. 5 stars to the staff, the coffee and the stunning Bryant park directly across the street."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2020-01-12,4.0,"Drinks
- Hot Matcha Latte with Oat Milk: (8/10) This was everything you could want in a matcha latte. It was served to me at a perfect temperature so I could drink it right away without burning my tongue. Also, it wasn't too bitter and didn't have a dirt-like taste to it like some other matcha drinks do. 
- Iced Caffe Mocha with Oat Milk: (9/10) The quality of this coffee was superb! This is how all mocha iced coffees should taste. It had the perfect amount of chocolate taste in it without tasting like a cold hot chocolate. 

Service: (8/10) The staff was friendly and knowledgeable in menu items (such as milk alternatives). Drinks came out quite quickly, which is always nice. 

Atmosphere: (7/10) This coffee shop was simple and clean. There was ample seating inside (it wasn't too busy when we went) and an outdoor seating area. This place had everything you need, but nothing extra. 

Beware that pricing is quite steep ($6+ for something that should cost $4) relative to the average coffee shop, but the quality is worth it."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2020-01-28,5.0,"Blue Bottle is worth the price. It is on the pricier side but everything is incredible. It's a small little space so I would not plan on spending time there  doing work or anything like that. But for a grab and go spot, this place is where it's at. The baristas are very friendly and engaging. We had a couple questions and the baristas were super helpful in answering! The yuzu lemon sparkling drink was so refreshing and tasty that we went back the next day to gET it again! Highly recommend!"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-08-25,4.0,"This is very accessible to bryant park but i found it a little expensive when compared to other coffee shops around! $11 for a cappuccino and almond croissant - probably its because as a Canadian after conversion, it comes to $14 which is a lot and high end coffee shops in Toronto doesn't cost that much

Anyways besides the pricing, loved their cappuccino and so is their almond croissant , they do have about 4-5 seating. Also the customer service was good

Very attentive and makes the coffee to the perfection especially the art on top of it shows it how much they care about the business and employees."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-06-13,4.0,"I love the taste of Blue Bottle Coffee's espresso and thoroughly enjoyed my iced latte here today! This location is right next to Bryant Park and centrally located in Midtown. It was pretty crowded when I was here, but the workers did a great job of moving the line along quickly!

The only reason I didn't give this spot 5 stars is the lack of seating. There were only about 6 chairs and it was counter seating (no tables). If you are looking for a place to sit and do work and drink some coffee, this isn't the place. It is good for grab and go, and would be nice in the summer because you can bring your coffee to Bryant Park and sit at one of the tables there! Overall, I wouldn't set out to go here, but if you are passing by, it is a nice place to get come coffee!

NOTE: they have paper straws here! If you are not a fan of them, like me, make sure to bring your own reusable straw!"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-06-10,4.0,"Very well known name of a coffee place. The coffee was overpriced for how small it is but that's the usual right? 

Coffee was good but nothing crazy enough for me to seek for it again. It's definitely popular so there was a good line to wait in before we cold order. 

The service was just meh. We were first timers and told them we were so any advice would be helpful and he said the coffee was good.... like ""no effing wayyyy I didn't know"" Lol. We laughed it off and left with expensive yummy little coffees."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-10-02,5.0,"I love blue bottle and this location! I usually make it here when I pick up my sweetgreen across the street during lunch, and the service is always great. 

I adore the New Orleans iced coffee, which isn't great for my waistline, but it's always a great pick me up if work is ever a drag. The employees are all amazing and I've never had a problem with a wrong or forgotten order. Everyone's so friendly and of course, the coffee is always delicious.

Will definitely be back!"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-04-18,4.0,"This is my favorite go to place for coffee. Always deadly delicious coffee. I never got disappointed with blue bottle coffee. I've been try a lot of different locations and I can tell you that this place was smaller than where I've been to. Very clean and cute small place with limited seat. There's no restroom because of private building. If you want use restroom should go near any of public places as Brayan park or Starbucks or Macdonald or etc..
My favorite coffee is latte in here. The barista was amazing great job with my coffee. All the staffs were very accommodating. I will definitely go back to this place again as much as I can while stay in NY."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-07-20,4.0,"The New Orleans cold brew coffee is by far the best I've had near the Bryant Park area. Not only the Coffee is excellent but they provide a personalized experience. Something you don't get at some of the larger coffee chains. The shop is very small and you can actually miss it walking pass by the first time around, look for the blue bottle sign and take the stairs inside the shop. 

Started in San Francisco, this is a ""must"" visit if you're a coffee connoisseur. It is well worth a visit. Multiple new locations recently opened up in the NYC area!"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-02-21,5.0,"Great place to grab a coffee and go but if you're looking to sit down for a long while, this ain't it. I have been here twice, once in the early afternoon and recently in the evening just so my friend could try a proper cappuccino. We were lucky that this place was empty cause the first time I came I basically had to step outside to have my latte. 

Now getting to the actual coffee here, this place does blind taste tests of each batch everyday and identifies a window of peak flavor that it needs to reach before going out to customers. Without a doubt, this process reflected in the taste of their coffee. Beans are roasted properly for a smooth, complex flavor. Their lattes and cappuccinos have the perfect foam consistency and you can tell that quality milk is being used because the foam is unlike any other generic place I've been to before. 

After realizing this I did some research and found out that they actually use farm fresh milk from a designated creamery which many places actually don't do. After all, milk is a big expense for making latte. 

With all these things taken into consideration, I think the 5 dollar price point is justified. My expectations have definitely been met at blue bottle.

651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-12-05,3.0,"Blue Bottle has struck the perfect balance between hipster and trendy vibes, and is very popular among the silicon valley crowd. You walk in and it's like a show to watch your coffee be made. It's very crowded and even to get a drip coffee, it takes about sixteen years from the time that you order until you actually get it. Ours was taking so long that I was about to approach the baristas and ask for an update, but my friend stopped me and said, ""No! You're not supposed to do that here!"" I laughed but now, I get it. You're supposed to let them work on their art and drink your coffee when they bestow it upon you. 

I got a cafe au lait made with their house blend, 3 Africa. It's about twice the price of anywhere else what's the coffee is so good and you can certainly tell the difference between the quality here versus other places nearby. 

If you're okay to skip the bathroom, wait about 10 minutes for your coffee, and pay over $4 for small cup, treat yourself to Blue Bottle, especially if you're a connoisseur of sorts."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-11-02,5.0,The New Orleans iced coffee is to die for - my favorite iced coffee ever. There is usually a short line and it moves very very quickly. Super limited seating in this location; I'd recommend taking your coffee to go.
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-06-14,4.0,I love this place because it's right in front of the Bryant Park! I would get a latte from here and drink it in the park. It's a tiny place but has everything you need. Good service.
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-03-03,4.0,"My friend who isn't even from American swears by this coffee shop.  I mean she went as far as to say it's the best coffee in all of the city.  Now, by no means am I a coffee connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between the quality here versus other places. When you first walk in, your nostrils are pleasantly hit with the aroma of coffee.  The baristas are friendly and are carefully handcrafting each beverage to make sure your coffee is made just right.  The location itself is pretty small, with just a few seats available.  I went with the cold brew (all black) which was good, came out rather quickly but a bit on the expensive side ($4 plus).  My friend ordered the latte ($5) which was pretty good.  Yes! you're probably going to pay more than most places but if you're a coffee connoisseur or just a fan of good coffee then I recommend giving blue bottle a try."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-11-15,5.0,"We were looking for a quick coffee in the afternoon on the way back to our hotel and Blue Bottle Coffee was perfect. Short menu, no flavors but delicious and fairly quick coffee. Friendly staff. Very small inside. 

When we first walked in it was very crowded and we could not tell where the line was. Luckily someone standing nearby helped and thank goodness everyone had already placed orders and were only waiting on their coffee. Seating is slim in here so don't expect to stay. The selection is a very short menu and they do not offer flavors. I chose a cafe mocha and my husband had a latte. The baristas worked very fast and each had their own job behind the tiny counter. There was a neat drop coffee setup with clear glass so that you could watch it being made. 

We both enjoyed our drinks and would recommend trying their coffee."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-08-02,3.0,"Tried the Cold Brew. I can't say it was that strong. Also, not sure I'm about to spend almost $6.00 for a coffee. I thought Starbucks was expensive, and then I visited Blue Bottle. If you're going to charge that much, better be the best around. Which it's not..."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-12-08,4.0,"I have no specific reason for this not being a 5 star review. The coffee was done perfectly and the out milk was splendid! It's possible I just want to have it all in a 5 Star coffee experience. There was no place to sit here but to be honest I knew that when walking in! 

Got a caffe latte  with oat milk, it was one of the best I ever had. Creamy micro bubbles clung together to creat a happy foam to top my expertly pulled espresso shot. Then why 4 stars you ask? I wanted a seat!"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-08-10,5.0,"How I love the blue bottle. My favorite spot hands down, on either coast. Always delicious. Always consistent."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2020-02-05,5.0,Probably the best coffee in the city.  Plus the people who work there are super knowledgeable and friendly.
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-12-08,3.0,"Great coffee as expected but service was sub-par. Maybe that's because there were a lot of customers.

Not a lot of seatings so be expected to have your coffee to go. Note that if you want a drip coffee, the wait might be much longer as that's what a lot of people order.

If i am around the area, will definitely stop by for coffee."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-05-20,5.0,best coffee i ve tasted ever. i ve been in front of  Grand Centeral one. But i couldn't find it in yelp. Stuff was very friendly and suggest some coffee types for my first time in there.
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-04-04,4.0,"tucked away on the side of 40th street, this was one of the first few Blue Bottle locations in NYC.  thankfully, we've gotten more over the years and i couldn't be happier because i'm a huge fan!  anyway, this location isn't very big, some seatings but more of a grab and go kinda spot (just go enjoy it in the park!).  i usually go for the latte or new orleans cold brew, both are consistently good and tastes great every time.  a little pricey given the portion size, but you gotta treat yoself!"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-11-15,3.0,"I like espresso and I usually get a macchiato. At this blue bottle location it's delicious, really good. But $4 is really a lot and the service is sooo slooow... I'd go back from time to time when I'm in no rush, but unfortunately it's not a good place for everyday after lunch coffee"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-11-10,4.0,Good drip coffee and pastries. Service is quick and friendly. Seating is a bit crowded along the walls as this place has a constant stream of customers.
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2017-08-27,5.0,"Stopped in here on my last day in NYC...always a line out the door so I knew that the coffee ""has to be amazing!""

I ordered the iced New Orleans Style Brew...sooooo incredibly rich and delicious with a hint of sugar cane and chicory!!! Wow!!!!  Soooo delicious!

Since there are no Blue Bottle Coffee Shop locations in Chicago-never fear....Whole Foods carries them in the refrigerator section of their beverage area in pint sized milk cartons that you got in elementary school!

The brand hails from ""The Bay Area"" of California and has opportunities to order their coffee via their web site.

They also offer accessories such as cups, mugs, slow drip apparatuses and kettles among other things...with their icon of a ""blue bottle"" on the front!

Quite possibly ""the best"" and most unique coffee (iced) that I have ever tasted!"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-08-06,4.0,"Love blue bottle for years! Do I love the price? Not so much, but it's NYC...

A great place to grab coffee as their coffee is so rich and smooth. There isn't that much room inside the shop, but luckily you have Bryant Park across the street."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2017-08-28,3.0,"Seems many coffee drinkers like their coffee. Therefore I made a trip to the city, and ordered a small latte for myself. It was $5.17 in total. 
It was very creamy, as a regular latte would be. It had the fresh espresso taste, under the smell of the good whole milk, which is the standard of a latte. 
For $5.17 for a small size cup, I am looking for more extraordinary espresso drink. Good coffee though."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-11-12,5.0,"Delicious coffee. The place is located under the Rockefeller Center, so it was packed. But, totally worth the wait. The mocha was one of the best I've ever had."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2017-09-15,4.0,"Totally delightful coffee. But here are a few tips:
-it's ALWAYS crowded, to the point where you wait waaaaay too long and have nowhere to stand 
-the coffee is delicious, but super strong and portion sizes are super small
-it's hard to look at the menu while you're in line 

All in all, it's totally worth a visit. I think it would be quicker for regular coffee, but I just love the lattes. Plus it's a different experience than going to Starbucks or another name brand coffee retailer. 

The baristas are super nice and helpful if you're uncertain about something. I just wish I had inquired about the size of the portions before purchasing because I totally got a size that was way TOO SMALL for my caffeine need."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-09-03,5.0,"Yes, you must come here to drink coffee and eat pastries. It is the type of goodness you must experience at least once in your life. Everything about this place just exudes excellence.

I just wish I could have some out here on Long Island."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-01-04,5.0,"Heaven in a cup? Yeah pretty close. Blue Bottle Coffee is an amazing coffee shop located near Bryant Park in NYC. Blue Bottle offers extremely quality coffee made the right way with great taste. Blue Bottle makes all coffee as a pour over so you may have to wait an extra moment for a great cup, but it's well worth it. The Cappuccinos are some of the best I've had in the states and I highly recommend grabbing one for your NYC stroll. Overall a top notch coffee establishment in Manhattan."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2020-01-27,4.0,"Other than the fact that the barista made me wait while he washed a bunch of dishes (allowing my milk to get cold) and the other barista lounged on the counter and smirked, this place is legit. The coffee is top notch, but whoever's managing this place needs to get the service together. It's too expensive for that kind of bs."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2017-09-29,5.0,"Strong coffee, creamy milky texture, dark sweet chocolatey taste, smooth finish, good price...what more can you ask?? 

The store is full and lines go to the door. The wait is not that long. Blue bottle rocks!"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2019-03-25,2.0,$5??? Come on now. Smh. Coffee taste just fine. But $5? For a super small iced coffee which they put huge ice cubes in. No
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-03-06,3.0,"If you want your high end coffee fix quick then this spot is an ok choice. No ambience to speak of unless you like watching people go in and out of the lobby of the WeWork location next door. Not overly busy when I stopped in on a rainy, winter, Saturday afternoon the staff of young workers lazily starred at their mobile devices in their downtime. 

The coffee was better than the scene - I went with the Bella Donovan pour over, which is a darker roast than I usually order, I found a splash of milk smoothed it out nicely. 

PS - there is no bathroom available at this location no matter how enticing the WeWork lobby's one looks!"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-10-20,4.0,"This place is pretty tiny, but they crank out the expected BB goodness. I'm a big fan of the single origin drip coffees that they brew on demand. Nothing sitting around in a pot or thermal carafe here. Sure, it takes extra time and the coffee costs a bit more than even those big chain coffee places, but I think it is worth it for a fresh cup of quality brew. Drink it black and hot!"
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-07-21,4.0,"Coffee is up to required standards.  

I like the flooring.

I never had almond milk that actually tasted like almonds before - somewhat shocking actually - still undecided.

I would think it could be easier to read the menu considering it is meant to be read by people who may need coffee earlyish - ie it's kinda small.

Unfortunately at 7:30 on Saturday, 21 Ivanka (what used to be called July before the ""changes"") in year 02 of the reign of ""I Alone"" the food had not all yet arrived.  I guess the people who could get that job done may have been otherwise occupied - detained so to speak."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-05-22,5.0,"TLDR: Best Coffee in NY?

I'm not a coffee drinker, so this review is on behalf of my wife who is an avid drinker. Just a quick intro about her coffee tastes before we get into this review. She usually takes it with a little cream and no sugar. The stronger the better. Her favorite drink is the Americano because it's pretty much a straight shot of coffee, diluted with some hot water. Now on to the review!

Even though they didn't have Americano on the menu, at the one we went to (across from Grand Central), they were still able to make one up for her. She really liked the strong taste of the coffee. It was very aromatic and most of all, didn't taste like ""Coffee-flavored water"", as she likes to call weak coffees.  In her opinion, this was in the top 3 of the best coffee she ever had. Number 1 is a little local Italian place in Seattle.

The servers were super nice and friendly, and the place was quite empty when we got there around 2pm.  Prices were reasonable. She would definitely go back again, if she could."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-04-20,4.0,"Dropped by blue bottle during a brief layover in NYC. Got there fairly early around 7am and was able to avoid the long lines. Staff were polite and friendly. The store was fairly small and there was not a lot of sitting room - just a few seats on the side of the store and therefore I made my order to go. Ended up getting the New Orleans coldbrew with half and half ($4.50). It was extremely smooth, creamy and delicious with a hint of organic sugar cane and chicory.

Bryant park is just across the street. It's a nice place to sit and enjoy your drink."
651,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-6,2018-12-04,4.0,"Good quality coffee, a little pricey, but worth the money. I love coffee, practically drink it everyday. The coffee tasted smooth and well-made. I did not need any sweetner or any additional cream for my espresso drink. I cannot remember the name of the drink I ordered, but it was good. So good that my sister and I brought coffee beans to bring home to the DMV. Then we later found out that Blue Bottle Coffee was also sold in VA. Oops!"

Well it is the same good coffee, and everything is still $2 for the cookies, cakes and other edible items that you can do wrong at that price. And the barista had the frenchey hat outfit too.

Oh well at least while shipping my cappuccino I can look at the mystery masked woman wall mural."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-08-02,4.0,"Everything is currently $2.    Large iced coffee - $2.  Egg sandwich on a wheat roll with tomato $2.

How does this place stay in business and why isn't there always a line out the door?  This Chelsea location is close to a subway stop and has plenty of comfortable seating and a clean.bathroom. 

The food portions are smaller but the coffee tastes good to me.   

This is a little gem in New York for the budget conscious.    There are multiple locations in the city all over Manhattan - midtown, uptown and downtown.   Staff is cool.

The one thing perhaps because of the low cost is no public napkin dispenser.  You have to ask for them.  

For being so cheap the place still feels stylish, food works and coffee will give you a buzz.  Thank you."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-08-16,4.0,"I didn't quite believe the sign outside when it said everything is $2, but everything is actually $2. Quite a nice change when you are used to paying over $5 for espresso drinks elsewhere. 

Super quick service, I noticed they handled the crowds well as they came in. Ample outlets as well for charging your phone which made my morning as I went in with an almost empty battery and wasn't sure when my husbands train was getting in or where we were going to meet!

Barstool seats at the front window, booths and chairs at tables down the side and a large table in the back, so there is a good variety of seating. 

Definitely a great place to grab some coffee when you want to sit down for a bit and enjoy it rather than taking it to go and you can't beat the price!"

The coffee is good as are the baked goods-solid fair nothing exceptional.  The interior is sparse.  If you are looking for a place to bring your computer and camp out for a morning, you could do it here, but not sure this is the place I would chose for that purpose."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-08-03,5.0,"Awesome place!! $2 for everything!! You can't beat that in Manhattan. The coffee is deliciously piping hot (nearly lava hot if that's how you like it). Been here many times, figured I should finally give them a review.  Everything is absolutely delicious... I have yet to try something that wasn't good. The service is always friendly and prompt.

Noticed this corner building painted in white and Red tape on window-Everything $2. At first I thought it was a two dollar store like a 99 cent or dollar tree. I missed the sign. Walked in and noticed counter of enclosed pastries, sandwiches and muffins. I was so happy to see their coffee maker. 

Folks everything here is $2 dollars. I was shocked. Where would you find a place in Manhattan that sells everything for $2 dollars for sandwiches and specialty coffee. Is this for real. Wonder how the quality of the food is really is.

OMG! I came back twice in one day to Matto Espresso for their Cappuccino. As you can see in my photos I just drank half the cup. Creamy and gave me that kick for mid morning to start the day shopping.

Came back in the afternoon, and ordered another cup of Cappuccino and went for one of their turkish pastries. Feta cheese encased in crispy phyllo dough. It was reheated and came in two. Yum.

Staff is friendly and greets you when you walk through the door.

Saw some peeps doing work on their laptop. Visited by locals in the neighborhood and tourist running in to grab quick bite and off on to their next travels. Cool meeting location. No way you can miss this building. Comfy chairs and tables scattered throughout store. One communal table in the back.

They have one bathroom. Get code from staff after purchase.  It was clean in the morning.

Will be making pitstop next time to try their sandwiches and sweets. Will make extra trips just for the Cappuccino."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-08-20,5.0,"$2 for any item in NYC? I think thats the best it gets. Let that sink in for a bit...Even in places that are not as popular as NYC, you can't get a $2 latte or cappuccino freshly made with beans that are instantly grounded as you order. Our total was a little over $6 including tax for a huge pistachio muffin, cappuccino and latte (both had art on top of it). 

The store is nice and clean and a lot of locals just popping in to grab breakfast and morning coffee before starting their day. Trust me you are not sacrificing quality here for the price. Definitely recommend over going to Starbucks. You won't regret it!!"
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-12-06,5.0,"Everything is $2!!!!!!!! Coffee's, latte's, pastries, breakfast breads!!!!

And everything is good too!! I'm so happy I finally found a cafe in NY that serves my needs.

Great price, fast service, free WIFI, many tables and outlets to do work!"
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-12-09,5.0,"This is a really great spot to know about! Everything on the menu was only two dollars. This makes it really easy to try multiple items and not feel bad about the cost, especially in New York City where everything is otherwise quite pricey. I will also say that what we had there was very good. You can get a nice beverage and pastry or flatbread. They will even heat up the food for you that way you can take it to go. There are multiple locations around the city to check out. This is definitely a place I will be going back to again soon for a quick bite. Not a place to sit down but excellent for take out, which happens to be often in NYC where most people are on the go. The service was friendly and things tasted great, overall what I would like in a coffee/hot coco and food experience."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-04-02,4.0,"What is there not to like about a well designed $2 cafes that resides right acrossed the street from my house and everything is $2!
 So i actually frequently go to this place when I am in a hurry, don't have time for anything else and feel the need to get a cup of coffee and a pastry. I've had quite a few things off of the menus here and they are all pretty good except for the chai tea latte which is always alittle on the wattery side. 
A few things you should know about. Yes! All small beverages, pasterys and sandwiches are $2. The average portion size here is alittle smaller then a tall at Starbucks. If you want, you can make it a bigger size and it's about $4 for a drink and a pastry. It's still not too bad concidering my average trip to Starbucks is around $11. They are usually out of whipped cream so that's one of my pet peeves. 
I was in yesterday and had a itallian hot choclate. This has got to be my new favorite drink. There's also a choclate crissont twist that's pretty amazing. I'm a giant fan of the pistachio muffins. The blueberry muffins are wonderful too. Right next to the register is a little cooler off to the side that has pretty amazing carrot cake in it. The carrot cake just makes me happy! The other day, I found the almondy and left in extreme bliss! There's so much to try here. If your on a budget! This is the place to get a cup of coffee!"
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-02-06,4.0,"First time going to one of these $2 for anything coffee chains. I had their brewed coffee which wasn't all that bad along with a fudge brownie. The brownie was great.

Theres a nice selection of sweet treats here along with all the standard espresso drinks and brewed coffee.

Beats Starbucks!"

[for now]"" sign outside the cafe. I'm not sure how often they do this type of flash sale, but the marketing works!

I was not particularly wild about the drip coffee, but the pumpkin loaf was standard and solid. I wish the babka had had a little more flavor. 

Lots of sweet and savory snack options."

This place doesn't compare to Starbucks franchise or FIKA."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2017-08-04,4.0,"Everything $2. In new York that's like winning the lottery.

I'm sure the girls behind the counter thought I was the cheapest bloke on Earth because I seriously thought I was on candid camera.

Lox and bagels sandwiches, acai smoothies, and coffee with add shots and coconut milk all ONLY $2 each.

Any pastry, any drink, and sandwich....$2!!

People were literally buying 5 items.

Heck if I wasn't so far from my friend's apartment I would have bought sandwiches and that lox and cream cheese bagel but I didn't want to carry it all.

The Evian large liter bottles flew off the shelf and I got a 3 shot coconut milk iced latte...all for $2.

Dang what a find!!!"

654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2018-10-19,3.0,"I'm not entirely sure I get Matto. I don't mean I don't understand what they do. They're a wannabe Starbucks, attempting to be a hipster kind of New York cool coffee shop (like you might see on ""Friends""), with so-so overpriced cakes and muffins (and sandwiches?!?!), and a less than chill ambience. 

We were meeting someone looking to work on a project with us. We got there a bit early. 6 pm on a Wednesday. It was busy, but they had one person behind the counter. He seemed frazzled. Tables were dirty. Place was dirty. It felt very chaotic, unnecessarily. 

But there was a table in the back. But it felt less than serene or comfortable. It felt like someone thought let's open a coffee place in Chelsea, but not make it a happy or enjoyable place. It wasn't conducive to a casual cup of coffee with my husband, much less a friend that we were meeting in person for the first time. 

I don't see going back. 

I'd love an option to Starbucks. But this just isn't it."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-11-17,5.0,A perfect place to get an espresso/cofand a pastry.  Brownies are very good and fresh.  Fast service and great prices ($2 for each item!). I recommend Matto if you are in the Chelsea area and need a coffee break.
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2018-09-09,2.0,"This location of Matto is so beautiful. The outside is a simple white brick building and the inside has all the right paintings and wooden tables inside. Sadly, the coffee is not up to par. It's one of the cheapest cups of coffee (most drinks are $2 only), but I ended up throwing my iced latte away. It tasted burnt and not good I didn't want to waste getting full on it when NYC has better coffee!"
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2018-05-09,5.0,"Coffee 2 dollars , pastries 2 dollars,  wait this must be a mistake.  The only mistake you make is not coming here.

Matto you are worth the extra avenue walk !"
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2018-06-10,4.0,"All cafes in nyc should be like this (one can wish). Everything, pastries and drinks, is $2!! This is how much coffee should be. Why are croissants $6 in this city!? :(

This is my second time here and besides the lovely price, this location is decently sized with tons of natural light and outlets. Would recommend for sure for someone working who doesn't want to shell out $6 for a drink to do so. There's always at least a few people working on their laptops or reading when I'm here. The ladies at her counter are pleasant and efficient too so no complaints really.

Their menu has the standard few coffees as well as some tea and more special options like Italian hot chocolate. 

Overall just good vibes for a good price."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2018-11-28,5.0,"First of all, why am I only now learning about this place?! $2 everything?! And then you read reviews that complain about the ""ambience"" and call it a Starbucks wannabe? Hahahahaha. Sorry, have you bought lunch in NYC before? How about breakfast? Was it ever $2/item outside of Chinatown? This place is awesome! Veggie burger (half) that can be toasted for you; all kinds of pastries, spinach rolls, mini bagels with smoked salmon, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, lemonade, juice - alllllll $2 each. If you have anything negative to say about it, you're a queen. Anyway, the only thing that would make it even better would be adding sushi. The staff are quick and polite and you can get a free drink if you get their plastic card. I mean. No, you can't go wrong here. Unless you're on a diet."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-09-05,3.0,"I don't normally drink coffee or tea so take this review with a grain of salt. 

Pros - convenient location 
            Friendly staff and service 
            Multiple food and coffee options for $2
            Dairy-free and gluten free options

Today I just had to have a cup because I was so tired I needed a caffeine boost. Decided to come here instead of spending an arm and a leg at Starbucks. The cost was $2+ tax even though I chose almond milk. I was glad they had that option. 

The size of my cortado was probably 7 oz and paying $2+ tax was really a great value. But I found the coffee really bitter (smooth but bitter). Again I don't drink coffee too often so I'm going by personal taste here. 

Go for yourself and see what the hype is about. Maybe this is your new coffee spot."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2018-04-27,5.0,"Being new to the city, finding a place to get a cup of coffee is easy, every step you take there is one either to your right or left; however, finding a GOOD cup of coffee was quite the journey. 

I used to pass Matto everyday walking to work, but now it's my everyday stop before work. The staff is super friendly, and the place always looks spotless, just adds to how great the coffee and treats they serve are. The Magic Superfood Bar and Blueberry muffin is a must try !"

I hope I can soon rate this place 5 stars. The place sadly has employees who are at best are polite, but not friendly! And boy, what's up with the napkins, they literally pinch the napkins as if they are made out of gold!

The food, though delicious, is also greasy and I don't want my messy and sticky fingers on my phone! But it is so hard to ask for extra napkins!

Still, I will continue going to this location, and I will have to remember to bring my own stack of napkins, lol, just kidding!"
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2019-09-08,4.0,"As others have said, you cannot beat the price.

I really enjoyed my pistachio muffin, good even 12 hours after I bought it; and my latte.  I was rather indifferent about the ""chocolate/vanilla twist"", I think is its name; as it literally had nothing ""vanilla"" about it, except maybe a drop of extract (with a name like that, I would expect some custard or similar).  Otherwise a great experience."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2017-12-17,4.0,"What Espresso Matto does, they do very well. What is that that they do, you ask? Cheap coffee, cheap pastries, cheap foods. Literally everything is 2$ here, so you can walk out with a coffee and a doughnut and still have some pocket change left over for whatever else you do with pocket change throughout the day.  They even have some vegan and vegetarian options.. Go figure!

Don't come here expecting top-shelf coffee roasts like Counter Culture or whatever other new kid on the block is, but if you want a solid cup of Joe for cheaper than a one-way subway trip, Espresso Matto is the spot."

654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2017-05-22,3.0,"Everything $2 ought to draw u in for sure. It says for a limited time, but I'm fairly certain it's their gimmick. Regardless, I'll take it. It's
a good place to sit down for coffee. We got a bunch of things to share: babka, banana bread, dulce de leche something, chocolate marshmallow treat, etc. I ordered an iced tea. Friends ordered coffee. I think everything was ok. Nothing to write about. U get what u paid for. Would return if in the area and looking for coffee. 

The only negative thing is the blonde woman at the cashier. She gave me more change than I should get back, so I was nice enough to tell her. But there was no thank u or anything. She was pretty rude smh."
654,matto-espresso-new-york-14,2018-02-23,5.0,"This is my go-to coffee stop on the way to work if I feel like I need a pick me up, and I've never had anything bad there before! I'm not sure (or I don't want to know) how they can upkeep their $2 price for each item, but I heard someone asked how long the promotion was going to go on for, and the cashier said ""a long time"". It's more of a stop and go place for me as their music and lighting isn't ideal for a relaxing spot to read a book.

I love their iced coffee and their non dairy milk options along with honey + blue agave syrup! Their pastries, smoothies, + parfaits are average and good for the price, but I love their breakfast sandwiches. You can't really beat a coffee and breakfast sandwich for $4 and some change."

Delicious (but not cheap, you've been warned) juices and healthy food options, all located in an airy open space. Square footage like this isn't common in this neighborhood. There were several couches and chairs around, and coolers full of to-go choices too. 100% organic, they also offer catering for your office lunches or personal parties. 

Solid coffee, loads of alternative options. Another reviewer compared them to Joe & The Juice and I couldn't agree more. Being from the West Coast I felt right at home here. Gimmie dat turmeric and ginger! While the service at this location was just as cold and deadpan as the chilly wind outside this establishment, they were efficient, to the point and not in a rude way.

655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-10-13,3.0,"Mixed feelings. I popped in a few times when I first moved to NYC for the avocado toast and golden almond milk lattes which I really liked. Later on, I came another time for an iced coconut matcha latte which truthfully wasn't that great, especially compared to all of the matcha competition in the area (it's a dog eat dog world). 

I decided to give the place another go and try a few more things one afternoon when my mom came to visit. We ordered two iced coffees, two avocado toasts and a vegan chili soup. We waited over 20 minutes for our order and when I went to ask where it was, they apologized and said it would be out shortly. 

15 minutes later we had still not received our order and when I went to check in again, the cashier and food prep went back and forth trying to figure out what happened and realized they skipped it yet again while pumping out other orders. 

We finally received an iced coffee which was extremely bitter and the soup which was not too bad and waited for the rest. Another 10 minutes or so had passed so I had requested a refund and they said they would still make the order for us on the house. Our food finally came out and they brought the wrong avocado toast my mom had ordered. 

The staff seemed disorganized and lacked communication amongst each other and were not very apologetic. The place was busy but it was not overwhelmingly packed and it is not a sit down restaurant so the wait was truly absurd. I don't mind it for a quick golden milk latte but don't plan to order anything else there again. :("
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-08-30,3.0,"First time here and very happy about the service, beautiful ambience... great location!
This place seems to have good coffee but it does not have decaf coffee and it is dairy free (but they disn't have soy milk)! I ended up having a cortado with almond milk (the guy said that almond was the best), which was meh... maybe because I am a coffee cow milk/soy milk drinker?! I had few sips only. Wanted to give a try...
As per the coffee size, I wouldn't name it cortado... at least Spanish cortado is a macchiato but with more milk ratio. This one seemed to me more a coffee with milk (café con leche!) or small latte... what a pity that I didn't order juice...
I would only come for a relaxing juice or sandwich, they seemed good"
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2020-03-08,4.0,Amazing working place with comfy seating and lighting. Healthy food - extensive vegan options. Their avocado toast with smoked salmon was delish - served on a round wooden bowl. Place I recommend to come to get your work done while enjoying great food and drinks. Very nice interior too. Spacious.
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-11-05,3.0,"I've been to this location several times now...here are my thoughts:

1. Food is as good as it is at other locations.
2. Ordering takes FOREVER.
3. Staff is disorganized and isn't very attentive.

Today it took an unncessarily long time to get my avocado toast and soup. The hold up? The soup, which makes no sense, because they literally just have to pour it into a container. But they were too busy socializing and ignoring customers to actually pour the soup into the container.

Also, they were out of the croutons, which I love more than life.

Overall I love the food, but not the service. Not sure I'll give this location another try which is unfortunate as it's near my office."
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-04-03,5.0,"I've found myself walking into Dr. Smood a few times before but have gotten turned off by their prices. However, I must say that every time I walk in, it's fairly busy with people working (lines are never too long), so the internet must be pretty good.

I came in today for a quick grab-and-go lunch and walked away very happy. Being vegan and gluten-free can be difficult but there were plenty of options to choose from. That said, I'm tempted to take away one star because I paid $20 for only these two small items (the quality of the food and atmosphere is five stars though so I can't bring myself to).

The cashew kale salad was fabulous. I loved that they packed the cashews and dressing in separate containers so it didn't get soggy. Since it was my first time getting it, I was happy I could taste the dressing first to make sure I liked it before pouring it all over the salad (spoiler alert: it was delicious).

I've actually had the eggplant jerky once before and had to get it again. It's a little tough but super addicting. This batch seemed to have more chili flakes than the last but other than that they were just as incredible as before!!

Overall,  I love the vibe, although it does remind me of something Gwyneth Paltrow would post on Goop (and a quick Google search tells me it is Goop-approved). I would definitely recommend Dr. Smood to anyone wanting quick but very fresh food!"
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-04-23,5.0,"I love everything about Dr Smood, from
the aesthetic to the trendy, organic menu options! 

It's like Starbucks meets Joe & the Juice meets an upscale version of an LA heath food shop.  And they're big into alternative mills; almond milk, cashew milk, and coconut milk were all listed in the menu.  I'm not a huge coffee fan but man, I loved the cashew milk latte!  Even at $7 for a small, I had zero regrets.  This place also offers grab-n-go food -- something I didn't even realize until I was leaving and walked past the refrigerated doors!  And the drink options include smoothies and juices too. 

Basically, if I could dream up a coffee shop, this would be it.  And I so wish I lived locally so I could come work on my laptop in this beautiful space!"

However, I've been here twice and the customer service is the same, so I hope you improve soon. Every time I come there are at least 4-5 people behind the counter. I usually have to wait for a while to get anyone attention. Also, there's only me( customer) at the counter. The place was not packed or anything. It annoys me to feel like I have to beg for your attention to try to buy your food. I've worked in the restaurant industry and I'd greeted everyone that comes in and be present. There are too many places with similar food with better service."
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-01-15,4.0,"Gave Dr. Smood a second chance with a foray into their food menu and I was content. They're a new business that's doing things differently, like with cashless paying and focusing on controlling moods through foods. The atmosphere here is very spa-like, high-class, and exclusive, great for reading a book or meeting a friend. I tried the Kale Works salad, which looks small, but is about 400 calories, so it does fill you up. It had unique ingredients, which I haven't seen lately, like goji berries, hemp seeds, and a thick cashew dressing, which I thought complemented the veggies well. 

I also did the Yelp check-in for a free coffee, but the cashier was flexible enough to let me switch it out for a tea. So I got to try the infused green tea, which was a refreshing and unique combo of pineapple and coconut. It was exotic, but wasn't too strong, so I think anyone would like it. 

I'm curious about the rest of their salads! They all seem to be low in calories, high in protein, and moderate in price. 

If you're vegan or vegetarian, or are just health-conscious, this is the perfect find for you!"
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2020-02-02,5.0,Totally chill place to hangout  . Large open space didn't feel  crowded as we waited for friends  .

Super nice and relaxing no hustle and bustle you find at a Starbucks  like chain... worth checking out and relaxing great place to take a load off!

You can get all the trendy healthy soup, sandwiches, pastries, smoothies, juices, booster shots, salads... you name it. 
They also have all the vegan milk options available.

Their soup of the day was a savory lentil soup and was delicious. Had their detox tea to go with it and made my breakfast very comforting and chill."

But in hearing someone outside the establishment say that had the best avocado toast from here. I had to try it my self! I got the Avocado Toast with Wild Caught Salon this comes with avocado, olive oil, himalayan salt, black pepper, wild smoked pacific salmon, micro-greens. The combination of all these ingredients made for a good toast. They have coffee and some great fruit juices such as Fruit Juice Number 2 which has 
apple, pineapple, turmeric and lemon. The Fruit Juice Number 3 has orange, pineapple, strawberry and pear. I didn't see any beef or chicken on the menu, did see a turkey sandwich. Good conscious eating!"
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-11-05,3.0,"Dr. Smood does two things really well:

1) Sandwiches. They have 5 or so on the menu and they're just perfection. The 'vegan' is surprisingly my favorite - it's just avocado, hummus, spinach, tomato, and pesto. The 'cold turkey' and 'power tuna' are also good, which are pretty much the same as the 'vegan' except replace the hummus with said protein. I think the pesto is the secret weapon. 

2) Seating. They have tons of it, including a communal table in the middle. A handful of the seats are tall and deep which feel cozy and private even when the next table is only a couple feet away. It's a decent place for meetings or to sit and work for a couple hours.

Dr. Smood does two things not so well:

1) Cappuccinos. As a disclaimer, I'm a hardcore milk fanatic. I need at least a tall glass of whole milk to finish a cookie. My milk to cereal ratio is 3:1. A splash of milk in my tea is preferred. So when it comes to my cappuccinos? You better believe I'm all about that whole milk. But, I'm also open-minded, so I gave both the coconut mylk and almond mylk cappuccinos a try. They were horrendous. 

2) Pricing. Everything feels a bit overpriced regardless of the fact that it's in the Flatiron District. The other day I bought a sandwich and a bottle of one of their detox juices, and it came out to $25. For a sandwich and juice!"
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-11-05,4.0,"So I come from San Francisco where it is common for places to be cash-only. That being said, and being a tourist in NYC, it appears it is a very common thing for a store to be CARD only ?! This is important.

I was staying at a hotel a block away and on a whim, with only my hotel key, phone and two twenties on me, I walked over to try Dr Smood. I placed my order, and was able to cash in on my free (tasty) small drip coffee thanks to Yelp ! Once time came to pay, I realized my mistake - should've brought the whole dang wallet - and the beautiful, yet cold blond cashier gave me an unimpressed look when I had to step out of line, stick the coconut water back in their cooler, and figure out my shit.

The story has a happy ending, folks!

Not wanting to trek all the way back to my hotel empty handed, I mustered up all the courage I had and approached a woman on her lunch break in business attire. I think her name was Alex, she was from Uruguay, and she worked as a talent acquisition executive for education nation-wide. She was my saving grace as she so very kindly allowed me to use her card to pay for my order, while I paid her for the equivalent in cash. Not only did she allow me to do this but when time came to pay her back, she insisted upon ensuring I received the correct change from her to make up the difference between my order total and the bills I had brought. 

T_T 

I don't know what I did to deserve such a kind and willing person to help me but if you are reading this, THANK YOU!

Because of you, I was able to bring healthy, delicious smoothies back to the hotel to my family and enjoy their Hawaj shake, Mango maca and coconut water (all delicious in their own right, and I think my skin developed an afternoon-long glow after drinking their smoothies). 

So I guess my review is less pertaining to Dr Smood but rather to this kind patroness who happened to have good taste (and for me, serendipitous timing) to order lunch from this same spot herself."
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-03-19,4.0,"I was quite surprised at the decent quality of the restaurant itself here. It's clean, wasn't overly crowded when I visited, and has a very good wifi signal. The tables are big, there's a bathroom, and the layout of the place is very nice, on the whole. This place is labeled as an organic food store, but I kind of see it as more of a coffee shop. They do have quite a few organic food options, along with fruit juices, but most of the people I saw when I visited seemed to have coffee like items on them, so I'm not certain this place is listed in the right category.

I came here because I was having dinner at hill country and needed somewhere to sit for about half and hour. I ordered a latte with coconut milk, and it was probably the most interested coconut milk latte I've ever tried. It kind of had a... almost spicy after taste to it, but perhaps it could be better described as tingly... I'm not 100%. Either way, this is a good place to come do work, and I'd definitely recommend them on account of their good wifi speeds.

Oh but I did try the hawaj and really didn't like it. It costs a whole extra $2, so beware."
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-06-01,4.0,"Dr Smood has a really great ambiance. It feels like a business casual cave almost because it's so dim inside.

655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-08-27,5.0,"Holy smokes Dr Smood is the perfect spot for sandwiches, smoothies, juices, milkshakes, and salads. Did I mention that everything is organic and almost everything is vegan? Pretty dreamy. 

The Cacao dairy free milk shake is to die for. Seriously, trust. 

The avocado cold turkey panini is delicious! Make sure you accompany it with the wonderful Dr. Smood hot sauce. (DR PLEASE BOTTLE THIS HOT SAUCE)"
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-01-29,5.0,"First impression: ""Oh look, another bougie coffee shop!""

That's not an inaccurate assessment of the place - it is bougie, but I enjoyed the few times I stopped by. Why?

The vibe reminds me of a hair salon or spa that has a DJ and gives you a robe to wear and a latte. I sat at one of their large tables for about an hour at about 10-11am and it was not crowded at all and I loved their music. It was hip and chill, but not like Enya. *Please share your Spotify playlist with me.* Also, much like a spa, their bathroom was nice and clean. 

They have coffee, tea, juice, salads, soup, sandwiches, ""smoodies,"" and a large selection of grab and go items. I'm not vegetarian, organic, gluten free, etc., and while I understand the appeal of that I find a lot of that stuff sounds weird. That's their thing here though: good food = good mood.

Surprise! The raw oats and raspberry coulis was really good. My first impression of it (weird) was wrong, it's actually tasty and is a puree that tastes like banana. I wouldn't mix all the coulis in if I were you.

Finally, I found the staff to be quite the pleasant bunch. They seem to enjoy working here and are good at their jobs. Shoutout to Jada, I see you out here on these Yelp reviews! :)"
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-06-04,4.0,"Already had a morning coffee but was tempted in by the promise of avocado toast. While I am gluten free I tried a little nibble of my girlfriend's toast and I have to say it was perfectly seasoned and executed.

The drip coffee I got for free from checking in on yelp had a little too much kick on the back end of my palette but not enough of a punch on the front. This is mostly just my personal preference but I like a coffee that doesn't leave so much of an aftertaste but still is bold.

The juice selection looked amazing and would definitely like to try it next time. Plenty of fun seating to choose from and I loved the little drawings etched into the tables. Will definitely come back next time I'm in New York."

One gripe is that black coffee is a tad bit expensive for my taste. It was $4 for a cup of black coffee y'all. I get it that it's organic but still... 


Outside of that great place to work!"

I came here with a friend on a whim. There was lots of healthy options to choose from and the color coding was actually a bit confusing. I had a green smoothie and it was a bit bitter, but definitely gave my body the recovery it needed. There's a decent amount of seating options."
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2020-01-20,2.0,"the service people were nice but the coffee was terrible. we just got basic drip coffee, it was so acidic, tasted old, I couldn't even finish it. I got mine with the house made cashew milk and it separated/curdled in the coffee (further proof of the extreme acidity). I don't think I've ever had coffee so bad that I couldn't finish it. a real disappointment."
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2018-04-22,5.0,"Dr Smood is a coffee/juice shop with a health-conscious twist. At Dr Smood, you'll find ingredients like chaga mushrooms, caco, chia seeds, turmeric, ashwaganda, and echinacea, among others on the menu. They have ready-to-go smoody's (smoothies) and cold-pressed juices in the refrigerator. You can get hot beverages like coffee and tea from the behind the counter. I had Hawaj White Coffee, which was pretty small but tasty and I highly recommend it.

Overall, you'll get real food, real and simple ingredients, and plenty of dairy-free options. What more can you ask for?"
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-04-28,3.0,Overrated! The smoothies are so tiny and for $9.95 I'm 100% sure that you can find a better deal somewhere else with the same quality. I ordered the cacao smoothie and it was overall tasty. Just be aware that it has a strong coconut flavor to it so if you aren't into coconut I would say pass. The ambience is very dark and depressing and I was surprised people were actually studying and doing work there. Was it worth a try? I guess if you're willing to spend that much on a small smoothie and it's close by. Is it worth it to return? I would have to say no. The smoothie was tasty but not tasty enough for a small portion and high price tag.
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-10-16,5.0,This is the cutest little coffee bar/eatery! Their avocado toast is on point! Would certainly come here again when visiting the city.

I had a wonderful sandwich with hummus and pesto on a delicious grilled bread; loved it!
The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because I do think it is a bit pricey."
655,dr-smood-broadway-organic-cafe-new-york,2019-04-14,5.0,"This location doesn't list ingredients in all the menu items on Ritual so sometimes it's hard to know what in certain things if you order in advance. Nonetheless, I wish I had a Dr Smood near my home and office, and if only I could afford it, I would eat there for every meal every day.

My favorite things have been the green protein and açaí bowl smoothies, and the salmon sandwich. They're tasty, filling, and healthier than most other alternatives found elsewhere. It's always a struggle to find unsweetened almond milk no matter where you go in the city, so it's a nice relief knowing you don't have to ask or risk getting a cup full of refined sugar with your drink. There's also plenty of seating as with almost all of their other locations (except soho which can be a bit overcrowded)."

I got the smoody #2 from the fridge to-go because i wanted something a little thicker rather than watery to fill me up -- the smoothie did not look very appetizing but tasted pretty good (~9$).

It is right by work and the food and drinks are so healthy, but they are ALWAYS sooooo SLOW and they seem to roll their eyes at all the impatient customers.

While the girl that worked there was very pleasant, I paid too much for a glass of extremely weak tea. It's like they didn't even brew it at all, and threw some ice on it which of course stops all of brewing... And then handed it to me. Not impressed. You need to give me time to steep before you add ice to it and give it to the customer."

Shouldnt be so hard to construct a sandwich properly. Maybe employees need proper training!!!! Pesto shouldn't be smear on top of the sandwich but rather INSIDE the sandwich. It's unacceptable. And Sadly won't be coming back to this location."

Avocado toast with tomato is delicious and the toast is low-glycemic crispy that's easy to eat with your hands in front of others.

Cold pressed Detox Juice No. 4 is a great to pair with the toast.

The hot chocolate is good And good for you, and their coconut and almond milk are actually real unlike any other coffee shop that serves it from a box.

657,paris-baguette-new-york-4,2020-01-23,2.0,"I like Paris baguette iced coffee and pastries, but horrible customer service here by Times Square... I came here last time and I asked for a small iced coffee and she gave me a medium and I told the lady I ordered a small and she said oh you can have the medium. I took it thinking she charged me for a small but when I looked down at my receipt she  charged me for a medium when I told her small, but when it came out and I asked for my small she made it seem like she gave me a medium for the price of small. 

Also another time the lady came out with a bunch of bread to place it in the refrigerated area and I already had the thing open to grab a sandwich and she slides the door on my wrist/hand so I glared at her cause she didn't even say sorry or excuse me and the guy employee saw and he said something to her in another language but she didn't care and walked away from me. 

I came here today again after a few months later and this time I ordered a medium iced coffee and she said it was $4.02 so I gave her $5 and she literally holds it up and says is this real? And passes it on to aNother employee asking if my $5 is real. I've never been to a place where people check on a $5. I was so annoyed and embarrassed. If she said it was fake I was gonna go to chase bank and ask them to check if my money was real because I took it out of the chase ATM while recording it on my phone for the Paris baguette employee because she can't tell the difference. If you don't know than don't try figuring it out if a $5 is real or fake. It's not like I gave you a $50.  mind blown. Never coming here ever again!!!"

Have pre-ordered cakes online or through the app and able to pick up.

Cakes have the lightest cream! 6"" mini-cakes are good for small group and 10"" full size for bigger parties...though value wise, purchase the larger cake...

I love fwd to going to Paris Baguette on a weekly basis to try new things as their menu updates seasonally"

While certain locations may only have pastries, some have a sandwich section for people to grab quick lunches from. This particular location is right in Times Square and is quite convenient for those working in the area for their morning coffee and pastries.

My personal favorites include their mini croissants (perfect for snacking throughout the day!), Mr. Bear (a chocolate cake in the shape of a bear), and their chocolate croissants. 

You can also download their app if you are a frequent visitor to rack up points for rewards! The only drawback is that their items tend to be on the pricier side. For example, their Mr. Bear which is like a 3x1 inch cake cost around $2.75. Not terrible for NYC but definitely pricier than what you can find at other places for sure."

For some reason looks like there's a smaller assortment of items, but everything still looks tasty. Got a pineapple tart and onion cheese bread the size of a demi baguette. Both were good (3.5/ 5).

Ok, fine, went back around then and only bland, boring thinks on the shelves...come to find out they removed my favorite item altogether. Basically all that was out was croissants, and milk bread (pretty but so bland!!) and other bread you can find all over. Total disappointment.

They take a simple piece of bread and make it outstanding, I don't remember what the puffy thing with the brown top is that I got but it's just basically a sweet bread, with just the right amount of Crispnaround the edges, and after two bites I wanted to go back and get a bunch more to take home with me.

Circumstance found me having even more Paris Baguette experiences when my coworkers bought me one of their green tea blueberry cakes for my birthday. The cake was delicious - subtle green tea flavor with a good balance of whipped cream and blueberry; everything about it spoke to me.

This leads me to my first actual visit to PG. Located not far from the heart of Times Square, this location is super small. The space is kind of narrow with coolers filled with pastries, sandwiches, and such lining the side walls and the ordering counter in the back. Seating is limited to a small counter near the front but some reviews say there's seating upstairs (??). Anyway, I only stopped in for an Earl Grey tea for this initial visit. The tea was good - nothing outstanding but hey, it's tea. 

I'm giving this PG a 4 based on the strength of their pastries in general and the speedy service I received here. I would definitely return to try more of their offerings, and maybe some more tea ;-)"

657,paris-baguette-new-york-4,2019-01-19,4.0,Paris Baguette is a South Korean bakery café chain. There is now one in Times Square so I stopped in for a snack. I've eaten it many times in Seoul. This one had the bakery on the ground floor and a café on the second floor. I got a box with tiny cheesy mini croissants for a snack. They had a good selection. Many things that you'd see in Korea with mayonnaise and ketchup etc on the pastry. It was delicious just as it is in Seoul. Very friendly employees!
657,paris-baguette-new-york-4,2020-01-30,1.0,Their salad used to be good but lately the condition of the greens have been very poor. A few days ago I bought a chicken cesar salad where the green beddings were inedible because they were mostly wilted. Today I stupidly got a mango chicken salad hoping that my last one was just an isolated incident and this time it's actually far more disgusting simply because the mixed greens have tiny white molds growing. See attached pix. I tried to call them twice to let them know to take the rest off shelf afraid someone will get sick from eating them but the calls went to voicemail which simply said the mailbox was full.

657,paris-baguette-new-york-4,2018-11-02,5.0,"We stopped at this bakery by chance after purchasing our wedding rings and what an awesome stop!! There a three floors here. The first has most of their breads, pastries, sandwiches, cakes, and salads. The second has soups, sandwiches, salads, and platters. The third floor has a nice seating area. 

Everything was very clean and beautifully presented (at least on the first and third floors where we were, I'm sure the second is no different.)

We treated ourselves to the Onion Mozzarella Bread, Sausage Bread, and mini chocolate pastries. They were AMAZING. the bread was so light and fluffy with the perfect amount of onion and cheese. The pastries were crispy, flaky, and the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The sausage bread was akin to smoked sausage and pepper hero (though pastry sized). 

All and all this is an amazing stop for a quick bite or to sit and take a load off while enjoying some goodies."

The location was brightly lit but the three floors were dirty and there was trash scattered on the tables and chairs.  

The milk tea tasted like slightly bitter water, nothing remotely like the traditional milk tea.  It was extremely overpriced and practically tasteless.  The mango smoothie was made from concentrate.  As we waited for the drinks, we saw a large jug of orange liquid being added.  Not only did it lack legitimate mango flavor, one cup wasn't completely filled.  It was pure icy sugar water.  We paid nearly $20 for the drinks and all were subpar.  This location appears to have good ratings for the food but the drinks are absolutely horrid."

Paris Baguette is a neat little shop with excellent pastries, croissants and of course cronuts.  I also tried their curry croquette which was really good. The also have nice seating area on the 3rd floor which was nice. Great place to get some coffee and cronut near Times Square."

The coffee bun was my favorite - I loved how soft the pasty was and the top coffee-tasting crust.  I would recommend trying it!  The fruit tart was a little underwhelming - the custard base was a little too sweet and the puff pastry did not taste very fresh.

I opted for pear pistachio mousse cake since I have never tried this combination of flavors and this had 30 calories less (200 lol) then the other one. It was so light and delicious. Not too sweet (mark of a good dessert for me) and different. Husband opted for strawberry pudding which came in a small cute glass jar. It was very refreshing, light and again not too sweet. Looking forward to try more desserts there.."

This is a three-story tall Paris Baguette. As you enter on the first floor, you see the fresh sweet pastries on your left and some drinks on your right. In the middle, you have the savory pastries, cakes, packaged items, tumblers etc. I love their selection of drinks offered over the counter and the quickness it comes after you order it. The quality of the food and drink is always consistent and making me come back for more. There's additional seating on the second and third floor. You can also order food and beverages from the second floor. Very spacious, comfortable and clean dining areas. Great for a coffee break or somewhere to catch up with friends."
657,paris-baguette-new-york-4,2017-05-07,2.0,"Very unfriendly staff. Not even a ""thank you"" from the cashier. I don't like how they package the pastries after buying them (see photo). They just put them into bags instead of giving a box and the frosting all came off of my cronut. The prices are decent for NYC but still kind of outrageous. Their egg tart was TINY (probably 2 inches in diameter) and cost $2.25. You can get the same thing in Chinatown twice the size for $1. Anyway, I really like their cronuts, but I don't know if it's worth the walk here anymore."

The selection and variety of pastries and baked goods are amazing. The place has 3 stories with a window front...try to get a seat upstairs by the window and people-watch as you indulge yourself with the delicious pastries and coffee.

657,paris-baguette-new-york-4,2016-02-21,4.0,"Delicious pastries.

My all time favorite Korean bakery is Mozart, but I haven't managed to find any locations other than in the ATL area. PB is definitely a great substitute for when I'm looking to get my Korean bakery fix. 

Although the retail portion of the store is small, they still offer a decent assortment of freshly made products from sweet to savory.

My personal favorite is their rendition of the cronut. It's light and flaky, and the lemon frosting on top is perfect. Another favorite is their castella (a delicious airy sponge cake).

Keep in mind that there's more seating at this location that just the small section at the store front. There is a second and third level that provides you a better view of the city.

The prices of the pastries can be a little steep but it's worth it."

After the last bakery never showed up before the work birthday celebration, Paris Baguette came thru and was able to provide me with 4 beautiful and delicious whole cakes that I was able to place the order over the phone, go to the store, go straight to the front and pick up the four cakes in less than 15 minutes. Amazing service, everybody was very friendly and appreciate them having urgency on my behalf. I ordered the chocolate, strawberry, berry and green tea whole cake and everybody loved each and every one. Fed about 15 people and had so much left over we gave the rest to the company (staff kitchen). I will definitely be getting our work birthday/any occasion cakes from there. Thanks."

All the baristas here are super friendly as well. Hopefully I get to try some of their pastries, the lemon bundt cake always look so good!

658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2019-08-30,5.0,"Short review: Preferred drink is shakerato but don't get it to go. Preferred pastry is their ciambello(ne.) Fruit and oat bar is also good.

Whoops. I thought I had written a review from here a while ago. I go here occasionally for their delicious shakerato which is a mix of espresso, milk, and simple syrup shaken until frothy and topped with an orange peel. It served like a cocktail and is quite delicious and a good pick-me-up in the morning. It's a popular drink in Italy and I wish more places served it. You should get some water to drink with it as they mix well. I don't recommend getting it to go as it doesn't mix well and I find the portion oddly smaller. Their espresso drinks are their specialties and I wouldn't recommend their general coffee drinks

They also have a drink which is a mix of their good variety of Amaro (bitter liqueur) and espresso. I personally recommend their Ramazzotti or Montenegro as these are a bit rarer/tastier than Campari and they both mix well with espresso.

Their food includes some general Italian pastries (the Ciambellone is my personal favorite as it's good lemon and icing cake) as well as specorino, a unique mix of pastry, Speck, and Pecorino which is delicious but way too rich/buttery for it's own good. Their elephant ears are as described and aren't worth it for the price. The fruit and oat bar is also good and not too much.

Nice staff also. low 4."
658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2019-07-14,5.0,"We stayed at the Redbury, so naturally we need to check out the Caffe! It's an adorable Italian themed cafe with white tiles and a classic lunch counter. All that was missing was my Italian grandparents! 

The pastries are delicious! We enjoyed an apple fritter that was baked to perfection. The other day we had a breakfast sandwich and grilled cheese. The breakfast sandwich was perfect with gooey cheese. The grilled cheese was weird - it has fig jam. I felt that did not work and the taste was offensive to me. But the star of the show here is the gelatos! They are so delicious and a great treat on a hot day.

CM is a lot like Cheers. There are the regulars and the newcomers. And in a place like NY, we see less and less of the friendliness amongst such patrons. It was a welcomed refreshment to see here! Go, Mangia!"

I got to work and NEEDED coffee. Of course, the one day I actually need coffee, we're out of half and half so I venture out. 
I order my coffee and realize, on top of a crappy morning, I'm having a crappy week. Someone stole my card numbers and charged a bunch of stuff to my bank account. My card was closed. I completely forgot!!
Luckily, the woman working took pity on me and gave me my coffee for free.

And for desserts, since I go there a lot I love there gelato and granita (frozen espresso with super thick whip cream) , they are pretty good!"
658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2019-10-26,4.0,"The sandwiches and focaccia are very good for a coffee shop, good enough that it's worth dropping by even if you're not a coffee drinker, which is something I wouldn't say about most coffee shops.

One caveat is that the gelato in the affogato can be icy. Depending on when you get it, it's sometimes not just a bit icy but can have large chunks of ice in it. That's not surprising for an affogato that uses gelato -- good gelato doesn't keep long and good gelato places will discard their gelato rather than keep it overnight since it will ice up. But it's a bit disappointing, since they advertise a fior di late gelato (pure milk, unflavored, not even vanilla). This is uncommon in the U.S. and it's usually a sign that you're going to get good gelato, since you can't cover up the flavor of bad milk or the chemical additives some places use to keep gelato from freezing. No such luck here, though."
658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2020-01-13,4.0,"Came in one morning for a latte and was kind of disappointed by the pastry selection that was on display.  My latte was good, but not one of the best things I've ever had.  I'd be willing to stop by again and give them another try, hope it was just an off morning.  The person working behind the counter was a bit abrupt so it was off putting."
658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2019-07-19,2.0,"Inoffensive but not particularly interesting cafe. I tried a chai latte, which was probably 80% foam? Don't get me wrong, I like foam! But even when I got down to the tiny amount of liquid it tasted more like, well, lightly chai-flavored foam than an actual latte. By 11:30, the pastries were running low. I tried the ciavatini with cherry jam. The sour cherry jam was nice, the the pastry hadn't held up well with the wetness of the filling. Overall a meh experience that I likely wouldn't repeat."

658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2018-05-27,4.0,"interesting concept where you grab your own coffee and juice at beginning of meal. Its a prefix type menu where you have a few options and you circle which one you want. I went with the egg pecorino sandwich. Portions are small here for the price but it was still pretty good. As part of the pre-fix menu I also ordered a fruit oat bar which was VERY GOOD. I would eat that every morning if I could. Not overly sweet and just the perfect amount of fruit flavor.  My coworker ordered the toast with jam as well as the egg pecorino without the bread. It is a small portion but had good flavor.

Ambiance was like a old french bistro but it was in the lobby of a hotel. They have a connected coffee shop for takeout orders and coffee which was also cool.  Service was on point but this place is a ""non-tipping"" restaurant where hospitality is included. Never have seen that but nevertheless we still gave him a little extra."
658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2019-01-22,4.0,"My most positive comment is that they actually had a gluten free chocolate hazelnut treat for my companion and she said it was delicious. This is pretty unusual for most cafés.

We were a small group of friends who convened from a number of distant places. We were looking for an after lunch coffee spot. Unfortunately, the main cafe couldn't accommodate the group but they pointed us to a lounge down the hall in a hotel reception area where we found group seating that resulted in lots of good conversation in a pleasant and quiet environment.

My Americano was fine but not special and my oatmeal cookie was truly mediocre. Still, it was a nice spot and keeping my companion happy with a gf treat was worth a million bucks!"

My friend had the regular hot drip coffee and thought it wasn't great. She couldn't verbalize if it was too weak or tasted bad/funny, just not great.

I asked for a hot decaf coffee which they don't have but offered a americano which I thought was fantastic.

658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2018-01-16,5.0,"Having recently visited Rome for the first time, I now feel...just about exactly as qualified as I previously did to offer my opinion on Caffe Marchio. 

You don't have to have been to Rome to appreciate delicious savory snacks, excellent pastries, friendly and efficient service, and what I'm told is perfect coffee.*

That said, there absolutely is a Roman sensibility about this little spot attached to the Redbury Hotel. It is bright and high-ceilinged, artfully designed with a shocking number of tasty and portable choices ranging from tiny sweet snack to full savory meal.

If you're so inclined, they offer a $15 lunch box that includes your choice of sandwich, vegetable, drink, and cookie (the four major food groups). 

The hot sandwiches (chicken and pork) are both surprisingly sizable amounts of meat for $9 a la carte, and juicy enough that they will soak through the perfect bread by the time you finish. 

The carrots or the mushrooms or the quinoa salad or whatever you get will be a small amount of veggies, but enough to make you feel healthy, and tasty enough that you won't be upset about eating it. 

The real winners here are the pastries though. Everything I've tasted has been incredible. The Ventaglia are the simplest little flaky bites of flour and butter and salt, and all I ever want to eat...except the pasticciotti, the crostatino, the specorino and everything else are also worth eating. I wouldn't get the biscotti, but I'd really never get the biscotti. 

I recently stopped in again with some co-workers, and we all got lunch boxes. When mine was delivered to our table by one of them (grab a comfortable seat in the hotel lounge if you know what's good for you), I saw a San Pellegrino instead of an Acqua Santa, and I said, ""She gave me the wrong fancy water. That bitch.""

But then I realized that wasn't my lunch, and that she actually gave me the right water. 

So I'm sorry, lady who runs Caffe Marchio, for jokingly insulting you behind your back. You are very smart, and I am very stupid. You are nice and lovely and I'm not good-looking at all. 

Please don't hold this thing you did not know about against me.

658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2017-09-11,5.0,"Another quick service cafe from the Union Square Hospitality Group just opened, which is destined to be a success like everything else they do. Kind of like a Roman version of Daily Provisions, this cafe attached to their full-service Roman pizzeria, Marta, serves breakfast and lunch in a beautiful standing-only space.

They have great coffee and pastries as well as both hot and cold sandwiches and other breads. They even have dessert too, including a killer Tiramisu ($8) and great Fior Di Latte Gelato ($3).

The hot sandwiches are a must try - either the Chicken or Pork ($9) are excellent, served on perfect bread and a nice, satisfying size that you can also eat easily on the go.

If you want something immediate though, the pastries are all incredible. It's hard to choose a favorite, but it might be the Ciambellone ($3.50) or the Pastcciotti ($2.50), but it's worth returning here to eat your way through all of them. I'll definitely be back soon for more."

658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2018-02-08,3.0,"Wasn't too impressed. The prepared foods made for a decent lunch but it was pretty expensive. The ham ""panini"" was literally a slice of meat between bread - no other fillings or condiments. Tasty, but it felt a bit bare. The ribollita soup was great. 

Baked goods were hit or miss - the chocolate hazelnut and sour cherry tarts were amazing, but the rest of the things we tried were kind of average.

Friendly service and there is some high top/bar seating. Overall, nothing too special. 

3.5 stars."
658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2017-11-16,3.0,"The Danny Meyer hype machine rolls on with his classic Italian complex of Marta, Vini e Fritti, and Caffe Marchio in the Redbury Hotel. I was going to the dentist in the area and decided to treat myself to pastries at the latter beforehand.

It was easy to spot, despite the construction. Inside wasn't as airy and bright as all of the press pictures suggest, probably because of the gloomy day and sunlight-blocking construction. It looks authentically European, and it was cute, but not that cute.

They have quite a few pastries on offer, and at reasonable prices ($1-4). I went with a hazelnut ball and a sour cherry pastry. My boyfriend had an egg sandwich.

His sandwich was pretty good. My cherry pastry didn't taste all that fresh (and we were there around 9 or so). The hazelnut one was slightly better, but still didn't blow my mind.

One annoyance is that we were standing around for a bit waiting for my pastries, even though there were 3 people working and no other customers. Eventually they noticed and then quickly bagged them up. Hospitality is otherwise good here.

Overall, this is not a bad choice if you find yourself in Murray Hill / Midtown East. Don't think it deserves a trip out of your way, nor all of the glowing press I've seen lavished on it. The pastries were just fine, but this is nothing out of the ordinary from what you could get at any other bakery."

Shakerato is the best coffee option, but definitely better to have it there.  Food is uniformly wonderful -- whether the combinations are classic or more novel, the ingredients sing.

The place isn't very big so there won't be too much seating, although they have some standing tables. The cafe is also part of the Union Square Hospitality Group, which is generally a no-tipping group.

Not sure if they still have it, but if you are interested in getting a coffee drink and pastry, they had something called the Roman Breakfast, if I remember correctly, which is a flat price for a combination of any coffee drink and select pastries."
658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2018-02-06,4.0,"This luxe Roman style coffee bar in The Redbury brews killer coffee and makes fine sweet treats. Pastry in the morning morphs into a sandwich bar in the afternoon with damn good soups and great veg sides, a new addition takes the cake- literally. It is a CORNETTO filled with CANNOLI CREAM. Now normally, I prefer croissant to CORNETTO ,but this version baked at Marta is outstanding with the finest cannoli cream you ever tasted. My only wish is that they would serve it earlier so I could dunk it in their excellent coffee. Another new offering is a chocolate glazed donut- delish."
658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2018-05-23,5.0,Excellent cappuccino - it is a true stand up place.  You can find a seat in the Redbury Hotel.

658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2017-09-20,5.0,"If there's a better Roman caffe in New York, shoot me a DM. Even better - if there's another standing room only, Roman caffe located anywhere in the city, fire me a message. This might be the only one that exists in the five boroughs that I'm aware of. 

At this point, when Danny Meyer opens a restaurant, you don't need much convincing that it's going to be a solid experience. Sort of like when Tyler Perry releases a new movie. You intrinsically know you're in for a treat. It's a classically beautiful room with some grab-and-go pastries, sandwiches, coffee drinks, and a few Amaros if you're hankering for a post-lunch digestif. I recommend you don't leave without trying the Maritozzi Con La Panna that resembles a baked potato. It's sweet, but not so sweet to where you can feel a molar begin to rot. It's well balanced, light, and unique.  

You'll be in and out pretty fast, unless you're a standing desk kind of person and love being on your feet. There's not a single chair anywhere in the caffe, so if you're looking for the kind of Euro coffee shop where you can stay awhile, be sure you're wearing comfortable shoes."
658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2017-09-15,4.0,"The espresso granita Y'ALL. 

Icy lightly sweet espresso + layers of dreamy unsweetened whipped cream = ambrosia of the Roman gods. I'm not big on sweets so couldn't finish the bundt cake, but the pastries all looked fiyah. (PSA there is an easy access water station)

The beautifully adorned standing-room-only space is a nice tribute to classic Italia. Service is lovely (thanks Laurel!). Danny Meyer done did it again."
658,caffe-marchio-new-york-2,2017-12-12,5.0,"They have stools now for countertop seating! This place is a cute spot to grab a coffee or light lunch/snacks. I was introduced to this place via Mealpal and got a cute lunchbox set with an egg salad sandwich, soup, and a cookie. 

Everything was very tasty and fresh, and I will definitely come back for their delicious looking pastries. Service was friendly and there was minimal wait for everything."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2020-01-29,5.0,"Not far from my job. Usually come here with my colleague to get some coffee. Only have gotten coffee here as that what's its known for it seems, but from the looks of it, they sell breakfast and lunch and it seems quite accommodating to sit down and dine. I know they have outlets and WiFi. They have a second floor for the seating and dinning in. Try them out if you're in midtown Manhattan."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2020-01-21,3.0,"I came here on a Monday afternoon for some coffee and to try to get some work done on my laptop. There was a good amount of seating in the upstairs are; tables were a bit small, just enough for a laptop and a drink but sharing a single table with friend would be a tight fit. The lighting was not too dim and not too bright and there was pop music playing at a reasonable volume. The space was about 70% full when I arrived and there was a lot of chatter.

I ordered an 8 oz. Flat White ($4.50) which came out really quick and nicely presented with the classic coffee art of a heart on top. The coffee itself was just okay to me; the milk was very overpowering and the coffee was pretty weak itself.

The vibes of this place would probably be a good for catching up with a friend over a cup of coffee but for getting work done, it may be a bit noisy without headphones. Prices are average to slightly above average for the area and coffee is pretty average. Milk substitutes are $1 extra. The service was quick and attentive."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-11-25,4.0,"I came to this coffee shop around 5:30 pm for a breather after an job interview located nearby. I enjoyed the cute decor and was surprised how spacious the place was, especially the second floor. Second floor is reserved for table services during the day, but it remains an open seating area after the kitchen closes later in the day. The pastries are kind of pricey as they are in many other NYC coffee shops, but the chocolate chip cookie certainly exceeded my expectations - it's decadent and crispy and big! I prefer bigger size for a cup of latte but it's still a nice presentation."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-09-04,4.0,"First time in-app offer: your first drink is free, and this include dairy substitutes

Unlike most coffee shops that require you to purchase 6-10 cups before redeeming a free cup, Taylor St only requires you to purchase 4 hot beverages and your 5th is free which makes their reward system is pretty fair. Everything can be tracked within the app, and you can use their app to, order, ""check-in"" on premises, and pay in-stores."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"Wow, great place! I love getting a little lost when I'm in NYC because I always get end up at sweet little places such as this one. I passed the little, hip gem of a place walking up 40th. SUPER fresh healthy eats, pressed juices, bakery items, a great espresso and a very friendly staff (that covers it all, right?) They have a to go cafe downstairs and a sit down upstairs. I opted for up since I wasn't needing to be anywhere. I had the avocado toast w poached egg and it was amazingly good. A drizzle of basil oil on top and she made my eggs perfectly. (You can see the kitchen from your seat). They have several vegan options as well including almond milk for your coffee drinks.  One more thing, for any Aussie visitors, I noticed that there are several Aussie specialities here as well since the original owner is Australian. 
I'll definitely be back on my next visit."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-12-10,2.0,$8.71 for an iced matcha latte with oat milk that is primarily oat milk and almost no matcha? Is this place for real? Even for NYC prices this is outrageous.
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-11-15,4.0,Great Aussie cafe with a pretty amazing flat white that helped me snap out of my slumber after several night shifts! The vibes brought me back. I'm regretting not getting more goods when I stopped by. Next time!
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-03-29,4.0,"Love coming here for a sit down breakfast when I'm working in Midtown and have an excuse to have a breakfast meeting! Usually get the Aussie breakfast or the slow cooked eggs, with a side of toast with butter and Vegemite. I also stopped by to grab a salad for lunch recently, and really liked their kale chicken caesar (although I will say the portion is a little small for the price). Coffee here is awesome, albeit pricey."

Came here on a work morning, looking for a spot to pull out my laptop and work for an hour on free wifi. The muesli was great, though the portion was tiny for $8. The latte was perfect. Service upstairs (table service) was great."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2020-02-19,5.0,Delicious latte! Appreciate they have glasses/mugs if request. Music slightly too loud- would have been more enjoyable experience if the music was turned down a notch.
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2020-02-21,1.0,"Beware: will refuse to make a half caf drink, as absolutely any other coffee shop will. Claim they ""won't"" mix the beans (note, not ""can't"".) Advice for the shop - some customers have limitations as to how much caffeine their bodies can handle. Would behoove you to try to accommodate instead of sending them away."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2020-02-18,4.0,"Awesome spot. Love coming here for coffee and breakfast. Super friendly staff. The portions have gotten a little skimpier on my favorite breakfast menu item (the eggs/smoked salmon/avocado), but it's delicious every time."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-06-03,5.0,"I like to try different coffee shops when I'm in the city & I'm glad I picked this one. Great coffee, great people, no line. (I'm sure I missed the morning rush though). In my Monday struggle I ordered ""regular"" or their filter brew coffee, the one from Peru, which I haven't seen elsewhere & it's fantastic. The barista was friendly enough after I spoke up first, no one said anything when I first walked in but, fine.

The coffee is self serve, which is cool. The pastry case looked lovely, but you know, watch your waistline or whatever. I'll be back to find out if the sweets are tasty as they look. And of course to see how amazing their lattes are."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-09-17,5.0,"Great place to sit and enjoy a good meal. I had a chicken salad, which hit the spot. Baristas are friendly and there is an air of warmth all around. 
Go upstairs if you want table service."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-05-19,4.0,"Cool coffee. shop.  Desperately needed coffee ASAP and the barista was friendly.  Apparently I think it's a Aussie coffee shop because the wooden blocks convey of of the owner's bio.  There are limited pastries, but the selection is about quality.  The iced latte was very nice and the scone w/ butter was a dollop of heaven in my mouth.  Their brownie bite was also not too sweet and a nice snack.  The seating and layout are a bit obscure, but I think that's what they're aiming for to stray from the norm, by being unorthodox."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-02-28,4.0,"I got a flat white here, very good espresso! They did not have unsweetened almond milk, but did have oat milk. I mistakenly didn't tell them i could not have dairy, and at the last second i changed my order, they were completely understanding! the barista was very surprise though when i looked at the almond milk label and told her it was sweetened with cane sugar. Be aware of that! The atmosphere was great, i wish i could have stayed for longer. I highly suggest coming here! It's a little pricey but that's to be expected in NYC."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2018-10-20,3.0,"Ok-- this place has a lot of positive reviews on yelp so I am unsure if I came on a bad day but the music in here is so loud! I had to yell at the barista to place my order  I am unsure how anyone could have a conversation or do work in here.

I got a chai tea latte which was good but a bit over priced."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-02-28,5.0,"This cafe is so cool! Per the recommendation of my coworker, I stopped by this morning to grab breakfast on my way to the office. Was looking for something quick so I just got their ""superfood oatmeal"" -- was not expecting much, but little did I know it would be hands down the best oatmeal I've had. They line the walls of the cup with peanut butter before filling it with oats, adding green apples, and drizzling some honey. If even the most simple things are done well, it speaks volumes :-) would love to come back!"
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2017-08-05,2.0,"All I have to say is - $5 for a blueberry muffin? Are you kidding me? Price wasn't listed and I admit it was my mistake for not asking first (I paid with the app so didn't see the total) but it was smaller than the size of my fist and I didn't think it would be so out of the realm of the other baked goods' prices. When I went back in and asked how much it had cost, the answer I received was: ""We bake them in-house."" That's perfectly reasonable -- it really is -- but at that price, you'd think it'd be a large enough muffin, and one of the best ones in town. In fact, the flavor was mediocre, and it was soggy in the middle. I'd asked for it to be heated up, but figured it would just be popped in the toaster or whatever. So I'm not sure how the sogginess occurred, but anyway.

Pic attached with a bottle of nail polish for scale. Size aside, it was a pretty average muffin. This was not worth it at all.

Never again."

The green tea latte was strong but nothing to call home about, yet the coffee latte did definitely have me snapping a picture to tell mom about later. Strong, flavorful, yet creamy and milky, the latte was perfect."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-07-02,2.0,"The coffee, food and service were mediocre at best, which I can get past for a quick lunch, but the music was so loud I literally had to shout at my lunch date. I'm not exactly an old fart and have lived in NY long enough to expect busy places to be noisy, but the volume was akin to a nightclub... and the music wasn't even good! Left with a fierce headache not even a strong cup of coffee would remedy. Skip it... plenty of good coffee and lunch fare elsewhere where you can hear yourself think through the myriad choices available."

659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-03-25,5.0,"My first time here and it was great but at the same time bit scary of a experience! Allow me to explain:

The good: the coffees are decent, very friendly baristas, sufficient seating upstairs and a bathroom well taken care of. Fast WiFi, some power outlets upstairs and they don't bother you like other places if you're just working on your computer with a coffee. 

Now the scary part--which was completely my fault. I was locked inside!  It's one of those afternoons where you put on your headphones and enjoy the productivity included with your $4 cold brew. I completely lost track of time and was even happy that all of a sudden the place became so empty. Roughly 40min after the closing time....I realized the music stopped and shortly after I heard the glass doors being locked... I packed my things as I would on a super late morning, rushed downstairs and...found myself trapped inside like a desperate lab rat. 
I tried calling the number of the business but then saw the telephone right in front of me  ...
I'm sorry but I had to peek inside the closet where I found a lanyard holding what looked like an access card, and phew!!--they worked at the back door! I kept the doors open and put the card back where I found them. I closed the doors behind. Sorry again! I didn't set off any alarms..will be more aware next time!!!"
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2018-01-24,4.0,"Really, really good coffee - the drip comes in three different types that you dispense yourself and they even offer little cups for tasting before you commit to one. All of the coffees smell lovely and have a nice balance - nothing overly acidic or bitter; trust me, this stuff you can drink black even if you don't usually take your coffee that way. Do not ruin this coffee by adding copious amounts of milk or sugar.

The baristas pride themselves on the espresso drinks, and you can tell. I've never had a bad Flat White here; once, my order was taking a while and the barista came over to apologize because the first espresso shot he pulled wasn't good so he had to remake the drink. 

I would come here everyday if I could, but unfortunately it is quite expensive, even for NYC standards; a bit of a downer, but I think they raised the prices recently to keep up with rent. Still - I try to swing by whenever I really need a pick-me-up."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2018-08-29,4.0,"Went here to get an iced chai latte with oat milk during a work lull on a hot day. The drink was good and I love how cold it was--almost like the ice cubes were shaped specifically to melt and cool the drink. The service here was super friendly, but they took a bit of time to make the drink--I didn't mind since I wasn't in a rush, but just a warning as they seem to make one drink at a time."

Unclear who is seating you. $5 for bacon, $4 for avocado (mashed and flavorless and comes in a tiny side plastic condiment cup), $8 two eggs on toast. Pricy for a basic breakfast and unremarkable otherwise. Toast was burnt and did not taste good. No seasoning. Absolute garbage for the money. SKIP IT"

659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2018-08-01,5.0,"Coffee: I've only had the cold brew but it is fantastic. Way better than Joes or Gregory's and a couple of others I've had around the city

Food: I tried their classic breakfast sandwich. It is also awesome. The bread is just right, not too soft and not too hard/chewy. The egg was abundant and cooked perfectly, slightly runny yolk. The tomato was juicy and fresh. Overall great selection and mixture of ingredients.

Space: love the lighting and decor. Almost minimalistic, but still has personality. Seems like a good spot to study/get work done.

Service: staff has always been polite."

659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-01-23,2.0,"I ordered a drip coffee in advance through an app. The message from the vendor told me to go and pick up my drink, which I assumed would be ready to go. After waiting for over ten minutes I asked the staff and she threw me a cup and told me to pour it myself. Sure, that might have been the protocol to have customers pour the drip themselves, but it was my first time visiting the cafe and I thought my order had been forgotten, plus the employees were inattentive and rude. Probably not coming back."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2016-06-03,4.0,"This cafe was a wonderful treasure find around the area. There are so many cafes around here, therefore, competition is intense! This spot is only opened during business hours but I was able to come here during my lunch break. I heard and saw pictures about the Wild Blueberry Latte and this is what I am here for. This is a small little café spot with a chalkboard menu of espresso drinks and baked goods. 

Wild Latte. Very simple latte art that is pleasing to the eye. There is a subtle aroma of blueberries and I could taste a bit of it when I took my first sip. This is one good cup of coffee.

The barista area is open so you can see your barista at work. There is a small bench for seating. Grab a punch card!"
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2018-07-19,2.0,"Have passed this place several times on my way to work.  Decided to stop in today for an iced coffee, my typical go-to and readily available from over a dozen nearby coffee spots.  

Coffee was good, but this place does not have it together.  The process of ordering and getting your food/drink definitely needs to be improved.  I ordered a simple cold brew with nothing in it and my order was forgotten, notwithstanding this it would have taken 10 min to get if not forgotten anyway.  The two workers repeatedly crossed each other up and it was confusing who was doing what.  

With so many other comparable options in the area it's hard to see myself coming back."
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2019-05-16,4.0,"I really want to give this place a five-star rating, but there are two huge turnoffs - the price ($8.50 for a medium iced dirty chai with oat?!) and the app. I work nearby and often come without a wallet, expecting to just pay with the app as you do in Starbucks. However, you have to ""check in"" once inside the cafe to be able to pay with your pre-loaded balance, and the check in almost never works for me - even when I'm on their wifi and have location services turned on (as the app suggests). The baristas have always been great and given me a coffee when this happens, otherwise the sheer frustration would knock this rating down further. I do love this place despite its faults (that have nothing to do with the quality of the drinks or staff)."

Cons: Price"
659,taylor-st-baristas-new-york,2017-06-09,5.0,"DRINKS | I ordered Pearl Jasmine Tea. With it being my first time here, I didn't know what to expect, but if you order ""for here"", it comes with a little tea cup and tea pot so you can manage how much tea you want at a time. If you ask for honey when you order, they provide the honey in a little side cup as well. A+ tea and presentation.

SERVICE | Yes, yes, yes. The barista is so friendly and excited about not only serving orders, but also interacting with the customers and co-workers. From sitting there, I could tell the barista really wanted to make sure everyone was enjoying themselves and that their drinks came out just right.

SPACE & AMBIANCE | I do not think upstairs seating was open because I came in the early morning hours. As for downstair- the space is a little small, but bench seating is available: it can probably fit around 6 people at a time. Ambiance is casual, comfortable, and friendly.

OTHER |
- Price: Jasmine Pearl Tea ~$4
- Bathrooms: Clean and available
- Payment: I feel like they only take card or just prefer card. I tried handing in a dollar bill but they said they have no change. It seems like they don't have a cash box either."

Well, Starbucks has a tall (their smallest one) for less than $3.  I have been to other cafes in Manhattan and they all come under $3.   

If you bring your own cup,  you save 25 cents.  Go green.  
There are two commune tables.  I sat there for an hour reading on my kindle.  The bathroom is very clean and spacious."

Place is surprisingly empty.

My vanilla latte with oat milk was rich & just sweet enough, and the almond croissant I ordered was HUGE! It wasn't too crowded & they have a large communal table, meaning I could spread both of my binders out & work comfortably. And, as someone who got a little tooooo excited when I heard about MCR playing at the Barclays Center, the music was right up my alley. I only wish there was a larger food selection since I was there a while and wanted something a little more substantial than a croissants. Will definitely be back!"

Great music selection. Some 90s and mid-00s songs. (Alright by Jain, 100 years by five for fighting, etc.) The barista is very friendly and seemed to know his coffee. The cold brew is delicious. 

This cafe is small, but because it wasn't too busy there was plenty of seating. There are two long tables with many chairs. There are also a couple of wooden bench-style seats. Overall, a great vibe for getting some work done or just catching up with friends."

Their menu was pretty standard and they even have oat milk as a dairy alternative (highly recommend for espresso drinks)! I ordered the cold brew for myself and a matcha latte with soy for my friend. The cold brew was pretty good, not too sour or bitter like some other ones I've had. The matcha latte felt somewhat lacking? It definitely wasn't too sweet but I've definitely had better."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-10-10,5.0,Absolutely LOVE this location. I've always loved coming to Cafe Grumpy bc the coffee is delicious and the staff is so amicable ! I have enjoyed every drink i've gotten from here and their desserts are seriously so good. I had the pumpkin loaf and lemon loaf yesterday and I am STILL thinking about them. I also got an iced maple spice latte which was so good I didn't have to add any sweetener to it. I think my favorite place about this place is that they use paper straws and their seating (which they have a lot of) is so cute! Definitely stop by!
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-01-27,5.0,"Dropped in to this place to grab a matcha green tea latte and they didn't disappoint. The latte was served to perfection, while the milk helped to cut through the green tea bitterness that is sometimes experienced.

They have a wide assortment of different coffee drinks and they even have whole bean coffee ready to grind yourself for a nice fresh option.

Situated right in the heart of midtown, is a great quick detour to grab a nice caffeine pick-me-up! A+!"
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-07-28,5.0,"Great service, perfectly air conditioned, comfortable seating, wonderful cappuccino. They also have so much variety with delightful lemonade concoctions and food options. Perfect start to any day"
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-10-31,5.0,"A cute little cafe with a funny name and good coffee. The interior is pretty small with 2 large tables and stools around it. This is perfect for small meetings, even though it get pretty loud/busy during lunch time. There are also newspapers on the tables for you to read since laptops are not allowed.The bakery/food section is pretty small, but they make their baked goods fresh daily. I ordered a latte and they even made the pretty design that everyone loves to Instagram. Overall, the coffee is not watered down, had a strong flavor and at a decent price.

Will be coming back!"
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-03-28,3.0,"PS and I stopped by at this place mainly because I was craving of hot chocolate. The café looks pretty but pretty small, but hot chocolate wasn't good. It was too much milk. I am not sure if I'm gonna go back to be honest."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-06-10,4.0,The cortado was incredible. Cute little spot. A little plain in decor but the coffee is NOT a disappointment. Putting it on my return list for future NYC visits
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-05-05,5.0,"Fine tasting mocha latte decaf and nice ambiance. Not pretentious.  Interesting customers--for some reason these long tables make for good opportunities to actually TALK TO HUMANS!
Thanks for a gutsy, smooth, rich and not too sweet cup!"
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-06-28,2.0,"So I came in on a Thursday evening and ordered an iced matcha latte with almond milk. $6 and the barista just poured cold milk in a plastic cup, mixed some matcha in, and dumped ice cubes in last. Wow. Great. Such quality. Wasn't even full. Still at least 1.5 inches of empty volume at the top. Overpriced. Overrated. 10/10 don't recommend."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-08-04,5.0,"There are a lot of options on this one block alone, but I wanted to try a smaller coffee shop native to NY which is how I stumbled along into this shop on a rainy Saturday morning. It was fairly empty (only two customers). I was greeted in a warm manner by the barista, and I ordered a flat white. I've had many a flat white in my lifetime, and I have to say that this barista did a FABULOUS job. I also had the almond croissant which has powdered sugar on top and an almond paste in the middle. Next time I'm in New York, I'll be back here for another flat white/almond croissant combination."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-11-22,4.0,One of few quiet coffee spots by time square. It's nice and spacious  with good coffee! It's a great escape from the crowd of time  square!

660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-12-02,4.0,"3 1/2 stars, just can't do the half here! Not as solid as the one in Brooklyn! I've had lattes and macchiatos at both, and I particularly like the BK location better. Somehow the way they froth the almond milk isn't as great here. But it's still good coffee, and I would rather go here than any other coffee place in this neighborhood,especially."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-05-07,2.0,"What the heck is the hype about this place?! I just started working around the corner and my co worker recommended Cafe Grumpy to me so I decided to go. The line went pretty fast and when it was my turn to order I asked for an iced vanilla latte but apparently they don't serve vanilla or were out? IDK the server was mumbling. Anyways I got a mocha latte instead and it is literally horrible. There's grinds or something floating inside, or maybe it's some trendy mocha particles but who knows!! I spent SIX dollars to drink chocolate milk with particles in it!! And the worst part of it all is that they used a Non- permanent marker to write my name on the cup so guess whose hand is covered in black marker... yeah MINE! Maybe I just got unlucky but I won't be returning here that's for sure!"
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-08-28,2.0,Baristas get pretty rude and aggressive when they are busy. Seems like they need more than 1 person for efficiency on the bar since working alone might be stressful. I didn't have pleasant experience and drink.
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-05-28,5.0,"I had always wanted to come to this cafe. It felt pretty convenient to have this cafe near Herald Square. The service was great. I had ordered a cardamom honey rose latte but couldn't decide hot versus cold. I took the baristas advice and the iced option was the best choice. I tasted the floral content throughout the whole beverage. 
Ironically, it was that baristas last day. But I'm glad i had a good experience."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-06-05,5.0,"Gotta say this place is fun and the people are not grumpy! The iced mocha latte tasted like a cold
Hot chocolate (so cool) and they gave us stamped grumpy sleeves. What a fun place"
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2016-11-11,5.0,"Depending on what area of town you're in - independent coffeeshops can be a warm and fuzzy haven. Grumpy is no exception... and other than the logo, no one here is actually, well, grumpy.  If you work in midtown, the café is a respite from your office, and from the noisy streets of Times Square and Herald Square surrounding it. 

Grumpy truly serves a fantastic espresso - I usually get a soy latte (and yes, they've got almond milk, too).  Though, keep in mind ICED lattes are 50 cents extra.  They roast their own beans and every cup packs a punch. I come here on a regular basis, and personally speaking, of Grumpy's seven locations, this one has the best energy and overall fun baristas. 

Grumpy also has many carb-heavy pastries.  And, as it is with many of their cafés, this Grumpy is laptop-free.  While many may see this as a negative, it keeps the tables open for the midtown latte aficionados and there is usually a place to sit if you want to chill for a bit."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-02-25,5.0,"I brought my friends to their coffee shop in fashion district. Also, bought their coffee beans heartbreakers for my mom in china. My mom loves their coffee beans heartbreakers because it's very strong. My friends also said it's the best mocha they ever tried. Overall it's one of the my favorite coffee roasters in nyc."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-12-07,5.0,"for a Saturday morning crowded.  There is seating.  Great cup of coffee. Just off 39th street and 7th Avenue.  The restroom was very clean.  Excellent customer service.  In addition to  milk and skim milk they have  soy, almond and oat milk. I will be back."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2017-12-06,4.0,"I love a coffee place that starts my order before I even place it. Cafe Grumpy makes my day!

This area is littered with coffee places but Cafe Grumpy is by far my favorite. It can get a little hectic during the afternoon but they know how to keep the line moving. There are 2 huge tables and for some reason people love to conduct interviews here so grab some coffee and eavesdrop for some free entertainment since there are no laptops allows. 

The pastry selection could use some work. There are croissants, cookies, breads, scones, and muffins and I've tried a few things but it was all just average. The coffee is definitely the prize winner. Usually I just grab a cup and head to the office. Iced latte with skim milk every time unless it's freezing out."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-05-28,2.0,"Biggest factor for low rating is bc of 
NO WI-FI 

Iced coffee for $6.50 is all ice and no coffee, so ask for light ice. 

Would not return"
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-10-28,5.0,I had both latte and matcha latte. Both were delicious with the right amount of silky foam. Our barista was very friendly and he made nice latte art. The place is spacious with 2 communal tables. They sell pastries and cute merchandise with Grumpy face.
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-07-11,2.0,"So here's my deal with the Grumpy.
Strictly in terms of beans, their roasts are unparalleled. Heartbreaker espresso in particular kills it every time...If it's pulled right.

And here's my deal with this particular Grumpy location: the shots are hit or miss, and recently on the miss side. I'd understand this if I were coming in at 8:30AM when they're massively busy, but I visit at the lulls around 11AM or 3PM. The shots I buy range from jaw-salts sour to eye-wateringly bitter, but I rarely enjoy a well-pulled shot here. And I can't imagine the baristas here being underskilled - maybe something's keeping them from keeping the espresso dialed in?

Again, this isn't usually a problem with any of the other Grumpies - I'm regularly at their OG in Greenpoint and their Chelsea shop, and I'm rarely disappointed in the product. Here it's almost guaranteed, to the point that I'll walk the extra 19 blocks to Chelsea, or skip Grumpy altogether and opt for Optimistic down the block.  I still buy the beans for home use, because they're magical.

Get it together guys, I know you can do it!"
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-11-19,5.0,"Cool atmosphere, friendly barista, great flat white. Will be back! Bf got a matcha latte and it had a generous amount of matcha in it, yum!"
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-02-25,4.0,"Café Grumpy may have risen to fame from Girls, but the great coffee there stands on its own. The space is fairly large for a small specialty shop, and you can actually stand and wait for a drink without truly being in anyone's way which is unique for specialty cafes in the area. Technically representing Brooklyn, it's a great representation of a flavor forward brew that doesn't skimp on the frothed milk, giving it almost a sweet flavor. I definitely wasn't grumpy after a double shot after a long bus ride."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2017-11-27,4.0,"A refreshingly unique coffee shop in the midtown Manhattan area.

Here you'll find a solid iced mocha latte (real shaved chocolate pieces!), espresso and pastries (and I'm sure many other fantastic coffee options) -- that are worth the price and the price is worth not going to Starbucks. But, aside from great coffee, this place is set apart by its no laptop policy and two large, communal, Game of Thrones era tables.

The staff is always friendly, *not* grumpy, and there's typically a steady crowd flowing in and out, but I've never had trouble grabbing a seat."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2018-09-28,5.0,"It was January 2016 I popped into NYC from LA to do an exhibit. I found Cafè Grumpy one day. My mum was with me. However she had been hit hard by the flu. As soon as I hit the line Mum had a 5 year old 'I'm sick and tired type tantrum'. We left the line and I walked her home to the hotel. Put her to bed and returned to Cafè Grumpy, laughing that Mum got grumpy in Grumpy. She wasn't herself. Poor bugger. 

On my return I got the most rewarding latte. Perfectly made in a coffee cup and saucer. (China makes it taste better) 

It's now 2018 I'm back in Manhattan and guess what Mum is with me. I take her to Grumpy and we have the best time together. I remind her of the story and she buys a t-shirt and laughs at herself. 

Both the barista and server gave exceptional service. The coffee (latte) was the perfect match of espresso to dexterity of milk with a fabulous foam of froth. It's a great spot to take Mum, boyfriend, girlfriend or take a business meeting. Just love coffee here. Love the intimate venue and love the great people that make it."
660,café-grumpy-new-york-4,2019-04-11,2.0,"Dont quite get what the fuss is all about. Got a mediocre lukewarm latte for $5 (I think they might have only one size, it's like a small at most places). Nice staff though. But wont be returning."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-12-28,4.0,"Highly recommend ordering ahead! We arrived at around 12PM on a weekday with less than 10 people in front of us in line, yet we waited close to 30 minutes before our 3 orders of 1 sandwich each were ready. The sandwiches themselves are HUGE and will probably last you 2-2.5 meals as they are packed with meats and cheeses, but they are quite pricey at around $15-$17 a pop. There isn't much seating inside, so its more of a to-go type of place. 

As for the sandwiches, I highly recommend the Alidoro if you can handle some spice. The alidoro is STUFFED with the works and full of flavor. I also tried the pinocchio which was just ok. It isn't nearly as flavorful and it has no veggies in the sandwich. The olive paste is very salty and a bit overwhelming. Definitely stay away if you're not big on salt or if you hate olives as the olive flavor can be overwhelming."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-12-21,4.0,"High-quality Italian sandwich if you are willing to pay a higher price. Only come when you have enough time because your order will take around 20-30 minutes if you come during the lunch rush. I believe you can order ahead.

I ordered the Pinocchio sandwich--prosciutto, soppressata, fresh mozzarella, sweet roasted peppers, and olive paste. I got it on the tramezzino bread. The sandwich was fairly large, which somewhat justified the $16 price tag for this sandwich. I personally would like to try another sandwich because I thought the olive paste was a bit overwhelming and too salty for my taste buds. Everything else about the sandwich was high-quality and the bread was nice and chewy.

I would return to try another one of their sandwiches and probably order ahead next time."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-12-10,2.0,"Lunch rush can be hectic and the service was terrible. I had the Italian Cheesesteak. It came out to over $16 which is pricey but the sandwich was large enough to share between 2 people. 

The roast beef was extremely dry as if it was reheated several times. I should've probably stuck with cold cuts. The bread was chewy, toasted and pressed very thin. I didn't taste anything, NO truffle NO rosemary, except for the salty cheese. I was so disappointed. 

On the bright side, wine and beer are $5 all day!"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2020-02-19,5.0,This spot is a hidden gem in New York and probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.  The bread really makes the sandwich along with the cheese and the fantastic meats they offer.
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-05-16,5.0,"This really is ""as good as it gets"" in terms of midtown sandwiches, so the 5 stars are deserved.  I've gone with the ""Matthew"" and the ""Alyssa"" on a number of occasions, and they never let me down.  It all starts with the bread - always super fresh.  The prosciutto is better quality than anything in a deli, the mozzarella is top notch, and the secret sauce makes the difference.  They've improved their queue management tremendously as well.  No wonder why I saw one of those ""Best Sandwich"" tv shows filming there one time.  If you're anywhere nearby, you have to swing by this place for a sandwich - you won't regret it."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-03-04,4.0,"4 stars is fair for this upper market sandwich house. 

I had the spicy one, the Enzo. I've had it a few times. It's pricey but worth it in my view. It is a lot of food. You could almost do a half and half for lunch and dinner seriously. The peppers on this sandwich have a spicy jalapeño running through it that really give it a kick. 

Couple of things to note, either come early or come late, but don't come at 12.30 or you'll wait 45 mins. They don't manage the line well, and they don't manage the speed well. So be aware. Second, it isn't cheap so if you are looking for that don't bother. Enjoy though, solid spot. 

Price 3/5
Food 4.5/5
Service 3.5/5 - nice but slow
Ambiance 4/5 - nice place to sit"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-04-08,4.0,"Seven shards of plastic found in my sandwich. Really a shame, because it was tasty.

For the biz: Pinocchio sandwich, ordered around 1pm on3/21

The manager responded very promptly to my review. He worked with their staff to identify what may have gone wrong in the production process.

These things happen and I couldn't have asked for a more professional response. I'll give them another try."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2018-07-17,4.0,"They make good premium Italian sandwiches with quality ingredients, during the mad rush that is the Midtown lunch crowd. I've ordered their sandwiches on many occasions, and my trading floor often orders platters for catering, but catering is ridiculously stingy with their fillings. I wouldn't recommend.

The place itself is always packed and they may omit an order here and there. After watching others grab their sandwiches, I inquired about mine and they hastily assembled it. I prefer their hot over cold sandwiches, especially the Pinocchio filled with prosciutto, sopressata, fresh mozz, sweet roasted peppers, and a pungent olive paste. The bread is a bit hard and the meats were salty, but definitely top-notch cured quality. 

Their donnoli pastry is a cross between a donut and cannoli. It can be oily, and the white cannoli cream is significantly better than the chocolate hazelnut. Pulling the spiraled pastry apart is half the fun. Overall bellissimo spot for a fine lunch option!"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-10-21,5.0,"Hands down one of the best sandwich shops in the city. Bread is on point, meats are a no brained and their spreads are .

Reminds me of the real deal sandwich shops of Firenze. 

I'm a sucker for Mortadella so the Fiorello sandwich is my current favorite. It's a hot sandwich. Toasted Stirato bread, thinly sliced import mortadella, fresh mozzarella melted together and heated just enough and topped with a cold eggplant caponata that'll knock your socks off. 

It's about $15 a sandwich but well worth it since all all ingredients are of the best quality. This isn't your average deli roll or ""Italian bread"". Highly recommend if you're craving a good sandwich."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-02-12,4.0,"If the line wasn't so long, I'd go more frequently!

661,alidoro-new-york-2,2018-11-27,3.0,"I don't know what it is about this place, but I just feel like for the size and quality of their sandwiches, their prices are astronomically high.

The ingredients and bread are good, but not amazing and it is a very average sized sandwich.

That being said, the staff here is super friendly and they crank them out quickly--I just can't bring myself to spend $15 for the sandwiches they are offering."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2020-04-20,5.0,"First and foremost, these sandwiches are phenomenal and are the closest thing you'll get to original sandwiches in Italy. I just ordered on seamless, order came in slightly wrong and Alex (manager) was incredible and redid the order and included desert. Class and service. Thanks!"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2020-01-31,2.0,"Came here for lunch and had to wait 25+ minutes for a sandwich. They said the oven was packed due to high volumes of hot sandwich orders.

661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-09-07,5.0,"Alidoro serves incredible freshly made sandwiches right near Bryant Park, making it the perfect lunch spot! A great variety on their menu and we loved both of our speciality sandwiches, the Mona Lisa (fresh mozzarella , artichokes, sweet peppers) and the Sinatra (smoked mozzarella, artichokes, sun dried tomatoes) that were on toasted on fresh focaccia. You can tell they care about quality ingredients because of how great everything tastes. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu!"

Still made a small mistake on my order (I order off the old menu) but it didn't matter since my and my colleague sandwiches were excellent.  THANK YOU.  One of my favorite places is back on the list!  Best italian sandwiches in NYC!  Excellent ingredients and great preparation.   If your a italian hero lover, you have to go to Alidoro!"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-06-25,3.0,"First time here at a recommendation from a coworker. Sandwich prices are a little steep (starting at 13$+), but the sandwiches are pretty big. Definitely higher quality than a footlong sandwich from Subway. I had the BRANDO, a roast chicken based sandwich, while my colleague had the cheesesteak. Upon opening my sandwich at my desk, I noticed the sandwich fillings did not fill the length of the sandwich (parts of the ends were just basically bread). The Brando was a delicious combination of mainly chicken and provolone. There were a couple slivers of sweet roasted peppers, and two to three pieces of arugula mixed in.

Overall decent sandwiches. May make the trek out from the office a couple times a year, but probably wont be a goto lunch spot."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-06-04,1.0,"You had one job to do! Just get the correct order ready and It was obviously too difficult... 
Where are we? McDonald's? 
Do I have to open my sandwich every time to make sure I get the correct one?! 
On top of that the wait was insane!"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2018-08-10,5.0,"I go to Alidoro when I want a small breakfast sandwich that packs a punch! The staff here is always friendly and they greet you as soon as you walk in the door. Everyone is usually wearing a smile when I walk in. 

Today I ordered the Davide which is a hard poached egg, smoked sliced chicken, a smear of bel pase, loads of hot peppers and it is on a mini brioche bun. It is made fresh while you wait the 5 minutes for it to be all put together. This mini breakfast sandwich is loaded with flavor and you only need one to get over those hunger pains. 

I would definitely go back to this restaurant and pick up this breakfast sandwich for $3.50 in Midtown. I cannot wait to go back and try there lunch items."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-12-11,5.0,"One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. We stopped in mid-afternoon after the lunch rush. The staff were friendly and offered suggestions in a polite way.  There are so many choices, but we tried the Gothamist. The sandwiches are large enough to split yet you  still feel quite full. There are five bread selections and it is a nice touch they are displayed where you place your order. The Gothamist had prosciutto,  was supposed to have fresh burrata,  but they were out and substituted fresh mozzarella. The prosciutto, was  fresh, thinly sliced and just the right amount of salt.  The sandwich included lemon basil pesto and fresh basil leaves.  The lemon was very faint and could have been a little more prevalent.  It was all accompanied by a sun dried tomato paste. Overall, each flavor complimented the other, the salty prosciutto was toned down by the mild mozzarella.   Many yelp reviews mentioned the prices being high, but since the sandwich was enough for two, it was equivalent to the price of two sandwiches.  Will definitely return."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-11-23,5.0,Absolutely incredible sando! My only quip is how long you have to wait to get that baby ( and I say baby because it's he actually as big as a new born) in your hands!
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-09-12,4.0,"Ugh I really do like this place. I'd get it regularly if it wasn't so expensive. But every once in a while I'll treat myself to a $17 sandwich for my lunch break. no but really, a warmed Pinocchio sandwich is excellent. I also love the alidoro one. So many good options and I wish I could try them all!"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-11-06,5.0,Love this place. A little expensive but worth it. If you complain about the service you're probably just being indecisive. The owner takes her job seriously and doesn't have time for BS.
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-02-18,1.0,"Ordered a bulk order on Friday and was told to arrive at 12:04 for pickup. Sandwiches were provided an hour later than they said they would. Upon arrival back at the office we noticed that they provided only half the sandwiches in the order. We had to go back and pick up the second half. All in all this took ~1:30 longer than it should have. All sandwiches were also labeled incorrectly. Most sandwiches were missing requested ingredients.

What are y'all doing right if all that is wrong.

661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-02-13,4.0,"Come here for a sandwich when you want to treat yourself. Yeah $20 is a lot for just a sandwich but man was it worth it. I got the Pinocchio sandwich on semolina bread which had prosciutto, soppresata, fresh mozzarella, sweet roasted peppers, and olive paste. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and of amazing quality. The staff appeared to be very hard working and skillful sandwich makers. Place was spotless. You can't beat this location either, it's just a couple blocks away from Grand Central so commuters: get your subs here on your way home!!!!"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-01-21,4.0,Very good Italian sandwiches here. Can't really go wrong with the Alidoro sandwich. Generous amount of prosciutto which tasted amazing and roasted red peppers but had way too much dressing on top of what I was eating which overpowered the prosciutto and made it quite spicy. Maybe I have poor tolerance to spice but this just took away from the sandwiches taste. Haven't tried any other ones but this place is still very good and has a solid reputation. Came here once before and the line was so long it stretched outside and waited 30 minutes. Definitely look inside before you commit to this place because it does tend to be very crowded.
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2017-12-01,4.0,"This review is for their Mealpal: Fellini Sandwich - sopressata, fresh mozzarella, hot peppers, arugula

Great deal on MealPal, plus you don't have to wait on line! The Fellini was delicious and filling. The bread was pretty tough, which made it somewhat difficult to eat without creating a mess. 

If you are on MealPal, I definitely recommend you to try one of their sandwiches during lunch."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2018-03-09,4.0,"Alidoro is a great change of pace from American Delis around town with plenty of sandwich selections and friendly service, but minus one star for sandwiches being $20 dollars and getting a slightly disappointing ingredients to bread ratio.

It also seems like the sandwich selections are hit or miss. The chicken parm sandwich came with pretty dried out chicken, but the roast beef cheesesteak used pretty high quality ingredients.

Extra shout out to the employees because they were incredibly friendly, but I don't see myself coming here as often due to the points above."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-06-10,3.0,"I tried.  Im a panini girl when back in Italy, and made the mistake of thinking that I could get something comparable in NY- First off you would never spend $16 for any sandwich in Italy and secondly these sandwiches in Alidoro are bland- Its not their fault, we just cant get the same quality products over here!  I tried 2 times but the price kills me for what you get- If you've never been to Italy you will probably love this place, for the rest, eh- they are trying, but the rent is too damn high-"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-06-05,5.0,"Wow, I had an amaaazing cold sandwich. It was a large enough portion that I had a late dinner that night and was extremely satisfied after lunch. It was delicious with mozzarella, red peppers, and arugula. The bread is to die for."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-05-17,4.0,"I'd be happy to give this place 5 stars as their sandwiches are amazing. However, the counter staff is extremely rude. If you want 5 stars, hire better staff."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2017-08-13,5.0,"I was looking for a portable lunch option between the Upper East Side and Penn Station.  My husband and I were toting carry-on size rolling suitcases, so initially we parked him with the suitcases at a small park across the street on the same block while I cued up with all the impeccably dressed young business people (or whatever they do).  The line went faster than I expected and shortly I was inside the shop, and then again, shortly I was at the ordering spot.  We got their signature sandwich, the Alidoro, cold, and one hot sandwich, the Fiorello.

Once I got past the ordering spot, I realized that the back is larger than I expected and there were tons of places to eat-in.  Since almost all the power lunchers were taking their food to go, I contacted the husband and he jumped on the chance to come over and eat in.  I figure you're paying for the option to eat in, might as well do it.  We sat at a bar facing away from the crew of sandwich makers and had no problem tucking our bags under the counter.  

The sandwiches were AWESOME!  We are not big meat eaters, but make an exception for quality like this.  We got both sandwiches on whole wheat, which at first seemed a big dense and chewy, but over the course of the sammies grew on me as it held up to the yumminess (and liquid).

The Alidoro has prosciutto, hot peppers, sweet roasted peppers, mushroom paste, fennel, hot spread, and arugula.  We chose this one because of the promise of spice and sevearl layers of veggies.  It was well-balanced and packed with flavors that just bursted and bursted and bursted in our mouths.  It definitely had some heat to it that was strong and sustained but never unpleasant.  

The Fiorello has mortadella, fresh mozzarella, and eggplant caponata.  We selected the Fiorello because we wanted to see if the mortadella stood up to the comparison of eating it freshly sliced in a deli in Bolongna, and also because we love caponata.  This sandwich was also fantastic, with a deep umami savoriness.  The mortadella did live up to our hopes and dreams.  The sandwich was a good foil to the Alidoro's spice.

We were beyond satisfied, and the meal stuck with us until late in the day.  If I ever ate here again, I would find a way to eat only a half at a time.  Yes, the sandwiches are crazy expensive, but compared to other options, I walked away feeling like the money was worth it.  Thanks Yelp."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-05-08,5.0,"A true gem in barren midtown south. A solid albeit somewhat pricey sandwich spot famous with the midtown lunch crowd. They have authentic italian sandwiches (and also some salads and pastries) with various meat, cheese, bread, veggie, and spread options. There are several combinations that the restaurant suggests but you can also make your own. TIP: Always get your sandwich made hot and add the hot spread! My favorites are the Fellini (hot) and the Sofia (hot + with hot spread). 

Yes the sandwiches will run you ~$15 here but usually the portions are big enough that I can eat half for lunch and save the other half for dinner or an afternoon snack. 

The ordering line moves pretty quickly but the attention to detail on the cook line is real, so the sandwiches take a while to make once you've ordered. Would not come here in a rush or during Friday peak lunch hour unless you want to wait 30+ minutes. Otherwise more than worth it!

The interior is cute, with bar-type seating watching the sandwiches being made - I think you can even order a glass of wine! And there are some tables in the back if you'd like to eat-in, although most people order to go.

Love this place!"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2016-05-11,4.0,"Looking for a super tasty food baby to slug down on your lunch break in midtown?! Look no further that alidoro! This place has choices galore and as much as you think you can't eat the other half of the ginormous sandwich you ordered, you do because it's so damn good. 

I went with the fratelli d'italia, so many flavors going on. So good. Really liked the hot spread and how it mixed with the pesto. My bf got the Gregorio and it really lived up to the claim of ""very spicy"". The mozzarella here is also on point. 

This place had a solid crowd for lunch, but the guys behind the counter were like a well oiled machine- we didn't wait more than 5-7 mins for our order."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-03-20,5.0,"After having a bad experience last week, Alidoro reached out to me and went above and beyond to make up for it. I am extremely happy about how they put an effort to right the wrong."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2017-04-18,5.0,"So after a 2-star review that I wrote earlier, I was contacted by Alidoro and was asked for a chance to re-try the restaurant and food.  The people I was in touch with cared very much about the quality of the food and that I was dissatisfied with the sandwich, and I honestly was blown away by their effort to make it better. 

I went down this afternoon and indeed it was much better!  Honestly, the customer service was the nicest and most attentive I had seen in a restaurant in a long long time.  I got a hot ""Mona Lisa"" sandwich and got an ""Alyssa"" for my friend.  

The Mona Lisa was ok, the bread was fantastic and fresh, and the ingredients themselves were delicious.  But there was just so few of them that it is hard to rate this sandwich 5 out of 5.  More like 5 on taste, 3 on the amount of ingredients. 

The Alyssa, however, was a totally different story.  Fresh and delicious, ample amounts of chicken and flavor and the focaccia is the best we have ever had.  5 out of 5 for the Alyssa!

Again, if not for the customer service and their true show of caring for the customer, if this review was solely based on the food, I would give a 4 star, however, since Alidoro truly went above and beyond, I gave 5 stars.  And I'll definitely be heading back!"
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2018-06-22,4.0,"Second time coming here, both times I really enjoyed my sandwich. Last time I got the Gregorio(which i didn't see on the menu this time) and the Enzo this time. Everything is super fresh, a bit pricey(mine was about $14 and my girlfriends was $19) but the sandwiches are pretty huge. Both times I got the spicy sandwich and they had a little kick. The place has limited seating but I've never had trouble finding a seat because everyone seems to get takeout, probably because the spot is only open on weekdays during lunch time so everyone is grabbing it and going back to work. My girlfriend got La bomba, which didn't have a lot of taste when I had some of it."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-09-17,5.0,PLEASE put Alidoro back on Seamless. There are a ton of companies in the area who have corporate seamless accounts and would LOVE to have you for lunch again.
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2016-01-23,4.0,"Take note: these are no ordinary sandwiches. 

These are gourmet Italian sandwiches made with the freshest and tastiest ingredients. There are a lot of choices, each one more tempting than the last, so take a minute to peruse the menu before ordering. On my first visit, I ordered the Brando, which is served hot and comes with smoked chicken breast, provolone cheese, sweet roasted peppers and arugula. It was delish. How delish? I intended to eat half of it and save the other half for dinner, but the first half was so good, the second half just had to follow.

I don't think these are expensive at $12-$13 a pop because you get a sandwich the size of a whole baguette. At other places, you'd pay that much for a sandwich half the size, here you get a foot-long sandwich made with quality ingredients. They use the best meats and cheeses like prosciutto and fresh mozzarella. Interior is quaint with communal tables. Service is friendly. Great Midtown lunch spot."
661,alidoro-new-york-2,2019-09-21,2.0,"I work in the neighborhood and finally tried Alidoro. I ordered the Alyssa and I'd say 90% of the sandwich was the bread. There was 2 thin slices of chicken and a barely there slice of mozzarella. I was really disappointed especially for a $14 sandwich (with tax). Cappones in Chelsea Market has a similar sandwich but it is so loaded with chicken and mozz that you can barely bite into it... And usually save the other half for dinner! For the price, don't get cheap with the serving size."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2020-01-25,5.0,Best coffee in NYC. Hands down. And always really  friendly staff! My morning isn't truly complete without it.
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2020-03-14,2.0,"PURCHASED: 1 tiny (8 oz) cup of coffee
TOTAL: $2.80

PROS: 
- Nice workers: The barristers are nice. 

CONS:
- Dear god... the coffee beans here taste like crap. I have to drink this because it's the closest spot to where I work and don't have enough time to run to a Starbucks. If you like the beans at Starbucks, you will think the coffee here is like.... crap mixed with water. It is just not good. 

IMPRESSION:
It's a tiny little coffee shop (4-seating table and 2-3 bar stools facing the street) located in Murray Hill off 3rd Avenue. It sells you a small cup (8 oz) filled with shitty-tasting coffee for $2.80. And, you have to tip on top?... F*@$. Starbucks is 3 blocks away. The price for a tall (12 oz) is $2.45. You get a normal size cup filled with delicious-tasting coffee. Nice workers though. 

I would give this place a 1-star rating had it not been for the fact that they are right down stairs. I only drink coffee for the caffeine. I think I am slowly becoming a coffee snob."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2020-02-18,4.0,"My local neighborhood coffee shop! I come here multiple times a week to pick up a brewed coffee, and I'm never disappointed. It's always piping hot and ready in seconds. Even when there's a line it moves relatively quickly and you can get your drink without a big wait. There's never a huge crowd, which is good because seating is a bit limited to one large table in the center and some window stools. The baristas are all very friendly and happy to help you figure out what you want, or just shoot the breeze if they're not helping anyone. I stick to regular milk but they also have oat milk which is a great non-dairy option. They also have a small selection of baked goods that I enjoy, particularly the mini scones which are the perfect size for me.

One thing to note - they don't have WiFi on purpose to encourage real-life conversation!"
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-09-06,4.0,I came here on a Thursday afternoon since I work nearby.  I pass by this place all the time but never went in.  My old coworker enjoys their chai lattes with oat milk so I decided to check it out with her.  I ordered a regular latte with skim milk.  It was pretty strong and hot.  They actually had seating which I was surprised about.  I took it back to work but I could hang out there if I had time to kill.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  I would come back and try their other drinks.  I could always go for a cortado from time to time.
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-10-02,1.0,"I asked two cold brew coffee and had use coupon today. And I got two of them. Looks different. 
Am I wrong? or It was same? 

If I use coupon and they gave me just ice coffee, I will not heading anymore. 
If these two are same cold brew, please let me know. 

I will remove this review."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-09-22,5.0,"The best oat milk latte in town! And I've tried a LOT of them.

My sister got me into oat milk this summer when I was in LA sending her off to college. I used to be the kind of person who shied away from food trends like kombucha, poke, and brunch as a concept, so oat milk lattes were nowhere on my to-try list. But I stand corrected - oat milk lattes are even better than their regular milk counterparts.

Birch's oat milk latte is especially creamy tasting - you wouldn't even believe you're drinking something vegan. The actual flavor of the oat milk really comes through too - the ones I've tried at other coffee places have been too watery and don't have as much flavor.

I'm thankful that I live near this location so I can stop by on the regular. I only have two small gripes: their largest size is the size of a small/medium anywhere else, and they don't open until 7am on weekdays, which I think is surprisingly late for a coffee place. I usually leave for work at 6:45, so I can't make it a morning habit. That might be for the best though...

PS: they have a punch card so every 10th drink is free!"
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-08-07,5.0,"Cute lil coffee shop i stumbled upon while waiting for brunch. The menu was small with the basic coffee items. I decided to go with an iced latte since it was hella hot with oat milk. I've become a huge fan of oat milk recently & love having it in my coffee! It gives it such a rich and wholesome flavor which makes me a happy camper. Definitely better than almond milk! Birch coffee is extremely proud to source each and every one of their beans from all across the world, making sure to capture the best flavors from the best seasons and freshest earth"
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-06-09,4.0,"Great grab and go coffee location complete with pastries and all the espresso drinks. They have one communal table and one counter to enjoy drinks in store. 

This one shop though has no outlets for the counter nor tables, so not the best place to post up and work if you need power. However, the drip coffee was very tasty--3.25 for a medium, which isn't too terrible for NYC. 

I'll probably be back whenever I need to grab my coffee to go!"
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-01-01,5.0,"I needed a really good cup of joe the day after NYE and this place was amazing. Really cute inside shop and the staff was very nice and very attractive as well (which is always a plus)! 

I loved the vibe I got from this shop and the napkins are SO CUTE. It says birch loves you and on the back is a place for inspiration note taking. I'm in the marketing industry so reallly appreciate when companies go out of their way to do little things like that. Obviously custom napkins are an added cost and likely most customers don't go there because of this but damn it is a nice touch. 

The coffee was also really delicious. Very solid cold brew! Had a nice clean finish and you could tell it was of good quality. I would definitely go back when I'm in the area!"
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2020-01-12,5.0,"Stopped in on this sunny morning for a mocha and chai latte. The mocha was delicious, a bit too sweet for my liking, but still pretty darn good. The vanilla chai, which I tried but wasn't for me was also pretty solid. It had a good chai kick. Probably would go back when I feel the need to spoil myself."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-12-14,1.0,"Paid $5.50 for a cup of milk. Could not taste the espresso in my iced latte whatsoever. When I went back to complain and asked for another shot to be put in, the barista said it's another $1 something. Guy working the register wasn't particularly friendly either. Won't be back."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-11-12,5.0,"Stop in to Birch every morning, and the cold brew is excellent. Everyone working is always so friendly even for it being so early in the morning. I also love that they sell oat milk right at the front!"
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2018-08-16,3.0,"I came here when I had to kill about an hour in the area. The sign outside said they had cold coffee drinks and it was cold inside, so I said why not?

I ordered the cold brew -- don't judge me! It tasted pretty great even black, which always says good things about the coffee.

The shop was pretty tiny with one communal table and a few seats by the window, so there isn't much room. The staff was pleasant enough: not overly friendly but decent.

My biggest complaint is the lack of Wifi. I was pretty sure that's a staple at coffee shops!"
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-09-23,4.0,"This place is so cute and the baristas are very friendly, but I'm not sure why it's labeled ""good for working,"" since they are ""WiFi free!"" I had a tasty croissant and enjoyed sitting in the cafe for a while, but sadly I had to leave since I had come hoping to get some work done, but I couldn't because they don't have WiFi. Yelp, wyd?? 

But aside from not actually being able to work here, I did like the cafe! The ambiance was pleasant and the baristas were so nice and seemed to know a lot of the customers personally. I'll probably be back, just not with the hopes of getting any work done."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-04-06,5.0,"This is one of my go-to locations for coffee other than the traditional starbucks/gregory's coffee chains. The space itself is quite small and there's not a lot of seating area so I usually take it to go. The baristas and receptions are always super nice and if you buy 9 coffees here, you get the 10th for free!

I often get the drip coffee or latte depending on my mood. Both are pretty good and they definitely don't burn their beans; sometimes at places like Starbucks they burn their beans and it ruins the quality/taste of the coffee. A bonus is that they have honey to put in your coffee if you want to make it a little sweet. One thing I've been wanting to try their oat milk (I've heard good things about it).

The price isn't too bad either. Probably similar to most shops, and I'd say it's worth the money. So if you're ever in the area, stop by! You won't regret it."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-06-17,5.0,Best Mocha ever! I highly recommend anyone to try Mocha. Also tried hot cocoa and enjoyed the smooth and gentle sweetness.

There's a book selection here with some seating. Non-dairy milks are hemp, soy, and oat? I think. Good music playlist too."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2018-10-07,5.0,Just walking by after brunch at bubo which was awesome. It is a cute nice fancy  place on 3rd avenue. They have some new coffee or different kinds of coffee. I ordered Ethiopia which took 10mins to make cuz he was making it fresh and my boyfriend got Birch blend which was amazing. The prices are of course little expensive. They have sitting place tho it is small it's entangled not crowded. If you like cream in your coffee you need to ask them as they don't have it separate.
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2020-02-24,2.0,Worst coffee ever. Tasted burnt and bitter. When all u make is coffee it should be awesome. Not here. Period. End of story.
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2018-11-16,5.0,The coffee is always great and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. I love their chai lattes because you can tell it's made from real chai tea not a sugary powder mix. They also offer a punch card so you can earn a free drink.
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-08-27,4.0,Enjoyed a cold brew and a coffee cake here.
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2018-02-03,5.0,"This place is on the way to work and so far I've been here three times.

Coffee: They say you can tell how good a coffee is by how it tastes without sugar. Well their lattes are soo good; not bitter with the right amount of strength. I love that they have hemp milk as an option.

Their staff is super nice.

I wish they had a greater danishes selection but other than that, this will be my go to place."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2018-05-12,5.0,"I don't drink coffee. I often get made fun of for drinking caramel milk with a splash of espresso. Eh, it's delicious, give it a try. But we were on our way to church and needed a pick me up, so we tried out birch. Of course, not realising the simplicity of the menu and I ask for an iced caramel macchiato. Oh, you don't have that. Ok. I'll take an iced vanilla latte. Oh, don't have that either. Ok. (How many people are staring at me and thinking ""oh lord she's dumb""). Fine, I'll get the iced chai. And it was the best decision ever. Flavourful, not overly spiced, and perfectly sweet (but not too sweet). They also have pastries that looked delicious. And iced coffee that S liked. Would/will come back."

I walked by this place and decided to stop in. It was reasonably priced- one of the cheapest I saw. The service was nice, actually started a conversation. They had fun trivia at the front. And I even signed up for their newsletter. I'll be coming by for another latte soon!"
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-06-02,4.0,"I recently walked into Birch coffee, grabbed an iced latte and have been hooked.  Actually cheating on my normal go to coffee spot, that says a lot.  Good reliable coffee.  My only gripe is the plastic lid for the cold beverage.  What is wrong with a flat lid? The one they provide is irksome.  I can never get it to fit tightly leading to coffee spilling out and onto whatever I am wearing."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2018-07-24,3.0,Cute coffee shop! Decent coffee for fair prices. Would come back here again!  They don't have free WiFi.

I can imagine on a rainy day or in the winter it would be crowded. They offer non-dairy milk options: soy and hemp, this is the first coffee shop that I have been to that offered hemp milk, if they offer non-dairy milk there's always soy, sometimes almond and even coconut milk, but I have never seen hemp as an option, which is great if you're trying to avoid soy and have a nut allergy."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2019-02-06,5.0,"The cafe is cozy (seating is limited) but don't let that deter you from delicious espresso! They make consistently great drinks and are always friendly. Their menu offers macchiatos, cappuccinos, lattes flat whites, etc but if you arent a coffee fan, they pretty much only have chai and iced tea. Also, they offer hemp, oat, and soy- sorry to my almond milk lovers! Their banana bread was gluten free and delicious, but their cheddar scone was a bit too dry for my liking. Can't wait to try their other goods :)"

662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2018-04-06,4.0,"Birch coffee is good and all. They offer two roasts, their Birch blend and a darker Nicaraguan blend (Could be making that up but I know they offer a second blend and depending on who is behind the counter they'll either tell you it's either lighter than the Birch blend or darker) Regardless, I've tried their Birch blend several times and it's definitely tasty. Complaint here is that they don't have any almond milk, they've got everything else though, including oat milk, which I had never tried before until coming in here. It's unsweetened, which is appreciated but if you're going to have every non-dairy creamer, almond milk should be on the list, in my opinion of course. The shop is tiny, minimal room to sit if there are other people in there, but when you catch a time where there is room, it's a quaint little place to sit and get some work done. Personally for me, it wouldn't be my place of choice because of the size. Two spots in the window and one other table. It's crammed but again, cute. Staff has been friendly each time I've come in. Coffee is pricey, which can be expected in a specialty coffee shop such as Birch. You won't be disappointed if you come here."
662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2017-03-02,4.0,"Birch has been consistently providing high quality espressos since my first try about two years ago; yet what I liked more about it was how it associates mood with the drinks. Birch supplies many ice-breaker cards, that one could choose to answer questions or talk with people around. At the counter, they would come up with ""question-of-the-day"" as well, that one could expect answer to be revealed on the following day. 

This location is particularly small, however the vibe carries over. A great spot in Kips Bay."

662,birch-coffee-new-york-9,2016-10-04,3.0,"Oh Birch, I don't know what to make of you. You are hip and got some nice woody decor going on. 

The cold brew here is good but the amount of ice they fill to the brim of cups is ridiculous. How much actual coffee am I getting? After a few tries, I have decided to stick to their tasty cappuccinos. 

They carry Dough donuts. Maybe Dough has changed but these aren't the ones I remember ""back in the days""... the 4 times that I have gotten the donuts all happened to be dense and heavy. Not worth the artisanal pricing it carries. Skip.

The staff. The baristas are all nice. The cashiers are mixed. Most males are super friendly but the lady seems to be doing me a huge favor when she rings me up. When I go to Birch, I just hope in the back of my mind that she is not at the register."

I wanted to point out that their sleeves don't really work. They were too thin that I burned my hands just by holding   2 coffees. Probably double the sleeve when you get hot drinks. 

Everything I got was $25 in total. This is also a strawless cafe. GO GREEN!"
663,café-m-new-york-2,2019-08-30,5.0,"Was walking by this place on the way to Pennsylvania station and saw one of my favorite drinks ""Affogato"" written on the sidewalk chalk stand. For those of you who don't know. An affogato (Italian for ""drowned"") is an Italian coffee-based dessert. It usually takes the form of a scoop of vanilla gelato or ice cream topped or ""drowned"" with a shot of hot espresso. They use good quality coffee and Haggen Daz ice cream. Quality on top of quality. I let that coffee blend together with that coffee and BAMMMM; a flavor explosion from the smooth/sweet goodness. The staff was nice too. They have all kinds of goodness in there!"
663,café-m-new-york-2,2019-08-19,4.0,"I believe I should give this three stars due to the girl at the register/ordering area. She really could give less sht about being there or you. I really hate that. They really need to upgrade on the smiles and enthusiasm. But the food seems to be amazing. At least what I got. It was two little sandwiches. One, pizza kind of sandwich. Dough tasted like there was either cheese inside and or that it was made out of cauliflower, which is popular now. And on the bed of tomato sauce goat cheese (I think?)spread out and topped with broccoli. And the second sandwich was smoked salmon/lox sandwich. Absolutely outstanding. High grade lox sliced thinly, on the bed of what I think is either also goat cheese or some other delicious spreadable soft cheese, and topped with radishes and the like. Top notch.
The prices seem to be a tad bit on the high side, and obviously not affordable to go there every day for lunch. But doable for like once a week or every other week. Also, the fact that their food and drinks are healthy, artfully presented and are above all, tasty, those are all definite reasons to come back. I am looking forward to trying other healthy light/finger food and the drinks they have on their menu.
But please, get more enthusiastic staff. Otherwise you will lose business."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2019-09-25,3.0,"I love this cafe, particularly the dirty chai. But I noticed recently that I get charged different prices for the same product. Today I was charged $7 for a SMALL dirty chai. I usually pay $6 for a LARGE dirty chai here. The cashier had incorrectly rung me up for a chai latte (4) + a separate espresso drink (3). 

I questioned them to confirm that was the price.... I probably will stop coming here due to the lack of price transparency."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2018-11-21,4.0,Nice sized almond latte which sufficiently woke me up.  The croissant however was very average although it looked pretty.
663,café-m-new-york-2,2018-06-06,5.0,"Cute shop, unique items. i came in to grab some macaroons, normally expensive. i Grabbed a box of 6 for $18 and another box of 12 for $48. prices don't make sense but whatever the box is really nice. 

staff was super sweet!"
663,café-m-new-york-2,2018-08-21,4.0,"I came here yesterday to pick up a quick cup of coffee since I was in the neighborhood. This place is really cute and intimate but beware this is not a place to sit and eat your food. It is more a grab your coffee and go back to your office kind of place. They do have one bench but, you cannot get comfortable with people standing in line right over you. 

I really wanted to order the Iced Salted Caramel Latte but I was told they had just sold out it. Darn that customer in front of me I hope they are happy! I then ordered an Iced Mocha latte and it was a chocolate lovers dream. It was just not my dream. I prefer my mocha lattes with a hint of chocolate. This was more like a chocolate drink with a hint of coffee. Either they put in way too much mocha syrup or the coffee is really light in flavor and caffeine. 

I would try this place again and I hope to try the latte that I really wanted on my next visit. The pastries look awesome by the way."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2017-12-19,5.0,Wonderfully delicious multi-grain croissants piping hot from the oven.  What a delight.  Also the mini quiches were scrumptious and seasoned to perfection.  Their cappuccino was excellent as well.  We shall return.
663,café-m-new-york-2,2017-11-15,3.0,So I been here on a couple occasions . Before I use to get the bread pudding I think it was blueberry bread pudding so good ! But they don't have it anymore I don't think . This morning I got this potato and onion popover kind of thing with a pumpkin spice scone . The onion potato thing was good just needed a little more seasoning . I was disappointed  in the scone though . It didn't taste anything like pumpkin and it was dry . So I didn't even bother to fully eat it . It's a nice place though . The decor is nice which I really appreciated . I think I would rather eat their desserts and cookies than savory things.
663,café-m-new-york-2,2017-04-22,3.0,"Tiny cafe.
Totally adorable.
Stunning baked goods.
So-so green tea latte.

It's all about the macarons & the cupcakes here.  Duly noted for the next time I'm in the neighborhood & I need macarons or cupcakes.  But my green tea latte was subpar, the service was dry, & there's only 2 seats inside.  

It's obviously not meant for lounging, & the cashier pretty much made that clear w her less than stellar attitude.  

Gorgeous cupcakes, though.  And a very feminine & sweet space.

3 stars."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2019-04-19,5.0,Very beautiful cafe and the bread pudding is to die for. The fruit cups are fresh and the coffee is made with love !
663,café-m-new-york-2,2016-03-19,4.0,"After walking in, you expect this place to be better than what it is. The enormous array of small dainty pastries, coloful lined macarons, individually wrapped little cookies, the wood furniture, the charm and allure of a small homey Italian cafe with ""La Colombe"" posted everywhere, a chic name like ""Cafe M Studio"" and of course, the lovely line of ladies who take your order. The manager in the morning is also a very friendly man, always smiling and greets all his customers with warm hospitality. 

If you need a place to have morning treats w/ your coffee, then this place is 4star caliber, but strictly coffee speaking, I don't believe some of the baristas are trained properly when artfully crafting the drinks. My first cappuccino was unmemorable, and the latte I had a while back was okay. My recent macchiato a few days ago was actually pretty good and very sharp but it was served with milk foam instead of being stained with steamed milk. Also, they have a Coffee of the Day, which can be good sometimes depending on your origin & roast level preferences.

This place is more of a petite bakery than a coffeshop.

Recommended: Macchiato, Drip"
663,café-m-new-york-2,2015-11-10,3.0,"Location: Cafe M is but at the main spot of Korean town, that is to say, you have to walk a little bit further on 33h street and you will see a small sign, waving to you - welcome to Cafe M. When I first stepped into the store, I was happy because although the store is small, the decoration is well-designed. Left side is for sweet treat and right side is for savory treat. Not a little table in the cafe but you do have a spot to sit comfortably.

Macaron: they are famous for their macaron? I do not. I saw they have small cream puffs(2.95/one), small cakes(8/one) and macarons (2.65/one)
I had strawberry, green tea, caramel and vanilla. Average. I am not a fan of macaron after all but this place does not change my opinion toward macaron. I guess, they are just average to me. 

Service: I did take out. No specific service related with my own experience but I was greeted warmly by their staff when I first came to the store. So, I would predict that it is a good service experience?

Overall: 3.5. Little bit pricy oh no. NYC is crazy."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2019-07-10,1.0,"I've been a loyal customer for almost 3 years. This place has gone considerably downhill after they renovated. The prices have skyrocketed while the quantities have gotten significantly smaller. A large iced coffee is not really a large, more like a small. The attitudes of the new baristas are also not welcoming at all. I was watched intently while pouring oat milk into my coffee one morning to make sure I don't pour too much. Save your money and don't patronize this business. Instead, pay a visit to Besfren right next door or to King's Street Coffee just a couple of blocks away. Your business is much more appreciated elsewhere, trust me."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2018-01-28,4.0,"Solid cafe and pastries looked great. We sat on one of the two benches, no other seating. Immaculate lovely decor. A bit hidden but surprised there weren't more people. A great place to grab and go or hang out for a few min if there's seating on the benches."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2017-07-10,1.0,"This is a cute coffee shop close to our office where I usually go to. However this will the the last time I put foot into this cafe as the lady at the coffee counter was extremely rude and obnoxious while taking my order this morning.

Already when I asked for my iced coffee (and I made a mistake I meant iced cappuccino) she was rough not a smile not an anything just turned around the machine for me to pay and said ""pay here"".
Just for that I didn't add any tip but it gets worse.
They give me the iced coffee and I realized that I had made a mistake, I asked if I could have an iced cappuccino which they know as a regular customer I usually order ( mistakes happen at 7 am!).

Very short toned and aggressively she says it's my fault and I had to pay again. It's not the problem of me paying again it was the ways she treated me from the start of my order to then end raising her eyes to the ceiling , being rude to me . I didn't like how I was treated and will not come back.

My advise to management is: you have a great concept and you should choose your staff very wisely because they are the face of your business. Don't have loyal customers go elsewhere."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2017-11-15,4.0,"This place has an amazing chocolate chip walnut cookie!! Get the fresh one, not the prepackaged. It's HUGE but chewy on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. I would prefer if it was even crunchier on the outside like Levain, but this one is pretty darn good. Wayyyyyy better than the one next door at Besfren. A pleasant surprise!

The cashier seemed super new like he didn't know what he was doing, but he was able to ring me up and was polite. All gotta start somewhere."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2014-06-23,3.0,"During lunch on a beautiful day I wandered around my work area to see if there were places to try out and long and behold I came upon Cafe M. I saw the beautiful display of macaroons but I wasn't hungry for a dessert. There were some selections of breads and other snacks but the Mocha Latte caught my attention since I was thirsty from the weather. I ordered a Iced Mocha Latte and it came up to about $5.39? It was a regular sized plastic cup. Too bad I forgot to snap a quick picture of it! It wasn't as sweet as I thought it should be and I didn't want to add any sugar since I hate crunching on it. I left it as is but only finished half. I guess I wasn't a fan. It had a strong mocha powder flavor. 

Next time I'll try the snacks and macaroons if I'm in the mood. The place was really cute and the cashier older lady was very nice."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2018-05-23,3.0,"I like this place and it is a few doors down from my office, but gave it a lower review than I normally would have due to what happened to their blueberry muffin's size.  The price is still $3.00 with tax (if that did not increase), but the size of the muffin shrank at least 40%.....WTF!

I would have rather they did small price increase and kept the size of the muffin the same.  I honestly probably would not have noticed,  However because they did the reverse, it seems even more of a slap in the face.  It is really a shame because these muffins are so fresh and bursting with fruity goodness.  

In all fairness the new size is probably the correct serving size when you decide you will eat something that amounts to cake for breakfast, but it is still a great let down. 

I'm addicted to these little things and will now have to quit them cold turkey.  It will be hard. :-("
663,café-m-new-york-2,2018-03-15,3.0,Delicious matcha lattes but very overpriced. Also great midtown location cute spot and very fast service. Good for once every so often when you want to treat yourself to nice coffee.
663,café-m-new-york-2,2017-06-14,4.0,"Around this area you have a couple main types of options: chains (Gregory's, Starbucks) west of Broadway, the K-Town offerings between Broadway and 5th, and then Cafe M. 

My co-workers and I frequently end up choosing Cafe M above all these due to the fact that it is enjoyable (but tiny) to be in, has really friendly staff, *good* coffee, and a delicious assortment of fresh baked goods and snacks. I won't say it is the most amazing coffee experience ever, but it sort of does everything really well and all of that adds up when you are choosing a daily coffee stop.

One of the downsides is they have a $5 minimum for cards, which can be difficult for those (like myself) that are often strapped for cash, but otherwise the fast service with good drinks makes it a worthwhile stop."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2018-05-14,4.0,Great stop for an almond croissant and cup of coffee. The other pastries looked delicious.
663,café-m-new-york-2,2018-04-10,5.0,Love love love Cafe M! The baked goods and pastries are the best around. They also have excellent coffee (La Colombe) and a wide selection of teas. Love Cafe M!
663,café-m-new-york-2,2015-11-25,4.0,"My mistake, the cookie sandwich was the proper price, though they might have added tax to both.

Also, the pate sandwich is delicious and worth the 8.95"
663,café-m-new-york-2,2016-01-12,4.0,"Was in need of some sweets and decided to stop by this place after discovering it on Yelp. They had a decent selection of Macaroons to choose from, included pre-packaged variety packs. The pricing is high, as is common for specialty desserts of this nature. I believe there was some seating at this location too, for up to 6 people max. I would stop by again for their cookie deal because it was very enticing! Staff was very kind which was an added plus."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2015-01-29,4.0,"I love Cafe M for 2 important reasons : it's a very cute little coffee shop, very well decorated, so peaceful. I seat on a bunch and relax whil waiting for my order.
The second reason is their homemade ginger tea. It is sooooo good! I cna't help stopping by and ordering one.

Those little things that make my day in NYC"
663,café-m-new-york-2,2015-09-28,2.0,"I walk by this neighborhood all the time and this place never really caught my eye. It wasn't until a friend and I wanted a small dessert that we discovered this place. 

The first thing that greets you once you step foot inside is the wonderful aromas of whatever is brewing. I didn't get a drink this time but may consider it the next time I'm here. 

We came for a light dessert and settled with the macarons. Their pastry selection was a little on the steep end, but is about right for the neighborhood it's in. The chocolate espresso macaron was great- not too heavy on either flavor and was my favorite. The strawberry one was too sweet, especially with the filling. I probably won't be back for macarons but the rest of what they had to offer looked decent. 

I'm not dying to come back here but wouldn't mind giving this place another try."

663,café-m-new-york-2,2015-06-13,5.0,"Stopped by on the way out of the Empire State Building just wanting some coffee but got an excellent and rich latte and the best macarons I've ever had. My favorite flavor was the pistachio and chocolate with the champagne being a strong runner up.

The interior was cutesy without being overbearing, and the staff answered all questions without acting as if they were a bother."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2012-06-23,3.0,"Macarons (not Macaroons according to Bakery Cafe M's version or spelling) at $1.95 each emitting one in strawberry and one in chocolate totaling and utter $4.25 with NYC sales tax.  My order was received into deaf ears for the server/sales associate exhibits very little English oral skills.  ""We have Lychee, Green Tea, Raspberry."" What about Strawberry?  ""We have Green Tea, GREEN TEA!!""  I want Strawberry meringue French cookie.  Back on point, how many times do I need to request for Strawberry??  Do you have a business card? Can I have a receipt for this order?  ""What, what? Yes, yeah!!"" Ajia, why produce a hard time for such simple requests?

Nevertheless, a cute bakery with two benches for indoor seating in a rustic and shabby-chic Parisian bakery.  Space is cramped with merchandise and the counter for amenities hogs the whole floor space.  Their business card also serves as a loyality card for the tenth stamp enables a free drink.  All in all, the macarons deliver a sweet resonance for texture and flavor.  Bakery Cafe M is known for their macarons which enticed me for this visit, but surely not worth a return visit."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2017-09-06,4.0,"This place has definitely became one of my go to coffee spots when I want to treat myself to some quality coffee. It is a small cute coffee shop with some fancy pastries and quick bites. I mainly come here for their espresso. It is velvety, rich and smells amazing. You can tell they use quality fresh beans. It isn't really a place for you to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee but definitely a good grab and go."
663,café-m-new-york-2,2016-05-08,2.0,"I can't believe the hype people put into this place, make it fancy and colorful and sell for a high price. I heard many people say this was a great place and I had to try it myself.

I was extremely disappointed with it, it is just cake... That's what all the cakes taste like, just cake, I thought I would feel younger and it would cure my sicknesses, but it is just cake. Of course, there is more direct why of explaining it, but I rather just say cake.

I didn't like the overall taste, I ate the chocolate and green tea cakes, and it wasn't worth how much it cost. I would only come here if someone wanted to go, but other then that, I would never come back for ""cake""... It is just one of those places that built such a name that everyone goes to it."

The food, coffee/tea, and pastries are all pretty good. The fault is with the staff. I ordered a green tea latte then received a latte. The older counter lady started telling me no I didn't and I had to tell her twice that I did order a green tea latte. Her attitude was very combative.

I just don't want to deal with this attitude again. Hopefully the employees' attitude will improve as well as their English."

An adorable little shop, definitely a calming place to brave the storm (literally, the rain was bad today guys) but they have little to no seating so be warned that you won't be here for long. Rows of cookies, sandwiches, and pastries fill up this little shop and it's very inviting!

The sandwiches are delcious--the grilled chicken with gouda was particularly good. The bread is soft and fresh. A great place to grab a bite!"

The staff was extremely helpful with catering to my needs. He helped me pick out a good combination of macaroons, some good for adults' palates and some kid-friendly flavors. I tried the green tea and hazelnut macaroons. They're really good! Not too sweet, not bland. The macaroons are have quite generous amounts of filling. The cafe itself is very cute. Not the best place to sit in to lounge with a cup of coffee. It's a better place for take-out. Excited to come back to try their other pastries."

After intense internal dialogue, my moral compass won the fight and here I am writing a five star review. 

Both of the male baristas working were so nice and walked me through all of their pastry items as I was eyeing them from the moment I walked in. I got their famous chocolate chip cookie and a pumpkin muffin ($3.50 each). I immediately tried the cookie and fell so in love. 

Their cookie is the exact definition of crispy on the outside, perfectly soft on the inside. If you have a sweet tooth or are just randomly craving something sweet, you need to come here and get a cookie! So happy to see that this biz is thriving with multiple locations around the city"

Encouraged by the many positive chocolate chip cookie reviews, I stopped by Culture 36 for a few minutes to cool down before a long bus ride a little while ago (they're across the street from the BoltBus stop.) I was not expecting just how much I'd enjoy this cookie--it was exactly the cookie I try to attain when I bake.

First of all, they snuck in an extra cookie, which completely made my day :) But even if I had only gotten one, I would definitely say it's worth the $3.50! These large cookies are wonderfully thick and chewy (and not at all oily, as soft café/bakery cookies sometimes are). The outside has the perfect crispy-chewy texture, and the cookie has the wonderful balance of sugar and butter. Perhaps most importantly, they're made with dark chocolate only! :')

Thank you for showing me that my archetypal chocolate chip cookie exists; I can't wait to come back!"

The inside is small and dark with hipster vibes and there wasn't too much on the menu except coffee. But as I'm lactose intolerant, I was skimming through to find non-dairy options. They offer almond and oat milk (no soy milk), so I decided to try out the Chai tea latte with oat milk (my first time)!

It was surprisingly not bad, so me and my bf were able to finish it together before going to church! Overall, if you want a quiet, hipster moment with dark selfies, y'all should check this place out! ;)"

The real reason is that the most underrated chocolate chip cookie exists in this coffee shop. It's the perfect standard textbook chocolate chip cookie. It's the chocolate chip cookie you failed to bake at home when you were a kid, the one you saw on kids shows/movies, and the one that pops in your head when I say 'chocolate chip cookie'.

If you want a really good, simple chocolate chip cookie, get this one. It's not mindboggling or one of the 'best' cookies in NYC, but we're human. Believe it or not, some days we're just not feeling an over-the-top Levain cookie rock. I call this ""The Real People's Chocolate Chip Cookie""."

The combo will cost you a whopping ten bucks but for a quick afternoon pick-me-up that will add stars and unicorns to your day, you can always spend more a drugs. Jussayin."

664,culture-36-new-york-2,2020-02-13,5.0,Great coffee spot in NYC! It's modern and the coffee is delicious! I'd go there again in a heartbeat!
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2019-10-16,5.0,"Culture has my whole heart!  

It's my go-to afternoon coffee spot since it's close to my office.  There's also the added bonus that they have THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE IN NYC.  They're always freshly baked, warm, and gooey, with a melted chocolate center - to die for!

All of the staff here is super nice.  It's a chill spot to hang and kill some time if needed!"
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2019-11-23,5.0,"I found this gem when I was recently visiting NYC and just wanted some good local coffee. The barista was friendly and helpful and had suggested that I try a latte with oat milk, which was rich and satisfying! I also ended up trying their pumpkin muffin which was a great accompaniment to the coffee. It wasn't too sweet since many muffins tend to be loaded with sugar. It was so good that I ordered another one to go along with a chocolate chip cookie, which she said they are renown for. 

I definitely hope to return to this place the next time I visit the city!"
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2018-12-22,4.0,"Coffee is real good.

Seating isn't very comfortable for being here for many hours.

Cookies are house made and thus delicious-o.

I would come back for a quickie but not to stay long! 

Prices are average, enjoy"
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2019-07-19,5.0,"A breath of fresh air in a very busy area. I stopped by due to the high reviews/recommendations and because Culture was close to where we were having breakfast (Liberty Bagels - also highly recommend!). Summer in New York is absolutely crazy and almost unbearably hot. When I walked in, I was met with the perfect temperature and the most welcoming of smells. The lady who took my order was incredibly friendly and sweet. 

I ordered a medium iced latte with oat milk and waited at one of the comfortable seats that were scattered around. I've been trying to find that perfect no-sugar coffee drink - you know, the one that tastes perfect and amazing even without sugar. It has to exist, right? Well, Culture definitely proved it does. My gosh, the espresso was /perfect/ and so smooth I can't even explain how delicious this latte was. It almost tasted sweet, balanced, a perfect kick of caffeine, and creamy. Love at first sip right here. Oh and they have non-plastic (paper) straws. Not the bad kind that disintegrates almost immediately, the straw lasted the entire drink and was very sturdy.

There were quite a few seats, though not as many as I'm used to back home in SoCal so I can't really tell you if it was too much or too little. What I can say is that there were tables as well as bar seating available, and seats were very comfortable. The bar seats overlook the street so it was the perfect place to just watch the city do its thing.

I had a long day of visiting different locations ahead of me but I really wanted to stay and just relax and get some work done. I was actually very productive. Because of the overall vibe and obviously the amazing coffee, I was able to finally sit down and /think/ which allowed me to purchase my train ticket that I needed in order to get to Newark airport for my flight the next day. The wifi was fast and I was able to get my ticket very easily. I had been trying to do that for the past few days but just couldn't sit down and think (it's so busy! and hot everywhere!) so that was very much appreciated.

Overall, a very welcoming location with lots of seating and absolutely delicious coffee. I will definitely come back when I revisit New York."
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2019-06-12,5.0,"5 stars for their maple latte. That is all.

But to add more to this review, I guess I had ordered a maple latte without thinking about hot or iced...so as the barista was making my drink hot, I stopped him and asked if they could make it iced and the barista poured out the milk he had already prepared and I felt so bad (sorry!). But was so appreciative that they made it iced for me. Thanks to the two gentlemen for my afternoon coffee today!

Will have to come back to try other drinks and pastries!"
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2018-10-11,3.0,"I went here yesterday morning and it was completely empty. I heard about the hype of this place and when I asked the woman at the counter she said this location isn't the main one that gets all the traffic. The popular one was on 38th. 

I was tempted to leave and just go to the 38th location but it was so empty I decided to buy something. I had an iced chai with a shot of maple. I have to be honest I didn't like it at all. The maple was just not good to me at all in the chai. The only flavor shot option she said they had was maple and vanilla. Should have gone classic with the vanilla! 

The 3 is because it was clean, quiet and the woman was so friendly to me! 


Side note: I went around 7:44am and the cookies weren't done yet.  They said another 15-20 until they would be... so I guess go around 8 if you're on the hunt for their infamous chocolate chip cookie!!"
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2018-05-13,5.0,"I normally don't like sweet things, but their cookie might have converted me. It's just slightly crispy on the outside, and fluffy with chocolate on the inside. The cookie is also the size of my palm!

I really liked their coffee and the interior as well, it was quite cozy but still felt spacious. Will definitely be back if I'm in that area."
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2020-02-20,5.0,"I love this place. I randomly discovered it when Yelping the area for a coffee meeting. Now I won't go anywhere else. The coffee great but the service is excellent. In a city where coffee places can be interchangeable, make this your regular spot. I actually look forward to my exchanges with the people behind the counter. No matter who it is, they've always found a way to forge a connection, no matter how brief."
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2019-02-24,3.0,"Noice level in a Sunday afternoon: super loud! 

People screaming, shouting and play pokers. 
Maybe the coffee is really good so they got extra hyper. 

If you need to wake up or break you ears, this cafe is for you"

One bite and you think you have died and gone to heaven 
Fresh out of the oven -only thing missing an icy cold glass of milk 
Down to earth helpful staff 
Place gets an Amen!"
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2018-06-27,4.0,"It's not very hard to miss the store since the interior itself stands out from the juxtaposed stores and you can see the inside through the glass window. Interior itself is quite minimalistic, with limited seating and a short, simple menu as well. The music is pretty loud here so probably not the best place for people to do work if it's distracting or to catch up with someone. Definitely recommend if you're trying to grab and go though. 

Coffee is pretty average. I had an iced americano and there wasn't anything special about it to me, but it was smooth and didn't have that sour taste that a lot of other coffees in the area tend to have. The cookie is definitely the selling point for this cafe though! It goes for $3 a pop and it's definitely worth! They're nice and crispy on the outside, but have the right amount of softness and chewiness inside. The cookie isn't too thick so it's not overwhelming and they're about the size of your palm (maybe a little bigger). This is definitely one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever bought ^_^"
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2018-08-20,5.0,"Nice coffee and cool space. Good for meeting, working, resting. I recommend this place. The coffee is very tasty."
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2018-04-27,4.0,"Delicious espresso drinks !! Love the oat milk latte. So creamy and smooth. Latte with special/ non dairy milk clocked in at $5 (50cents extra). Pretty standard or slightly cheaper than other places who charge more for non dairy milk. The rest of the menu is your typical espresso drink menu. 

Store itself is average size- there are a few seats (maybe 10-12 or so total including the window seats?). Chill hipster vibe and clean design. The cookies look amazing! I think I saw vegan ones before but not this time. They also have a few other sweet pastries to go with your coffee!

Overall a solid choice for coffee in the midtown area. Nice to sit for a bit and chat with a friend or read a book."
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2018-07-12,4.0,"Came here after work on a Thursday to catch up with a friend. Got there at 5:30 and there were only two chocolate chip cookies and three cranberry somethings left on the rack. Got the chocolate chip ($3)-it tasted homemade but I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I would as if it were fresh out of the oven.

This place takes card, service was nice and there r three two seater tables against the wall which r good for chats. The music wasn't too loud, but you did need to raise your voice a little to hear yourself. However, I preferred this volume so that other people cant really hear my conversations lol. Great vibes and good proximity to herald square!"
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2019-08-26,1.0,"The male baristas here have such an attitude. I took about 30 secs to a minute to look at the menu and in that span I was asked what I want 3 times, even after saying give me a second please. Also the coffee wasn't even great for the price. I get that it's a hipster spot in midtown so you shouldn't have much expectations. But it just isn't worth it. Plus there are no outlets anywhere. So don't go in hoping to charge something quickly while you slurp on your $6 drink."
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2018-05-13,5.0,"The cookies here are heavenly and are my favorite guilty pleasure.

I try to stop here at least once a week for a cookie, but i find myself here twice a week sometimes.

Definitely stop by and check them out."
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2019-08-30,5.0,One of my favorite places for coffee in the city! I'm never disappointed and their cookies are TO DIE FOR! There isn't a ton of seating or outlets so keep that in mind if you plan on doing some work at the cafe.
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2016-12-24,4.0,"Cute cafe shop made simple and elegant in a city where the competitors are all trying to be too big, too much, and too extravagant.  They confuse you with a plethora of options where you walk in and forget you where there for a cup of joe.  
My hot chocolate was tasty and soothing.  The last hot chocolate I got from a pop up competitor wasn't made with much effort.  The service here is superb and they are very knowledgeable.  They almost seem vested.  
Everyone should stop by and try something because they will not be disappointed!"
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2017-12-21,5.0,"It's good to be back in NYC enjoying the hustle and bustle in another amazing coffee shop :) This is a branch of the amazing Culture Espresso, and is located along midtown-West side. Pretty close to Penn station if you're looking for a good pick-me-up in the area. This shop is a small space, but decent size for NYC. Depending on the time of day it can be busy or slow. When I arrived there was a small line and seats were filled inside. But after a few minutes of waiting I was able to get seated with a friend. There's a large glass window with booth seating to people watch or have a good convo, and there is a large table space in the center for people to do work. There are a few 2 people seating tables along the side as well for those who want a bit more privacy.

The coffee is AMAZING here. The baristas are fantastic. They make amazing espressos in a quick amount of time in the business of the lines of people. And they get their beans from Heart Coffee Roasters out in Portland, Oregon. For those of you who are still new to the coffee world - let's just sat Heart Coffee is one of the best out west, if not in the states :P I ordered a macchiato and was made to perfection :) 

They are also known for their amazing Chocolate Chip cookies and Oatmeal Cranberry cookies. My friend ordered the chocolate chip cookie, and I had a few bites of it :P It was delicious! It was nice and warm on the outside, and warm and gooey on the inside with a ton of chocolate chips. Macchiato and cookie - my cup of tea. The barista also told me they won the Cookie Competition this past year..apparently it's the new cookie and better than Levain Bakery's cookie now! I have tried both and going to be honest - hard to judge which is the better cookie. All that to say, please do yourself a favor and get a cookie with your espresso drink..you won't regret it. They also have amazing baked goods around the City from places like Ceci Cela, Blue Sky Bakery, Ovenly, Dough Doughnuts, Corner Café, and Magpies.

There are also two more locations in midtown-west area. I haven't checked out the other places, but imagine it's just as amazing. I'm a pretty hardcore Stumptown fan, but this might be my new fav in NYC. Love Culture Espresso and will def be having another cup of coffee and cookie during my next trip to NYC :) Always good to be back in the city that never sleeps ;D"
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2018-03-28,5.0,"Culture 36 is a casual coffee and tea shop with some baked desserts. They carry Dough doughnuts and chocolate chip cookies. The latter is warm and soft in the centre while being crispy on the outside. Definitely a place to stop by to treat yourself with a cookie. Worth it!
They offer milk substitutes for all their drinks, which is great for vegans/lactose-intolerant.
The café is also fairly spacious given its location with a decent amount of seating. I have never had a problem finding a seat and enjoying my tea and chocolate chip cookie."
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2017-12-17,4.0,YAY! I was finally able to visit this place after having it bookmarked a while. I wasn't able to say no to the oatmeal raisin cookie! It was chewy with the right amount of sugar. Staffs were very friendly.
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2017-11-24,4.0,"A relaxed space near the chaos of Herald Square to re-energize. It's a large space but without too much seating (2- two tops, a few seats by the window, and a larger shared table in the center) which makes you feel like there's room to breathe.

I enjoyed an almond milk latte, while my friends got flat whites-- all were quite good. Interestingly, they don't have soy milk- only almond and oat (the latter is new to me). Based on the other recommendations, I also grabbed a chocolate chip cookie for my brother, and it certainly got his stamp of approval!

Unfortunately, no bathroom."
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2019-06-05,5.0,I'm not a coffee kinda guy but the COOKIES are to die for. OMG the best chocolate chip cookie I ever had. Oozing with chocolate chips and uncooked cookie dough got me reconsidering using this as a drug. Highly addictive and made with love. When they are fresh out the oven you might want to consider rehab because it's that good. I love the oatmeal cranberry raisin cookies as well but it's not close compared to the chocolate chip cookies.
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2017-10-06,5.0,"Adorable ambiance with sweet service. Cozy, cute, and hipster spot that the garment district needed. 

Their latte is smoother than Robert Downey Jr - didn't even require flavoring or sugar, not bitter at all, and so foamy. Maybe one of the best I've had. 

Also split their chocolate chip cookie. It's so thick and chocolatey!!! Will have to return for their oatmeal cookie immediately."
664,culture-36-new-york-2,2018-01-03,4.0,"Chocolate chip cookies here are theeee best ever! Everytime I go I get at least two, sometimes three! I've tried their chocolate chip banana bread and croissants and they are also pretty good though if there are end pieces left of the banana bread- it is usually a little hard on the side which makes it eh. 

Since I am not a big coffee person- I always get their hot chocolate and its nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about also!"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-06-04,5.0,"I've come here many times and I'm so glad they've reopened after closing for covid19. I drink bubble tea about 4x a week and this place is great. Great selection of teas. I often get the barley soy milk tea since they're one of the only places that has a non-caffeinated tea option for those days that I don't want caffeine. 

Beyond that they do an amazing job with their pearls. Chewy, sweet. Well done. Top notch."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-03-10,5.0,"Everytime you go to NYC, this is a must go-to boba shop!!
The shop itself is quite small, but cute and clean. Their well-known drink (the dirty brown sugar fresh milk) is out of this world. I personally love flavored milk, so their Strawberry Fresh Milk is one of my favorites.

This is my all time favorite boba shop for one reason-- their ingredients. I am a huge milk fan and I can say with guarantee that their milk is the best I've ever had- super sweet and smooth. I love love love their milk and tea, and together, it's just a huge flavor blast :) The employees are also friendly. Please come to DMV (Maryland specific) hehe THANKS"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-03-09,5.0,"Stumbled upon this gem walking by in the city. Very cute! There are 3 tables and was greeted with enthusiasm and friendliness when you enter the store. Clean, very well kept store. They have a vast selection of drinks and they use cane sugar, fruits and milk instead of powdered ingredients. Yum!

Drinks: brown sugar bubble milk tea and taro milk. You have to shake the cup 10-15 times so the tapioca can soften and break apart. The tapioca was chewy, soft, sweet and has a nice texture to it. The drink was pre-made unfortunately so couldn't alter the sugar level to it so I just added extra ice to make it less sweet but it was still very delicious. The taro drink was made with real taro so it tasted authentic and flavorful with each sip!

Pricing was kind of expensive, $6+ per drink.

Will come back again!"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-02-25,3.0,"Stopped in here after Krispy Kreme (next door). Tried the brown sugar bubble milk tea, which is one of their signature drinks. Was told that sugar level couldn't be customized. Enjoyed the drink in the beginning, but not as much towards the end (it got sweeter, & sweeter, as you drank). Bubbles were very soft, w/ a nice chewy texture. Not a fan of the one cup size, & the price point (when did it become the norm to pay $6 bubble tea!??). 

*Had followed staff instructions, shaking more then 15x."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-02-22,5.0,"As soon as I entered, I was welcomed very warmly and asked what I'd like. 

I asked for the Brown Sugar Bubble Milk with less ice. She mentioned that it might taste sweeter if we reduce the ice but I love sugar anyways so ... not a problem for me. It was ready in a jiffy and I was told it shake it 15 times. This is something really different and I really enjoyed my experience at the store and with the drink. Too pricey for me to get daily, but definitely a great afternoon pick me up.

665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-03-02,4.0,"I really liked this place it was very neat. They have a visual display of all of their beverages which helped me to better determine which one I wanted. This was especially useful because most places don't do this.

I got the brown sugar milk, and the staff recommended that I shake the milk 15 to 18 times before drinking. The brown sugar mixed with milk tasted much better than I thought it would. I will be coming back again! :-)"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-01-17,5.0,"Delicious! Their boba is--dare I say--some of the best in the city. It's perfectly chewy and has that magnificent QQ. 

Got the taro boba after they said they use real taro. They said to shake it 17 (!) times. 

My only caveat is that it is on the pricier for the size but you do get quality and taste. I'd recommend!"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-11,5.0,"Yes! The best boba spot since moving to the East coast . Prior to discovering I'Milky, the best boba in my opinion was from the Los Angeles area.

Yesterday I walked in for my first drink and I ordered the ""Top #1"" drink: Brown Sugar Bubble Milk. I heard the lady say to shake the drink, so I shook it 5 times. Little did I know i was really suppose to shake it 15 times, NOT 5 times . So the base of my drink was too sweet and the top was mostly plain milk flavor.

Today I walked in again for another boba and ordered their ""Top #3"" Taro Milk + I added boba for an extra $0.50 ... which was completely worth every penny. 

I finally had the time to read the directions on how to prepare the drink prior to drinking since there was a longer wait to pick up my drink today (due to other orders ahead of me.) At that moment, I realized I had to shake my drink 15 times to ensure the best boba textures. Well better to know now than to sinfully drink my bobas incorrectly.

The overall cafe was brightly lit and clean. 
I had a sticker shock yesterday when I found out my order was over $6. Today's order was $6.80. The drinks are delicious, but definitely on the expensive side. I only went two days in a row because the reviews all raved about the taro milk. OMG i really enjoyed the bits of taro.  I will order this again in a heartbeat. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-13,5.0,"Way to go on perfectly textured and sweetened tapioca pearls. I wouldn't come here first for the brown sugar milk drinks (have had better elsewhere), but for the regular milk teas/lattes with tapioca pearls, it's great.

The tea is brewed strong, with great flavor. You can request to try out the flavors if you don't know what they are. Be aware, the teas will be way stronger and bitter than once there's milk and sugar added to it.

Definitely happy that a legit tea place has opened up in midtown. The last place I went to gave me watered down tea which was so bland, so appreciate the brew here."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-12,4.0,"I decided to stop by after reading some of the reviews on their brown sugar milk with bubbles and I'm glad I did! The bubbles had a great texture - it was bouncy and perfectly chewy. They also had a nice coating of brown sugar, which mixed well with the milk. After shaking the drink, it was sweet and creamy but not thick in any way. Other reviews said it tastes like Tiger Sugar (thicker) but I do not agree. Inside the shop, about 6 people can sit down. There's enough space for around 5 people to order in the front but there's more space for the waiting area. The display samples are also helpful for those who want a visual of what the drinks look like. Overall, I am a fan of their brown sugar milk and I will stop by when I crave it! 

Stopped by a second time and the drink was rushed. It tasted entirely like milk probably because there was not enough brown sugar in the cup.

665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-11-18,3.0,"So many new Bubble Tea joints opening up I am losing track of who is who and where they are at. Well this one is at 37th St and 6th Ave. It could be this is their first store in the States.  I liked that they had examples of the drinks so you can see what you are ordering. 

I was planing on getting a Brown Sugar Milk Tea but then I saw this Grapefruit Tea, it was tall and beautiful with two tones of colors from the mix of flavors and a big slice of Grapefruit on the inside, oh boy I wanted to try that instead. 

The shop is small but big enough to have comfy places to sit and I had my drink in less than 5 minutes with about 8 other customers in the store.

First thing I notice is I don't have a slice of Grapefruit in my drink, was the display jjust a prop, I got no explanation. I then realized the the display drinks are all plastic. They are Sampuru , plastic food made to look real , not what you will be  getting. ={

Well it tasted kind of funky, I didn't like the flavor of the Green Tea, but that could be me since I don't now what it suppose to taste like in the first place because it was my first one.

This was my second new bubble tea shop just today.  I think the Tiger Sugar craze is making franchises open stores before they are ready and have there staff trained with employees that care about what they are making and business owners who don't think beyond opening day."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-11-20,4.0,"I'Milky was one of popular brown sugar bubble tea brands from Taiwan and famous for their high quality milk and soy milk. We were extremely excited when we heard they opened up a new store in NYC. 

Their decor is cozy and cute but with limited seats available. Their line up space in front of cashiers is narrow so you might need to wait outside if it's crowded.

We tried their brown sugar bubble milk ($6.25 with tax) and it was great. Their bubble cooked with brown sugar was chewy and not too sweet; the milk was creamy, thick and rich."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-11-17,4.0,"Came by to their second day of their grand soft opening. Apparently this is their first US location as they had success in Taiwan. Don't really know the background and history to their business, but they're here to compete with the likes of Tiger Sugar, Yi Fang, and other expanding chains.

I got to try the Brown Sugar Bubble Milk Tea and Brown Sugar Bubble Coffee Milk Tea during this trip. It took a few minutes for them to make them and we where advised to shake our cups 15 times. I felt like they needed to be shaken a good 25+ times. The tapioca is soaked in brown sugar as that's where the sweetness comes from. They just pour the milk or coffee straight into the cup after loading it with tapioca and brown sugar. When I drank the two drinks, you can get the distinct milk or coffee taste as if you were drinking straight up milk or coffee. We got both of them light ice which was 30% ice so it was expected to be sweeter than normal which wasn't the case.

We shall see how this chain plays out in the future, but welcome to the Big Apple!"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-02-18,5.0,This was a really cute Boba spot by our hotel. We decided to give it a try and got the brown sugar Boba drink. There was no line and not too many people were in the restaurant. It was cute little shop that had interesting types of boba drinks and keychains. I definitely would love to come back to try their other drinks.
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,"Had to try it since I didn't get a chance to try it in Asia haha. Small store but they do have a few tables and seats on the side. I ordered the taro with (fresh) milk with boba and it wasn't the artificial purple taro, it had taro chunks in it! Boba was fresh and warm and complemented the drink. The staff were super friendly and nice. They were handing out hand warmers after you order. 
Definitely will be back to try their other drinks!"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-11-30,4.0,"Found this spot while walking around Manhattan one evening and decided to stop in.  Small shop with just 3-4 small tables if you want to hang out. This place seems like it opened within the last couple of months at this location. 

We ordered our standard jasmine green milk tea with boba at 25% sweet, regular ice.  I wish I hadn't added the boba as it was way too sweet for my liking. I ended up drinking the milk tea and leaving most of my boba in the cup.  The jasmine tea was perfect though. It wasn't bitter or over-brewed and had the perfect jasmine flavor to it.  

I'd definitely order from here again but I'd go without the boba next time."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-11-12,4.0,"Came here for their soft opening.
They will have grand opening this weekend 11/15 and 11/16

Lots of option on the menu.
Their top 5 drink are
-Brown sugar bubble milk
-Brown sugar bubble coffee milk
-Taro milk
- classic bubble tea latte
-jasmine green tea lemonade

Unfortunately when I went, the brown sugar bubble was not ready so I got taro milk with pudding and classic bubble tea latte instead.

They use earl grey tea. Instead of milk powder, they use real milk, so taste more refresh. I order 80% sugar. Not too sweet at all. Bubble texture was chewy but I think sweeter will taste better

For the taro one, they use real fresh taro to make the purée, so it doesn't look terrible purple.
The drink didn't taste very strong taro, more milk taste. And the hand made pudding also not too sweet. So they balance well."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-11-15,5.0,"Another great addition to my boba list!! This brand is known for its milk drink series. Today is the grand opening for this location, and they are giving out free drinks on both today and tomorrow.

Interior - honestly quite small, can barely fit 10+ customers, so the line was out the door. I like the interior though! Big kitchen area for the workers, cozy vibes for seating customers.

Service - great service, keep it up!!! Trilingual workers.

Taste - GOOOOOD. Honestly tasted pretty close to Tiger Sugar (another well known brand for its brown sugar boba milk). The drink size is a little small though, considering it's almost $6 a cup. But the boba was chewy, delicious, and sweet!!! Will definitely come back to try the other products in their milk series."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-04-18,4.0,"What differentiates I'Milky from the rest of the boba shops is in the name - milk. All their milky drinks are deliciously crafted with using either fresh farm milk or soy milk. And they're paired with soft & chewy boba pearls that are just right in texture. I like the fact that their drinks aren't as sweet as some other places. And their location is conveniently in Midtown between Bryant Park & Herald Sq, which makes it a good pit stop for the thirsty!"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-02-27,4.0,"OK I have been here a couple of times now. What makes this place different from all the Gong Chas and Vivis is that this places uses real ingredients- milk instead of creamer, real sugar instead of fructose shite, etc (see photo for list). The milk, especially, is FRESH. The boba/bubbles have their own sweetness to them and are a good texture. 

Everyone raves about the Taro Milk and the Brown Sugar Bubble Milk. The taro drink consists of mushed up, real taro with the super fresh milk. It was very rich imo and I would recommend 50% sugar on this one (and that's saying something bc I'm a sugar junkie). All drinks they recommend you shake no less than 15 times for consistency. I think this place is worth going out of the way for and is a good spot to go for dessert after eating in Ktown."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-02-05,4.0,"This is a cute cosy place. The service was pretty quick. I got the brown sugar boba milk. It tasted really good. However, it wasn't the best brown sugar milk I've had. There was too much milk and the brown sugar taste was not there completely. The boba was tasty though. There are around 6 seats to sit but no bathrooms. Overall it's a nice place to try out the drinks once"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-01-15,4.0,"The bubble tea here is legit, there's no doubt about that. I had the Taro Milk with bubbles and you can definitely can clearly tell that the ingredients that they use are super high quality. I think that the price is also reflective of the high quality. It is definitely pretty pricey, even for the area, but I do feel that it is worth it. I think overall it's about $5 - 6 dollars for a drink (and that doesn't include any extras). I liked that the Taro Milk had little pieces of taro in it as well, you can tell that this isn't just a regular bubble tea powder mix. This is a great treat once in a while!"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-02-02,3.0,"I would give fewer stars if I were only rating the drink, but I'm giving a few extra stars because I ordered 0% sugar for my drink, given that at most places 0% sugar is still pretty sweet. But when I tasted the drink, I realized that here, 0% sugar truly is 0%, and it was not sweet enough for me. They offered to remake the drink at the next sugar level, which was a lot better in terms of sweetness, but the drink was really watery and not creamy at all. And it was just warm, not super hot."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-03-05,4.0,"I went here yesterday and got the taro milk tea with lactoud free milk and were informed that they use real taro blended and no taro powder at all so it will not be that purple color which I had no problem with 
I'm a taro milk tea fan and this was the first time I have enjoyed it so much it's not too sweet you can taste the sweet potato it's not artificial taste and felt thick like a smoothie .!! I really enjoyed it but 4 stars only because it came to be around $6.25 for one medium drink which I feel is very pricey but if you wanna taste real Taro --- I definitely recommend to go here but it's not something u can buy everyday but they have good seating and great customer service so I would try somehting else"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-01-26,3.0,"TLDR; decent bubble tea with sweet bubbles. Cute decor and knowledgeable staff, but beware of plastic pieces in your drink.

I came here around 1:30 on a Friday. There wasn't a wait, but the girl at the register was fixing something in the system after someone put in their order; she asked us to give her a moment. We ordered two brown sugar bubble milk tea, wanting to see how this compared to the brown sugar competition. It was nice that you can alter the amount of ice in this so asked for less ice which is 70% (note: there is less ice and light ice. Light ice is only 30%, FYI) 

We took the time while we were waiting to admire the decor in the store. It was very cute with the different greetings tacked onto a fake grass wall. The kitchen area was surrounded by bubble tea models so you can see what your drink should look like. 

When our order was up, the girl told us how to shake it and how NOT to shake it. She even offered to shake it for us, but we were fine with shaking it ourselves. 

The bubbles were warm which was nice. We shook it up and drank it, instantly noticing that it tasted rather dilute compared to the big competition, but I would say it's probably on par with most other bubble tea places. The tea itself didn't have too much flavor but the bubbles were deliciously sweet. Unfortunately part way through my drink I noticed something rather hard to chew when I was chewing on the bubbles. Lo and behold, I found a piece of plastic in my drink. I'm not sure what it was from, but I was genuinely surprised to see that in my drink. The likelihood of this happening in every drink is low, but I still think this shouldn't happen ever."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-09,5.0,I'Milky is one of the chains from Taiwan. I had tried their Barley tea with boba at the Taiwan airport earlier this year during my layover at the Taiwan airport. I was surprised to see their location in NYC near work couple of weeks ago and decided to give them a try. It is more pricey than other bubble tea places (along the lines of Moge Tea and Boba Guys) but their brown sugar series was really good! I love their taro milk and brown sugar boba! The boba chewiness is very consistent. And I like how you can adjust the sweetness and ice. A nice addition to the swarm of bubble tea shops popping up all over NYC!
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-01-14,3.0,"The interior has great ambiance and plenty of seating for a small bubble tea shop in Midtown, Manhattan. However, I usually get no sugar with my iced bubble teas and this Jasmine Green Tea Latte was not what I had expected. The tea is very light and there was not too much flavor. The drink was pretty sweet. The bubbles were a little too hard for my taste. The drinks were aesthetics and nice looking but maybe I should try something else if I go back next time. Price is reasonable."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-12,5.0,"I enjoyed the fresh and highest quality ingredients that they used. You could taste the difference and they don't use powder in the drinks I had.

Their Brown Sugar Bubble Coffee Milk was a great twist by adding the coffee. It was a great pick me up.

Their Taro was delicious and you had the sweet taro and fresh milk.

As a refresher, I got their Jasmine Green Tea Lemonade and it's the perfect balance of sweetness."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-09,4.0,"Another Boba spot in midtown, I like it that I can get different Boba from so many different places and get the best of the best no matter where I go. The interior quite small but feels cozy, can barely fit eight customers but it doesn't take long to get your drink.


The service was good for me but my friend ended up with the wrong drink she pointed to one of the plastic drinks on display so the staff needs better training or at least know what the drinks on display are. I order the brown sugar milk and t tasted pretty close to Tiger Sugar but drink size is a little small though, considering it's almost $6 a cup but I still will definitely come back to try the other products in their milk series"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-11-18,5.0,"I stumbled upon this while walking to herald square and got SUPER excited!! This was one of my favorite bubble tea places in Taipei, Taiwan when I went to ximending. I got the brown sugar milk tea- so GOOD!!! I haven't found a better one in NYC- def come by and try at least once! The cups are really cute too"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-10,2.0,"Meh. We were in the area after lunch and my cousin had it bookmarked. The storefront is really tight. There isn't really a waiting area to wait for your drinks. All drinks are delivered in the front of the store, but you can't really stand there because people are coming in and ordering. There's a window in the back, but it's not an open one so they can't even pass your drinks over. You have to fight your way back to the front to get your drinks.

We both had their signature milk tea with boba. I ordered it hot with 50% sugar and my cousin had hers iced with 50% sugar and 30% ice. Both of our bobas were super watery and fairly tasteless? I did not taste any tea! You'd think with 30% ice, it wouldn't be so watery and tasteless?

It's not the worst boba that I've ever had, but it's definitely a hard pass the next time I'm in the area."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-08,4.0,"I'milky is such a great addition to Koreatown. I was craving some bubble tea yesterday and came across this gem. Upon entering, I didn't know what to expect but wanted to enter with an open mind. The store itself is bigger than most bubble tea spots I've been too which I liked very much. Their menu is pretty straightforward and written in both English as well as their native language. Their bubble tea were very pretty and I'm sure it's going to be the next Instagram-able trend. Since I'm lactose intolerant, I stuck to their matcha soy milk option. This tea was pretty balanced  with equal portions of soy milk to their matcha base. If soy milk isn't your thing, they do have regular teas without milk. You can also add other toppings to drink such as red beans and more. The restaurant itself was very inviting and well lit. They have limited seatings and it's probably best to order it to go."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-05-23,2.0,The few drinks I have tasted here were way too artificial.  Wished they would make the drinks taste more natural with less chemicals.  Not the worst boba drinks in the world though.
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2020-03-06,5.0,"Such a cute little place. It's a little bit off from the craziness of K-Town, but that's okay. It looks small from the outside, but there are three small tables (6 seats) inside. The workers are so nice and pleasant. The cashier introduced me the store concept before I even had a chance to look at the menu. She said that everything in the store is natural and fresh, not from powder, save for the matcha and cocoa. I ordered the taro milk tea, which is made with actual taro, not purple powder. The visual looks a little strange because real taro is brownish, not brightly purple, but looks are so deceiving. This is the best taro milk tea I've ever had. You can feel the pulps of taro, nice and starchy with a blunted sugariness, so welcoming after having tried many extremely sweet brown sugar milk tea lately. But it is still quite sweet, as you cannot control the sugar level for this drink. The boba is nicely sweetened and chewy. I had a slight issue with the drink, and the employees were so nice about addressing the issue. The drinks and the cafe are so cute. I would definitely return again to try one of their other drinks."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-11-21,5.0,"I visited during their soft opening and was impressed by their expansive menu. The cafe interior is very cute & has wifi. There is some seating but a bit limited, there are 4 circular table tops and an outlet which would be perfect to bring your laptop."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-04,5.0,"NEW FAVORITE BOBA SHOP! 

I've been obsessed with fresh taro milk since visiting Taiwan and could not find a good one in NY. Most places use taro powder to make their taro items. There are a few places with fresh taro paste, but they add too much flour or some kind of starch so it's less natural. 

THIS PLACE THOUGH. This place has super fresh taro paste with the perfect texture and sweetness. Definitely get it if you visit and like taro (REAL taro, not fake powder). I've gotten the fresh taro milk 3 times now and the best way to order it is plain. Just get it cold with no extra toppings for the perfect sweet drink."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-04,4.0,"I'milky is amazing in that they have a large variety of boba especially their coffee boba the first ever made. Their ingredients are organic and served with warm boba, cold tea, creating a nice mesh of deliciousness. I strongly recommend trying the green tea with redbeans!"
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-11-30,4.0,"Ordered the hot Brown sugar milk bubble tea and the hot brown sugar coffee milk tea. 

My brown sugar milk bubble tea was too sweet when I got to the end. It was too milky for my preference of bubble tea but I'm glad I tried it."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-14,4.0,"Good option for an after-dinner drink. I was looking for something without caffeine so I wouldn't stay up all night, and they had a barley tea with soy milk option that was quite tasty. The boba was a little on the overly firm side."
665,i-milky-沐白-new-york,2019-12-05,5.0,"So glad I found a good tea spot right near my commute! Right near Herald Square, I loved all the drinks I've tried from them. The Brown Sugar Boba Milk is sweet and delicious. Also, if you're a fan of classic boba tea, that's a really solid bet. What surprised me most was their taro milk. Be prepared for the texture of the taro in the drink, but also be prepared for a seriously delicious beverage! Definitely going to go back for more."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2019-08-07,4.0,"Perfect for a quick, quality, and unique bite of breakfast on your way into work if you happen to pass through the Fulton / World Trade Center area, Lavazza Café offers pre-made sandwiches and coffees with little to no wait.  While it's certainly a bit of a trek from Fulton Center (maybe a 20-minute round trip), for those passing through the Oculus, Lavazza is only slightly removed from the main thoroughfares with its location tucked away in the back corner of Eataly.  

I've ordered every sandwich, and each has vastly exceeded expectations for a pre-made meal.  Croissants that are buttery and flaky without being crumbly, tomatoes that aren't tough (you know the kind; you take one bite and drag the entire tomato off the sandwich the kitchen, in haste or oversight, left the unripe center green bit on the slice, leaving you to play Jenga with your breakfast or lunch with each bite, or just forego the tomato altogether), cheese that has actual taste, and boiled eggs that have a yellow yolk (rather than a sickeningly dull grey, the bane of the pre-made boiled egg market) are all marks of Lavazza's breakfast sandwiches.

The coffee is fantastic as well, in the hot, cold, and dessert varieties.  The affogato is nice pick me up for later in the day and the drip coffee is always fresh and fragrant, alleviating any concern that it might be stale or hours old.  The cold brew has robust flavor that outperforms similar competitors in the area, with a subtle chocolate caramel sweetness that is apparent even while drinking it black.  

Change up your breakfast routine.  Put down the bagel and cream cheese or the BEC on a roll (both of which I order on multiple occasions each week) and pick up a croissant with fontina and cured ham.  Or maybe some prosciutto on a roll. Or get really crazy and have the tomato and mozzarella, topped with just enough black pepper and olive oil, on a buttery little puff of bread.  And chase it all down with some of the best coffee in the area. Lavazza Café provides the perfect setting to entice one to sit down and enjoy the little things, so just do it already."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2019-05-19,3.0,I liked how the affogatto has 2 scoops of ice cream but they could've used 2 shots instead of 1 of espresso.  The chocolate cake was good but very dry.
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2018-09-28,4.0,"Nice coffee stand within Eataly Flatiron.  Had a decent latte here.  I'm a fan of Lavazza coffee and this is one of the rare places that sell it in Manhattan.  They do everything from espresso shots to iced coffee to hot chocolate.

I got a pecan and caramel croissant which looked better than it actually was.  It was a bit dry and not as delicate as I had hoped.  I'd probably go across the street to Chanson for pastries instead."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2019-11-06,4.0,I wish I can come in and have coffee here and start my every day form here one of my most favourite place for coffee and pastry love to come and having coffee or tea .quick service nice staf everything is awfully nice .
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2018-03-02,5.0,"Great coffee, great croissant. The cashier asked me butter or olive oil. My impulse was to say butter but upon asking him for his favorite, I went for the olive oil.

First of all, I didn't even know there were two kinds! I went w his suggestion and didn't regret it. Obviously it wasn't as flaky as a butter croissant but the bread was warm and had an almost citrusy? (extreeemly subtle) taste from the olive oil. Would def get it again along w try the classic butter one next time!"

Don't be deceived -this place has everything Italian  from shopping your favorite take home items : cheese , pasta, meats, seafood.....  Now if you want to sit down and have a meal, then this place is for you Pisano!  There is even. Rooftop Restaurant & casual dining inside.  Cool shopping for upscale Italian take homes like Santa Maria Novella perfumes- rarely carried by vendors outside of Florence / Sorrento !  Grazie Mille Eataly!!!"
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2018-11-11,4.0,The only reason this place gets a four star is bc the coffee itself is very good. Otherwise it's a very expensive small cup that takes a very long time to get. Also for anyone that needs dairy replacement they have almond and soy.
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2018-05-12,4.0,"Why have I waited so long to try Eataly's coffee? I noticed that they don't have lattes but it registered under macchiato when I ordered. The only problem was that almond milk was $1.. I mean that's quite expensive just for substitution, costing $4.90 for a small cup of coffee. Anyways, it was really yummy and I'll definitely be back! There is probably a line, but its worth the wait."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2016-09-10,4.0,"Good coffee, nice people, and fun building.  

I got a double espresso and it did it's job.  I came here early in the AM so no one was around which was nice because I was able to get a window seat and people watch for a bit.  They open at 7AM so being in an empty place at that time was a treat - this place is usually crowded to the max by noon.

They have a large selection of coffees and treats, and once the entire building opens up, you'll have a huge selection of other goodies from Eataly."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2018-04-24,5.0,It's inside the complex of Eataly in the flatiron district. Always packed and long lines but worth the wait. Hard to find seats  but Good Cappuccino and Yummmy Chocolate milk.  Try some!
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2017-03-28,2.0,"My drink was fine. Service was unpleasant. They call out the names of your drinks, not your name or order number, and if you miss the call or aren't sure, bad luck, the person who called it out is gone. Ask if your drink came up yet and you get attitude. Not many seats and they aren't comfortable. Oh, and the doors will open frequently and blast you with cold air.
I won't be back."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2016-08-11,5.0,"Loved their cappuccino! So rich and foamy and relaxing! I wish I could simply sip their espresso all day long and enjoy a great book somewhere. Definitely stop by in the morning as there was no line at all that you could have a short stay as well.

Better location than the other coffee shop tucked inside for sure."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2019-01-09,1.0,"I had wanted to try this place for a long time and was excited to hear that it was in Eataly in NY. I really liked the coffee! My problem was with the lack of service. From the moment I ordered to the moment I got my coffee I was surprised as to how slow and lackluster this experience was! The person taking the order and the person making the drink were hard to hear because they barely looked at you when they spoke. They were grumpy and it also seemed like they didn't enjoy being at this place. This was an evening and they had one customer prior to me ordering. It was a very uncomfortable experience and I for one will never go back. I had even tipped them in advance! And, it took a while because they made my drink caffeinated even though I had asked for decaf!  :("
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2015-02-06,4.0,"I wandered in here yesterday and got the world's most amazing hot chocolate (okay, okay - maybe not the world's best, but it's definitely right up there) all that was missing was booze, lol.

My phone conked out earlier due to my photographing random plastic snowmen by Madison Square Park and unfortunately my battery gave up and I didn't get to photograph this amazing thing - but that just means that I'll have to go back.

It was about $4 and change and served with a thick layer of cream, espresso (I think), whipped cream and chocolate shavings. It was expertly put together and although it was super busy - their staff was friendly, efficient and awesome.

I'll definitely be back and soon!"
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2017-04-23,3.0,My coffee tasted burnt. That's because the lady steamed the milk and espresso together. They almost seemed annoyed that I was ordering something so I didn't bother asking for them to please remake it. My cake was delicious. Will not be visiting again for coffee.
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2015-05-30,4.0,"Got two drinks from here - one iced and one hot. There are so many options to choose from its quite overwhelming. First off, it's definitely overpriced ($5 for a small ass cup), but it's Lavazza and its located within Eataly so I'm not surprised. 

The iced mocha was HORRIBLE. so disgusting I couldn't even get myself to take a second sip. but I also ordered the spumina and WOW. just WOW. the espresso was rich and intense and the hazelnut mousse was perfectly airy and creamy and tasted like Nutella infused whipped cream. 

I understand an iced mocha is not part of Italian espresso so I will look past the disgusting drink and just remember the flavor of the spumina. It has definitely found a place in my heart."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2018-07-22,5.0,Amazing coffee is all I would like to say. Don't quite remember what we got but it was a street fight between me and my wife to get a sip of it (no wonder this place is amazing).

Thick hot chocolate topped with ""cremespresso,"" a smooth coffee sorbet, & finished off with a healthy dollop of rich whipped cream & chocolate shavings. 

Part drink, part dessert, all sweet & indulgent. 

Can't even complain about the size (comes out to what? A dollar an ounce?!) because you only need a couple mouthfuls to obtain that all-day smile when a product is loaded with this much flavor & body."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2013-10-30,3.0,"If you are wandering around the Italian Disneyland that is Eataly the Lavazza Cafe located by the front entrance is a decent stop for coffee or cappuccino. Along with the delicious pastries and baked goods they offer here this can be a dangerous place for your waist line.

Always seems crowded with all the hustle and bustle here. We had to do ""the hover"" and wait for a few people to leave before jumping into their seats at one of the tables. The staff are a bit slow in clearing the dirty stuff off the tables so I did it myself. Cappuccino's were tasty with thick foam. The desserts we chose were of good quality, but be warned your surely pay for it. In fact, it seems most things here are a bit higher priced, but I guess it comes with the territory.

It's a nice stop for a change of pace, but nothing to make a habit of. So many other coffee and dessert places to hit up in the area or within a few minutes away."

Regardless of how you say it, the coffee here is top notch. Its what I crave when I'm in the Flatiron.  

My kids like to order the Ciocolatta, I'm quick, I like to order a double espresso. Done and done. (And they give you a little cookie on the side)

This is just a dangerous section of Eataly, There is gelato/ice cream, baked goods and chocolates, tons and tons of chocolate!

Forget that ""truck"" outside parked across the street. I used to go there before this place opened. Come inside, its the real Italian coffee deal."

While everyone was ordering affogatos and other fancy drinks, all I wanted was an iced coffee. It's really frenetic in here. At one point, the baristas behind the counter amassed a pile of receipts. But, their attitudes and overall service made up for it, but not as much as how good the iced coffee was! Staple."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2017-01-30,5.0,"This is my go to cafe in the mornings on my way to work. The cappuccino is one of the best I've ever had. They serve LaVazza coffee (obviously...) which is my favorite. And they have tons of great pastries, croissants, and breakfast sandwiches. Now even breakfast paninis. The prosciutto on a croissant is always great."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2015-05-01,4.0,"I thought this place seemed really cute on Yelp.  It has really good reviews!  However, I didn't know it was a part of Eataly, the huge consortium of all things Italian from pasta to seafood to gelato.  So note that this is ""Lavazza Cafe"" as a part of Eataly - which means you might just get lost.

So I am reviewing solely the gelato and panini portion of Eataly (to be quite honest it's practically a superstore because its half restaurant/cafe and half groceries and produce!).  My friend ordered their panini with prosciutto ($8) which was actually pretty good!  I opted for dessert - their Stracciachella (is that spelled correctly?!), which is a milk ice-cream with dark chocolate chips.  Not that the ""milk"" really made a difference, it tasted more like vanilla to me, but I mean dairy is dairy.  It was about $4 on a cone and $5 on a cup.  Either way, it was super good and to be honest it's a lot of ice cream.

They have a seating area too, just where a lot of people sit.  You might end up sharing with another person as each table could sit like 8 people.  Either way, it's a great place to just enjoy a little bit of Italian eatery.

Also note that they have one bathroom and if you come into Lavazza, you're going to have to go all the way back (and probably ask for directions once or twice)."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2016-07-12,4.0,Their specialty drinks bring me back to Europe. Not so much their environment. Avoid weekends. Unkempt environment and TOURIST CHAOS.

Maybe I was still in my California mindset when I ordered what i did but I was a little shocked that I didn't know it was an espresso. Well I'm more of a tea lover than a coffee lover anyways. However, the espresso was very rich and one of the better espresso's I've had. Also, the people working at the registers were also friendly."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2015-11-28,5.0,"I got a hot chocolate with extra espresso shot for about $4. It's more than worth it, this chocolate is the best I've ever had. Very rich, chocolatey, creamy and fairly sweet, this medium-sized cup (apparently as tiny as a tall Starbucks one) satisfied me more than any venti-sized hot chocolate anywhere else. 
The service was pretty good even though it was quite overwhelmingly crowded."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2012-08-06,4.0,"I work very close to Lavazza and used to come here everyday. (I only stopped due to wallet constraints.)

They make some of the best coffee in NYC, in my opinion. The cappuccino has an amazing slightly nutty flavor and the baristas clearly make every drink with care.

The cup sizing is European, so all drink sizes are smaller than one might expect. The prices, though, are pretty steep.

The ciocolata is decadent and absolutely amazing. I used to be an L.A. Burdick fanatic (also in Flatiron) but I think the ciocolata just might be better. It's extremely sweet and thick, so go for the smaller size.

Be prepared for a bit of a wait if you come here in the mornings or early afternoons."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2012-06-18,4.0,"Starbucks, I sense a problem if they expand their business! 

Their drinks and tart selection (and other sweet treats) are affordable.  I found this gem in a food blog.  Now look, you see if you go there for your first time it will be difficult.  You will not find it one shot.  Google maps didn't do justice finding this place for me.  I guess I am hungry and want the goodies pronto.

Black man not feed on time, damnnnnnnnn... That's a No No!

So I had to ask a person where can I find this place. The person point it out.  Oh my god, it was right there.  Let's go get my goodies.  The layout is cute. I took pictures like Asian taking pics of a toilet bowl (is the same thing, Miss... Look it flush!)...

Quick tip: if you going there with friend, tell that friend to hold seats while you place the order. There aren't many seating arrangements for you to enjoy your purchase. 

Comparing their prices vs Starbucks it is about equal.... The drinks taste way better here.  Is Italian focus drinks.  I gather that is reason why it taste sooooooooooo good.

My opinion: 
Starbucks = McDonald's 
This place = High in spot

Going back to the review, I love hot drinks that have a foam design, because I love that kind of layout. My recommendation for your first time is latte and raspberry tart.  After you trying this for your first time, you will honestly feel is worth traveling far to get a good drink. You deserve the best. 

Quick overview:
Helpful employees
No attitude
Clean
Tourist feeling (no need to worry about them over pricing)
Addictive place to explore more drinks and goodies (you need a friend to stop you from buying more...  Friend, let go the cup... Say no to the 11th tart... Walk away"""
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2013-09-23,4.0,"Inside Eatlaly, we settled on having coffee and dessert at the LavAzza Cafe.  They have a desserts counter with interesting offerings.  We were both looking for chocolate and hazelnut flavors and they had numerous unique options, none of which I'd ever seen in a bakery before.  We ended up with a little torte that packed a creamy, rich, nutty hazelnut taste with dark chocolate on top.  There are tall tables where you can sit and rest a bit so while it's quite a bit more chaotic than an Italian cafe, it's a taste of it."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2014-01-14,4.0,"I had breakfast there with a friend this morning. The HIGHLIGHT was the latte macchiatto I had. An INCREDIBLE cup of coffee. It was a 5 star coffee and I will make a special point of returning just for that. 

Other highlights were:

- being served in a real china cup not paper or (gasp) plastics.
- appropriately conservative portion sizes alla moda Italiana
-some quaintness with retro Italian design napkin dispensers and such
-location facing the park, nr flatiron and clock, within Eataly....great place to meet up, for purposes of convenience and NYC essence too
-the interesting and surprisingly delicious taste and crunch of large salt crystals in the breakfast 
sandwich

Lowlights:

-Oddly, considering Eataly's raison d'etre, the food was entirely a miss (aside from above-mentioned salt crystals) at least for me. 

-The breakfast food options were minimal. 
-Service was slow. 
-Mozza tomato basil roll had melted mozza on it but was served cold. I enjoyed the sea salt on it perhaps all the more because the sandwich had such a wan, wilting vibe. Sorry but I would have enjoyed a simple egg&cheese from the corner deli more. I generally adore the mozza tomato basil combinations so I can't put my finger on why this was so disappointing. Too bready maybe. Yet the basil was intense. I couldn't really taste tomato or mozza at all. To be fair, personal taste must be a factor because I wouldn't ordinarily find this sounding good for breakfast but chose this because the other two rolls had pork on them and I, uh, saw Babe.

In the hopes that I just had a flukey misfire with that, I ordered an apricot croissant which turned out to be sadly, worse. The butteriness was there but no light flaky airy quality. And it was basically hollow and filled with an extremely syrupy apricot jelly. It reminded me of a jelly donut, which I don't dig. There was very little apricot flavor and it was just wayyy too cloyingly syrupy. Left most on my plate. Again this could be partly a matter of personal taste preference (a lot of people love jelly doughnuts) which is why I still give them 4 stars given the out-of-this-world coffee.

So oddly folks, based on this experience I would go back to Eataly for the COFFEE in a heartbeat. In fact I will go out of my way for that again. And soon. But surprisingly, not the food."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2016-07-12,1.0,"For almost $6, I expected way better. It was actually one of the worst coffee drinks I've ever had and I had to get through the madness of Eataly to obtain it."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2016-01-09,4.0,"had to try the hot chocolate here since well why not? it was warm out (at least for us) the other night so we stopped in here on the way back to our hotel. the hot chocolate wasn't bad, it just seemed too bitter tasting for me.... I love a thick hot chocolate but maybe it would have been to just sip it instead of walking around drinking it? who knows but either way it wasn't my favorite. I liked Mariebelle way more (thick delicious hot cocoa)"
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2014-10-26,5.0,"Everyone should try their hot chocolate.  It's thick and chocolatey.  I promise you it'll take you to chocolate heaven and back.  And yes, with whipped cream.

Don't worry, the cold winter weather would burn all the calories you consume (at least that's what I tell myself)"
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2017-07-08,5.0,Amazing coffee made fresh and good desserts... had an awesome cafe mocha which was made perfectly and not too sweet and perfectly warm for a summer day caffeine kick. A must go if you are in the area!!!
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2012-01-26,5.0,"Best and quickest breakfast I have ever had ! 

A dreamy warm Macchiato with a prosciutto filled croissant. 

I was only in NY for a week and I ate at this place twice (no where near where I was staying too). The second morning I went I guess I got there too late and they were out of the prosciutto croissants :( 

The place it is also connected to is an amazing market as well, called Eataly. I spent an hour just walking around looking at all of the imported eye candy.

Have not eaten this good since I was in Europe."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2013-11-01,4.0,"Being street side on 5th ave in the madhouse of Eately makes it not do crazy. I ordered a latte and hazelnut cookie. Both were excellent. Coffee (Lavazza, natch) had good flavor and no bitterness. So you 're here for a caffeine jolt but it would be a shame to not indulge in a pastry. A delightful combo. Grab a seat at the tall counters -- thankfully with comfy, tho tall, chairs, and for a few minutes all is right with the world. $10 ain't cheap, but it 's so worth it!! Does not disappoint."
666,lavazza-café-new-york,2015-10-29,4.0,Awesome awesome awesome coffee here. The real deal. Everytime I'm in the area and want  a well crafted delicious coffee I come here. I hate having to deal with every European tourist coffee snob that comes here. But swallow your pride it's worth it. Staff is friendly and it's always busy. I'd skip the pastries.
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2020-01-07,5.0,"If you're here, you must get the Oat Milk Draft Latte or the Oat Milk Black and Tan. If you're into regular milk, get the Draft Latte or the Black and Tan. 

Basically the only disappointing part of La Colombe is their purposeful lack of WiFi."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-11-01,5.0,"This would be one of my favorite cafes in NYC. I truly love their coffee. It's so smooth and tasty! 
I usually don't like to get coffee outside because they are so bitter. But La Columbe coffee is easy to drink and has a deep and nice flavor. I am glad it's near my office!!"
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-11-03,5.0,"The coffee here is truly amazing! This is a great spot right across from Bryant Park with a good amount of seating. I usually grab and go here and they are always very quick, while still delivering a high quality cup of coffee.

Today, I had an iced latte here. It was perfect as always! I also love their cappuccinos and draft lattes. I didn't get food today, but I have had their vegan scone in the past and it was great. Even for such a central location, it is never too crazy crowded. I also like that they give you a spoon to stir your drink. It is an extra touch that is nice. They also are giving you lids that don't require a straw for cold drinks. So if you want a straw, remember to bring your metal ones to save the environment!"
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-11-01,4.0,"Bryant Park's La Colombe Coffee is spacious and sometimes I stop by to get some reading or work done. It's easy to find a seat in the morning but gets harder later. Place gets packed during the busy hour like sometime before 9 am and lunch time, but the line goes pretty fast. 

Draft latte here is pretty good, but it is sweeter and more filling than a latte, so it doesn't pair too well with pastries. I recommend enjoying draft latte by itself."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-10-08,3.0,"Not my best experience at the coveted La Colombe. I was itching to get the oat milk draft latte as the one I got in Chelsea left me on cloud 9. Unfortunately, this location fell flat--literally. The oat milk draft latte has nitrogen which gives it the foamy texture. They need to dial back on that nitro because my coffee was way too light and foamy. I was in shock, after reaching Bryant Park, only to see that my coffee settled to about 1/4 th of the cup. I wanted to enjoy my coffee at the park and only took a few sips! This situation did not happen at the Chelsea location; I was able to enjoy my oat milk draft latte at a leisurely pace without it having settled to that degree. 

I went back to the shop and explained what happened. The man at the cashier was understanding and led me back to the coffee station to get a new cup. The woman manning the draft latte was confused and gave me  attitude, saying that the draft latte was ""suppose to be foamy"". I had to explain my situation to her 2 times and she still seemed confused. A manager came out to release some nitrogen from the tank. I asked again for another cup and she poured it reluctantly. Sorry, but her customer service skills are lacking. Still overly foamy. 

This would have been 2 stars, but I bumped it up to 3 just because they gave me another cup. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt that it's just an off day, we shall see..."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-11-04,4.0,"Good vibes, good coffee. I had an oat milk draft latte and loved the frothiness and flavor. Can't wait to try more of their stuff. There is some seating, but not a ton. Staff is super chill and helpful. I can't wait to try more on the menu, but may just have to get the oat milk draft latte again cause it was sooo good!"
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-11-03,4.0,"It's been maybe half a year since I've been to La Colombe and I was happy to find they finally offer milk alternatives almond and oat, but not soy. Coffee is still as good as ever! I didn't stay because I went to check out Bryant Park's winter village but it's pretty quiet and dim and looks like a nice study spot."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-09-08,5.0,Love walking into a random coffee shop and walking out getting exactly what you want. We are on our way to a broadway play and wanted to sit in Bryant park for a bit with a coffee before the 2pm show. I got a cold brew and my fiancé got the drip coffee. Each were about 4 bucks normal ny prices but both were worth the value. The two girls that worked there (I think one was the owner) were nice and the service was quick. If it wasn't such a nice day it would have been nice to sit inside. They're right next to Bryant park so it's a great location. When they get busier they probably will need a better system for the milk (I was asked what kind and given a carton of skim which is fine but probably would take time if they had a lot of customers). They also had a spoon waiting for me to stir the milk which is very much appreciated. Hope they do well!
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-13,5.0,"This is up there on my list of favorite coffee places. I love their dark roast coffee as well as their Black and Tan. I love that they have both oat and almond milk as well. Their donuts, cookies, and croissants are delicious. I try to avoid them though, it is hard.

I love the service here. Once you get your coffee to go or to stay, they have a bar and your name is called. They then give you a saucer with a spoon on top of it and ask you if you want to add any milk. There is sugar too. My only complaint is that they don't have stevia or cinnamon. Cinnamon would be a great condiment to offer. It is maybe the o my reason why this is not my favorite coffee shop. 

If you like a great roasted coffee, draft latte, or espresso, this is the place to go! They also have delicious treats as well as pre-packaged coffee to go and yogurt!"
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-02-22,5.0,"Delicious coffee, easy to understand menu and cheery, efficient baristas! That's what you will find at La Colombe Coffee. Even during the Friday, midtown, before work rush the staff here is polite and calm. 

My first visit I got the cappuccino, which was the perfect temperature and very smooth. Today I got the draft latte and I now understand the hype! It is cool, creamy and filled with flavor. I'm originally from Rhode Island and they have a state drink called a Coffee Milk (coffee flavored syrup stirred into milk). This drink is the closed thing I have had to replicating this flavor (and without the syrupy chemicals)."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2020-03-04,4.0,This may have just become my favorite coffee shop in the city. I tried the oat milk draft latte and it was creamy and just the right amount of sweet. I did add some ice to it when I got back to my office which I would definitely recommend doing. The lady taking my order was also very patient and explained to me what each different latte consists of. Minus one star for the price. Unfortunately $5.50 for a latte is not doable too often.
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-07-20,4.0,Wow. The draft oat milk latte is amazing! It's poured directly from the tap and serve chilled. It's so creamy and decadent. It's an absolutely delicious latte. I usually get my iced lattes with oat milk if it's offered. The oat milk is so creamy. It's the perfect type of milk for a latte. This draft oat milk latte is one of a kind. Highly recommend.
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-09-19,4.0,"Oh my goodness, talk about a well-oiled machine. This place operates so efficiently I couldn't believe my eyes. My co-workers told me I had to get to La Colombe ASAP when they had heard I had never been. I take coffee recommendations seriously, very seriously. So, on my break at work I waltzed on over to this location for a coffee and almost turned back around in disappointment when I stepped inside and saw that the line was at the door. Not only was it at the door but it was wrapped around the entire cafe, legitimately the longest coffee line I had ever seen. I turned around and was going to head out when I noticed the line was moving, I mean really moving. So I said to the person in front of me, ""Is this typical?"" She said, ""Oh yeah but it moves quickly."" Low and behold she was correct, I was in and out of there in less than 7 minutes. Still a longer wait than usual for coffee but as I'm waiting, I'm thinking this coffee has got to be the best of the best for it to be so busy and for people to take time out of their busy day to wait on this line. My friends at work suggested their black and tan amongst other specialty drinks. I'm a simple coffee gal, never had a latte in my life or a macchiato or anything fancy. I'm a black coffee or cold brew woman. There were some people sitting at the tables in the shop but to be honest, you wouldn't find me there. I couldn't relax or get any work done sitting there with a huge line of people surrounding me looking at me because there's not much else to look at while you're waiting online. It would make me uncomfortable and chances are, I'd be distracted people watching the entire time too. They had four baristas or so back there and they were hustling. I started getting nervous when I approached the counter, people were going to KNOW I was new, I didn't want to be the new girl here, didn't want to slow the line down but what was I to get. Drip coffee, cold brew, drip coffee, cold brew. I asked the guy behind the counter real quick and he said to go with the cold brew so I did. He suggested I ask one of the baristas for a taste of their nitro cold brew just so I knew what it tasted like. They were so busy I felt bad saying saying, ""Hey, I know you have a line of 30 people but can I get a taste of that."" Wasn't going to happen. I took my cold brew, put a splash of almond milk in it and I was on my way. Strolling through Bryant Park sipping on my cold brew, sun beating down, picture perfect scene except my cold brew was EH. I wasn't loving it, which made me sad. I still think Starbucks has better cold brew and I paid $5 and change for the one in my hand. I have to give this place a good rating though because they operate so efficiently, the staff is nice, they have delicious looking cookies in the window, they offer a myriad of specialty drinks that may have blown my mind had I tried them and just because I didn't enjoy their cold brew doesn't mean you aren't going to love it. Definitely check this place out.

Draft oat milk latte. That's what my co-workers told me to get, it just came to me. I messed up. I'll go back and get that, it'll probably be amazing and then I'll update this review. Ta ta for now."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-06-13,5.0,All of the draft lattes are good! I'm not sure how they are made since they are pre made and poured from the bar. I only know that they are lighter than the usual latte and tasted creamier and nicer. Highly recommend oat draft if you like oat milk and coffee.
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2020-03-14,1.0,"I've been coming here regularly for a while now, as the location is convenient on the way to my office. Came here Friday and seemed to be bothering the people working there. The place was empty. You would think they would be gracious enough to have some business.

667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-11-05,2.0,"La Colombe is among my favorite cafes -- particularly the NoHo and West Chelsea locations.  

However, today I got an iced latte from Bryant Park was disappointing -- the flavor of the drink tasted both burnt and bitter.  The iced latte was sadly reminiscent of Starbucks, which is the anthesis of La Colombe.

This location is busier than most others, but the quality of the coffee, the level of gracious service, and the staff attire / aesthetics in NoHo is far superior."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2018-11-30,4.0,"11/30/18 update- I patron this coffee shop regularly. I always get a plain hot or iced latte. I like it because it doesn't need extra sugar or sweetness to taste good. The espresso is very smooth which I love. Sometimes they don't fill the cup all the way which disappoints me, but it's only certain workers I have noticed. You also must try the almond croissant- it's to die for! I was not a fan of the blueberry muffin and the regular croissant is good as well. 

------------

3.5 stars and Interesting is my way of describing my experience at La Colombe. I went it at 9am and just beat the huge line that came in after me. They don't have a menu posted anywhere besides a printed one near the register, which in my opinion they should post it on the wall where the line starts for new customers like myself. 

I went for the draft latte and had the cashier explain what it was to me, and it from the reviews it sounded pretty good. They don't take down your name or anything so my latte was sitting there and I had no idea until I asked another girl behind the counter and SHE WAS SO SNOOTY. Another older man was confused about the whole set up too and she was acting like we were asking her questions that didn't fall under her job description!! 

Anyways, the draft latte was subtly sweet and smooth all at the same time. The only weird thing is they didn't put ice in it so it was like on the brink of being cold but it wasn't, so when i got to my office I added ice which took away some of the frothiness  but it's better cold! I definitely will come back to try their other stuff, but hopefully that girl changes her attitude."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-04-13,5.0,"I try not to gorge on coffee but when I do... this is my new place when i'm in the area. The decor is so smooth and appealing. I feel like I can just relax there anytime I want. Had a nice cold brew with oat milk and that was that. The workers were alert and on it. I feel like it's a well oiled machine. 

I will return for sure whenever I am in need of a caffeinated pick me up."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-03-15,4.0,"I popped into this place before a meeting.  The interior has cool wall decor.  The coffee cups had have cool designs that reminded me of Palm Springs.  However, the bar area gets crowded.  The put a lid and spoon on each dish for each customer.  I didn't realize it until I was looking for something to stir my drink.  They have a few seats in the back, but not really place to work.  The location is more of a pop in and bounce coffee shop."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-11-04,5.0,Flew into NYC for 2 day trip and definitely had the Cafe on my must go to while here list. On the last day walked couple blocks from my hotel and was able to stop by. Loved the service. The staff were very friendly and personable. Got great instructions on how I could order coffee back home in San Francisco. The barista was a great help and had lived in the Bay Area for a period of time and we talked about not having La colombe there and how it was worth me making sure I stopped by while I was in New York. Very good coffee also tried oatmeal milk drip latte which was also very good. First time having and may have caught on to something.

667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-07-09,1.0,"Roach in coffee purchased at La Colombe

I purchased iced lattes at La Colombe located at 1045 6th Ave, NY on June 26, 2019. And my friend sucked it up with a straw and she felt something in her mouth. When she spit it out and found out it was a dead roach. 

We went back to the store and told them about what happened. They said they are going to report to the headquarters and contact her later. 

Greg Smith, a NY district manager, contacted her the next day. He said he's been working at La Colombe for 25 years and it had never happened before. He offered my friend $200 La Colombe gift card. 

I and my friend were very upset and told him that she never wants to purchase anything at La Colombe ever again and that will never make it up to her. 

Smith asked her what she wanted. She said she is very traumatized that she does not want to think about this issue at the moment and she will get back to him later. 

Yesterday, We contacted Smith and asked for $2,000. Smith said his boss is out of country so he will have an answer for us two weeks later. 

My aunt found a CEO's instagram account and direct messaged him about the situation. He never replied. 

My aunt received a call from Greg Smith today, saying that they would give her $500 and asked her to sign the waiver as the CEO told Greg so. 

She refused it because she thought it can never be made up to her and she did not like their attitude, especially that CEO not replying or apologizing to her even though she contacted him directly.

They kept saying they haven't had this kind of issue since they started their business. But it happened anyways. They should have showed more caring attitude if they think of their business. We loved their coffee always. Now we are so traumatized that we can't get any iced drink outside. We can't believe that they offered store gift cards without asking us any options or so. We asked Greg would he put a roach in his mouth if we give you $200. I bet nobody would. That was our true feeling."

Also, how cool are they for offering free sparkling water?!"

This location is clearly firing on all cylinders and everyone was friendly and efficient. From walking in to walking out with my coffee was only a couple minutes.

Draft latte ($4.25) was perfect as always. Thick, creamy, and deceptively highly caffeinated. Y'all ever had coffee milk, the Rhode Island delight? This is that on steroids. I loved that they gave it to me with a spoon and plate with my to-go order so I could mix my simple syrup in at the counter mess-free and make the perfect milkshake-esque coffee.

I will not rest until there are draft latte taps in every office and restaurant in America, but for now I will settle for hitting up all of the La Colombes around town."

667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2018-11-28,5.0,"You can never go wrong with La Colombe, imo.

I first fell in love with their Cold Brew. It's dark and bold, but yet very smooth. I got so addicted that it was putting a hole in my wallet, so I ended up buying their Corsica beans and making my own cold brew. The beans are dark and has notes of cocoa. It's great to drink as is, without milk. 

This summer they released an oat draft latte and once again... I got hooked!! I've been dreaming of having a draft latte for years now because my friends always order it. But because I'm lactose intolerant, I haven't been able to. I came almost every day to cure my 3pm slump. I thought it was a summer special only, but I'm so glad it's still available! It's thick and creamy. It's kind of like drinking a melted milkshake. It was the perfect summer drink to beat the heat!

I've also had their mocha and latte. Their mocha is different from other coffee shops. It's not sweetened and they use really dark chocolate. This is the way I like my mocha, but it's not for everyone. Some will think it's too bitter. The latte is pretty average, still a great solid choice though. 

Overall, I think I can say La Colombe is one of my favorite coffee shops."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-08-07,5.0,"La Colombe has some of the best coffee around. I've been to this spot a few times and it's great. A few things to note:

1) It's right in the middle of Midtown, so it's always very busy. A lot of young professionals meeting and getting their coffee. The line is pretty fast moving, usually about 15-20 people in line but you're probably waiting about 5 minutes at most. The baristas are great about taking orders down the line. 

2) There is not a lot of seating. Toward the back of the shop there are a few 2 person tables, maybe 4 total and in the front there are some standing tables.

3) No wi-fi!!! This is one of the worst parts. I hate when shops don't have wi-if. I came in before an interview and I was pretty upset because I love La Colombe coffee but I hated having to use my data. 

Also, excellent chocolate almond croissants . Top notch."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-06-24,5.0,What a great coffee! My go to when I feel like an ice caffeine break in the park. The line is usually pretty crazy around 2pm but it moves quick. Worth the wait if your in the neighborhood.
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2018-11-09,4.0,"It was the first day of our trip to NYC and we needed some coffee in the afternoon to battle jet lag. We were around Bryant Park and this coffee shop was across the street so we decided to check it out. As we were looking at the menu, the Iced Red Eye jumped out at us since we had just flown in on a red eye flight the same day. I asked the cashier what it was and she told us that it's an Americano with a shot of espresso. We ordered the Red Eye hot and it was really great! It was bold, strong, and I actually felt instantly lifted after the first sip. And as we drank our coffee and walked around, it did not become acidic at all. 

The only complain I have about this place is that they don't call your name when your order is ready and just put it on the counter. So when there's more than one of the same order, you don't really know which one is your coffee, and the baristas didn't seem very interested in helping you. I guess you're just supposed wait by the counter and watch the coffees come out like a hawk."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2017-12-30,4.0,"Really nice La Colombe location! Bigger and more spacious than their other locations with more seating as well. Awesome espresso drinks. They have almond, soy and now Oatly oatmilk!! If you haven't had an oatmilk latte (I know it may sound strange to some), try it! The oat latte here is super creamy and delicious. One of my favorites! 

There is also a variety of pastries, their own canned coffee brand, draft lattes. 

They also have this awesome water station that has both still water and seltzer for free. FREE SELTZER YAY. 

Friendly baristas and staff. Pretty standard New York latte prices. With the added $1 for non dairy milk (sadly), my latte was $5ish. 

Anyway I'm glad to see more La Colombe locations popping up! I will return!"
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-04-24,5.0,"I'm glad that la colombe is gradually branching out in the city. My favorite here is latte. Heavy on milk but with their syrup, it's a light kick to start the morning. I've tried mocha but it's a bit light for me. Staff at this location are all friendly and courteous. It's very busy in the morning though with not that many tables to sit on and a bar like standing table."
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-10-31,5.0,I love Colombe !! This spot doesn't have much seating though so I usually just grab a cup and go to the park across the street.
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-06-16,5.0,"One of the best spots for an oat milk latte, AND they have oat milk lattes ON DRAFT! The creamiest and the smoothest!"
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-02-05,5.0,One of my favorite coffee places! The amount of seats are quite limited but the quality of coffee makes up for it! I love their cold brew latte on tap - it tastes just like a milkshake. The staff is always very friendly which is an added bonus.
667,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-8,2019-07-11,4.0,"Spacious, good music and energy. Smooth and delicious coffee. NO WIFI, ONE OUTLET, small seating area. Good for in and out, quick meetings. Not good for working out of coffee shop vibe. Also $1.00 extra for all non-dairy milk alternatives. Easy for cheaper coffee to end up at $6.50"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-12-11,4.0,"Need some quiet time for yourself, on some quaint place to do it, try here. I walked into this small time coffee shop that was over crowded. I quickly found a seat and the two baristas working the counter was so kind and amazing. 

I didn't order anything special, just the house blend with oat milk, but I love the small coffee shop. It did clear out near to 5pm and it was pretty homey. If you're looking for a small spot to get some work done, here it is. 
Ambiance: for a small coffee shop it does the job of being a hole in the wall. There isn't any bathroom so that's something you should keep in mind. There are two outlets in the front of the shop, but other than that make sure your electronics are charged. There is also wifi."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2020-02-04,1.0,"Not much to say about this small spot but I got hot chocolate and coffee from here and the hot chocolate tasted watered down and coffee not good, even heard from customers that got coffee from here that it wasnt good...

I dont understand how places can fuck up hot chocolate BUT stop skimping out on the chocolate..."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2020-03-05,3.0,Okay spot. The chai here was a little bland in flavor and the barista wasn't particularly friendly. The pink sprinkle cookie was really good though! Just not a spot to write home about.
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2020-01-11,5.0,Absolutely worth hopping off the High Line for cold brew and a chat with the friendly baristas. Quaint little place but seemed to be getting a lot of foot traffic. Highly recommend!
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2020-01-30,5.0,Had a Great walk on the high line but I love getting a coffee at under line. Said hi to Anna she makes the best Mocha!
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-03-11,1.0,"NYC life is usually made better by coffee.  Not here.

Visited on a rainy, dreary day, for hope of a cheerful pick me up.  Nope.

First, the counter staff was flat out sullen, cold and hard of attitude.  I know this person can smile, banter and laugh as I saw this cashier and the barista doing so, loudly, the rest of the time while I was there.  Anti-humanist customer service.  Cashier: you are here to be pleasant and get orders efficiently taken and delivered.  Serving the customer is partially about being upbeat, positive and kind.  Didn't happen.

Now one could just let that go and enjoy food and beverage... but  those, also were nasty and unpleasant. I had an almond milk latte that tasted like the  milk was bad. Barely drank half of it and then, as I was there with a friend & didn't want to ask for a redo, just let the rest sit there untouched. A bad coffee at a coffee shop? How depressing.

The final insult to injury was the ricotta, strawberries, and balsamic toast. It looked (in the advertising photo) like it was on some lovely rustic white bread. Nope.  It was on the stalest piece of white bread that had been toasted so long ago that it was stone cold.  Oh, and not that I expected it to have a massive serving of strawberries, but there was barely one and a half strawberries cut up for each half slice of toast. Summarized: it was one piece of plain white bread, cut diagonally, thinly spread with the ricotta, and a total of 3 small hard strawberries cut up, sprinkled on it. The final yuck was that the accenting balsamic vinegar was poured onto the toast in such a way that it only hit the center part of the toast and none of the rest - soggy meet stale. It was truly a rip off at eight dollars and hardly edible.

TL/dr: For java and a snack, go to a well-known coffee chain or a bodega instead of here."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-07-18,4.0,"Nice place! Cozy!

Coffee is good !!! Much better than Starbucks

For medium hot latte and almond croissant (which is delicious and decent size) I have paid $9 smth.

Definitely recommend everyone to have a cup of coffee here! Nice and friendly stuff"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-09-14,5.0,On 8/31/2019 we stopped in while walking the High Line and glad we did. My wife ordered an espresso and the barista brought it out on a nice little tray which included a glass of carbonated water. What a nice touch! I ordered a caffe americano. We were told by the barista that the owner created his own blend of beans over a course of several years. Both coffees had a bright taste and were absolutely delicious. So we glad we waited until we came across an independent coffee shop. The service was also excellent (very friendly and obvious they appreciated our patronage).
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-02-21,4.0,"Conveniently located right under the High Line, it's the perfect coffee shop to stop by before taking a walk on the high line. 

It's small but spacious, but there's not a lot of seating. There's a lot of foot traffic as well, so it's maybe not the best coffee shop to kill an afternoon at. 

I ordered a large oat latte, which was very good. Not to be a diva, but I would disregard every review from people visiting complaining about the price of the coffee. It's New York. You're inevitably going to be charged an arm and a leg for coffee shops. I'm honestly just grateful that Underline Coffee doesn't charge more for the coffee given the excellent location lol.

A+ service as well."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2018-04-19,4.0,"I'm a big fan of this place. It's tiny but has plenty of seating and extra friendly staff. 

I highly recommend the toasts at 7 dollars a pop it won't break the bank but will fill the gap"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2018-11-05,4.0,"This isn't the first time I've been to Underline Coffee's location in Meatpacking, but it's the first time I've been able to write a review for the coffee shop and I'm happy I get to share about how convenient this little spot is.

My friend and I arrived around 1:45 on a Saturday afternoon. The space was pretty full but given the time and it also being the weekend that's to be expected. However, there wasn't any line when we went up to order which speaks to the turn around time the barista's are able to take orders and make drinks at. You're definitely getting fast service when you stop in here.

When it came time to order we both went with medium hot black coffee's ($2.50 each). Nothing out of the ordinary, the coffee got the job done and definitely kept us warm on a particularly cold and windy day in the city.

Overall a great small spot to grab coffee and hang out, or take while you walk the High Line!"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-10-04,4.0,During our trip in NYC we visited the highland and found this cute café. The Iced Latte was delicious. Best Coffee in Town!
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2018-10-23,3.0,"It was a chilly day on the high line, so we descended to the Underline for a coffee fix.  I preferred a 10-ounce  latte.  I asked what syrup flavors they had & was told they only do chocolate.  Hmmm.  So I got it plain.  It tasted fine plain, but nothing spectacular.  I was surprised though at how pricey it was for an average latte that was pretty small.  Almost $5.  I know NYC can be pricey, but I can get better coffees, larger servings, & with flavorings at other shops around town for less of a cost.  ""Underline"" is ""walking a fine line"" with their pricing & lack of syrups.  I probably would not go there again."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2018-09-13,5.0,Excellent pour over. Excellent service. The feel you get here is of someone who cares about the coffee they serve and the customer that comes into the shop. A delightful and delicious gem hidden under the highline. Don't go to a corporate chain when you can experience the flavor and service of Underline. You will not be disappointed.
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-10-26,1.0,"Ordered an americano and received the worst, watered down coffee-flavored water of my life. Something odd must have happened. The drink was light brown and transparent. I ended up throwing it away a few minutes later. I cannot recommend Underline based on this experience."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-06-29,2.0,"I was near the HL and in a rush so I grabbed an iced coffee here with some almond milk. It was $4.90 and disgusting. The almond milk was old and made my coffee taste sour. Should I have tried it before I left? Yes, but I trusted it would be good for the price I was paying and I was in a rush. Despite the terrible coffee, the lady who helped me was very nice and made sure she put the right amount of their old almond milk in my coffee."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-08-06,2.0,My coffee was made by someone who was just mopping the floor and didn't even stop to wash their hands. The coffee is just okay. The ambiance is also not welcoming.
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2018-11-18,5.0,"This cute little coffee shop has a lot of interesting drink options that you probably won't find at your local Starbucks. I got a flat white with their home made almond milk. I've never tasted anything like it and I probably won't get it again, but I'm glad I got to try it here. I highly recommend the cookies tho, they have armed velvet cookie that covered in crystallized sugar and stuffed with frosting. It's to die for. 

The service and ambiance were great too. It's a small spot, but enough room to sit for a little bit. They also had a banging playlist going when we were there so we were really jamming. The service was really friendly, too. 

If you're in the area, you should definitely check it out."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2017-12-25,5.0,"Stumbled upon this small coffee shop while waiting for the famed Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors exhibit. 

This place was small and quaint. About five different people working, all very friendly.

The most important part (and the reason for my review): it was the best Dirty Chai I've ever had. The homemade almond milk gave it an added punch, but it was flavorful and spicy. I hope to return!

The other items here looked incredible. This seems like a good spot to grab a bite and a drink and make your way to the highline or the Hudson."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-02-21,1.0,"Worst service ever. The guy working there is so dry and unhelpful. He wouldn't make avocado toast said he ""didn't feel like it."" He goes ""I'm gonna be honest with you. I'm not gonna make you toast right now."" He also wouldn't tell another customer what time the store is open until. So rude!"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-02-21,5.0,This coffeeshop is great. Quiet when I went which was a little before noon on a Sunday. Service was great which made the food even better.
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2017-10-18,3.0,"Marked down due to the lack of a toilet. This is indicated by a sticker on the front door so that's fair enough & it was bad luck that as well as needing shelter from the rain and a coffee I needed to urinate when we stopped in in mid-September. Whether there's an employees' toilet & whether, as a Crohn's sufferer, I could have used it are moot points as the question was never asked. I just though always find it weird when places selling food and drink which allow it to be consumed on the premises, don't then have the facilities for its post-consumption disposal.

The coffee & service were though good (unlike other places in the city a Babyccino was managed). Just don't sit-in if you've a full bladder."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-04-30,5.0,"Stopped in on my way down the high line, beautiful hidden gem that you could almost miss if you weren't looking for it. Excellent coffee and such a wonderful barista! A young man served me a flat white I'll never forget. What was more charming than the coffee, was the Irish brogue. Will be back for another flat white and hearty chat. Many thanks to Tim"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2018-09-01,5.0,This place is awesome. Great coffee and a funny crew making the coffee. Get a Chelsea.
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2017-08-15,4.0,"This was my favorite coffee shop I've been to so far this week.... Located right underneath the Highline. Coffee shop has a nice atmosphere, it wasn't very busy when I was here. Nice seating if you would like to enjoy your matcha latte (no pressure). 


Matcha latte was what I got. I really liked it. One of the better ones i've had in new York. I'll be back :)"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-09-05,5.0,"Cute, independently owned coffee shop. They roast their own beans and the staff are sweet and helpful. Great alternative to Intelligentsia in the Highline."

NY Manhattan Chelsea
12:30pm Thursday 24th September 2015
Four Stars

As the name suggests Under Line Coffee is located directly below the High Line on 20th. This narrow hallway of a shop has 3 two-top tables, a four person bar counter at the front, and 7 person L shaped bar counter at the back. The East wall is white brick and the West Wall is blue brick. They have assortment of quasi matching lighting fixtures. 

The reason I came here was because the Cups App had a food special today. So I came to try their mashed avocado toast ($2 instead of $5) plus a cold brew ($2 instead of $3.75). If you haven't downloaded the app and use my code ""25pn5"" and we both get free coffee. 

The coffee was served in a clear plastic cup with crescent ice. The color was cloudy brown with a sheen of oil. The taste was slightly bitter with tangy acidity and notes of caramel. The texture lingers on your tongue. The caffeine was mild. 

The 3.5 cm thick multigrain bread was freshly toasted and covered with large chunks of ripe avocado. The bread had delicious crunchy bits of  grains and seeds, the inside had an airy texture, and finished with a hint of sweetness. The seasoning had a spicy kick. However, there was no olive oil or salt on top. Luckily they have salt packets.  

I think they concentrate more on the espresso than anything else. According to their social media barista  Rich Cummins won the East coast Coffee competition. I saw a beautiful Iced Cappuccino with scooped foam on top. 

Next time, I will try The Chelsea (an iced latte with anise infused shots of espresso and maple syrup) and SL28 Fizz (grapefruit juice, tonic and espresso). Also their house made almond milk. 

Note they don't have a restroom.

They do have wifi: ul coffee; ulcoffee511"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2018-05-25,3.0,"I love that this place markets itself on the High Line. There is a sign on a building you can't miss as you walk south. For a week or so I've observed the sign and made a mental note that I'll pop down the staircase as I make my walking commute downtown. Today, I was so disappointed by a coffee I purchased before walking up to the High Line that I was ready and not yet caffeinated...I flew down those steps to 20th St. and popped right into Underline. 

I like the space - small, somewhat narrow, woodsy-metal feel. My order was taken right away by pleasant staff, my cold brew popped right up, and I made my way back up the steps to finish my walk downtown.

Cold Brew was OK. It was worlds above what I had been served earlier that morning from another shop, so it was welcome. It just lacked depth. It gave me an energy boost. 

I think I'll try this place again, but likely not the same item. 
It's worth checking out to explore the menu."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2018-06-13,5.0,"Always a special experience...pastries are some of New York's best from Balthazaar... the fresh moist muffins and loaf cakes burst with home baked flavor... maybe somebody's grandma makes them? Try the poppyseed  loaf with the jam inside...really good! Sit undisturbed at the rustic log tables... sip...munch...listen to totally funky music...get smiled at by the upbeat friendly staff. This tiny urban oasis holds forth on West 20th St under the High Line...hense...eh eh... ""Underline Coffee""!"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2016-11-29,5.0,"Another hidden gem off the High Line. Don't let the small scale (12-15 feet wide store) fool you. What it lacks in size, it more than makes up for in warmth, hospitality and character. The coffee was fantastic and made with great care by the barista. We also tried a chocolate chip cookie, which far exceeded our expectation."

Perfect location: right under the high line, thus the name. It's between 10th Ave and 11th Ave, so not many people around which makes it perfectly quiet and uncrowded.
Perfect ambiance: just the right amount of simplicity+design
Perfect tea: the queen's guard was not too strong, not too light, had a hint of rose in the taste, just amazing.
Perfect service: staff was very welcoming and helpful, service was very on point!

Overall a great great experience, will definitely be back."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2017-12-06,4.0,"A nice cozy spot to stop by for a quick cup of coffee. I was in the neighborhood craving some caffeine and happened to stumble upon this place. It looks like they have a pretty extensive tea list, so non-coffee drinkers, take note as well! The staff is very friendly and the vibe is super welcoming. They really take the time to make your cup of coffee special for you, accompanied by the nice touch of latte art. Perfect for stopping by before or after looking at a couple galleries, or walking the Highline on an Autumn day."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2016-07-26,4.0,"Have passed by this cute little gem many times visiting high line park and today finally made it a try! While their pastry option was a bit limited, their espresso selection was definitely extensive. 

The best way to enjoy would be to grab a small cup and sip inside the park! Creamy and balanced cappuccino, well done!"

Today I ordered their house brew which is a light brew and is fruity with a light tea texture. It's soft tones give it a light body. For $2.25 for a small, it's a great deal. 

Great coffee house for a quick pick up!"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2017-03-11,4.0,"Came here while waiting for a friend before waking the Highline.  It's nestled right below the park on 20th street.  Definitely a hidden gem.  I got just an americano but my friends and I couldn't stop raving about how smooth and delicious the coffee was.  T

They have a little merchandise shelf inside with metal coffee mugs, tees, coffee and zines.   Cool place that I was happy I stumbled upon.  Recommend as your meeting point if you are exploring the park for the first time."
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2017-11-17,4.0,I really liked this place!! Atmosphere was friendly and casual . A nice neighborhood feel to it. Staff was friendly and made you feel comfortable.

669,underline-coffee-new-york,2014-07-31,4.0,"I really dig this spot! The coffee is really nicely balanced, and the people who work here are super nice.

It's definitely tucked away, but it's worth checking out!"
669,underline-coffee-new-york,2019-03-05,1.0,Coffee was good but the service was frustrating. The barista/manager talked in a very condescending manner and I was quite offended. I don't think I would go back.

Can't go wrong with a lunch or a coffee here!"
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2019-01-30,3.0,"Extremely disappointed by my delivery experience. Had a two day event event I ordered for and the coffee was fine along with the delivery driver couldn't be nicer, but on the first day I ordered $20 worth of tea and water - to have all of the tea bags stuffed in a small cup (not exactly presentable for a corporate event). When I called to clarify because online it says they come in a box, I was told that was corporate policy and that I would have to tell them. I informed them that their ""corporate policy"" was a health code violation and that tomorrow I would like them to come in a box how we ordered them- I was told they would. The next day they come in one of those flimsy bags. Will not order from pret again for a large event."

It's clean, has good air conditioning, and spacious."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2018-05-31,1.0,UK Pret is 5-stars; US Pret is sad. I didn't buy anything because the choices seemed insipid and cowardly by catering to supposed US tastes instead of the bold boxes bulging British shelves. The baked goods case looked forlorn. 22 May 2018

Sherley is particularly welcoming and always makes me feel appreciated. This high quality service keeps me coming back to this location. They are so efficient, I never have to wait to check out.  The store is clean and well organized. The food is fresh and I love their salads.  It's a pleasure to come here."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2019-08-01,1.0,"Grabbed the Salmon, Mango & Avocado Grain Salad, which looked good in the box, but was actually pretty vile. Whatever was in there looked like salmon, but it tasted like sardines. And there appeared to be a healthy serving of grains, but it's a rather stingy amount placed atop the greens in such a way that it looks like there's more than there actually is. Mango was unripe and the avocado was soggy. The dressing tasted more like peanut sauce, which seems to be to be an odd pairing for salmon, but, as I said, I'm not entirely sure what that was despite the fact that it was pink. I had a few bites and then threw the whole thing out. So much for an $11. salad, but it was really gross and made me feel ill. Iced coffee was okay, but weaker than I prefer. Bag of chips was good, though. Certainly won't be going there again for lunch!"

670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2018-04-26,5.0,"Love this location. It's clean, has good energy, and is easy to get to/find.

Shout out to Sunita (I think that was her name) for the stellar customer service and smile two weekends ago when I came in. She did such a good job that I wrote a note to myself to give her props, and am now just getting to it LOL.  When you're in New York it's easy to be in your own world and focused on yourself. It's nice to experience someone who was truly of service - made my day!"
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2017-01-24,4.0,"This is my go-to Pret in the area especially if I get to NY way too early in the morning. I've come here to sit and relax in the morning till I go to work. 

What's not to like?! They have a lot of food options available during breakfast and lunch. They have pastries, oatmeal, sandwiches (breakfast and lunch), soups, salads, and many more. They're also not as crowded compared to any of the Starbucks (at least 4) within this area and slightly cheaper. This location is pretty large and have plenty of tables and seating available downstairs and upstairs. I've even seen a some people conducting interviews here.

As far as my experience here goes, service has been excellent and their workers look like they enjoy working here. I've also received a free hazelnut croissant here once! I haven't seen that hazelnut croissant in a while or at any other Prets I've visited lately but definitely try it! It's hazelnut spread inside the croissant and the outside is topped with mini chocolate chips... mm mm"
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2019-06-09,1.0,Bad customer services. All the employees were chatting inside and didn't care about customer at all.
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2017-10-22,4.0,"Pret is a staple in my NY visits for work. It's quick, fresh, they have many options and for everyone is actually really friendly. It makes the start of your day or mid-day that much better. ENJOY!"
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2017-04-20,1.0,Where are my vegan options at? Everything meat and cheese.... except for $10 falafel salad.....
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2017-04-05,5.0,"My go to pret for on the go and I like the environment to do hw etc..I recommend the falafel wrap, the pastas are great, and soups the Moroccan Lental and tomato soup. I like that they have many vegetarian options. Not a fan of the juices flavors though and think the drinks are not worth it. Also the brownies are great best brownie bites I've ever had hands down . In the morning they have a different menu so i like the egg and portobello sandwich I just wish they had more whole grain breakfast options with bread."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2017-08-24,2.0,"I was curious why this place was more empty than every other restaurant in the area. I soon found out... the air conditioning was so cold it seriously felt like a refrigerator. The sandwich that I got did not taste fresh, had cilantro in it, and was put together very messily. The only thing I would recommend is their juices but they were overpriced too."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2015-07-21,4.0,"A great place to get away from the crowds for a latte or organic hot tea.  It's affordable and cheaper than Starbucks. 

We didn't eat here, but stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for a quick pick me up. It was clean, but the trash bins (attempting to separate recyclables and trash) were overflowing."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2018-02-07,5.0,"the 5 stars is not so much about the food. you like Prêt' s products or you don't right?. But their customer service is the best. STAFF is always helpful, polite and friendly. They should probably train all their staff at this location because the other pret on 23rd and Lex or the one in Union square is ok at best."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2015-04-24,4.0,"We found ourselves here for a break and coffee after a few hours of walking and sightseeing first in the West Village and later in the East Village.  We had just taken a taxi back to the Flatiron to see if we can grab a drink at Eataly, but no luck. The warm spring day has packed Eataly's rooftop Birreria! We ended up here instead, and that was fine with me, as I needed to rest my feet! 

This place is great! Yes, it's a chain, but it's a good place to grab a quick bite or lunch that's affordable.  I've eaten at other Prets before on previous visits to NYC, and it's always a good choice for breakfast, lunch or snack. It's clean, has a lot of seating, and they serve freshly made salads and sandwiches. The coffee was good too. And if you need wifi, you will get the wifi password on your receipt. The only thing though is that this place doesn't have a lot of outlets for plugging in your phone charger. We went upstairs and was able to find one outlet where I could plug my charger. 

The downstairs area has couch seating as well. They have two restrooms, one downstairs and one upstairs.  You'll need to punch in a code, so you'll have to ask a clerk for it. 

If I have a choice between Starbucks and Pret a Manger, I would definitely eat at Pret. They make their sandwiches and salads FRESH daily. Whatever fresh sandwiches, salads and breads they have leftover for the day, they are donated to charities. And apparently, each store is given a daily budget to give away free food to customers. Read the article below. Maybe you'll be the next lucky recipient!

670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2015-05-27,5.0,"*** Healthy/Fresh food, Quick service, Great seating *** 

Love this location. There's great seating available and lots of options to choose from. If you're looking for a quick healthy and fresh bite, come here! Or check out the many locations Pret has to offer!"
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2018-03-11,4.0,Love their almond Lattes- best I've ever had! Could use some vegan pastries and vegan food options.- vegan croissant would be nice :) But whatever almond milk they use - it's amazing! Will never go to Starbucks again.
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2014-09-07,4.0,"I love this place! They food is healthy and fresh which is a plus. Although they have a variety of healthy sandwiches and salads, I go in for their chocolate chip cookies!! They taste like grandmas homemade cookies! So good."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2018-10-28,5.0,"Was SO happy with this on the go cafe spot with an abundance of healthy options, organic and reasonably priced. Also serving good coffee"
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2014-08-21,4.0,"Pret A Manger, you're great, you really are. All of your food is always fresh and well-made. I especially like your soups, brie and tomato baguettes, and your hot wraps. You should consider making that holiday wrap a year-round thing.

But just once, JUST ONCE, I'd love to come here and not have to dance around the guy restocking the shelves. 

I know it's a weird thing to complain about, but seriously. This happens every single time. Are you guys on 2 minute restocking increments? Am I the only one seeing plenty of food on those shelves at the time the guy rolls out YET ANOTHER giant cart of sandwiches?

Just once I'd like to be able to select my sandwich in peace. Not bobbing and weaving around the guy who's just pretty much making it impossible to see what's on the shelves. Not constantly having to step out of the way to make room for the guy who's basically stuffing said shelves with unnecessary amounts of food.

I'm sure you guys are just trying to get a jump on the rush. But geez louise. Is there no better way to do it? 

Sorry, I'm whining here. It's a trivial complaint. You and I both know that regardless of that cart I'm still going to come back and get my meatball wrap.

PS - Your locations in the UK are better."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2016-07-01,4.0,"Not sure how you can hate on really solid, pretty affordable for NYC organic food. I'm a fan of the wraps at lunch, both the chicken and shrimp ones are really tasty. 

In the morning, I love the southwest breakfast wrap (vegetarian only), bacon one is hit or miss on how crispy the bacon is. Love the 5-grain oatmeal and the chia pudding or yogurt cups are always tasty.

Only know is I wish they had cold brew coffee, rather than just iced. And yes, there is a difference in taste, acidity, caffeine level between cold brew and iced coffee, and cold brew wins out every time. Hence the ""trend"" of everyone from Starbucks to Dunkin getting on board. Still, the hot coffee, is quite delicious and organic, big fan of the Lively Latin."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2017-11-09,1.0,"I, personally, have not been to this location. HOWEVER my coworker took one bite of oatmeal from this place and her immediate response was ""I am not happy."" The oatmeal was practically frozen... she tried to resuscitate it by adding some hot water, but it was too late. She then tried putting the oatmeal in a toaster bag and toasting it, but it just turned it into this weird oatmeal wafer thing.

It was the saddest I think I've ever seen her and it really harshed my mellow."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2017-08-14,5.0,"First time here very good organic coffee is wonderful pastries are delicious, staff very polite place is clean smells great a lot of seating very nice area would tell all my people about this spot"
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2011-06-07,4.0,"Went out for lunch today and came across a new location for this chain. Pretty much a carbon copy of the one I had lunch at recently in Union Square

Clean, bright, and spacious decor.

Diverse selection of freshly made sandwiches, salads, and wraps.

Hearty and tasty soup selections.

Seating on main level and large upstairs level.  

Friendly and quick counter staff.

Clean bathrooms

As it was hot outside today I was craving a cool salad. There are about a half dozen varieties to choose from, and all freshly made. Had one with chicken, avocado, walnuts, and dried cranberries. You have to purchase the dressing on the side so I went with the balsamic vinaigrette. Good stuff. Went to sit on the upstairs level at the front overlooking the store which was great for people watching. It was nicely air conditioned in there too.

What's cool about this place is that everything is made fresh daily with organic and natural products. No additives or extra preservatives, which can cause all types of problems to our bodies. They use local suppliers for their products. At the end of the day they donate leftover food to City Harvest which is a wonderful charity. 

Funny, next to this location is the Van Leeuwen Ice Cream truck, and next to the one in Union Square is the Big Gay Ice Cream truck. What is this? Some kind of evil plot to keep us fat after we eat healthy?"
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2017-06-03,1.0,"Ordered am iced green tea, I got a peach flavored sweet tea.  That is not what I ordered.  The internet wasn't working.  I will pass on this chain in the future."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2017-08-23,4.0,The staff here have always been friendly to me. The food is the standard Pret selection - but I like it for something quick and easy. I also get their organic coffee regularly. Without their ubiquitous presence here in NYC I would seriously have to rethink my coffee situation.
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2018-06-18,2.0,"I'm giving this place 2 stars, simply because they are always out of everything by 6:00. I don't know why they bother to stay open till 9:00, because they are pretty much down to empty shelves by 6:00. It defies logic, because this street is packed with people till 10:00 pm. When I ask the staff, they say (politely) , ""yeah, we sell out early."" HUH??? But you're open till 9:00."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2015-02-26,2.0,"Let me take a moment to gripe about what is ultimately a #firstworldproblem, but I dunno Pret A Manger... I dunno... Your delicious Hoisin Duck Salad Wrap tickled the cockles of my palette given your delicious description. I picked you up, like a grindr hookup without further inspection. And, as I should have suspected, looks were deceiving. All I saw were the plump ends of the wrap. I pictured succulent duck breasts pressed plushly against the soft tortilla pouch. But when I delicately unpeeled your wrapping, I found a good third of your soul missing (see picture). It was like eating a hollow, empty shell. Yes, you were delicious for a moment, but you left me craving for more. And, alas, an additional $6.99 was not enough for me to return for seconds."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2014-08-16,3.0,"This is a chain restaurant that replaced the longtime Stark's Veranda restaurant. Given the location--on a strip of chain stores, across from Federal Plaza on Broadway--I'm surprised they didn't take over sooner.

I haven't sampled much of the food here, because not much of the food is vegan--although, of course, you can get a plain green salad in a pinch. Everything is pre-made (albeit freshly; one of their selling points is that they never offer day-old food, preferring instead to give it away to homeless shelters at the end of the business day)  so naturally there are no substitutions. 

I often go in for their coffee, because 1) they have decaf at all their locations, 2) it's organic and 3) it's fresh. 

(This location has a restroom!)"
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2015-04-17,5.0,"Always a great atmosphere, clean and with plenty of seating. The staff is so nice and the food is fresh and tasty. Their bread is just phenomenal.

This location has a nice open floorplan and coffee service is fast. Very nice to find in a busy part of town."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2012-10-14,3.0,"Decent place to hang, not enough outlets for the laptop crowd. Counter service is spotty & I've been ignored more than once.

Soups are very good. I really like the New England clam & the tomato.  Dude at the counter today didn't give me any bread or crackers. The food tends to be fresh and good, though.

There's a lot of the sandwich/soup/coffee places but this place is a cut above the rest."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2016-01-30,4.0,"The flatiron outpost of a place I pronounce in a typical NYC accent. Place is of french decent, presumably. Right across the street of Touro College. Pret has everything from soups , salads and pre packaged sandwiches. I have had several sandwiches like the tuna on rye and the butternut squash curry soup. There is something in there for everyone and ""its gone the same day"". Don't leave without treating yourself to a pint size Brownie Bite usually by the cashier. I love those. Damn you, SWEET TOOTH!!!!"
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2014-04-15,5.0,"As someone always on the run, Pret a Manger offers what New York is most known for, food on the run done right and prepared fresh daily. The service in particular by Abdul is top notch.

I would recommend this place to anyone who needs a quick sandwich, salad, snack, or in particular a croissant; these things are the best I've had in the city."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2012-03-10,4.0,"On my way to Home Depot, I stopped in although I already had my lunch about 15 minutes ago. 

There were super cute sandwich choices but I decided Tuna sandwich. I like Tuna sandwich. Multi-grain whole wheat bread was fresh, soft and a good texture with creamy tuna. I appreciated this consciously healthy and tasty sandwich. I felt not cheated and received a good Karma. 

Offering half sandwiches gives more flexible lunch choices. I just add a salad, soup or dessert to half sandwich and make your own combo and getting two different half sandwiches might work as well. 

I didn't get to try their interesting and healthy name drinks....

On the street window side, there are a narrow table facing to the window with a people watching-single sitting area."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2011-09-23,5.0,"There are a million places to grab a sandwich in the Flatiron District but somehow this is exactly what the neighborhood needed. 

Pret brings a more upscale feel with cheap prices for fresh, quality food. First off, the space is designed very well, it feels very open for a New York City sandwich place, and compared to other Pret's it's a pretty big one. There is plentiful seating upstairs and downstairs and it's not overran by the Flatiron lunch rush, there are usually a few open seats and the line at the cashier is never too long. 

When considering their food, everything is fresh and tasty like all the other Pret locations. I have never picked a bad sandwich or salad, although I do prefer the chicken salad with bacon (add a side of ranch for a $1 or so more). 

Big thumbs up for a nice Pret A Manger location in the neighborhood, I would definitely consider myself a regular already."
670,pret-a-manger-new-york-50,2014-08-01,4.0,"Despite it's deceptive French name, the fare (and system of display/purchase,) is pretty downright 'Marican... That said, the sandwiches I have had are fantastic, tho not quite as wonderful as you should expect for the price - by the time you grab chips and a drink you're over $10. 

The California club is my favorite - turkey, avocado and egg. I have been to a few and this one seemed to have fresher ingredients and was way less crowded. Thumbs-up. (And, no, it's not French...)"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-11-27,5.0,"We dropped in for a latte. What a pleasant surprise that we received a free cookie upon check in! I got the toffee oatmeal cookie and it was LITERALLY one of the best cookies I've ever had. The latte was great too. Not too strong but flavorful and not too sweet. Come for the coffee, stay for the cookies!"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-05-19,5.0,"This is a fantastic little coffee shop hidden away down a small flight of stairs. Inside there is not much room to sit and hang out, but there is a fantastic menu of coffee and espresso options and a little case of pastries. They normally run seasonal coffee specials, and right now it is the delicious cereal milk cappuccino. Their espresso is very smooth and subtle, which makes it a perfect accompaniment for a well made simple drink. 

I did try their toffee oatmeal walnut cookie and need to give it a shout out as well. It's small but worth every penny!"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-11-18,5.0,"Just tried their s'mores latte and omg it is amazing. The s'mores was so simple but tasty, and the drink was delicious. Presentation 10/10. Please keep this on the regular menu"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-03-05,5.0,"It's a small coffee shop with little seating, so it's a quick grab and go place for some great drinks and pastries. I ordered the Chai today and it was great! Usually Chai can be too milky and sweet, but this one had a nice kick of spice to it.

I also got a free check-in cookie. I would get it every time but definitely not good for me, even though the chocolate chip tastes amazing!"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-05-14,5.0,"We stayed nearby, with a plethora of amazing coffee options. However, we came here 3x because:

- earl grey latte: wow
- excellent espresso
- free cookie with check-in 

Pricing-wise, I was pleasantly surprised at how reasonable it was compared to SF or, heck, even Peet's."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-09-17,1.0,"This place is trash. The clientele and part of town can't be helped, but the management sucks and I heard they just let go of the best barista they had so there goes the excellent customer service so many people were writing about.

Honestly better just to go the extra block or so to the Ace Hotel, which has a coffee shop attached."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-09-17,2.0,"Overpriced, underwhelming cup of coffee. Overextracted. Can't complain about the pastries, but you can get them anywhere they're not ""Patent"" exclusives. 

Added 1 star bc barista with head tattoo was nice about it and offered me an americano instead when I complained about the drip coffee. The shot was very well extracted and tasted much better than the bitter drip that just left my tongue feeling dry and, uh yuck. If I'm paying that much for coffee, I get to be more critical. 

I won't return but at least that customer service experience was redeeming. If you find yourself in that neck of Manhattan: stick to the espresso, or go to literally any Starbucks. 

and don't get me started on the aesthetic of the place. I'm so fucking over it. No atmosphere, pure sanitized, generic instagram ""modernism."""
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-08-29,5.0,"I love this place!

I came here on a whim, expecting to just get a black coffee because I needed caffeine, but was really tempted by their coco matcha on the menu. No regrets, it was absolutely delicious.

Do you love coconut? What about matcha? Are you up for an iced drink? If so, look no further, the coco matcha is the drink for you!

Outside of their delicious coco matcha, the service was what really stood out about this place. The man working here when I went was incredibly helpful, friendly, and knowledgable.

I'd come back again while passing through the area and I recommend everyone reading this to check this place out!"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-03-29,3.0,"I came in last minute for the Cappy hour ($2 cappuccino at 10:30am - noon). I believe the barista should be more attentive - she charged me regular price for the cappuccino at first, since she was not aware of the discount hours. 

I was looking forward to choosing from pastries by pain d'avignon, but it seemed like the cafe didn't have any today. Blueberry muffin was pretty good, but otherwise there were sad looking pale pastries."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2020-01-26,4.0,"If I'm craving a ""treat drink"" -- not just a regular coffee -- I go out of my way to come here. I haven't found better specialty coffee drinks anywhere else in Manhattan, and that's saying a lot. The baristas are super cool. The s'mores hot chocolate, which you can turn into a latte for an upcharge, is possibly the most fun you can have with a hot drink without adding alcohol :) The toasted marshmallow is over the top in the best way! -1 star for two reasons: this place almost no seating for those hoping to chill out, and it's quite expensive, so not an everyday sort of deal."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-03-04,4.0,"I love this place, the coffee is great, the baristas have a cool edgy look and vibe, and the place itself is unique. 

Just -1 because seating is so limited (it really is a grab-and-go type place). 

FYI, I paid +$2 for CBD oil in my latte and didn't exactly feel any sort of difference. In case anyone is curious..."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-05-15,4.0,"Delicious and creamy, the macchiato with CBD oil gives you a calm alertness. Barista with the vegetable tattoos didn't disappoint."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-11-27,1.0,"Ordered their butternut squash soup.  It comes in a tiny 6 ounce cup, for which they charge a whopping $6.00. To top it off, their payment interface has a 20% tip by default and -clumsy me- I hit ok the second the barista swiveled the iPad to me to e-sign my receipt. 
Ended up paying $7.20 for the munchkin size cup of soup in the photo, not to mention it tasted like it had been stored in an old moldy antique trunk  overnight."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-01-23,5.0,"The little coffee shop that could. Opening today with stellar machines and sweet treats by Pain D'Avignon and cookies by the senior food editor of Bon Appetit magazine.The smell of the coffee here is intoxicating. Can't wait to stop by for my morning brew en route to my office and some sweet treats. Hot and cold brews abound. 
P.S. Tried the cookies- thin, crispy and amazing!! #Epiccookies"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-09-22,5.0,"I came here because the sign outside caught my eye. It said CBD coffee and since I love coffee. I just had to try it especially considering the sign said it has all of these positive health properties. 

I tried the CBD Cold Brew with Vanilla syrup as suggested by the cashier. It was tasty although I did not taste any vanilla it was definitely  herb tasting. But I enjoyed it this unique tasting drink. 

I will be back to try some  of there other drinks and pastries."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-03-27,4.0,"Cute tiny coffee shop, good drip coffee, ok croissants, oat milk at no extra charge. One star off (considered giving 2 stars off) for having the credit card machine default to a 20% tip. That's quite a tip for pouring someone a cup of coffee to go."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-09-17,5.0,"Overall: a great quick coffee alternative to Starbucks when you're on your way to work and need a caffeine jolt without sacrificing quality 

Coffee: The coffee here is top notch. They have three different blends each for a different purpose: espresso, drip and pour over. I've had espresso and drip and both blends are unique and flavorful. They change up the blends every so often so it's great to come back and see what they have. 

Service: honestly some of the friendliest staff I've met in a coffee shop. They're always eager to ask about your morning or compliment your outfit.

Other things: This is NOT the place to sit down and work on your next novel. They don't have WiFi and they only have a few bar stools. However, I love this place for its coffee and service. You won't be disappointed going here!"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-07-27,5.0,"Really helpful staff and management! I had the CBD lemonade and it's very good. I like that it is not very sweet or at all and I can add my sugar as desired. I also got a cold brew in a bottle to go that I can't wait to try and share with my friends. 
The cbd is great quality."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-09-19,1.0,"Update owners response is a bold face lie. 
You can easily fact check this in other reviews from people who aren't me. In fact just a few reviews down you can see where another customer mentioned that they just fired their best barista less than a month ago...  I stand by my review, the issue is the owners/management. 

Yelp removed my review the first time around because they claim it is not my experience (great job yelp- great job straight white guys). When in reality the owner is embarrassed by my bad review.  I am a queer woman and from my point of view from my experience trying out Patent Coffee I would not go again. I felt they were rude to me based on my obvious queerness  as they seemed perfectly nice to the straight lady before me (one of the cis gendered Ryan's or whatever). I also have worked as a barista in my younger years and can tell you first hand their espresso is over extracted. Here is my original review: The management/owners as well as the customer base are extremely homophobic/queerphobic here. Hostile environment. It's NYC you can get a great cup of coffee/espresso anywhere. Don't spend your hard earned money here."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-01-02,5.0,"I've been here quite a few times and have had different baristas. I enjoy this spot. They offer CBD drinks. I always get milk alternatives. I've seen a woman bring her dog before. They have bottle CBD drinks too. Their seasonal s'mores drink sounded good, but I was scared of the sweetness..."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2020-01-10,1.0,"This coffee shop automatically adds a tip. Not cool. Unremarkable baked goods do not make up for this behavior. If the location were not in the middle of a long block, not sure how they would have customers."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-09-17,1.0,"As a third-wave coffee connoisseur, I was excited to explore NYC's offerings this weekend. I worked at a cafe for two years and am always looking to see how other places run their business. Not too excited about what I found at Patent. I think the owner or manager Ryan took my order and was kind of rude. Totally another third wave coffee Brad/Chad. How groundbreaking. This place has the bland aesthetic of a bunch of MBAs opening up a millennial cafe.  The light is bad. The espresso is super expensive and over-extracted. Will stick to Blue Bottle."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-11-18,5.0,"This is a nice casual spot to grab a quick coffee if you're in chelsea. I was immediately intrigued since the sign outside advertised CBD infused drinks. I ended up trying a CBD coffee - my first experience! And it tasted just like a good coffee (but maybe extra relaxing!). Our barista was really really nice and I felt very welcomed. The place itself is really tiny, but there are a few bar stools in the corner in case you want to stick it out for a few minutes. The cool part of this place is at night it becomes the entrance to Patent Pending which is a speakeasy bar hidden behind the coffee shop. Definitely stop by if you're in the area!"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-12-17,5.0,Just had latte with oat milk and oatmeal / toffee / pecan cookie and both were excellent.
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-04-25,4.0,"It's a really cool cafe! It offers good latte, coffee and various healthy drinks and sweets options. Interior was cute and staff was very nice. However the seatings are pretty limited - only a few. Cookies were good but not as much as I expected from the other reviews. I may come back to get coffee if I'm around."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-03-06,4.0,"The cutest coffee shop with great service, plentiful options and a fun vintage modern vibe. Great commuter stop for your pick-me-up coffee in the AM. Unfortunately, they only have oat milk as a Lactose free option. It has a strong grainy taste and is not enjoyable."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-10-14,3.0,"I recently visited Patent coffee at the suggestion of my girl. I tried the CBD Arnold Palmer and had a Yelp check-in offer for a free cookie. That cookie was delicious! I tried the chocolate chip.  I'm not usually big on chocolate chip, but it was really good. I wanted to try the CBD coffee, but the only non dairy alternative is oat milk which is strange as a solitary choice and I'm just not into it. So I settled for the Arnold Palmer which was ok. I was looking for the herbaceous flavor that usually comes with CBD products and I missed it. I also didn't feel any if the effects of the CBD after drinking it. I would try the coffee next time if I'm in the area, and definitely grab a cookie."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-06-22,4.0,Everyone that worked here was super friendly and helpful! They had a few interesting coffee combinations and the classics. I would go back but since the location is small it's more a of a grab and go spot.
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-11-04,5.0,"Adorable place- I had a lovely lavender latte and it was perfectly made. 
Good spot to catch up with a friend or work on your novel-- plenty of tables and outlets."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-06-05,5.0,I love coming here for a quick coffee run. The staff is so friendly and the drinks are refreshing.  The coconut matcha is delicious!
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-04-13,5.0,"We just moved into an office upstairs from this coffee shop and it has quickly become what I look forward to most about going to work. Their cookies are HEAT no Dwayne Wade and CAPPY HOUR may be the best deal on a premium Cappuccino in all of the NYC area.

They also offer healthy milk alternatives such as oat milk for all the vegans out there.

Definitely take a JOURNEY to this coffee shop!!"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-04-13,5.0,"Stop what you're doing and grab the most delicious cookies in all of flat iron. While you're at it enjoy some of the neighborhoods best coffee as well. I personally love to stop by for Cappy Hour from 10:30am-12:30pm during the week. Honorable mention goes to the incredible staff who are friendly and very knowledgeable (Emily and Journey).

Also, their overnight oats game is on point! Glad to call this place my neighbor and a refuge from my office during the day. 

Thank you!"
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-01-21,2.0,I ordered a latte and it had way too much milk and ice. I barely tasted the coffee. Disappointed- don't think I'll come back here.
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2019-09-04,5.0,"I love it here! Their coffee is really good. They have oat milk, which is my favorite kind of milk for coffee. They have nice and friendly staff."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-01-25,5.0,Cute little coffee shop in Chelsea with the friendliest people in NYC working there. Coffee tasted fresh and was very clean inside!
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-12-06,5.0,This place is hard to miss because it is in a small basement but I am very happy I discovered it. The baristas working here are very passionate about their coffee and the shop is absolutely beautiful. You can tell by the grinder and machine that they have that they are taking their business serious. They also have nice pastries and are very friendly.
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-06-20,4.0,"Awesome, clean, and local coffee shop. Very little inside seating, but it's complemented with Madison Square Park so close. I have been getting the charcoal lemonade off of the new 2018 summer menu. It is delicious and refreshing. The chocolate chip cookies are large and have a unique, delicious taste. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of the steep prices."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-02-13,5.0,Such a quaint adorable space. Love the environment and offerings. I got a cappuccino. The coffee is very tasty and the barista said they use a small boutique roastery in Brooklyn. I also had their overnight oats. Will definitely be making this a regular spot and recommend it to anyone who needs a quick and juicy cuppa joe.
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-12-15,1.0,"Pretty pretentious spot. Payment system set to add a 20 percent tip to your purchase unless you go out of your way to turn it off. Im sure lots of people dont even realize and end up accidentally tipping. Then, for a $6.50 cold brew w cbd, there are just a few drops of cbd, a cup full of ice and a coffee not filled to the top. 

In response to management: so youre admitting you add a 20 perfect tip to all purchases unless the buyer realizes it and turns it off? We are not discussing the benefits of tipping. I am complaining that you sneak it in as a default. 
That is completely unethical. 
If you're charging what you charge for coffee, pay your staff a living wage. You shouldnt be depending on sneakily added tips to survive. 
Also, for $6.50 give me a full cup of iced coffee, not ice and a little coffee. I wasn't complaining about the amt of cbd."
671,patent-coffee-new-york,2018-05-31,4.0,"CAPPY HOUR! 
Y'all this cafe has $2 cappuccinos from like 10:30-12:30 PM, and they're sooo good! Make sure to get their chocolate chip cookies while you're at it. Heaven is that."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2020-03-10,4.0,"I liked that the space was spacious with yummy bagel smells and there was no crazy wait on a weekday morning. They didn't scoff at my request to toast the bagel, and they didn't skimp on the cream cheese shmear.

To be honest, when I was eating my toasted egg bagel with plain cream cheese shmear in the shop, it seemed a little ho hum to me. It tasted good but not special.

Good thing I saved half of my bagel because when i ate it cold a few hours later - good lord! It was chewy, slightly sweet, and everything I hoped a New York bagel would be. Not sure why I couldn't perceive the one-of-a-kindness of a Browns egg bagel when I was sitting in the shop.

My companions ordered more elaborate bagel sandwiches with bacon and smoked salmon - all their bagels looks great."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-12-27,5.0,"You had me at EGG EVERYTHING BAGEL!  OMG so delicious!  

My wife loves the gluten free bagel here!

I also had the Brown's omlett that include d a latke."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-12-02,3.0,"Stopped in to have a coffee break and snacks between places and to fuel a walk while resting from the other trek. Plus, I had never had matzo ball soup and compatriot said I must try it before I leave the area. 

So, I had a bowl of the matzo soup. And a bialy. Mostly because the name of it sounded nifty and I had never had one before. The matzo soup... was plain. I was hoping for more of a richness to come from the broth to counterbalance the slices of matzo, but that didn't happen so I salted til it felt right. The bialy was pretty tasty though. I just had it plain with some butter and it worked pretty well. Flat bagel for the win.

Doesn't wow you, but the older guy behind the counter helped out with any questions I had and gave some character to the whole experience."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-12-28,5.0,"This place is PACKED so come here with the expectation that you might be waiting a hot minute for seating. The take out counter is much quicker but space is limited to be read to elbow through a crowd or two. The bagels, however, are worth it. My family stopped for a quick half dozen and they were still warm -- no toasting required. We huddled and ate them in the corner, which was maybe not ideal but it was 28 degrees outside. Long story short, I'll be back next time I'm in Manhattan!"
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-04-09,4.0,"We were on a ravenous hunt for breakfast at about 10 am and everywhere had a long wait!  We had initially come here to eat at Friedman's which is attached, but again, long wait. So we decided just to grab some bagels and coffee and eat in the park. Turns out, it was a great decision. The rest of the menu looked good, judging by the plates on other tables, which I eyed enviously while we waited in for bagels. But the line moved very quickly and before I knew it I was panic ordering a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on an egg bagel. After paying it was ready very quickly and off we went to the park to enjoy. It was hot, delicious, and really hit the spot.

I would have posted a picture of the sandwich, but honestly, I dug in straight away before even thinking about it. Next time."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-11-17,2.0,"Glad I have some time to kill before my convention. Decided to get a bagel. The inside is really nice! But let's take a look at my everything bagel toasted with butter. It's burnt. Still eating it cause it was paid for, I wont be back if I'm in Manhattan."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2020-03-01,3.0,Good bagels and spread. Not as many options for spreads as other places. We had a plain bagel with scallion & lox cream cheese and an everything bagel w/jalapeno cheddar cream cheese. There are tables inside but they seemed to belong to the full service restaurant that is connected and were all full with waitstaff.
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2020-01-15,5.0,"The best bagels in New York City! Delicious and fresh bagels without too much sugar. Amazing tuna salad in particular, but the chicken salad is very good, too. The cream cheese selection is great. My favorite is the lox spread. As for the space, it's large with comfortable seating and clean bathrooms. The employees are super friendly. This is a place you MUST visit when you go to NYC!"
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-09-11,4.0,"If they had Spinach, they would of gotten 5 stars.

Love the customer service. Very busy place to eat but there's -just- enough room for you to spend some time and enjoy your meal. 

I ordered a multigrain bagel with egg whites and turkey bacon. I also got iced coffee and a fruit salad.

Yummy 
Delicious 
Meal"
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-12-25,3.0,"Very crowded location and overpriced for a bagel with a spread. The bagel itself was under $2; however adding a spread brought up the price to be over $6. For the price and the wait, this bagel location does not standout amongst the rest."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-08-03,3.0,"Standard bagels. Appreciate they have flat bagels. Delivery and packaging decent.

$6.25 egg salad 1/4 lb."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-06-23,5.0,"Came after lunch time on a Sunday, and the sit down portion of the restaurant was really busy still, but service to get a bagel sandwich to go was really fast!! The lox was greattttt. Ill definitely be making weekly visits here!!! Ordering was kind of confusing bc you don't order at the cash registers until after you get your bagel from the back of the restaurant, but otherwise I don't have much to say! A really solid lox bagel"
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2020-01-23,2.0,Had omlette with brisket pastrami n other meat. Very dry and lots of fat. Eggs dry.. $15 omlette NOT worth it.
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2020-03-14,5.0,"Brown Bagels is my go-to bagel place in NYC! While the food is great, it is not amazing compared to literally thousands of other shops around the city. The place is also clean, fast, but seatings might be a bit challenging during weekend brunch hours. However, the service Brown Bagels offers is top-notch. I was genuinely surprised at the kindness of the people behind the counter. My husband has dairy allergy and we were helped by Alberto. The first time we visited Brown Bagels, he kindly adhered to our request for changing gloves before making my husband's bagel and insured the bagel was prepared on the clean, dairy-free surface. The second time we visited, which was days later, we were touched to be recognized by Alberto right away, and he immediately changed to new gloves without our request. We will definitely be back whenever we are in the city!"
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-09-23,4.0,"This was a great bagel spot with other deli options as well, like egg and chicken salads and matzo ball soup. I got the nova salmon bagel sandwich and it was a good ratio of schmear to other toppings. The two I was with got a cinnamon and an everything bagel with butter and both said they were good too. The iced coffee I got was pretty bitter and a little watery, which is the reason for the loss of a star. The line went so fast and the food was really good though, so would recommend!"
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-09-29,5.0,Go here. Eat. Repeat. Again and again. Best lox already I've ever had. Huge menu too.
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-04-18,3.0,"No trip to NY is complete without having bagels. Found this place after reading the reviews but somehow were so disappointed.  Tried their everything bagel and Brooklyn Bialy. Both of them were hard. glad we had ordered coffee which was also just ok. Menu has a selection of bagels, bagel flats, sandwiches, breakfast platters. Have tasted better in NY."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2020-03-04,5.0,The bagel and banana walnut muffin were very tasty. Don't know why they have bad review.
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-09-22,1.0,"I never write reviews but DAMB this place sucked. If you wanna go somewhere that the staff does not care or want to help you WHATSOEVER, this is the place!! They told my boyfriend they were unable to toast his bagel but for some reason mine was completely fine to toast...um, okay? woman at the checkout counter was SASSY AS HELL when I asked if they had hot sauce, okay chill
Girl.  when my bagel did come, is was cut in half like most bagels are, but one side was almost paper thin and the other was basically a full bagel. Zero flavor. Staff was rude as hell. Oh and to top it off, I ordered a everything and they gave me poppyseed, lovely."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-10-01,5.0,Yummy bagels! Multigrain and blueberry are my favorite. I frequently get the #2 breakfast sandwich! The lunch sandwiches are yummy as well!! Perfect spot if you are traveling too. Quick and easy but options to sit as well.
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-11-09,3.0,Can be tough to maneuver ordering and pick up due to the seating for Friedman's but the bagels are food and so are the breakfast sandwiches!
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2020-03-03,2.0,"I'm visiting from California and was excited to try a N.Y. bagel spot by our hotel. We got there around 2:45, 15 minutes before they apparently closed. The gal working was rude and told us to go down the line to order and clearly irritated, mentioned they were getting ready to close. Then she did a hard motion for us to leave. 

I went down the line to where the prep chefs were to see what they still had. They were nice and apologized for not having everything which is to be expected since they were closing soon.

Meanwhile, my boyfriend asked her for recommendations.m to make it quick. She gave him a rushed list of options with her back towards him. 

Even though we are visiting and will not return, there are other locals that seem to have had a bad experience here with rude service. I can bet they will go out of their way or to return.

Each bad experience comes with a lifetime customer cost per loss, including the people in their network they report to. My company helps business owners fix this exact problem at QSRs so we know this problem well. 

Poor customer service literally costs you money. It is quantifiable. Is it worth it? Sit down and do the math. 

Every half star on Yelp = 12% of your revenue. Your careless employees are taking food out of your families' mouth."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2020-02-22,3.0,"Okay bagels. Doesn't compare to classic, NY bagels. I feel like I could get these bagels anywhere."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-02-12,5.0,I love Browns Bagels! I always get a sesame bagel with either scallion cream cheese or the bacon herbed cream cheese. They are friendly and let my friend and I sit at a table in the bagel part of the restaurant (a lot of the tables are used by Friedman's as well). The bagels are fresh and fluffy and delicious.
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-11-08,5.0,Got to Friedman's to early so decided to try this connected bagel store. Very nice and clean good gluten free selection for my wife. My sandwich was cooked perfect.
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-02-04,5.0,"This place was around the corner from our hotel.  I wish we had eaten here more (but there's so much food to try in NYC!)

We really liked the food. 
Egg and tomato sandwich on everything bagel- this was amazing.  I could eat this everyday!
Cinnamon raisin bagel with butter - fine
spinach knish- doesn't have cheese, which is nice!!! My husband really liked it."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2018-08-18,5.0,"I'm obsessed with this place. Hands down the best bagel I've ever had. They have quite a large selection of bagels and schmears. Last week they were advertising french toast, jalapeño and veggie bagels as new additions! Although their blueberry bagel is perfection this is truly the place to experiment different combinations!

It gets a little wild in the morning during rush hour but the staff is pretty attentive and the lines generally move quick enough that I'm not late to work."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-08-04,4.0,"First time at Browns Bagels and it really hit the spot!  My friends and I ordered the breakfast sandwich #1: whole wheat everything bagel with roasted tomatoes, eggs, and gruyere (5/5, delicious tomatoes); gluten free bagel with egg salad (5/5); and the latkes with an everything bagel and plain cream cheese (5/5). The place gets a 4/5 because their iced tea and iced coffee were not good. There's a Starbucks down the block, I recommend going there for drinks instead. Overall, great food at Browns!"
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2018-08-03,4.0,"Ordered some bagels and shmear from here for a work event. I had placed the order a couple of weeks in advance and they were ready right on time when I came in to pick them up. 

I ordered and assortment of bagels and a couple different types of cream cheese. I didn't try the berry cream cheese but it was a super bright pink that almost looked nonedible. The bagels themselves were chewy and tasty. NYC definitely knows how to do good bagels. And the scallion cream cheese was great and had fresh scallions in it. That was a nice touch. 

They also had rainbow cookies on display when I came to pick up the bagels and they were too tempting not to order as well. They were good though a touch too sweet for my taste.

When I was considering options, Browns was much more reasonable as far as prices go than Friedman's, which is right next door. Overall a good experience. Would return if I lived in the city."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2018-05-01,4.0,"Oh, great Googamooga, can't you hear me talking to you.
Just a ball of confusion.
(The Temptations -Ball of Confusion) 

Yeah, confusion is the word.  Friedman's and Browns Bagels share the same address, they are next door to each other and share a common space, they are kind of/sort of two separate places, but they really aren't. Owned by the same owner, a lot of the characteristics of each kind of blends over into the other.

We walked into Friedman's for breakfast, and since there was a wait, they asked us to walk into Browns and wait in their space. When they called our name, we walked back to the hostess at Friedman's, and she led us to our seats in Browns! Confused yet??

Basically, Friedman's is more of a formal restaurant where you can order entrée- like food from a server. Browns is a self-service bagel and cream cheese sandwich shop/bakery where a lot of the customers take their food to go.

But to carry on the confusion theme, we observed this -customers waiting for a table at Friedman's were seated at tables in Browns. And customers who, say ordered a bagel and cream cheese at Browns also sit at the empty tables at Browns, the same tables that customers at Friedman's are waiting for.

The whole system seemed to me to land somewhere between confusing and ridiculous.

So anyway, there we were seated at a table in the Browns half of the dining room. The menu is for Friedman's food only, so if you wanted a bagel breakfast sandwich, you couldn't order it from your server. 

Seriously, you had to get up from your table, wait on line at Browns, and order the food in a cafeteria line. I sh*t you not.    

I ordered a breakfast cobb salad from the Friedman's menu ($17) and it was a big bowl of diced bacon, blue cheese, two poached eggs, diced chicken, sliced tomatoes, sliced avocado, and greens. It was huge portion and I couldn't finish it. My brother-in-law also ordered from the Friedman's menu and went for a Nova Benny with poached eggs, potato pancake, smoked salmon, and Hollandaise ($17).

My wife just wanted a bagel with lox and cream cheese, but since it wasn't offered on the Friedman's menu, she had to leave the table, walk up to the Browns Bagel counter, order it, and bring it to our table.  

Has your mind been blown yet?? Hey--at least now you know."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-06-01,4.0,"The bagel was nice and chewy. I got a bacon, egg and cheese on mine. Also got one with some good quality cream cheese. If you are a gluten free eater, they have GF bagels. Good amount of seating to enjoy your breakfast. Fresh juices. Even flat bagels for those calorie counters. Over all service and pricing are great! Would recommend to anyone."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2018-05-10,4.0,"I went here last weekend on a day trip to NYC. I really enjoyed the bagels! It was definitely crowded, but it was NYC on a Saturday morning so what can you expect? 

I got a blueberry bagel with regular cream cheese and it was good. My sister got a regular bagel with berry cream cheese and the cream cheese was delicious! I wished we could have bought some of that to take home.

My only real complaint is that the staff did not seem friendly. That may have been because of how busy they were, but it definitely fit into that stereotypical New Yorker vibe. Since we were tourists, we weren't sure if we left our trash on the table or not (we didn't see any trash cans). We tried to flag down several staff members to ask but were unable to. It was too busy and the tables too close together to walk around and find someone. Eventually, a man came to us and asked to take our trash, so all is well I suppose. 

Overall, a good experience and I would go back next time I'm in town."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-12-12,1.0,"Terrible bagel.  Never asked for my bagel to be toasted.  When I got the bagel it looked like it was toasted a few minutes ago to perk the bagel up from being stale. It was cold but toasted.  Good bagels should never have to be toasted.  This is just a terrible bagel. What else can i say?? I understand that sometime you don't catch a fresh batch especially if you eat breakfast around 9am which for a bakery is late, but this was just a terrible bagel.."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2020-02-07,4.0,I came here my second time coming to NY and i got a blueberry bagel with plain cream cheese. It was really good but a little too much cream cheese (never thought i'd say that). I also got a croissant to go and that ish was SO GOOD. Just what i needed to hit the spot!
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2018-11-29,4.0,"Conveniently located between our regular hotel (Hampton Inn) and Penn Station. Fantastic bagels that make the phrase ""the bagels in NYC are better than anywhere else"" a true statement. Most mornings when we're in town, we get the mini-sesame bagels with cream cheese or peanut butter. That and a large cup of their delicious coffee makes our train ride out to Jersey so much more tolerable. 

Our last day in town always involves picking up as many bagels as we have room for in the luggage so we can enjoy NYC bagels in Texas for at least a week. 

If you get there between 7:30 - 9 am, it's going to be busy, cramped and kind of confusing but tough it out--it's worth it. The whole Friedman's connection is interesting and weird and we just sort of avoid it altogether.  No need to worry about it as long as we get our Browns bagels."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-04-19,4.0,"Came here after leaving penn station and we were starving. Service was super quick and the gluten free bagel was really good. BF got the blueberry bagel and liked that as well.

Was only a little disappointed because they use the same bagels I can get at home... the brand is The Greater Knead if anyone's lookin for them. But the garlic cream cheese was delicious and would def go again if we are in a crunch to make it to the train or something."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-10-21,2.0,The egg and bacon sandwiches are very expensive. 7 bucks. Wow. It's only eggs and bacon. Little too pricey for me. The people in there are nice tho. But prices are way too high for this location.
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2020-02-24,1.0,I came  from Chicago a 28 years in the serving industry they wouldn't make me a bagel which I had a taste for the guys where rude and the girl replied we don't have bagels nah dah you put them in the back . Well guess what you lost my business and I went else where where there was more selections and better
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-01-24,4.0,"Very good deli and bagel place. I went during lunch around 12:30 and it was very crowded but the line moved quick. Walked towards the back of the restaurant to get in line to order. 

I ordered a bagel with chicken salad and it was soo good! Comes toasted(if preferred) with LTO and a WHOLE pickle. Around $10 for a delicious and filling lunch."
672,browns-bagels-new-york,2019-09-20,1.0,"absolutely awful experience. I call after waiting an hour and 45 min for nothing to show to be told that my order was never received, but then it was found in seamless corporate and the rude lady on the phone told me I ordered on seamless corporate, when Iknow where the hell I ordered from. She says they'll send out my order now. I check in 45 mins later and nothing is in process! Grubhub had to cancel my order. This place is trash. I would give it a 0 if I could."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2020-02-09,5.0,"Difficult to find this location but once you realize it's within a food court, it's easy to get to. I've gone several times and every time they have been efficient in getting my drink to me no matter how busy. 

The actual drinks are always made well and you can customize them as you choose. My personal favorite is the winter melon milk tea with bubbles! The boba here is my favorite, it's always chewy and never mealy or tough. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend trying Kung Fu tea, even if it's one of the other locations."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2020-03-08,1.0,"I ordered taro milk tea this afternoon and found hair in it... howwww..... ughhh not a pleasant experience at all.

I do like their bubble tea, but make sure you order 50% for the sugar level, otherwise it is going to be extremely sweet."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-12-15,5.0,"Review #345 - 2019

After our long walk inside Macy's, I got thirsty and decided that I wanted to grab a few drinks at my favorite tea shop so I Yelped the nearest location and this one happened to be the closest in walking distance.

We made our walk over through the wind and rain, just so I can satisfy my craving!

We showed up at around 12:45 PM on Tuesday, December 10th, and the place was pretty empty, most likely due to the rain.  I had a really hard time finding it because I was looking for a stand alone shop, but it was inside a food court.

Since I didn't want to walk back again later, I decided to just order two of the longan jujube drink for myself and two of the kung fu milktea for my daughter.

Our drinks were made exactly the way we liked them!

The owner was very nice and accommodating!

He tried his best to pack the drinks up so that we could transport them back safely to our hotel room, since I didn't have a free hand while pushing the stroller.

The location is probably one of the least attractive Kung Fu Tea that I've been to, but service more than makes up for it."

Especially when it's hot (65F) in the middle of winter."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2020-03-15,5.0,"Stopped here after an appointment uptown with a craving for boba. Of all the chain spots in NYC, I find Kung Fu delivers really consistently on flavor and quality across locations. There's a few other spots around, but the quality and quick service here have me coming back when I'm in the neighborhood. Keep it up, guys!"
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-09-02,5.0,"I love KFT, especially the Lemon Black Tea. So much so that I often start rapping while sipping. I call it Rasping, or Srirapcha.

Like Britney and Tinache, I made you OOH
And now I'll introduce you to something NEW
I'll give you yummy Boba to CHEW
That defines a five-star REVIEW

Lemon Black Tea's what I'll give to YOU
It has a lot to LIVE UP TO
But I know you'll share my POINT OF VIEW
Like the 90's web you'll scream YAHOO

Palestine will hear you louder then NETENYAHU
Who's big on Google but not on YAHOO
Crap I just double-used YAHOO
Oh well, Altavista's dead, Excite TOO

And no, my income tax returns aren't TRUE
But like Joey said, that point is MOO
So before we get audited by internal REVENUE
Let's go and get Boba from KUNG FU!

(And let me know please when you're period's DUE)

WHAT

This Kung Fu tea is inside the Korean market in the heart of Manhattan's amazing Koreatown, and I could make a whole Korea out of trying everything on this amazing street. I wish it opened until later like a lot of the Koreatown stuff does though.

Service can be okay or can be iffy, but a couple of the employees are really nice and friendly. The LBT was okay, but I've had better KFT drinks from other locations. It was a little on the watery side but still I'm really glad to have it in here, and because of how friendly the woman working here was, I can just about give it 5 stars,

So if you think your life is now over
And your gf won't let you disrobe her
And you ask what I think
Just come get a drink
Kung Fu's Lemon Black Tea with Boba!"
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-08-30,5.0,"They have variety of teas and also can give the levels of sugar you need in your drink .
The minimum for using the credit card is $6 for this location . There are many shops here and there is a sitting area ."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-03-10,3.0,"Was never a huge fan of Kung Fu Tea's bubble tea mainly because their teas are incredibly powdery tasting and overly sweet. This particular one is located inside Food Gallery and they're on the right hand side. 

Went in today ordering a Taro Slush, the girl at the counter was pretty blunt but whatever. It was a busy Sunday and I totally feel for her, would rather be home than working. 

Anyway my main issue is the tea itself. Just way too sugary and powdery, not mixed very well or enough. I hope to return to try and modify my drink to have less sugar since they give you that option. Not sure how much they put when you say regular but it seems like a lot. 

Vivi's Bubble Tea is better in my opinion but Kung Fu Tea was closer at that point for me so I went. I recommend trying them out though! They're not my preference but I am always willing to return to try something new."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-09-03,2.0,"I was really disappointed with this location. I ordered the honey oolong milk tea. First, I knew they didn't accept card under $10 but I had a reward that I wanted to use but couldn't use because I had to purchase $10 worth of stuff for 1 free drink. It didn't make any sense. The people working there were very nice and they explained that the credit card fees are too high and it's expensive to be in midtown. However, there were several people who left the line because they didn't have the minimum on card. They're losing business that way. I ended up ordering a drink and got it 70% sugar but it was still super sweet. I don't know how I'll end up using my reward. Probably will end up at a different bubble tea establishment with rewards/ with no card minimum."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-07-31,4.0,"This Kung Fu Tea spot is not the best but definitely not the worst. It's located in Gallery 32 so it's expected to be crowded and chaotic most of the time, but for the amount of usual traffic, their speed is pretty quick. Most times they're faster than Gong Cha across the street, even when the line is about the same. The line here is confusing because it overlaps with the path to the stairs and restaurants in the back, and there's been many times where employees tell us to line up in directions different than my last visit. It seems like they installed some footprint stickers leading up to the register though, so maybe that's been helping with crowd control. There's also an older man that works the register sometimes and he's always SO cheery and polite, and he always makes my day a bit better.

In terms of taste, KFT's milk teas are not my personal favorite, but they also don't disappoint. The pearls also feel a bit rubbery. The biggest deterring factor for me though is their $6 card minimum, so most times I go to Gong Cha instead."

I do like their flavor combinations. They have lots of unique options that most places don't offer."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-08-20,3.0,KF Tea is a classic place with classic boba options. It's probably one of the better priced boba shops (not as pricey) but just as good! This one is located inside Gallery 32 (a large 3 floor area in ktown with a bunch of different eats inside). There always seems to be a super long line for KF but they're very efficient so you won't be in line for long. My friend and I were really craving slushie/snow drinks so we got a mango snow with aloe and strawberry milk snow with boba. Both were delicious and hit the spot!
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-07-18,4.0,"I really liked the bbt I got.  The brown sugar was flavourful, the boba was chewy and the milk top added a nice bit of salt to the sweet drink.  I don't recall whether the tea was particularly flavourful, however.  I would definitely go back!"
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-12-08,5.0,"By far the best most consistent boba chain in NY.  Not just this store, but there's consistency in their drinks whichever location you go.
It's all about the bubble when it comes to my boba drink.  No bells and whistles needed.  Their bubbles are always perfect in texture with that slight bit of chewiness and nicely flavored,  if that makes any sense.  I've tried my share of other boba shops and still do, but Kung fu Tea has me coming back. They have my loyalty when it comes to my weekly boba dose needs."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2018-10-07,5.0,"I'm addicted to this Kung Fu Tea and there are about 20 of them in NYC. This one's located in the Food Gallery 32, which is an Asian food hall with lots of vendors in the middle of Korea Town. Service is super quick here. Wait time is about 2 minutes after ordering.

I was looking forward to the mini bubz in my tea but they didn't have any today! Mini bubz = mini boba. I ordered the Pomelo Tea (trying something different) but didn't realize how good girlfriend's Strawberry Lemon Green Tea was. She always orders something better than mine. Couldn't stop sipping hers so I had to give my Pomelo Tea away for free and get my own Strawberry Lemon.

What I like about both teas is that they have real fruit shavings on the bottom along with the boba. Tastes healthy."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2020-03-09,1.0,I bought passion fruit green tea here today and it tasted like crap the green tea doesn't taste fresh I've had better Kung Fu tea passion fruit green tea at East 23st their tea is a lot more fresh then the shitty made tea here the worst tea I ever had from Kung Fu tea it will be my last time coming here.
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-04-27,4.0,"Since they ran out of Thai milk tea, I tried the rosehip milk tea for the 1st time. The cashier told me it was berry flavored. I got it with fig jelly. I tried to get it with no sugar but I was informed that it already contains sugar. It was really good, very berry but too sweet imo. The cashier was informative & the service is good."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-09-25,3.0,"Wasn't the best location on a Friday night for bubble tea but KFT never really seems to fail me. Gets the job done. Got the taro boba and it was delicious. Felt super hectic and not very orderly but like I said, always a fan of KFT, even in the midst of KTown."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2020-02-16,1.0,"I usually go to the Stonybrook location but I tried this location because I was getting food at the food court. I ordered the taro because I love the taste and also wanted something without caffeine because I'm expecting. They ended up making what I realized was an earl grey tea and tried to convince me that it was taro but without the color. Shameful and I definitely won't be back, I'll stick to Gong cha it's right across the street."
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-08-23,4.0,"I visit this Kung Fu Tea frequently (maybe a bit too much), not only because I love their drinks, but their service is awesome. The staff are friendly and very speedy! Long lines are expected to clear rather quickly, so do not be afraid to stay on the line during lunch hours. My only comment is the prices at this location are higher than usual and they do not let you use your app to pay (and earn points) unless your purchase is $6 or more. I get it, rent is higher, but 99% of the drinks on the menu are $5+, so it only forces you to buy more than 1 drink to use your app. Discourages me from even going sometimes, but their drinks are so damn good!"

Food: This are my favorite flavors of bubble milk tea here. TARO: as always it is always good! THAI MILK TEA: omg this is soo good, very milky, usually I add bubble tea and pudding. COCOA CREAM WOW: this is a recent addition, and damn its soo good, so milky and chocolatey! 

Price rating: 5 out of 10. Cheap and its good!

I always go here when I am in Koreatown! All the flavors are good! I have 3 favorites now but Ill try all of them!"
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-09-02,1.0,"The Kung fu tea that's located in Food Gallery 32 is the worst. They are the only ones that won't let you get one (1) drink WITH there app. What's the point in having the app if I need cash for one drink. And why would I buy more then one for just me. Thou I do love the bubble teas and they have a great selection. Just  stay away from this location. 
I have bin to many other locations and they usually have a $5 limit if you are using the app or a card. Which is a lot more reasonable, considering you can just get a large drink and totally get away with one drink and using the app. Also other locations also have food/ snack options too, but not this one location that makes you pay for one drink no matter what size you get. FYI, If you're at Food Gallery 32 you can get a soft drink next door for less with your card."

Came here 2x during my trip. Each time the line had maybe 3-4 people but moved very fast and got my drink within 5 mins. Not bad at all. The entire gallery is very busy with people, but don't be discouraged. 

My #1 drink: Kung Fu Milk tea with half sugar, light ice, and boba. Tasted just like the ones I have in ATL. Boba is like always perfect. I swear -- KFT must have a secret recipe for how to make/cook the boba. 

Also - I think it was a 3 min walk from a station entrance."

I had the Black Tea, Honey Tea Cap and didn't exactly know what I was getting but let me tell you... it was DELICIOUS! I don't know how they make the frothy cap of sweet and salty milk.. I shamelessly licked my cup clean after finishing the tea and bubbles.

The service is quick so don't let a line scare you away. They do charge you 50 cents if you only buy one tea and are paying with a card, so bring cash or just buy two drinks! 

Great place in one of my favorite parts of town. Just a short walk away from the Empire State Building and the subway."

The people here are very friendly though.

Despite the long line to order, they make the drinks quickly and the cashier/order taker is always so friendly and greets you with a smile. Bring cash if you're ordering one drink, otherwise they take card for two or more drinks. Don't be daunted by the line. Drinks are consistently delicious and they work quickly. 

Highly recommend!"

673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2019-05-21,3.0,Its very crowded place because its located inside a crowded shopping center where there re food restaurants surrounded. They are rushed because of the long line. The tea is same as any other kungfu tea. I like the milk cap tea because it s different and it gives you a different experience to drink boba tea.
673,kung-fu-tea-new-york-18,2018-04-13,3.0,"If your city has plenty of bubble tea places, don't bother trying it here, unless you are a big fan of bubble tea or are addicted to it and need it daily. Otherwise just skip it.

I find the bubble milk tea is normal. Nothing special. I asked for just milk tea but somehow the guy heard I wanted pearls and added them. Never mind.

Bring cash as card is only accepted if you are ordering two drinks or more. 

The signage for placing order and collecting order is non-existent. Ask around. Don't just stand there queuing, you might be at the wrong line. There is no ticket number or name to be called out. So pay attention otherwise your drink might get lost in the confusion, especially if there are many people waiting."

There was a line of people waiting to get tea, and so I thought that perhaps I better give it a try. When I got to the front to place my order, the server was very helpful because I wasn't sure what to order. I ended up ordering a simple hot Tallow milk tea and let me tell you, it is my new addiction! I have never tasted anything so good. It is just the right amount of sweet to satisfy every drinker.

I can't wait to go back and try their bubble tea, as well as several other options that they have for winter teas both hot and cold. 

The service was polite and quick, and I would highly recommend that if you find yourself at Times Square, that you head on over to Kung Fu tea and grab yourself something!  I'm pretty sure that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"

I decided to order Boba here because I saw they made strawberry milk slush! I thought the flavor was pretty unique, so I decided to give it a go. 

The flavor was okay. It wasn't as strawberry as I wanted it to be. It tasted like Milka (you know that Korean drink?). The slush also was too ice-y rather than being nicely blended. So towards the end, it had huge chunks of ice making it difficult to finish. I ended up throwing away a little bit of it :("

We had the app with the free bubble tea offer for national bubble tea place and this location made up rules around it making it hard for people to redeem it. The older guy at the counter rudely said the order minimum needed to be $10 for us to use the offer. When I asked where does it say that within the app, he bluntly said ""It doesn't but we're saying so now!"". I looked at the menu and said how does one order $10 here for one person? Each drink is 4-5$ and I'm alone. He screamed while pointing to his receipts ""100 PEOPLE SPEND $10 HERE"" and walked away. The woman stepped up also giving an attitude saying ""It's like Buy one get one... okay?"" while rolling her eyes at me.

Never coming here again. If you look behind the counter at the actual space, its not even clean...."

When I got the drink it was SUPER sweet. When I brought this up they said it was the lactose free milk that was sweet or the matcha... after I asked specifically if there was any sugar in the drink when ordering , they obviously either put sugar in it or the matcha powder was sweet. Due to sucrose intolerance I can't have any sugar at all and this actually could be harmful. 
My friend got a milk tea with grass jelly. They put bubbles in it instead. When my friend brought it up, they literally poured the milk tea they already made, which had been opened also, into another cup with grass jelly. They did not remake the drink.

I had spicy tuna and a shrimp onigiri (Japanese triangle rice balls) here and they were delicious! I liked that the rice was still warm. I also tried a green cake with red filling. I thought it was matcha with strawberry but it just tasted like bland butter. The red didn't taste like berry either. The cake was definitely not something I'd get again. I tried a lemon kumquat iced tea that was a bit too sweet and a long bread filled with custard. The custard tasted more like just butter however. I'd come back just for the onigiri. You cannot bring merchandise into the cafe, as signs will tell you. They sell ready-to-grab bento boxes with fish too. I saw others who got it and it looked like they were enjoying themselves. I've never been to their actual larger store so I do not know how this compares to it. The cafe definitely inspired me to want to go to Japan."

This location is in an awkward location on the 2nd floor of a bookstore. Not only that, there are signs throughout the bookstore stating that there are no food or drinks allowed in the the bookstore...go figure! on top of that, the service here is terrible. 

I arrived at 7:15pm and they close at 8pm. After looking at the empty shelves for a few seconds, they told me that I had 5 mins and they were cleaning up. I asked them what time they close and they said 8pm but they typically start cleaning up by 7:45pm. After I bought some items, I figured I could sit with my family and eat the items, but they wouldn't allow me to sit, saying the cafe was closed. Sorry, but please correct your advertised store hours!! If your staff at this cafe want to be out early, do not misrepresented your store hours as being open until 8pm. Extremely disappointed with their staff, will not be back here!"

Fun place to chill for a while when you're bored or want a snack!
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2018-04-18,4.0,"This is the only place I have ever seen a grab-and-go hot chawanmushi so that in itself is thrilling.  This Cafe Zaiya outpost is on the top floor of the Kinokuniya bookstore.  When I first went upstairs to check it out, it seemed like a Taiwanese bakery as there were shelves of unique pastries and breads and trays to pile on what one wanted.  However, upon closer inspection, I saw bentos, bowls, side dishes, chawanmushi cold and hot, onigiri, and Japanese pastries.  The drink menu included bubble tea and other teas and coffees.  

I first grabbed the cold chawanmushi but then saw a hot shelf.  This reminded me so much of Japan.  I had cold chawanmushi in a grocery store in Kutchan over winter break, and the heated shelves reminded me of Japanese convenience stores (like 7-11) which have hot and cold beverages depending on the case.  I immediately switched to the hot chawanmushi, though both would be delicious.

I also grabbed the one remaining bag of green tea melon pan.  I had not seen melon pan like that before.  I also went to the ito en case and found yet another type of ito en tea bottle I had ever seen, a cold brew matcha!  I paid and sat at a table, enjoying first the chawanmushi and then one of the melon pan.  Right when I was leaving, carts full of new breads and pastries showed up.  I was a bit bummed, since I could have purchased a single green tea melon pan rather than a bag of them.  However, as I carried them in my hand/backpack on flights to Chicago and then back home, it smelled comforting like sugar cookies, and I am now able to enjoy them at home.  Itadakimasu!"
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2018-07-15,4.0,"Quick Summary:
- Don't eat here if you're in the process of purchasing books, or carrying books around (It's located within a bookstore)
- Once you enter and eat here, you can't leave the cafe until you finish eating everything (It's located within a bookstore)
- Lots of different breads and sandwiches to choose from
- Tables are full during lunchtime hour, but dissipated after 1:30pm
- Recommended to wait near the cashier area to receive drinks (tea, coffee, etc.)
- Past experience with ordering milk tea, this cafe took the longest to prepare

I entered solely because I wanted to visit the bookstore, but when I climbed to the second floor, I discovered there was a cafe. Just in time because I didn't have anything in my stomach this morning other than coffee. 

There were open display cases where it was lined up with different kinds of bread, sandwiches, and desserts. I ordered my tea and a sandwich at the cashier and managed to find a seat in the corner of the cafe. I entered at lunchtime, so majority of the seats were occupied. 

I did needed to leave my stuff at my desk because I wasn't sure how my drink was going to be delivered (I didn't leave them my name). However, the cafe is small enough that I can glance over my stuff as I waited near the checkout area. The milk tea took a really long time to arrive. I can say I have ordered over a dozen milk teas, but this cafe took the longest to prepare and receive. Other than that, the sandwich and the tea were very good and helped calm the hunger."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2019-09-12,5.0,"Ok I love this place. It provides a much needed variety to this area for quick lunches and snacks. I know there are more Japanese markets and even another Cafe Zaiya across the park, but its a much further walk for me. Plus, being able to waste a pleasant minute or two in the bookstore is nice.

But jeez, I miss those pork buns so much. I have been thinking about it and by far I think they are the best pork buns I've had in NYC (including Flushing). Understandably its probably a nuisance for the staff to have that steaming cabinet of pork buns there, and I was so thankful to be able to get them. I hope they bring it back someday. Or perhaps, let me know where those buns are from!"
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2019-07-22,4.0,Best part here is the location and the seats. Very quiet compare to other locations so that I would be able to have lunch while taking a conference call for example. Food options are pretty limited. My fav is the bento with mackerel.

Me: no"
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2019-04-18,3.0,Very much mini review. It's like their actual store two blocks away but lacking a few options such as their terrific matcha cream puffs. Black sesame drinks are good but I've had a bad one there also. Mid/low 3. Main location is better.
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2020-02-20,5.0,"This is probably the cafe that I go the most to. Small, but the seating, food and drinks are AMAZING. Definitely recommend."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2019-08-20,4.0,"A few years ago, acfriend suggested this place for black sesame ice and I have been stopping by for their black sesma ever since, even during the winter. There are other bakery options but I never tried it. I hope to try it someday."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2017-10-07,4.0,"This is a decent and fine cafe. Its located inside the Kinokuniya bookstore so its basically the bookstores food court. They don't want you to bring drinks or food outside the cafe where the books are so I understand that.

The place is small and seating can be limited but they offer good bubble tea and Japanese treats. They have a wide variety of decently priced and cheap food. If you like Chinese bakery buns you will love this place. As for the bubble tea its one of the better places I have had and they offer hot bubble tea as well.

Pretty good place if you work around the neighborhood."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2018-06-03,4.0,Love their $4.5 green tea / black sesame ice cream. A great place to take a rest around Bryant Park.
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2018-08-19,2.0,"A food cafe located on the 2nd in a bookstore where you can't bring drinks to the floor. You would think it would be better to make the cafe on the basement or ground floor. Mediocre Japanese quick food.

Also one of the cafe worker was rude. 
white girl working Sat 8/18 at 2pm, making my drink. Noticed i placed my purchased onigiri on a collapsible  counter by the register while waiting, want on a power trip and made a show of moving it elsewhere and collapsing the counter just because i didn't take the straw she offer with me drink."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2016-08-26,2.0,"Café Zaiya is conveniently located across the street from Bryant Park on the second floor of Kinokuniya Bookstore, a Japanese book and novelty store. Prices are fair, but there's a $10 credit card minimum. 

I ordered the black sesame frappe, and my boyfriend ordered the green tea frappe and a green tea crème puff. I wanted to add tapioca (""bubbles"", they call them), but they ran out even though I visited earlier in the day around 12:30 pm. My black sesame frappe tasted extremely overwhelming and strong - almost as if the black sesame was burnt. The taste gradually improved, but I've tried many delicious black sesame products (ice cream, shakes, hot tea, and bubble teas) and none of them have tasted burnt like this frappe initially did. However, my boyfriend's green tea frappe was much better with a potent matcha taste but without the bitterness. The green tea crème in the cream puff tasted very good, but the pastry dough tasted a bit stale - like it's been sitting in the display for a day or two. 

If I come back to Bryant Park, I may return to Café Zaiya and try something else on the menu, but my first experience didn't seem too promising."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2017-09-20,4.0,"The tiramisu here is really good, with lady fingers super soaked in espresso! The mascarpone cheese cream is super light and fluffy. My only quips are that the service was really shoddy (i.e. They were annoyed to be packing my slice of cake neatly)...and that the slice was super small for $4.

Other than that, this location is fun to visit as it is less busy than the main one, and is above Kinnokuya bookstore (where they sell a ton of cute little goodies)."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2018-07-11,4.0,Best asian spot near Bryant Park. Cheap bento box style lunches and teas. Not a ton of room but easy to grab and go to the park for lunch
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2016-01-04,4.0,"Relatively cheap foods for a cafe in midtown area. I came in around 5 and was sad to see that there was only 1 riceball left, but I'll be back to try the other onigiri with more substantial filling than seaweed :3. I had a latte here, as well as a melon bread, teriyaki chicken rice bowl, and matcha steamed muffin. The latte had a nice amount of foam to it, and the melon bread can't quite compare to an Asian bakery's pineapple bread (as well as its price). I really enjoyed the chicken teriyaki bowl as I heated up at work and tasted the nice flavors of the bowl mesh together. There was spicy mayo, seaweed, and Japanese rice in a bowl that contains more than it looks! 

For a cafe, it should have free wifi, but the cute Japanese book store compensated for its lack of free internet."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2019-08-06,5.0,"This place is underrated and deserves a higher average rating.  It doesn't have 5 star food, I'm giving 5 stars for how well they do for what this was designed to be, a cheap affordable place to eat for average American who wants to stay in th $10 range in lunch budget.  Cakes are much lower price compared to chain bakeries and just as good as some of the more well know bakery chains."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2018-10-25,1.0,The onigiri with fish eggs was absolutely inedible. The eggs had a weird taste to it. I would stick with katagari near grand central.
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2015-01-05,4.0,"I visited based on recommendations from Yelp and the close proximity to where I was staying. This bakery location was upstairs on the second floor of Kinokuniya Bookstore. 

I like Japanese breads and pastries, though there's not much of it when I live. Here, the dorayaki was fine, though a little bit dry and bland. There was a good amount of red bean. The breads (white loaf and others) were quite fresh and weren't all that expensive. For the most part, all the breads and pastries looked attractive and I wish I could've tried them all.

The view of Bryant Park is lovely and if I were in the area, I'd come here to do some remote work. Service was polite and patient."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2014-08-22,4.0,"CASH ONLY under $10 - I had to run to the ATM.

This location of Cafe Zaiya is situated on the 2nd level of Kinokuniya Bookstore, right across the street from Bryant Park.  I came here by myself one day to have a nice light lunch while listening to music, reading, and people watching - yes I'm a good multitasker.  It's a place where you can chill and eat alone and nobody is going to judge you!

Cafe Zaiya always has the best affordable ""to-go"" style food and my favorite is their onigiri.  I've always preferred the spicy tuna, but this time I learned they had spicy clam, which I've never had before.  Both were delicious, as expected. 

Great place for some relaxing ""me"" time."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2018-04-24,4.0,Love this place! When I can sit eat fresh unique sandwiches when the places is not packed. I enjoy the beverages they have from coffee to bubble tea frap. Reminds me of a lil cafe in Tokyo.   It just has that Asian Japanese atmosphere to it. Plus its within a Kinokuniya bookstore. So theres plenty of Manga to checkout
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2017-09-15,4.0,"If you're lactose intolerant, you know how happy I felt when I found out they can make their frappe with soy milk. Even though soy also makes me bloat, their black sesame frappe is soooo worth it! Especially on a hot summer day.  Whenever I want to treat myself when I'm at work, this is what I get. It's creamy and not overly sweet like starbucks frappes. It's so refreshing and it's like drinking a milkshake. 

Their cookies are also very good. I like the thin almond cookies which also comes as sesame too. They're light and crispy. I don't know anyone who doesn't like these. I heard their cakes are also very good."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2017-08-09,4.0,"Great place for a quick bite or easy to go food. I love the spicy chicken sandwiches, good for lunch time. They have a great variety of food from sandwiches to sushi to udons. If you work around this neighborhood this is a good quick lunch spot."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2018-02-20,3.0,"As far as ambiance and location goes, this cafe has it in spades. Inside the Kinokuniya bookstore, Cafe Zaiya is right across Bryant Park with nice seating for you to look out at a pretty popular part of Manhattan. I stopped by after a search for onigiri in the city and found some nice packages of Japanese convenience store food along with pastries and drinks. I picked up the chicken katsu, tuna, and egg sandwich combo and the salmon onigiri. Both were okay, both lacking. The katsu sandwich was dry, but the tuna and egg sandwiches were both tasty and great for me to munch on while I was on the go. The onigiri lacked in filling and ultimately a little lackluster.

Since I've had better and cheaper versions of these meals, the food did not impress me. However, the bookstore is adorable and it's a great place to stop for a quick bite if you're walking around the city and you don't want to spend too much money for a meal."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2015-05-29,3.0,"Every time I go to Kino, I want to try this place, but the lines are so long. Luckily it wasn't this time. 
I wanted to get a mochi donut, but they were out:( also they have a $10 minimum for credit card users, so I browsed around for something else. I eventually got a chicken teriyaki don, yakimochi, spicy salmon onigiri, and a small hot chocolate and the total came to around $15. 
The yakimochi was pretty good, I liked how chewy it was and red bean is always delicious lol
The spicy salmon onigiri could have been better, it lacked any spicy. I think spam would have been a better filling
The chicken teriyaki don was nothing special. Chicken teriyaki with spicy mayo on some rice and seaweed and a few broccoli and greens.
The hot chocolate tastes like dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate and watery"
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2017-05-11,4.0,"Convenient location inside Kinokuniya, but offers a limited selection compared to their other location. For example, no soft serve ice cream, and smaller assortment of pastries. The bookstore kind of compensates for the limited offerings.

Running into a renowned model also vastly overcompensated for the limited offerings.

I came here on a weekday afternoon and ran into supermodel Ming Xi, though, which made my experience at Zaiya unforgettable. She, on the other hand, I believe, was looking for some privacy and a somewhat secluded area to chill and talk with her friend, but I ruined that by getting excited and asking for a photo. I'll be back, but perhaps she won't. My apologies!"
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2016-01-18,3.0,"Ok. I was here last week when I tried to find a place where hot meals were available. I went all the way from the front to the back of the library, and finally settled down with this place because my shoes were killing me. Fortunately I saw it some where that this place is associate with a book store, otherwise I would never find it. 

The cafe locates on the second floor of a japanese bookstore. The whole place is small. They have a refrigerator and couple microwaves. Basically the only way you can get a meal here is to select from the refrigerator, pay, and microwave them. Not exactly what I had in mind. 

They have fried pork rice, curry, beef rice, sushi, Japanese style bread (red bean mellon and so on). They can make tea for you, from a tea bag. They do have coffee. Thank god they take cash. Chairs are not exactly comfortable.

I do like cafe, but microwave foods are not acceptable for me."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2017-08-16,2.0,"Worst sushi I have ever had, which is pretty embarrassing for a Japanese cafe.

Sweets are good though."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2013-03-12,2.0,"Went in today after shopping for books.

How things have changed ...
My latte was very bland; I could barely taste any espresso and I did not order a misto.
The Pudding a la Mode was 'meh' as well; I was disappointed to have wasted my calories on this."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2018-07-05,5.0,"This is one of the rare places that you can buy takeaway onigiri like in Japan. Amazing selection of japanese drinks (green tea bottles imported from japan) and desserts which really reminds me of Japan. 

There were many japanese people in the cafe so you know its authentic!"
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2015-10-01,4.0,Yummy bento box. I had the salmon one and it was very tasty and filling! Limited seating but I was able to grab a spot. A nice place to enjoy lunch for the right price.
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2012-09-03,4.0,"I'd been going to the other Cafe Zaiya location and just realized that this one is even closer to my office! They have significantly fewer options, but there's still a great selection of sandwiches and bowls and other food that's easy to grab and go. I like that all of the foods are in one place so you can just pick something out and stand in line, whereas at the other location you have to wander around to eat of the cold food areas to pick something out and then get into one of two possible lines. The cold food itself is good and affordable!

I also finally tried the Black Sesame Frappe and it was delicious!!! Over five dollars is a bit much for a frappe (for some reason it's pricier here than it is at the other location), but it's one of those things you have to try...and will continue to buy on the rough days that you want to treat yourself at work. I'll be back!"
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2018-10-16,4.0,"I decided to try their matcha bubble tea. It was a busy time as I went on a Saturday and it was comic con that weekend so it was crowded. Staff was polite, patient, and explained the menu well when I had questions. Would recommend this place and to come during non busy hours. Their spot is cute and has a nice view of Bryant Park"
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2017-01-03,4.0,"4 stars for the onigiri (mentaiko is the best - spicy cod eggs, spicy salmon was alright) and the coffee is mediocre (slightly burnt but waaaaay better than Starbucks and better price). But the view, the new decor, and the manga and little collectibles all around the cafe! Cafe is on the second floor of Kinokuniya bookstore and brilliant idea because now I can't leave without buying a ton of stuff. My tummy is happy and my eyes are pleased with this view."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2016-04-11,4.0,"Neat little hideaway on the second floor of the Japanese book shop. Picked up some onigiri and a package of sushi roll, grand total was under $15. A gem for people who work in the area and need an escape from the greasy joints all around. A relatively healthy lunch that's tasty. I didn't try the tea--maybe next time."
674,cafe-zaiya-new-york-10,2012-08-20,3.0,"Sadly Cafe Zaiya was out of Black Sesame Frappe.....................so I ended up with a Green Tea Frappe.

Great space for a time out inside Kinokuniya Bookstore!

Green Tea Frappe is smooth and a great matcha taste. Another good choice as a liquid dessert.

Looking at all the cute and well presented baked goods, this kind of feel like I am in Tokyo?!"
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2019-12-06,4.0,"Really nice and super fast, which is important. No lines at the register bc they kept it moving nicely, and my order was ready quickly. Perfect way to start a Friday morning."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2019-12-17,3.0,"Seems like they do a ""bang up business"" on remote order apps.  Maybe that's what took them so long to get my simple, small Pike place coffee order as I stood there.   It didn't seem crowded at all, and there was ample seating available during my 9:30am visit.  There is a little confusion with where the line forms and who is IN line.   Otherwise, it's ok.  The coffee was very good. Seems like, as we shift to an ""app ordering"" economy...they might want to focus on a few of these logistical issues."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2019-11-06,3.0,"Please please get it together. No one has time to wait for their food/ drinks while the baristas/ food preparers are just hanging out by the toaster gossiping about last nights events. Then have the order be completely incorrect and wait another 7 minutes for the correct one.

Time is money, people.
other then that, I'm usually satisfied with this place. but the past 5-6 times I've been, it's been an annoying process.

Today it was the girl in the pink sweater. Not to call anyone out, but maybe next time she will pay attention to what bagel was ordered and not rush it just so she could go on her break."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2018-07-16,1.0,"The older woman with an accent that works here in the morning and doesn't wear a name tag - her name may be Vera IdK. She is so miserable. Today she was wearing a viser. I cannot be around her in the morning, she kills any joy I might have had walking into the store. She is so gruff and yelling and staff and customers. I mobile ordered and she went through my phone, then took my phone somewhere. Unreal.

She needs to learn the policy Bc refills are $0.50. She's trying to act like they don't do refills.

If you still need to come here, there is a restroom and seating in the front."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2019-12-08,1.0,"Mobile ordering is the worst, you can get a drink faster standing in line. They're always running out of everything, like that one time I waited 20 minutes for a blonde flat white, only to find out they ran out of it. Your staff is not very friendly, borderline RUDE. They also ran out of all the croissants and the drinks suck. Also, you might want to consider teaching your employees how to make all the drinks your menu provides instead of saying ""I don't know how to make that. Are you sure that's what you want?"" Um, yes that's what I want!"
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2019-07-07,5.0,"This is the best Starbucks I've ever been to in the city. Great staff! This is my go-to Starbucks every morning before work! I keep it simple with a cold brew or iced coffee (with no classic), but I get the occasional cappuccino and they fill it up to the top. You'll see some Starbucks/other coffee shops give it with half foam. It makes a difference. Lol 

They are also super quick in the morning - whether you order on mobile and in-store. Some Starbucks crush under pressure during the morning rush, but not this place. 5 stars all around!!"
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2019-02-23,1.0,"Starbucks!
I love the everything there, from the Frappuccinos to their Iced Teas!
Today when I went to order my go-to drink (the Black & White Mocha Frappuccino) the service was unexpectedly poor.

From my observations, the customer is not their #1 priority.

It was a pretty average day and the store wasn't too packed. After I had ordered, I was waiting for my drink for FIFTEEN minutes. The barista started to make my drink and right before she was going to put the lid on my Frappuccino, she starts to make someone else a sandwich. She even began to brew another coffee. I actually had to ASK another barista (the first one left) to finish it off.
I didn't catch her name but I was furious when I left the store. It was all together unprofessional and unsettling.

Another thing that negatively caught my attention was that they don't provide a public restroom for customers. Only employees had access to it.

Starbucks is a place where people purchase beverages and like to hangout with their friends and/or relatives and the fact that this location doesn't provide a restroom for their customers is very upsetting and creates an uncomfortable environment for everyone."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2018-08-10,4.0,"Great location. Staff was nice, Miranda even greated us with a warm smile, and helped my friend with her mobile app. The place was clean, even had a staff member keepin it clean. The music selection was good, and I found out that happy hour ran all nite, not just until five like my local starbucks says it is. My vanilla chai tea, with a shot of  cinnamon dolce,with almond milk extra hot, was on point, could of been hotter, but still delicious. I think Starbuck need to study this particular location and teach their other locations a thing or 2, about how a coffee shop really is supposed to be."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2019-04-12,5.0,My favorite Starbucks on Earth. I just switched jobs so I will be going to a new location in a few days. They made Cool Lime Refreshers and Very Berry Hibiscus Refreshers better than any store I have frequented. The staff is amazing and just awesome. Thank you for making my mornings less painful. I fucking love Starbucks and especially this store!

675,starbucks-new-york-121,2015-08-25,3.0,"I usually don't review Starbucks as I usually receive a consistently good product with service that's not really noteworthy either in either direction. 

This Starbucks was a little under par.  I was there during mid-morning so was able to walk right up and order. I had a few questions about the flavor shots available. Actually, not a few questions. One question. I wanted to know what they had. The barista dryly responded ""vanilla"" and stared back at me. 

That's fine. I like vanilla and my coffee was standard otherwise. No complaints about the quality. 

I don't need a hug from the barista, but a little enthusiasm or explanation on the lack of product availability would go a long way to me. Too bad this is the only Starbucks in the city. Oh wait, I have other options..."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2017-03-08,5.0,"I mean its Starbucks, whats not to love? The coffee is consistent, the staff is friendly, and the stores are a familiar place to relax. 

This particular location can get pretty busy during peak hours since it is on a high traffic road, but the baristas are efficient, there is always plenty of staff working together, and as always you have the option to order on their mobile app and skip the line. In my opinion it is one of the few starbucks that works well under pressure and doesn't mess up drinks when the line is out the door."

It's the slowest store in Manhattan, so only go here if you have 20 minutes or so each morning (that's honestly not an exaggeration).  The employees are slovenly at best, and apathetic at their worst.  They have 4-5 people standing around at all times while people wait, and wait, and wait...

The Rewards system is also tailored to the extravagant drinks.  You would have to purchase more than 25 black coffees to get one free.  That doesn't seem very rewarding.  (No stars off for this corporate policy)"

Wait a very short time.  Scan your iPhone (or use that green paper you might have with you) and wait another very short time, listen to them call you ""Tyler!  Time to get YO COFFEE ON!"" (or some derivation of) get your beverage, walk out, make the 6 train just in time, get off, get to work on time touting an empty venti iced coffee cup and...get your work on.

This place is the model of efficiency and it makes me proud to always be in a rush when I visit, all the time most always."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2014-10-30,5.0,"I believe I can vouch for any student or writer when I say that Starbucks has become a very important part of peoples lives. I know it has for wifey and I. We like to change up the scenery when studying, and Starbucks is a perfect scenery switch. The art deco and the music produce a very serene and comfortable environment. Starbucks makes you want to stay for hours and the best part is the COFFEE. 

Usually if we come in to study, we like to get the blonde roast. Blonde roast is the strongest coffee and will keep you awake and buzzed for hours without giving you a really bad crash. 

I am also very fond of the vanilla chai latte and their iced coffee on the hotter days. Frida (my wife) likes a hot skinny caramel latte and their amazing java chip frap with an addition of an espresso shot for an extra kick. Also, some of the favorites are: Cool lime refresher (with a bit of extra water), Hot chocolate (in the winter) and the Dark Roast coffee brew.

Now, I would like to talk about their logo. There is something about their cups and their logo that just brings you in, no matter what's in the cup, even if it's free water (which is very much appreciated. Thank you Starbucks) and truth be told no matter where I am if there is both a Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks around I would always choose Starbucks for coffee. It feels like the people who work in Starbucks are quicker and better at what they do. True proffessional baristas.  Definately a lifetime customer."

Plus, there are a few tables to sit at if you are lucky enough to find a chair. If you do get a seat, I recommend you get your latte or cappuccino or whatever in a ceramic for-here cup. It's a beverage meant to be enjoyed while you relax."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2016-06-07,5.0,Awesome service and staff! Recommend as a point to stop in for meetings or afternoon java!
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2016-03-03,5.0,"I cannot get through the day without my iced green tea! Love coming to this location, so convenient and the staff is also so accommodating to my allergies. Don't think we need to be so upset it's a corporate giant? It's creating jobs!"
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2012-07-26,2.0,"This location was the closest to my hotel, otherwise I would prefer another location.  The quality of the service was poor.  They take your order, but seem rushed and like they are in bad mood.  

My drink did not taste consistent with ones made at other locations."

675,starbucks-new-york-121,2015-07-27,2.0,"Starbucks are cool. Coffee is okay, not great. I'm not very impressed with this location. 
This location has been unfriendly at times.  I've experienced being ask to leave because of purchasing a coffee. This location is not very professional as far as staff are concern. 
Hopefully, it may gotten better with a well trained manager."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2016-08-15,3.0,The lines are always so long every time I come to this location. Last time I got a cold brew it tasted like it was brewed much longer than they usually do which was annoying because I love cold brew but it had a weird taste to it

Quick service. 
And they made my drink right. 
What more can a coffee fiend ask for? 
(maybe a sofa or a cushy seat)"
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2013-10-09,3.0,"This is defitnitely not one of your larger Starbucks. There a few seats in the front and in the back of the store. 

Because the store is shaped like a thin rectangle, the register and the line combine to leave very little thin walking/passing isle after you get your drink at the end of the line.  

It seems to always be busy, but the lines move fast.

Other than that, everything else is pretty much the same as all the other Starbucks."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2016-02-04,1.0,"I really do despise this location.  The only reason I keep coming back is because I work across the street so it's convenient.  If once, JUST ONCE, they can get a mobile order correct (considering I'm paying almost $7 for a mediocre latte), then they'd get more stars.  However, as always, I am sitting here at work now drinking a bitter latte because none of the flavors that I had requested were added and I do not have time to check out the coffee to make sure they put freaking caramel in it AS WAS STATED.  I guess reading a simple order really is that complicated."
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2016-09-15,5.0,"absolutely best starbucks in manhattan. they treat you like family, admittedly theyre a bit slow in the morning but at night they move at a faster pace. however service (knowing your name, your favorite drink, something random about you) is more important me than how fast my coffee is poured. love the team here"
675,starbucks-new-york-121,2016-03-31,3.0,"CS, speed and design of the facility are great. The only bad thing: they rotate workers too often, which results in poor quality drinks from time to time-like my last green tea frap that was pretty close to terrible. Need to work on quality control."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2020-04-22,5.0,"Thank you for being there for us during this tough period. I am so touched by the staffs who work there to provide sweet and thoughtful service. And please go and takeout their pastries in store. I highly recommend Zucchini bread, it's just the best ZB I ever had in the entire world!"
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2020-01-19,5.0,"** Healthy and cozy place near Hudson Yard for coffee and brunch **

The good reviews of their coffee drew us here. We are happily impressed by the food options as well! The menu offers a lot of vegetarian and vegan options. It also details the ingredients and calories which I love. The portion of the food is just the right size. Healthy! 

Drinks:
Flat white
Ice latte

Brunch:
Baked green eggs (our favorite. Interesting way to eat baked eggs, be careful the skillet was really hot and it burnt hand a little bit...)

BL burrito"
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2020-01-12,4.0,"I was never a big Bluestone Lane fan, but when this one opened it won me over. It's not as crowded as many of the other locations tend to be on the weekends. The  servers are always pleasant and don't make you feel rushed, regardless of whether you are having food or just coffee.

Today I had the lemon ricotta pancakes for the first time, and they were probably the best thing I have ever had off the brunch menu- such a great blend of flavors and textures. I'll definitely be craving them again soon.

The beet latte is also a favorite of mine."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-12-15,4.0,"Tucked away across from. Hudson yards is this lovely little coffee and brunch house. 

Great service and great coffee.  

A little on the expensive side but I guess that's the Hudson yard thing rubbing off."

676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-09-25,3.0,"I came here on a Tuesday morning to do some work. I order the Avocado Smash and a pot of Earl Grey tea. 

To be honest, the Avocado toast was way too sour to me. I do like the toast they used. 

One of the biggest downsides is the if you're trying to work here, the wifi is really bad! The internet kept going in and out. It's really challenging to work. 

I feel like people don't come here to work for long period of time. I was here for 3 hours and if felt like the waiters were wondering why I was still there."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2020-03-02,5.0,Great place to grab breakfast! Loved their fresh made their juice and their avocado toast was fantastic.

676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-06-16,4.0,"Located right in the Eugene with lots of great outdoor seating. Note that it is very expensive at Bluestone Lane, but you do pay for the class and the quality of the coffee/drink.

Staff are courteous and lots of free water to be had. You can sit and be served, or sit outside without service. Very convenient for those who live in the Eugene."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-07-11,5.0,"Love Bluestone Lane and definitely one of my fav spots to enjoy a nice light and healthy brunch! This location in particular is fantastic as it is a bit larger than the other locations, so you do not need to wait to get seated. I get the 'Brekkie Board' and beet or turmeric latte every time and it is amazing. The only thing stopping me from giving this 5-stars is the price. You know the food is good quality, and tastes amazing, but for the serving size.. it is pricey!! Regardless, highly recommend and is a great spot. 

UPDATE: I visit Bluestone Lane every time that I am in NYC now, my go to brunch spot. Staff is so friendly and I am addicted to the Brekkie Board and the Banana Bread. My boyfriend will order something different each time, and he always loves what he gets. Amazing taste, high quality, and lots of flavour. I am just hoping that their Toronto location will change their menu to have more like the US locations."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-05-01,4.0,"First time going to one of these Bluestone Lane Coffee chains. The person taking our order was super chill. I'm not really a coffee drinker, so I didn't really know what was good to get, but I did know I was crashing after a plane ride. They suggested that I get a Mocha latte. It was just the right burst of caffeine with a little chocolate drizzle. Nice and strong, but not overbearing in the least. Not gonna lie the smell it gave off was almost like a black coffee, but that was not the case. Overall, I thought the drink was really good and it did it's job. The barista was super nice, the atmosphere of the shop was really chill as well. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating for everyone. The art inside is eye catching as well. This is a shop I could see myself meeting friends up at and having a nice cup of Joe!"
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2020-02-25,1.0,"I was a huge bluestone fan, and I always told my friends they have the best avocado toast in NYC.However, today I am really disappointed. I ordered avocado smash as usual and the bread is overcooked. It is really hard to cut it and chew. The avocado is too salty, every bite is like eating salt itself. I really hope that they would improve this."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2020-02-19,3.0,"Food was amazing, service was kind of wonky. The table next to us didn't get the food they ordered and the kitchen or staff didn't mind fixing that for her. They seat you and leave you for a bit, just a friendly note the menus are under the plate and silver ware. I looked for it for 10 minutes and then realized it was under there. Lol. It's a cozy setting meaning, it's a tight fit for seating.  But good food!"
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-07-06,5.0,"I was generally ambivalent towards Bluestone Lane, having been to the West Village location in my old 'hood only a couple of times.  However, I am a huge, massive fan of this new location.  This is an excellent place for either a relaxing brunch or an afternoon caffeine recharge.

The decor is sleek and modern, but still very relaxed and inviting.  The staff here is amazing.  They are incredibly friendly and helpful.  The indoor space is pretty large for a coffee shop and there is outdoor seating, too.  

I have had the bacon and egg on a roll, and the zucchini bread and probably a few other thing, too (can't remember it all).  The food is very good and the coffee is excellent.  I am a fan of the espresso, but they also do good lattes and cortados, etc."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-10-12,5.0,"We came with some friends and their baby, all of whom we hadn't seen in a while, and the service was absolutely amazing. We had to wait a bit for a table, which the wait staff handled with great kindness and kept giving us updates. Once we sat, we didn't feel rushed, allowing us time to talk and really catch up. Everyone was soo nice. And the food and coffee were delicious!! 
One of the best brunch experiences I've had in nyc. Thanks so much to the entire staff for making it great!"
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-11-10,5.0,"We want to have a nice but quick breakfast before exploring while visiting NYC. I'm so glad we picked Bluestone, we were able to sit outside and had excellent service. I ordered the Brekkie Board I highly recommend. The lemon curd in the parfait set it over the top and I loved the avocado toast. The iced latte was so good, I ordered a second one to go."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-11-20,5.0,"I am really a huge fan of Bluestone Lane.  While pricey, if you want amazing fresh food its well worth the price.  I ordered a slice of their avocado toast and a fresh pressed juice and have never felt more refreshed!  I loved their take on the avocado toast.

Our server was very friendly and knowledgable when I didn't know what to order.  I didn't know much about pressed juices and he helped me find the perfect one!

Great atmosphere, great food, I will definitely be back!"
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-10-21,5.0,"Americano, latte and CHAI MUFFIN. Sooooo perfect for a breezy cold New York day after just walking the high line! The vibe in here is very pastel/ gold beautiful!"

676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-10-06,4.0,"##Overall: 3.8/5
Nice cafe just in front of Port Authority and behind the crowd of Times Square. The inside is not too crowded given the location, and high-ceiling and floor to ceiling windows makes me feel released from stress. For a traveler from outside of NYC who just arrived at Port Authority, this is a perfect starting point to sit down and review your travel plan. For people who get tired of walking around Times Square, there are not many places like this to take a break quietly.

##Drink: 4.5/5
Ordered just small regular coffee which was my favorite taste - sour end but not too very sour, like blue bottle. 

##Food: 3.5/5
The banana bread i ordered was a bit wet and was hard to eat. All foods look cute but are a bit too small and not stuffing.

##Service: 4/5
Good service in general. There was not much outlet so not sure if the place is good for work, though.

##Atmosphere: 4/5
Modern but relaxing thanks to high ceiling and glass windows with not too many seats inside. 

##Cost Performance: 3/5
Both drinks and foods are on pricy end... the small banana muffin was $3.5 and all other small snacks are at smiler price. Might be a bit too expense for daily use."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-12-11,2.0,"Generally a fan of Bluestone Lane, but the experience at this location was really underwhelming. Food and drinks were fine, but the service was really lacking. Two people in our party of four ordered the big brekkie plate but did not have any mushrooms when it arrived. The server did not say anything, not when we ordered, nor when they served it. Running out of an ingredient is not a big deal. We simply would have chosen something else from the menu. It wasn't until we asked them about the mushrooms that they gave us extra bacon. The placating gesture seemed like such an inconvenience for the server and their attitude reflected so. A more genuine gesture would be to ask us if we would like anything else, instead of just giving us bacon. Because we didn't really want bacon, we would have been happy with just an extra slice of toast. 

A recommendation for the cafe: The tables aren't big so it would be nice to have some smaller plates. Not all the entrees need such big plates and they take up a lot of precious surface area. I asked the server and they said they didn't have anything smaller."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-04-07,4.0,"This place is very nice and a good comfortable place to hang out just east of midtown. 

The food is delicious.  The prices are on the high end.   It's fairy quiet with good music.  

Advocado toast is very yummy.  So are the sandwiches."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-08-15,5.0,"This phenomenal new location at The Eugene is part of the Huson Yards revitalization and as a Chelsea resident pretty damn exciting. Barista and cashier ae super nice her and the coffee- flat white was spot on!
I must say the price a $5.17 as hi ghee than most, but they offer both almond and oat milk which works for me and a huge high design space nearby does too!"
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-08-01,4.0,"Wheelchair user reviewer and foodie all in one! I love the location. I think every building should have a cafe entrance from the lobby. I'm biased since The Eugene will be my second home when I visit my sister and brother-in-law. With that said, I love the coffee with the OAT MILK! I want to buy more oat milk. 

There is a variety of items which helps when you have a diverse set of friends. I think that the prices for the items with eggs are a bit pricey. The main value comes from the vegetable only items. It's as if they think you are rabbit. When it comes to one of my sisters, they struck gold. 

You have to go early to get the bakery items. They are delicious. The croissants! OMG! Another great item is the fresh juice. They are all delicious. 

The outdoor seating is awesome for the fall. I can't wait to go back there. My biggest concern is that the only accessible bathroom there is blocked with chairs. The good part is that I ask one of the servers to move them and they do so. The bathroom is accessible. I love the soap! I have to buy that brand. 

Let's get to the service. Some of the servers are much friendlier than the others. Shout out to Vinnie! He was awesome. I got VIP service. I think he pretty much gave that to everyone. That's a plus. 

There was a guy who had just started out. He made the coffee. He was awesome too! 
I love that many people came in and knew others by name. It had that friendly neighborhood feeling."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-09-12,5.0,Great avocado toast and atmosphere. Friendly staff. Quick service. Nice place to get some work done or meet up with a friend.
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-10-19,2.0,"I've been to this one twice. Definitely my least favorite Bluestone of the ones I've been to. Service is a bit slow. Food was just average. Virtually tasteless.

Also, why is this location so unwilling to substitute scrambled eggs for the poached eggs on anything? That's got to be the easiest substitution to make! 

I won't be back. Just not worth the time and money.

Update to the response I received: thanks for the reply. I should've added that it was NOT very busy at all. I think there were three other people in there when I was ordering. Got busier by the time I left, though."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-09-25,4.0,"Quick and convenient

Banana on toast is absolutely yummy and less than $5!

Chai latte also yum. And the avocado toast with chilli flakes is great, but the banana toast was a must!"

676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-03-19,4.0,"This place has great coffee and great coffee alternatives. It's a bit on the pricier side but it's definitely great for a ""here and there"" treat. The pastries are pretty tasty too. Definitely a good coffee franchise."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-01-30,5.0,"I decided to give Bluestone Lane another visit since I was in the Hudson Yard area, and there aren't too many options around yet. The restaurant and chef definitely seemed to make use of my comments about the rainbow bowl, because it was really great this time! You could definitely taste the maple in the carrots, the dressing had a nice spicy kick to it, and all of the other elements were well prepared. I also added the chicken and it had a very flavorful rub- not sure if it was paprika, but something along those lines. I also got one of the best cookies that I've ever eaten at a restaurant. It was similar to a giant Verona cookie- a super soft and chewy sugar cookie with raspberry or strawberry jam in the middle. I'm glad I had a better experience this time, and would recommend Bluestone Lane."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-02-15,4.0,I love this place!  The one uptown gets crazy crowded but we always find a place to sit at this location.  The neighborhood has a lot of construction going on so that may be why.  The workers are always kind and attentive.  The only con is that they close a bit early.
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-03-08,4.0,"I've made it my mission to frequent every Bluestone Lane in an effort to make myself feel like I'm back in Aussie Land. I miss you, Australia!!! 

This branch is very off the beaten path (past 9th avenue, gasp!), but it's worth it. The café is beautiful, spacious, and relaxing. Filled with big plants and baristas who say ""takeaway,"" it creates an aura of serenity on a very desolate block. 

The coffee was good for New York, average for Australia. Got a large cup with whole milk. It was a bit tepid, actually, but it got the job done. I've had better at other Bluestones, but I still enjoyed it. I've had the almond milk latte here as well, and that was perfect. I'd return. 

Prime for FIT students, construction workers, and commuters."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-10-29,3.0,"I live upstairs and have tried this place 3 times (since I believe in 2nd....and 3rd chances). It is hard to get someone to pay attention to you and give you service. Hipster workers with a little too much of an ""I dont care about you"" tude. But this is NYC I guess so don't expect much. The AVO Toast is is okay. The bread is hard to cut through and its pretty pricey. Not coming back."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-07-26,2.0,Cool vibe but food wasn't prepared well. I ordered a breakfast bowl to go. The 'poached egg' was basically hard boiled with a solid round yolk and the avocado was hard and cold.
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-06-12,4.0,"We popped in for a late brunch one day. The cafe was smooth and cool in ambience. The service was impeccable. The food quick, tasty and enjoyable. We will return, even if we are from Australia."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-08-12,3.0,"I wish I could give Bluestone 3.5 stars, but alas, I cannot. This is the most spacious Bluestone I have visited, and I am completely enamored by the interior design here. I would encourage you to order sit down and order a cup of coffee as I thoroughly enjoyed pouring the hot cup of coffee from the glass bottle into my blue coffee mug.

In regards to food, like most other hipster joints, the menu items are overpriced. I would recommend that you visit Bluestone for the coffee and pastries and not so much for its a la carte options."
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-02-18,4.0,"Decided to try this place as people say its like an Aussie cafe. As we're from Australia, we thought we'd give it a go and compare.
Love the decor inside the place. It was a cold rainy day when we went but got a seat straight away. I ordered a oat milk mocha and my husband a dirty chai. Oat milk mocha was really good however the dirty chai was quite watery tasting. 
I git the breakfast board and my husband the scrambled eggs with bacon. I loved my breakfast board! Perfect amount of avo on toast with a granola on the side. My husbands bacon and eggs were ok. The eggs were a little different to what we're used to and the amount of bacon you get for the price is a bit underwhelming. 
Overall a nice place.. would definitely return.. and it did sort of remind us of an aussie cafe!"
676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2019-06-13,5.0,"I popped in to introduce myself this afternoon as I work security in the area. I was immediately greeted with a welcoming smile.

676,bluestone-lane-new-york-19,2018-11-27,5.0,"Can't get enough of the oat milk lattes here. They're so delicious and so addictive. The pastries are also great. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu, brunch is looking might fine. Coming for that hot stone dish. Vicky is the best barista in town"
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2018-02-02,4.0,"The model of efficiency. A tiny little place that has quality roasts and speciality drinks. The drip coffee I had wasn't too dark and let the berry flavor out. Smooth. Their specialty drinks, including lattes with seasonal spices, looked good. I had two tiny muffins that had a surprising burst of cream in the middle; tasty but small. 

The barista was polite but efficient, and didn't waste any words or movements fulfilling my order. The shop is strictly take out, as there are two small bar stools and a ledge and that's about all the hospitality you get. I would make this a regular stop on my AM coffee hunt."

The surly woman behind the counter said they only do one size for lattes, the medium size. I asked why, and she said it's the store's philosophy. Seriously? No one was behind me, so I stood for a moment trying to decide what to do, whereupon she turned away and put the cup back and said ""there are other coffee shops up the street."" There was no one behind me. I hesitated for maybe two seconds. She was haughty in a way I have rarely seen and that has no place in a coffee shop. But since I was pressed for time, I said ""no, I'll take one"" and then she presented me with the most sloppily made latte I have ever encountered, with drips and spatters all around the rim and running down the outside. An awful experience all around. Oh and the coffee was ok."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2017-07-03,3.0,"I have to knock a few stars off this review. 

We came back to the Stone Street Coffee Company today and don't get me wrong, the coffee was still great, but the service - meh. The women behind the counter was rude. Also, they now charge $.75 for the vanilla infused simple syrup. Seriously? $.75? How petty are you that you charge several dollars for a cup of coffee then you feel that you need to charge extra for simple syrup with a vanilla twig in it? The counter person kept chanting it too, taking the bottle out of my hand until I paid for it.

I may have felt better about the $.75 if it came without the attitude but clearly the counterperson was giving that away for free."

677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2017-04-02,1.0,"Sorry really bad coffee. Can't believe I paid $5 for the almond latte, that's worse than Starbucks. It's too bitter. Im always up for organic boutique coffee shops, but just not this one."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2017-01-20,4.0,"I must admit that I have passed by Stone Street multiple times in the morning, yet this is my only time trying it. SS is literally a hole in the wall, with at most five seatings squeezed inside the room. For a coffee shop, I actually love this sort of intimacy. 

Ordered my regular cappuccino to-go, and gladly discovered their pastry selection from Amy's bread. Barista was nice and quick. 

Lovely start of the weekend!"
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2016-06-15,4.0,"The address (in Chelsea) is nowhere near Stone Street, but their large chocolate macaron was an OK way to drop $3, and the staffer very friendly. Pre-auth ppears on CC as BATHTUB GIN.

677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2017-04-17,4.0,"Got a quick coffee to go on a weekend morning. The space is tiny, but there's still a good spot to perch a while and chat with the barista. Simple and smooth coffee at a competitive price. I'm always fascinated about how small coffee places like this can stay in business, but they do what they do well. There were a few pastries at the counter, as well."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2017-08-02,5.0,"Best iced mocha in NYC plus if you go in the morning, Elena is an amazing host and always has an large smile to clients."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2017-02-26,4.0,"Stopped by this place after walking by and it piqued my curiosity. The homemade vanilla latte felt like the best drink to give them a chance to really shine, and it did. It was a tasty drink and the vanilla really popped in a unique way. That said, it didn't really taste like coffee nor did the milk strike me as particularly creamy. It just had a very nice sweet, vanilla flavor. Service was nice. Ambiance is a counter on the street. If I walk by again, I'll definitely try something else."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2014-03-27,4.0,"Love Stone Street Coffee Company. Great place to stop after lunch and have a great espresso based beverage. There usually is a young woman behind the counter who is always pleasant and a huge dog lover and has treats for them. I always have a cappuccino (smooth not bitter or acidic). I recently purchased a Chocolate French Macaron. I stood out front Stone Street and devoured the French pastry and sipped my cappuccino. I started my walk back to the apartment on 7th when half way through remnants were still dancing around in my mouth. I stopped and went back or an additional Chocolate Macaron.

This place is more than a GREAT coffee shop, during the afternoon hours a saloon opens up in the back. The wall you are facing when you enter has a secret door but you would't know because it is painted blue and has a large framed picture hanging from the door ;0)

Food: Coffee and pastries are very good.

Service: Pleasant and cheerful (The Young Woman)

Decor: Very cozy and warm. Haven't visited the saloon yet"
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2014-06-01,4.0,"Ordered the iced white chocolate pumpkin latte! So good! Comparable to Starbucks but at a cheaper price! The shop is small and has stools on the side. 

There's actually a door that leads to a hidden bar/lounge. Check it out if you're interested."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2017-06-19,5.0,I definitely have to tip my hat off to this incredibly delicious coffee spot!! The atmosphere and the barista was absolutely amazing. I love walking into places that make you feel at home!
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2017-12-12,5.0,"Just happened to walk by this Gem and noticed a sweet boxer puppy by the door, soooo glad I stopped to grab a coffee! Not only was it one of the BEST Cappuccinos I've ever had, but the barista was really sweet! Will def be back!"
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2017-11-06,5.0,Service  with a smile. Great coffee.  Great pastries. Any time of day. Fair priced for the area too.
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2016-08-14,4.0,After walking around NYC all day in the sweltering heat I was dying for something cool and refreshing to try. This little cafe was on our way to the parking garage and we decided to pop in. It is a very quaint shop with limited bar seating. I decided to try out their iced mint tea. I poured in some honey and it helped balance out the mintiness of it. I love anything mint so I was a big fan of the tea. It was very cold and refreshing and hit the spot after a long day of walking.
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2017-02-28,5.0,So cute! You can order from the street through a window or enter into the shop. The shop is very cute and the staff is nice. The latte's are delicious and the baked good are too! Reasonably priced.
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2018-06-27,1.0,"Upon ordering two freshly squeezed orange juices, I received two cups from their fridge. I thought that was weird, since it is advertised as fresh on the sign outside- but I thought maybe it was squeezed this morning which I am personally okay with. I paid for my juices and left without trying them, having trusted that stone street coffee would know what all fresh OJ drinkers know: THE TASTE OF NOT FRESH OJ.  They charged me $7 for two cups of Tropicana. They also didn't answer the phone when I called to complain. This happened like 16 minutes ago. I will never go back."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2015-07-20,1.0,"I think the barista was having a horrible day; at least I hope  that would explain his attitude. It's like he would have rather been doing anything than working. Rude, acted like he was completely put out when I asked for an iced drink, absolutely no response when the cup lids were out of stock and we asked for lids. Just handed them over and took his sweet time. 

Bummer because the shop is cute & small and plays great music."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2012-08-23,4.0,"Pretty good coffee with a window to service the outside? Very cool.
Small fact about Stone Street Coffee Company, it;s a father and son operation. And they're Greek! (I'm half Greek) Friggin Opa to you!

They busted out a plant in Brooklyn, started roasting coffee beans and sell the blend to some high end restaurants in NYC. Nice goin' guys, keepin' it real in my NYC!

Anyhoo, swung by today for a Caffè macchiato and a chocolate croissant. Pretty good place to grab a coffee and go. I now have four of my favorite places to go in this area! 

I love coffee and if you love it as much as me? Swing by and support this place.
Trust me.. Opa!"
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2016-09-21,4.0,Essential no seating area and the parties looked terrible but the espresso went down quite smoothly
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2016-03-05,3.0,"Hello dear humans and coffehumans.
Today I'm going to write a review that well it is hard to write. My dear girlfriend and I were walking towards ninth street espresso at Chelsea market when we stumbled upon a place we haven't seen before... This one!! Very small very interesting and also nice because they use their own coffee and let me tell you, it is very good.
Now, they reason why I'm sad is because when I ordered my espresso and iced coffee the barista place my espresso in a to go cup, espresso shouldn't be placed in a to go cup... But that was my mutate for not specifying such a terrible act.
Now, the barista grabbed a plastic cup and poured straight from the machine, the espresso shot... WHY!!!!!! No one should do that ever... Ever... Not even f it is convenient. Pouring hot contents into plastic is a terrible thing.... Please never do this, that's why I had to give three stars! 
God never do that for anything!!!!"
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2018-02-25,2.0,"Lacking in customer service.  I visited the store yesterday to buy beans.  the guy behind the counter was unable to explain the difference in the variety of beans they offer.  He seemed frazzled and hyped up on something (maybe too much coffee).  There are other coffee shops nearby that employ professional, knowledgeable baristas."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2015-08-18,5.0,"Try the homemade vanilla latte, it's a divine, sweet, natural taste. Miles better than the fake vanilla syrup at Starbucks.
Friendly service; check the take out window, if in a hurry."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2012-03-16,4.0,"Heading back downtown from my runin with blue bottle, I decide why not take a detour, and head west for round two.

I had bumped into this space a week or two ago, finding my way to Bathtub Gin, the super exclusive let down parked behind.  So I had made a note to check back for coffee soon.

The space is tiny, with three stools, and standing room as well.  That means not a lot of stragglers, and a chance to chat with the barristas.  They are super cool, and pull a shot that is creamy and delicious.  

There is also a window to the street, where they also take orders, a nice addition.  

It's not often I get out to Ninth avenue, and the Western hinterlands, but next time I do, this place will definitely be on my radar."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2014-09-14,5.0,Super friendly.  Called me by name.  No min on credit card.  Insanely good banana bread.  Great coffee.  Walk up window for when you're on your bike or with your dog.  Love.
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2013-08-01,5.0,"While staying around the corner at the Dream Downtown hotel, I was NEEDING some coffee one morning. I thought I would make it to Starbucks being such a sucker for those gold stars accumulating on my app for a free drink, but ended up being gravitationally pulled into Stone Street. 

This seems counter-intuitive, but the walk-up window made me walk inside. Everyone outside just looked so happy. Their dogs looked happy. The barista helping them looked happy. 

Once inside, I saw there was not much seating area, but the service was exceptional and made me wish I was a local.

I ordered a blueberry scone (the pastries are from Amy's Bread) and a soy latte. They have Guatemalan coffee, which makes the coffee dark (almost bitter), but really good.

Being just down the street from Chelsea market, you should make your way over to this little place. All that happiness and they have a membership program for all of you that are as neurotic as me about your accumulation toward free future coffee."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2014-11-11,1.0,"It sounds like this place is really great. Unfortunately I didn't go in because there was a bouncer outside who was bad at his job. 
He kept repeating ""hello"" to me in a way that made me feel like he was just some guy on the street trying to get my attention. My auto response to that is to ignore, plus I've never seen a bouncer outside a coffee shop. By the time I realized what was going on I was annoyed and alienated. 
If there's a speakeasy inside then the bouncer should be inside too."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2016-11-02,1.0,"I visited the chelsea locations, two employees were there. I walked in and both saw me pull out my wallet. Then they ignored me, they even had a conversation in front of me. What the fuck is wrong with this place?  I used to buy coffee bean by the pound, not any more. Fuck you Stone Street."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2013-08-12,4.0,"Cortado fans, assemble! 

You can get an iced coffee or a doppio macchiato anywhere. The places that serve delicious, silky and rich cortados are few and far between. If you're a fan, do yourself a favor and check out Stone Street.

Don't come here with your laptop or a book hoping to crash for an hour. The seating is very minimal (wouldn't even consider it ""seating""), but the coffee is good, the vibe is welcoming, and the cortados are enough to keep me coming back."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2014-05-11,4.0,"Small shop, great iced coffee. It's a grab and go kind of place. Can't wait to come back for the secret bar. They also have macarons, yogurt, fruits, pastry things."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2015-10-11,5.0,"I know everyone says that they know the best coffee spot, but this is truly the best coffee spot in town. I have traveled all over the world and never had a better latte. Brooklyn coffee roasters do the best latte. Definitely a must check out spot for anyone living or visiting in NYC."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2013-04-02,3.0,"Cute small coffee shop. Either walk in on a rainy day or go for the quick pick up by the window!
Coffee a bit too bitter for me but the nice staff will bring me back.
Pastries are from Amy's Bread so probably yummy!"
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2015-08-30,5.0,Continuing our girls day i had a hankering for non-starbucks coffee and we happened upon this hole in the wall. It is a very tiny place and the barista guy was very friendly and knowledgeable. My sis ordered an iced americano and i got a fresh drip pour of the sumatran coffee. The coffee was awesome! Two days later i am still craving it. The prices were fair and the coffee options were endless. There many neat little surprises here so it is so worth the visit!
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2016-01-16,5.0,"Tiny, cozy awesome and sweet barista. Pastries are limited but there drip coffee and espresso coffee is on point."
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2012-08-23,5.0,"The 5 stars are for the coffee being delicious and the service polite. This isn't as much a place to go with other people or while it is busy. It is suuuuper tiny. However, I came here and sat for a while and was surprised, as they had free wifi and were very accomodating. The guy behind the counter, who I believe may also be the manager was really warm and friendly, not only to me but others I saw enter. There were some homeless people that came in and he was really gracious and gave them some water and let them sit for a second before they were on their way. 

They also have a ""walk through"" window which is pretty convenient as well!"
677,stone-street-coffee-company-manhattan,2015-07-22,4.0,"who knew abt the hidden lounge :)....was a sweet find on a sat night...

people walking by would come up to us and ask if we were in line for coffee :) 

crammed for room but good hands behind the bar counter, loved the cocktails"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2020-02-06,5.0,"HOT NEW BAR IN TOWN!!!! I can't believe I missed this bar when it's been open for more than 3 months.

Den Social is a coffee bar by day, and a speakeasy(-ish) bar by night... plus a Karaoke bar in the basement.

The space is gorgeous - sleek, modern, chic. Solid happy hour menu and great cocktails. Perfect spot for drinks after work.

I was here with a pretty big group for a dear friend's farewell and we had enough space, great service, and low noise level to carry out quality conversations.

This is one of those places that you wish no one else finds about... but now that you have, you should visit."
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2020-01-22,5.0,"The cutest hole in the wall cafe a gal can find in this urban jungle! The coffee was made just right & the baristas took the time out to draw me something on my cup sleeve! I'll definitely be returning just to chill & read a book or get some work done while drinking my cup of joe. Plus, I'm feeling the sleek layout of this coffee shop and love the touch of the brick walls (concrete jungle, ya dig?).

Thanks for making hump day a little bit brighter! :)"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2020-05-22,5.0,"So glad I got to check this place out before everything was closing. Cool, hip atmosphere and great cocktails. It duels as a coffee shop during the day, which I missed, but can't wait to check it out. The bartenders make great recommendations catered to your taste. Just ask! There is an upstairs area that was closed off but is usually used for private events. Karaoke was booked for the entire night but we were able to get a spot at their sister karaoke bar, Duet 35. Very friendly staff and reasonable drink prices. The songs are up-to-date and the rooms are great for parties. Hosts check in every so often to see if you need anything and they're pretty good at checking in. I can't wait for these places to open up again!"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-10-03,5.0,"Just found this lovely coffee shop in midtown.
Inside decoration is classic and elegant.
There are few seats in the store, 
I got a vanilla latte. Very smooth with vanilla flavor.
Barista was very friendly, and very comfy spot take short break.
Definitely coming back and try other drinks!"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-11-20,4.0,"Stumbled across this cute new cafe right by Herald Square. It's a cafe by day and karaoke lounge by night! I ordered an oat latte after the barista confirmed they had Oatly milk. While I was waiting for my order, I was able to take a peek at the karaoke lounge behind the doors. It looked really nice! I would definitely come back at night for the lounge. The oat latte was pretty good - minus the latte art. The barista did apologize for her bad artwork, though. There are a few tables and seats (both high and low tables/chairs), if you plan to have your coffee to stay."
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2020-02-19,5.0,"Delicious espresso drinks. Nice and strong. I was worried their pastries  wouldn't be fresh as they only displayed one of each kind on the counter but she gave me oops from a basket under the register, individually wrapped. It was very fresh, crisp and delicious. Very friendly service. This stop wIll be an add on to my routine. Recommend you try. Apparwntly it morphs isn't a karaoke  bar at nig"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-08-27,5.0,"Looovvve this place! It's trendiness hits you in the face and you can't pass up! Came in for a quick pick-me-up and had their iced coffee and croissant! Good prices, tasty coffee, and such a friendly staff! Chin and Kayan (hope that was spelled right) are amazing and so nice! They'll be opening a Cocktail Lounge, can't wait to come visit! I'd give this place 6 stars if I could, come support your local spot :)"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-08-17,5.0,"Nice set up and great coffee. Soon they are opening the lounge and high end bar! Looking forward to visit it.
Stuff are very friendly and definitely will make your day!"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-12-14,5.0,Best coffee in Midtown. Chin and Erica make everyone's morning with their smiles and skill with latte art. Den social is such an awesome addition to the neighborhood. I can't wait to try the karaoke and lounge in the back as well!
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2020-02-18,5.0,"Great cafe to do work by ktown. Big spacious room with limited space.

Back area is a bar and a karaoke bar? It's like a more chick.modern version of the roost in ev I guess.

One day i'll check out the bar but as of now, the cafe will do just fine."
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-09-05,5.0,I ordered off Ritual and didn't know what to expect since it's a new coffee shop. I was very impressed with the space. It was cool and inviting. They have bunch of cute tables. My latte was pretty and delicious. Everyone was nice.
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-09-14,5.0,"I am surprised to find such a high quality cafe in this area. The nitro coffee is one of the best in town! I also tried their sweet croissant which is excellent. It is a great place to hangout, relax and enjoy a cup of coffee."
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2020-02-18,5.0,"Great coffee (I had an oat milk latte), and good service. Clean atmosphere with decent seating."
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2020-02-14,5.0,"Great coffee, go there everyday and I love the coffee, the staff, and the general vibe of the place. There is a cute bar that the coffee place is attached to. Overall the best coffee around my job!"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,"The only question I have for the owners, what took you so long???  This venue is my new favorite spot for happy hour and late night.  An extensive liquor list, friendly bartenders, and amazingly intimate decor, yes I'm a fan.  Also they have a karaoke in the basement, I'm going to just sign a lease and reside in the DEN!"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,I was recommended by a friend and decided to stop by for a study break. Very nice and calm atmosphere and great non-dairy milk options. Loved my latte and the friendly service.
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-08-27,5.0,So glad this cute coffee shop is here! Finally there is coffee shop in this area that serves good stuffs and people who work there know how to smile! And they also have Oatly which helps me a lot (I m lactose intolerant)!!!!!!!!!!!
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-12-30,5.0,"Where do I begin? This place has everything I want for a night out. Cocktails were on point. Bartender Yancy has magic hands and every drink he makes is delicious. Casual hangout on weekdays, but with DJ on weekends, this place turned into a sexy club with beautiful people. If you are single and ready to mingle, this is the place to be! If you want some private and low key entertainment, karaoke rooms downstairs provide the excellent choice. 
If you are tired of the crazy expensive and snobby meat packing spots, definitely give this place a shot. Good vibe, delicious drinks, excellent service and sexy crowd will make your night in town a memorable one!"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-09-12,3.0,"Amazing pastries, great atmosphere and great service. Small place but very inviting. Waiting for the opening of the social club and karaoke !!"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-12-17,5.0,Went here for a cappuccino and a croissant. Both were excellent.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The restaurant is very clean and well kept.
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-10-19,5.0,"What a great small place tucked into the Herald Square neighborhood.  The owner/staff are pleasant and thrilled to have you there. The coffee was prompt and delicious and while I believe they bring the pastries in from somewhere else, the lemon creme filled donut was a nice accent to the rich espresso breve latte served.  When you are tired of the long Starbucks lines culminating in over roasted burnt franchised coffee and sneers from staff who'd rather be scalding their hands in steam then serving you- I'd suggest this refreshing location."
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-11-24,5.0,"Excellent drinks, luxurious interior, above and beyond service. Came all the way from New Jersey with a group of people to see what the hype was about, and let me tell you, the hype is real."
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-10-24,5.0,It is an amazing coffee place that I love to hang out with friends after class. A cup of latte is all I need for the coming winter.
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-08-21,5.0,"I happened to pass by and decided to try their latte which I thought was really delicious because of the velvety texture and nice flavor. Their chocolate croissant is also really good - slightly buttery with a satisfying amount of chocolate in it. 
The decor is really clean and modern, and the staff was super friendly. I'll definitely be coming back!"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-08-14,5.0,"My favorite coffee shop around the area! Employees are amazingly nice and their coffee is great! I love their lattes and the fact that they have four different types of milk: almond, half&half, whole, and oat! Their pastries are really delicious (especially the yuzu one and the sweet croissant). I definitely recommend this place to coffee & pastry lovers :)!"
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-09-23,5.0,Excellent espresso drinks in a very nice small setting. We've visited twice since we are staying in a nearby hotel. The macchiato is my favorite so far although their drip coffee and cappuccinos are also quite good. There is limited seating burnt we got seats on both visits.
678,den-social-cafe-new-york,2019-08-28,5.0,"Den Social is my favorite place to study. This cafe honestly satisfies all five of your senses. The interior is aesthetically pleasing and clean all the time, the smell of coffee being roasted almost every hour gives me content, the drinks and pastries taste exceptional, the music playing is very soothing, and the warmth of the hot coffee in a mug helps me overcome my hypothermia. Not only that, the staff is remarkably engaging !! I love starting and ending my day with den social's matcha latte. It's a great help to a college student who's loaded with classes and assignments !!"
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-16,5.0,"A gem in the neighborhood that's surrounded by touristy shops!!

Coffees taste great and the prices are very reasonable. Staffs are friendly and efficient as well."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-15,4.0,"A cute little spot that I found walking around as I was saying my entire time out there ""The Streets of NY"". I was excited to find this place via Yelp so close to my hotel, as I was on a trip out to NY for work. I was starving and I could not wait to eat and get some coffee, exactly what I did. 

The food and coffee came out quickly and everything was hot and fresh. Definitely worth coming here on a rainy day :)"
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-15,4.0,"Came here for a quick breakfast because the pizza shop next door wasn't open when we got up to go do our business.
We got a coffee, hot chocolate, croissant and muffin. 
Everything was fresh, delicious and just good.
The only reason it loses a star is because the shop was overstaffed for 10am..."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-05,5.0,"Inexpensive, fast, quality.  I always prefer local coffee vendors to Starbucks, so I was glad to see Corvo right next to my hotel.  Corvo helped open my eyes the rest of the way today with a delicious latte."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-18,4.0,"Didn't realize this place is so tiny. There were 6 seats and all of them were hugged by tourists. It surprised me with the draft latte. However, I ordered large and it didn't look like the large latte that you would get from la colombe."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-08,3.0,"We came early morning on a Saturday. Not too busy though I think they just opened. They were limited on certain drinks. I ordered the Nitro Brew but they gave me just a black iced coffee.. so.. that kind of threw me off, but I just went with it. Coffee was great. Satisfied the craving and provided the energy I needed for the long day ahead."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-12,5.0,"The last time I reviewed this place was 2 years ago and I said I wouldn't step back inside. If you read the review you'll see my issue was with a very rude employee whom I had multiple encounters with. Since then, after having to walk by this shop many times, I eventually noticed this particular employee was no longer around (hmm, wonder why!). So, given the convenience of the location and the fact that I did enjoy the coffee at Corvo and I liked their food selection I decided to start giving it a try again. My experience now is the exact opposite of what it was before. The staff is very warm and friendly. Many of them actually take time to ask you how you are doing and don't give you the typical in-and-out/next person feeling that you get at a lot of shops in the busy parts of the city. Granted, I have not gone during very busy hours but I have no doubt this place is now much better equipped with the right personnel to handle prime times. 

Also, the brownies are bomb."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-10,5.0,"Honestly such a gem in midtown! They serve a ton of pastries and breakfast items as well as a solid coffee selection by La Colombe. Best part? Everything is under $4! The barista is so friendly and the service is fast. 
I'm always on the hunt for new coffee shops to get some work done in. Corvo has bar style seating, with small counters and 6 chairs total. Didn't see any outlets, and to my knowledge they don't have any WiFi. Music is on the louder side but they had a Beyoncé playlist on when I was in which I so appreciated. So, probably not the best work spot, but a great place to grab coffee and a snack! Definitely would come back if I'm ever in need of a pick-me-up and in the area."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-08-15,5.0,"Incredibly grateful and impressed by this place!

A hard boiled egg and avocado croissant, plus a cold brew.  Any independent coffee shop could easily charge over $10 for that.  So I happily said ""REALLY???"" when the barista gave me a total much lower than that.

Tasty food, kind staff, clean space & a happy wallet.  Thanks Corvo!!"
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-23,3.0,"I wanted a cup of coffee but I did not want to hike it up to the main drag of the Times Square area. I was pumped when I pulled up my Yelp app and found Corvo right at the corner of the street next to my hotel. It was even more cool that almost everything was $2!

My dad had a flat white and I ordered a white chocolate mocha. Since it was a special, the white chocolate mocha was $3. It was still cheaper than walking to my nearest Starbucks so I didn't mind. The barista expertly made them with La Colombe coffee and had them ready in a short amount of time. We decided to sit for a minute and people watch. The coffee shop is not a cozy, large place that you could sit and work in. There are 4 or 5 seats on a bar that faces the street but that's it.

The coffees were well made but I wasn't really feeling the flavor. Maybe I've been knocked out with the overly sweet coffee from chains? It was a good coffee, but I'm not sure I'd get it again. It's a very good deal though, so if you're in the area it's not a bad choice - but I think there are enough coffee shops in New York that I can try more without having to come back."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2017-12-21,5.0,"It doesn't get any better than this super tiny coffee shop. 
It's located in the Garment District of the city - West 40th street, beside the Double Tree by Hilton hotel. 

We didn't find it through Yelp (gasp!) but found it beside our hotel, and then after Yelping, saw the high rating, and then saw the prices, and I'm just like whoa, whoa, WHOA. 

It's small, only maybe 6-8 seats. Very clean... an ""A"" sanitation rating is posted on their window, which is a thing in NY.  Spread of goodies like bagels (of course) pastries such as croissants, muffins, and so many other goods, and all for $2 EACH. I can't even. I know it's definitely their volume which makes them money. They serve Colombe coffee, which is delicious. Again, only $2 + tax for a medium or large coffee, cappuccino, tea, hot or iced latte, espresso shots, hot chocolate, and Flat Whites, which we chose for our morning drink before boarding the bus back to VA Beach. I also got a bagel with cream cheese, and two Coffee Muffins for the road. Two drinks and three fresh and delicious food items for $10.16?! Almost unheard of in our neighborhood, let alone in a city setting! 

I wish we could have partaken more than once. But this one time was perfect; I highly recommend and I would definitely be back! Kudos to the owner/manager. Keep it up; you're doing it right. Long live Corvo!!"
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-02-06,5.0,"Fast service and good as long as everyone in the line knows what they want. The shop is small but similar to all other coffee shops in NYC. There are 4 small bar top tables by the windows. I like it because then I can people watch. Most people don't stay to drink their coffee. 

Plus is that they actually make a real macchiato. Not the sweetened Starbucks kind. Major plus for serving real coffee and espresso drinks.

The food is good. Not freshly baked goodies but still delicious. My baked good was cold when I ate it so it's most likely refrigerated from another day."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-11,5.0,Small place but great prices!  Blown away by the assortment of pastries/breakfast sandwiches.  We had two coffees and two breakfast sandwiches for less than $12 in NYC?!?  Even went back later for an iced coffee.  Only 6 seats so a great grab and go option or just get there early on a weekend day.  Very close to the whole line of hotels down West 40th.
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-31,4.0,"My drink was only $2 for a small! WHAT?!?! 
Not even Starbucks give you Iced latte let alone NYC with that price especially around Times Square!

This coffeeshop is definitely a solid place to go to get yourself some quality coffee!
They aren't a very big shop but they make great coffees. I got the Iced Latte and I thought  it was quite exceptional.

The wait in line was not too long and after I ordered, my drink came out pretty quick and efficiently. I will most definitely be back for. More coffee! In a very convenient location as well. 

ENJOY!"
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-25,5.0,"I love coming to this place. It's low priced, but quality. From Pastries to Coffee, I always have a great selection to pick from. Been here about 15 times, nearly every day I spend in New York for trips."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-24,4.0,Great little spot for coffee and a danish! The egg and avocado croissant is delicious and they offer non-dairy milk options. The prices are also reasonable. Only reason I can't give this place a 5-star rating is due to a subpar custom service experience.
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2017-09-26,4.0,"Pretty good latte for $2!! Be sure to ask for the small size though. Once I ordered an iced latte and by default they gave me the bigger size and charged me more. So when I questioned it they said it was only for the small iced latte but they did not make it clear -_- so i found that a little shady. Also if you get almond or soy milk there is extra charge. 
But STILL, a small iced almond latte for less than $3 in NYC is a good deal. Pretty nice and bold espresso. 

They have a good selection of pastries, croissants etc. Never tried them myself but they do look appetizing. Small store and no actual seats- some counters by the window for a quick bite. Not the kind of cafe to plop down with your laptop. Definitely more a grab and go spot. Did not see any restrooms either. 

All in all a good choice for more affordable coffee/ espresso drinks right by port authority area nearer to 9th avenue."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2017-08-05,3.0,"It is a great concept and good for people on the go without breaking the bank!! Everything is $2.00, unfortunately there is no decaf coffee for those caffeine intolerant people. 

The muffins are decent, again for $2.00 in middle of NYC you can't go wrong!!! Just remember it is a grab and go type of place."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-06-20,3.0,"Decent coffee shop. I've not tried enough places in Manhattan, but I'm guessing the spacious and luxurious coffee shops I'm used to just don't exist in this over-crowded city.
I had an iced mocha and a muffin, both of which were fairly good but not anything I couldn't have created at my own house. 
The seating is good for people watching, but is not designed for long visits, which was frustrating as I had hoped to read at a coffee shop for at least an hour. If you just need a quick bite or caffeine boost, though, this is a great location for that."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-06,1.0,"Today I encountered three unpleasantries. 1. Everything is no longer just so dollars. 2. The place is a mess. . 3. The young lady behind the counter is super rude.

679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-05,3.0,"The coffee is great and the bagels are toasty. I give them 5 stars for food quality and price. 

I suspect they don't give their employees paid sick time because the barista who made my coffee coughed a storm shortly after she made my latte. I looked at her a bit closer and saw the signs of a bad cold --slightly puffy face, a pale demeanor. She definitely was sick. 

Flu season is coming! November is when it starts. Sick employees should be allowed to stay home without infecting customers."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2017-05-17,5.0,"Not only is the coffee and espresso solid, but also everything is $2!!! 

Great place to grab and go. Service is friendly and quick. There are about 6 bar seats facing the window, so you can sit down and enjoy your coffee and food. But it's not a place for long meetings or working. 

Great coffee for 2 bucks? Hard to beat!"
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-26,5.0,"Love this little spot! Avocado egg croissant is my go to with an almond milk cappuccino. It's always busy but they are pretty quick about getting everything out. Don't expect to sit and stay, it's a to-go type of place."

2. These items are delicious. (You may need to ask to have your pastry heated.)
3. Service is excellent...



You have found a winner."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-04-22,4.0,"I had a hot caramel latte. The coffee was good, it was on the stronger side for a latte which I appreciate. Also got the Apple pocket which was just average for me. So four stars for the coffee and just three for the pastry"
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2016-12-06,5.0,"Day 2: I still need to try their coffee. Today I tried their Spinach and Cheese Pastry which was great. The cheese and spinach had good flavor and the puff was just right. I promise to get the coffee next time for reviewing!

Day 3: I walked in meaning to get a Flat White but when I saw Chai Latte on the menu I had to get it. I'm not a coffee connoisseur but this drink is one of the smoothest I've ever had! The take-out cup is plain, but I'm not a stickler for fancy cups- as long as the contents amaze. One note is that usually coffee gives me a stomachache, but this brand (La Colombe) didn't!  I also got an egg croissant sandwich which I have to say I like better than the egg sandwich because of the soft buttery feel of the croissant vs the baguette bite of the sandwich bread.

Day 4: I'm back again and this time I got a flat white and a different kind of egg sandwich. The sandwich bun was probably the best I've had yet; it was circular and soft like a croissant but not as buttery/greasy. This place might just convert me into a coffee drinker! I wish this place got more business because it fits everything I've ever looked for from a coffee shop."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2019-04-25,2.0,"Unfortunately this place just gets worse over time. The one on 8th Ave is getting better. The consistency of the coffee is improving this one is just bad. They really do not know what a cortado is here. There's so much milk it's like a latte or a warm milkshake with a burnt aftertaste. Please, Corvo, I've been a loyal visitor for a long time. Please train your staff to make a coffee. It doesn't have to be great. Just be as good as your other location."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-14,3.0,"The cafe looks cute but their food was disappointing. I ordered a bagel with egg and cheese. Less than a minute after paying they gave me my bagel, I was surprised it came out that quickly. The cheese was a slice of American cheese, not even melted, still in it's cold square form. There was also a surprise tomato in my bagel which was really disgusting. I don't like tomatoes so to bite into a slimy wet tomato was really gross. I don't even know how that got in there. The bagel was barely heated so I was basically eating a cold bagel. Seemed like the only part of it that was cooked was the egg. I also ordered a hot cocoa, and it tastes exactly like Swissmiss, which is like...ok. Needless to say I am not coming back."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-08-21,5.0,I came by on a busy Monday morning since I work down the block now and they were so quick with my order. I ordered the small chai latte which came out to 2.79. I didn't have high expectations but it was probably one of the best chai I've had in a while. I can't wait to become a regular here and try the rest of the menu!
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-08,3.0,Had the coffee from here once. It was okay. I had great customer service from one of the guys there. But haven't been back since.
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-02,5.0,$2 is a no brainer. I've tried most of the menu items and so far I'm impressed. In particular among the food items  I liked the mozzarella sandwich and the egg/avocado toast sandwich. I'm so glad we have this place in the cesspool that is Port Authority.
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2017-03-26,4.0,"Nice, small coffee bar just south of the Port Authority building on the Ninth Ave side, entrance on 40th St.  I had a large cappuccino and a blueberry muffin, both fine, which came to something over $5.00 with the tax. Seems like the large size coffee was an up-charge from their $2.00 menu. But still cheap enough.

Counter staff were pleasant and processed orders quickly.  Very small area to line up to place your order.  About eight seats at a counter against the window.

Fine if you are in the area, especially if your order is to go."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2017-04-11,5.0,"I was randomly walking to work when I found this cafe, where everything was $2. It helps that the iced soy latte and blueberry scone I got was actually good. 
The baristas were also super happy and put you in a great mood first thing in the morning.
Keep it up corvo cafe!"
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2017-01-30,4.0,"Showed up to have a coffee break before grabbing dinner. I got a flat white while L had a hot chocolate. Everything is $2 with their promotion. There was still a few pastries and sandwiches left but I'd only get that if that was much earlier in the day. 
My coffee was very smooth. I don't normally drink a lot of coffee so L finished the other half... great quality although he normally likes his really sweet. Better than Starbucks any day...
Staff is friendly..."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-04,2.0,"This poor rating is because of a really bad croissant. 

It had a very nice aesthetic, the outside is what led me to try it. The atmosphere was intimate and encourage To-Go orders; there wasn't much seating. The prices a great, but after you try the items you can understand why everything is $2. They serve you quick and did not invite conversation into the transaction. The coffee does not taste great and neither does the croissant. 

Overall, I would go again if it wasn't out of the way; however, this is not the shop for me."
679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2016-11-16,5.0,"I'm so glad this place is here!

Corvo has been open for about a month now, and in that time, they've had a promotion where EVERY item on their menu is $2. Every. Single. Item. That includes all their coffee products as well as their pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and other goodies. I keep going every day, thinking the promotion will end soon, but it's been a solid month and prices are still the same. 

So not only are the prices great, but get this: the coffee is too. They use La Colombe beans and turn out solid lattes, regular coffee, flat whites, or anything you're in the mood for. Best of all, the service is friendly and efficient. I occasionally ask for mochas or flavored lattes with very little syrup, and they have always been happy to accommodate. I've never been disappointed with either my drink or the service. Part of me hopes that Corvo will stay a secret, but part of me is happy to see more people discover it!"

679,corvo-coffee-new-york-2,2018-03-08,2.0,This place was next to our hotel and I walked past it every morning to go to take the subway. I got an almond croissant and it was super cold. I don't know if they had an option to pop it in the oven real quick. They were so packed and I guess I was supposed to ask for them to warm it up. It also didn't help that it was 30 degrees outside with a cold croissant.

680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2020-02-28,3.0,"I happened to be in NY for the day for work and of course it was ridiculously windy and cold. With my face half frozen tears running down my face a friend of mine referred me to one of the few places near the office to grab a warm drink. (The office is in Chelsea.) This coffee spot is great for popping in for a quick coffee. They have an array of milk options whether they be regular milk, oat, almond etc.. virtually nothing they make there has added sugar or sweeteners so you're looking for that I'd say stop and go to Starbucks between 10th and 11th ave. They also have a small assortment of savory scones and pastries and fresh juices. Pro tip: they are a little pricey but the price of coffees are pretty moderate. I'd probs just come here for coffee only as the pastries were a little dry, but overall I'm not disappointed."
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2019-09-18,5.0,"The BEST oat milk latter you'll ever have! 

COFFEE // I ordered the Oat Milk Draft Latte (served cold) to go and oh my gosh! This is the most delicious coffee beverage I have EVER had. I've hopped on the oat milk trend and have had my fair share of oat milk lattes. I would have to say that the one at La Colombe is by far the best. It is so nice, rich, and creamy. The oat milk adds such a velvety richness that takes away from the bitter-y coffee taste. I would highly recommend this! 

SERVICE // The service here was good - They let me try the Oat Milk Draft Latte before purchasing it to make sure that I like it! The service was friendly and gave me a little bit of a hip vibe.

PRICE // It's definitely on the pricier side, but it's so delicious that I would spend the money on the quality of the latte! 

I still crave the Oat Milk Draft Latte and am excited for my next visit to New York! 10/10 would recommend"

I had to try this place when I walked passed it. Also, I was 2 hours early for an event to go to so I had plenty of time to kill.

The Americano was mean. It was bold, strong, and NY pricing. Felt robbed buying this cup. Would I buy it again? 100% yes. It was very good."

The oatmilk adds a little nutty flavor to the coffee. The coffee flavor itself is perfect as it's not overpowering. All the flavors and textures were balanced. As a non-coffee drinker, I am converted!"
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2019-09-07,5.0,"I love this place! I always make a stop here whenever I'm in NYC. It's origins are in Philly but there are many locations in NY. Each one has a chill vibe but there is some serious coffee happening here. I love the smooth, well-balanced flavor of their coffee. Cortado, cappuccino, cold brew, single origins...they are all delicious! During these hot summer days I've been loving their draft nitro brew. I go for the Black & Tan, which is a half and half mixture of the black nitro brew with the draft latte.  You'll pay about $4.50 for one, but it is worth the splurge.  The first sip has a super creamy taste, almost buttery. As you let the two combine, it's the perfect balance. Sugar is not even necessary. These guys love coffee and love their product. Every time I've gone, I can tell they love what they do - which makes the experience that much better."

I ordered their regular house coffee and as expected, it was delicious. 

They have some counter seatings, a few tables (I think six tables for two) and counters without seats. When it's not busy, I think it's a great location to catch up with friends. If you're looking for a new work spot, not sure if it's the best. From where I sat (at one of the tables), I didn't see any outlets and didn't seem like they had WiFi either. But if you don't need either of those, I think this spot will work. Not sure how comfortable you'll be if it gets crowded since seating space is limited though."

I said maybe ask them for more chocolate Bc last time it didn't taste like a mocha at all. Omg this time, it tasted even worse!!! Like, I drank 5 sips Bc you know I've already paid $5, but then after that I just couldn't do it and just chucked it. It reminded me of old burnt coffee. I don't know what the extra chocolate did, if it was even added, except taste even more bitter and nasty.  I had my coworker tried it Bc he liked his cold brew, and he made the most disgusted face when he tried mine lol.

First time: Ugh we were shooting our tv show  halfway down the street and I desperately needed a mocha and was so excited this was nearby. Got a hot mocha and it looked so pretty! I was so excited for this sweet salvation to save me from falling asleep Bc I was only halfway through my work day. Sadly, it tasted bitter and not chocolate-y at all. Boo! Onto the next coffee."

I always come to this coffee shop and everyone is so kind and nice.
Today, my co workers and I ordered 11 drinks. That being said - cashier woman was nice and another woman behind the bar ( the actually people interacting with us).

While we were sorting out our drinks - I asked if they had a permanent marker so I can mark each drink. I don't think this is an outrageous ask especially from a coffee shop. So that woman took it upon herself to say that we should have come prepared if we were going to order all these drinks, that's not what she has to do ...etc etc...

MAM, a simple ""no"" could have been suffice and without your attitude. I get people have bad days but holy shit- if you don't like your job- leave. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. 

So rude to customers who just spent a lot of money."

With three additional people in front, no one bothered to take anyone's order for a long time. I gave up on the croissant and sat back down. 

The coffee, on the other hand, was amazing!! While both their draft latte and regular latte are delicious, I'd recommend the draft latte if you're undecided!! It was so smooth and airy. 

I mainly visited to study and the space is very large and well-suited for studying. However, there are only two tables with access to outlets and no wifi is available. It was also FREEZING in here! 

It's not much of a group friendly space since all tables are fixed and accommodate 2 people each. There are standing tables to crowd around though."

However it is a short 5 minute walk from the Highline and about a 15 minute walk from the 23rd street station.  So if you are walking the High Line keep this spot on your agenda.  It's the perfect place to relax before getting ready to go out to a show or out on the town.  You'll love it. 

The space is great, lots of wood and brick in what looks like an old terminal or warehouse near the Hudson.  Lots of room and seating options as well and big windows for lots of light coming in, a perfect place to relax on a winter or summer day, it has that warm cozy feel, but also that cool hip feel for summer.  

Love the cold Chai draft latte very refreshing on a hot late May walk on the High Line."

It's a nice, spacious coffee shop with plenty of seating. I now see that they actually have little coffee menus now. I opted for a black cold brew and a triple shot of iced espresso with foam. The cold brew was excellent, and the iced espresso foam tasted like the best part of a nitro cold brew.

Definitely worth a visit"

680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2018-08-24,3.0,"We camped out here to hide out form the rain a few weeks ago. The seating area is huge, so we didn't have any trouble finding a seat. I got a tea, and my bf got a regular coffee. There was nothing special about this place, not particularly good nor particularly bad, but I was a little turned off by the cups that they used. They had a grime-y kind of feel and had some tea/coffee stains that were off putting. With NYC's massive selection of cafes to choose from, this one just wouldn't be on the top of my list next time."
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2019-09-27,5.0,"My friend told me her favorite coffee drink is from La Colombe. It is now my favorite too. 

The draft latte with oat milk is frothy and the perfect balance between bitter & sweet. It feels like a warm hug. 

I'm so grateful to have discovered this place and I look forward to trying more of their drinks. 

Any cold drink recommendations? I appreciate it greatly. Thank you!

* Draft Latte with Oat Milk: I recommend asking them to go light on the ice. This way you will get a diversified sense of temperature furthering the experience of the beverage. *"
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2019-07-15,4.0,Love their coffee always.  Always pick up a box to bring and make at home.  Unfortunately seem to to be out of Phocea which is my husbands favorite.  But really do appreciate the free coffee if you buy the beans.  No matter what it's still great coffee
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2019-05-19,3.0,Serves great coffee and bad attitudes. Would like more power outlets since they are awkwardly placed
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2019-05-22,5.0,This location of La Colombe just started using plant-based and compostable straws! Now their containers are as sustainable as their coffee products are delicious. Please keep purchasing eco-friendly products and consider displaying signs that educate patrons about your sustainable choices!
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2017-08-10,4.0,"One of my favorite coffee chains in Manhattan! Love the nitro brew drip latte.. or something along the lines of that. Plenty of seating and natural lighting, as well as plenty of covfefe options to choose from. This location has the vibes of an ~aesthetic~ Greenpoint coffee shop, without having to travel all the way out there. Prices are average for a cup of joe in Chelsea, friendly baristas, fresh cut flowers in glass vases when we went. Would definitely come back here to work if I were in the Hudson yards area again!"
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2016-06-26,5.0,"I was in the area waiting for an event to start (otherwise I don't think I would ever have come to this location). This La Colombe is on the newer side (just a few weeks old when I went in mid-June). It's spacious, clean, and very modern. There's seating at the ""bar"", at tables, and even little nooks by the back, where the bathrooms are.

We did two of their drip coffees. They had this drip cones that actually seeped the grounds before dripping them into the cup, which was cool. Hadn't seen one of those before. The coffees weren't cheap. Depending on which beans you get, you're looking at around $7 apiece, but you're also paying for quality and labor. The guy making our coffees put a lot of time and effort making sure everything was perfect. And it was!"

680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2017-04-08,4.0,"What a find

I do hope they stay open till the construction upheaval around them is over. If you want a secluded spot snack in the middle of city to have a cup and study or work on your laptop or just enjoy the calming old hardwood floor covered interior with wooden tables and soft lighting you found it

The mocha latte was smooth and refreshing on a crisp cool April day. The staff is friendly and the bathroom clean!"
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2018-04-07,3.0,"Coffee was very good, pastries were decent.  It's cramped compared to their Philly location on Frankford Ave.  That is somewhat expected,  but having tables a couple feet away from the restrooms is kind of gross.
It is still a good spot to quickly grab a coffee before or after gallery crawling in Chelsea."
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2016-11-13,1.0,"Product is good, but the staff was really rude to a costumer who was filming himself and friends not disturbing anyone. They told him they didn't want his kind in the shop. Just for that I will never go back! Chill out La Colombe, don't let petty stuff ruin your day...
We need diversity everywhere, we want Augie!"

680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2016-07-10,5.0,"Coffee heaven! Huge red brick lined, light corner space with ample and spacios seating .this is a serious coffee house. The brews are all top- notch and made super well, but the draft latte is the best coffee drink in town. It's cold espresso with a nitrogen foamed top and has a natural sweetness and sweet coffee flavor. Regular coffee and regular milk in the draft latte but they are experimenting and in the meantime it knocks iced coffee into the Hudson!"
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2017-06-26,3.0,"When first walking in, I thought this location would be my perfect new study spots--a lot of wide open space and ample seating. I ordered a pour over iced coffee upon the recommendation of the barista, and was not impressed. It almost tastes like a tea, rather than a coffee, super light. I wanted to purchase a pastry but at the time I came, noon, the pastries looked a little old. Finding out that there was no wifi, okay, but at a place like this I feel like its expected. I tried to do some work but the music is super loud so after a little bit of frustration, I left. The place has a lot of potential, but definitely didn't live up to my expectation from my experience at La Colombe in Philadelphia."

680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2016-07-17,4.0,"So excited to have a location (relatively) close to me! I came on a Sunday afternoon and this place was completely empty, with the exception of one customer that was taking her drink to go.

The draft brew was just as good as the ones I've had at other La Colombe locations, so kudos to their consistency. Baristas were friendly. Drink came out immediately (was likely easy to do at this time since the place was empty).

Location itself is spacious, bright, and clean. I'll be using this as my new study space in the future."
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2017-04-23,5.0,"Probably my favorite location in the city. I happened to stumble upon this La Colombe completely by chance while making my way to the Auto Show, and was delighted to find it. The location is HUGE! Tons of seating, nice marble counters, a lovely view of Lamborghinis in the windows of Manhattan Motorcars across the street. The espresso is just as good as the other locations, but I totally love this space. Came on a Sunday and it was empty, which is a pleasant surprise compared to the bustling ones downtown. The staff is friendly and chill. It is definitely out of the way for me, but when in the area, I now know where to go for my caffeine fix."
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2018-07-15,1.0,I used to love La Colombe Coffee for the high quality of coffee and atmosphere. Only the atmosphere remains. The coffee is now just the same average quality as Starbuks. I ordered cappuccino. The foam was weak and the coffee did not taste good.
680,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-6,2017-09-09,4.0,Pretty cute place with a nice atmosphere. Spent seven something on a medium ice coffee and chocolate croissant.  The staff was quick and friendly. I would definitely come back if in the neighborhood.
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2020-01-11,5.0,"I'm one of those ""I have two types of coffee drinks I always get"" and I never really try anything else. But I'm incredibly glad we stopped here for some caffeine because the iced ginseng ginger latte is amazing. You can't beat fresh ginger chunks! Try it with soy or almond milk - it's not overly sweet and the ginger flavor comes through really well."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2020-04-02,4.0,"Copying my review from Besfren (https://www.yelp.com/biz/besfren-new-york) as a large majority of the reviews for here are from there also as these places occupy the same storefront.

As this is the ginseng side: My preference is the ginseng latte as it's more pure. In terms of otherwise, the maple ginseng cappuccino is an interesting mix of sweet and bitter and it makes some great wake-up energy in the morning. The ginseng coconut drink is also excellent, super refreshing.

Review for the other place edited for more recent thoughts:

Note: If you like the drinks here (which I recommend over the sweets,) you can ask for as card, 10 drinks and you get a free one.

They added a Teapuccino menu, which is 4.50 (well 4.90 with tax) for a small (only small, I think 12 oz.) In short a teapuccino is basically a tea latter but with well Cappuccino style milk. Flavors include earl grey, matcha, and surprisingly taro.

While I have had better Matcha in the area (for the price I'd easily go to Ippodo or Blank Slate Tea,) the Taro is unique and delicious. I'd recommend it."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2019-07-28,5.0,I love the taro and green tea ice cream. It was about $6. I also occasionally buy the Korean ginseng packets from them. They have Korean ginseng on sale during Lunar New Year and Mother's Day.
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2019-10-02,5.0,"They have absolutely amazing ice cream! 
We also got the bunny tails(?) which are like cream puffs but with ice cream inside! These are also sooooo good! 
The price is reasonable and the portions are big!
The seating is a little tight as it is combined with a ginseng store but overall great place for softserved matcha/taro ice cream!"
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2018-10-18,4.0,"Ginseng latte? Right, I had the same thought. It's a cute little café attached to a ginseng shop. I came in super early waiting for the Empire State building to open so I can skip all the line. I ordered the ginseng ginger latte and a doolly mini chiffon cake. The ginseng latter was a meh but the mini chiffon cake was like crack. It was so good that I want to order a box of them. I would have licked everything but  I was sitting next to a window and there were a lot of people walking by looking at me looking at them.

Come in and try their cakes!"
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2018-08-21,4.0,The cafe was clean and cute but it is on the pricier side. Got the rose lemonade drink and it was definitely lemony and refreshing. My boyfriend got the taro and matcha ice cream which is very aesthetically pleasing. It tasted wonderful as well however we realized that it's hollow in the inside so you're paying a lot for the aesthetic value. The cafe is small and there's a few tables but it was all filled up when I was there. Probably sits about 20 people at most. Overall it's an okay place but not recommended if you're not into the price.
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2018-03-22,3.0,"So I got off the Manhattan shuttle bus from King Spa and stumbled on this Korean cafe. They had the cutest, but pricey!, looking pastries, which were labeled as Besfren pastries. Roll cakes seemed pretty popular, as well as the French items. Cookies and chaps (chapsal dduk - korean rice cake) pies didn't look appealing. They also have a Matcha & Taro swirl that I would have tried, were the weather 40F degrees warmer. I get that this is a ginseng themed cafe, but I'd much rather buy the real deal & boil it up myself, and control the sugar additive. So no, didn't try their signature drinks.

Ordered the red ginseng roll cake, and 2 mini cakes - the Beauty & the Beast. Trust me, it was not intentional. The Beauty is berry based and the Beast is a tiramisu. I got home and was so disappointed that the roll cake I ordered wasn't the Red Ginseng!! It was the Milk. The roll was good, but I wanted to try the ginseng!! They wet the bready part of the roll with a sugar syrup that wasn't to my liking. But the cream was ok. 

I think I was all sugared out after trying the cream puff from B&S. Or the puff was so impressive, these pastries were slightly underwhelming. I would buy the Red Ginseng roll cake as a gift to friends, but I don't believe the mini desserts are worth it. I would come back again to soak in the atmosphere."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2018-02-12,5.0,"Nothing taro-ble to complain about at this café! 

Tip #1- get the taro teapuccino! It's divine, so smooth, and one of the most memorable coffee drinks I've ever had. It has the perfect amount of milk, and the taro flavor doesn't taste articial. 

Tip #2: get the taro ice cream. Full of taro flavor and is super creamy and delicious. The swirl of colors and the flower in it makes it so beautiful, not to mention Instagram-worthy for all you millennials out there. 

Tip #3: don't try the ginseng they have on the shelves like I did, because it is not edible!"
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2017-12-16,5.0,Outstanding almond croissants and quiches.  Rapid service and competitive prices.  Very enjoyable visit.
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2018-01-20,5.0,"This is a tiny dessert spot in Korea Town NYC. The service is fast and great. I bought the taro ice cream on a cone, which was delish! And a macadamin cooke that was freshly baked! Lovely and enjoyable."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2018-01-18,3.0,"Not bad boba. I think their matcha soft serve and other deserts are better. The service could be faster as it took some time despite the place being basically empty. Also somewhat pricey for what you get, but that may be New York."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2017-12-16,4.0,"A very odd idea to have medical roots at a corner of the NYC K-town block surprisingly did well. Their ginseng, yuja and other Korean and higher quality coffees and unique and delicious desserts served their customers well. Their WiFi and small seating area attracts customers to ask about Korea's treasured ginseng that supposedly cures everything. Really appreciate this place!"
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2018-04-20,3.0,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Something was happening that day because the half of the cafe was submerged in about 1/4 inch of water. I was also confused about the location because its ""Korean Red Ginseng"" but also ""Best Fren."" This location is a combination of a cafe and traditional tea shop. 

ATMOSPHERE: It was crowded and I couldn't find seats in the cafe. (There are about 6 tables). The tables are right by large windows where you can watch the street. A lot people were just ordering desserts or drinks for pick up. 

DRINKS: I tried the taro milk tea. It was very tasty! My friend got the matcha green tea and that was also very good too. Between the two, I really liked the taro. It was sweet, but not good sweet. 

SERVICE: When we originally got our orders, we got two matcha green teas instead of a matcha and taro. When I told the cashier of the mistake, she did not apologize for the mistake and looked annoyed that I told her the order was wrong. Not a big deal, but it rubbed me the wrong way. 

Overall, I would definitely come here again if I was in the area and wanted a drink. Given the amount of cafes in NYC that serve matcha and taro drinks, I think I would go to a different cafe if I wanted a good ambiance."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2018-01-21,4.0,"This is such a cute and unique little cafe. They specialize in cookies and little desserts but every one ventures here for the taro and matcha ice cream specifically. 

I think Insider featured them for the huge chocolate chips cookies they have but I didn't try that. 

I had the taro ice-cream and this little matcha filled bun that they put a bunny cookie on which is deemed the ""matcha bunny."" 

The taro was super creamy and not too sweet which is the best. Go and try a cone. 

The cafe is a decent size but there aren't too many places to sit and enjoy. Only 3 small tables."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2018-11-30,4.0,"First time trying their matcha and taro ice cream in a cup. The taro flavor tasted natural, no pungent artificial scent. Not certain about the food coloring, if any, that was used for the taro flavor. The matcha tasted authentic and makes you go back for a second bite. Overall, the sweetness level is higher than I normally prefer but it's not too bad if two people who aren't big sweet tooth share the ice cream! Would want to go back and try the cream puff taro bunny tail."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2017-11-09,4.0,Very cute cafe in Koreatown. I had the Ginseng Latte which was delicious. I want their other ginseng teas and drinks. Definitely will be back. Friendly staff and the prices are decent. I haven't had ginseng in years. I am going to buy some Korean Red Ginseng for my tea collection again.
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2017-01-17,5.0,I came back here for try their donuts and other drinks. I tried maple ginseng cappuccino and it was so so good!!!! Very smooth and tasty!!! I tried their signature chiffon donut with green tea flavor. It was not too sweet and pretty light. It's covered chocolate frosting and filled with cream. I liked it!!! It's usually busy so hard to get a seat but it's worth to try here!! I would come back here to try other sweets and drinks. Their tea latte series sound good!!!
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2018-09-29,5.0,Best cold passion fruit tea. Had to go back for seconds. Tried two of their treats that were just super yummy. Wish I could take you back to Miami
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2017-02-13,1.0,"We spend about $300 here on ginseng dose here & all of us took ginseng juice ! What I most hated about this place is a young Girl constantly glued to her phone when I wanted to ask her something & deposit a camera which belonged to a tourist who was sitting right next to us.She has no acknowledgement, it's a blank look,  & nothing to say even when the camera was on the counter top! 
Hello ! 
Will u Let your employees forbid using phones when they are at work or keep it behind the desk.This was really annoying & I hate to see people blocking the way texting in the middle of the streets ! Hello get the F off to the side & do it. Similar damn situation everywhere."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2016-04-04,3.0,"Ginger. Ginseng. What?

I was extremely intrigued by their drinks menu and decided to get myself a ginger ginseng latte. The menu almost made me believe it was going to be the next big thing, like matcha. However, from the beginning, I knew it was a long shot. Afterall, ginger only appeals to a selected few.

I love coffee/latte, ginger and ginseng. However, the combination just didn't hit it for me. Starting off, I didn't taste much of the caffeine in the drink. Most likely, this is because of the overpowering ginseng, or how do I put it, the GINSENG CANDY taste. If you grew up in an asian household, you would know what I mean when I say this drink tastes like an overly sweet ginseng candy. Maybe the barista didn't stir the drink enough, but a lot of the syrup sunk to the bottom so my first sip was very very sweet. I had to stir it quite a few times. but even after that, the drink was still a little sweet. One thing I like about the drink is the little ginger pieces in the drink. Really gives the drink a great texture. Overall, I liked the thought of the drink, but the execution was somewhat of a disappointment. 


I do love the set up of the store. The barista was also extremely friendly. I think I will come back to taste their regular coffee offerings and sweets next time. They look AMAZING."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2015-12-31,5.0,Try their ginseng ginger latte! Might sound weird but it tastes very good! I also bought their sliced ginseng and ginseng extract. Next time I'll try their desserts! They have some Korean desserts there seem really cute!

Anyway, got a large iced coffee which was average. I took a bite out of my boyfriend's triple chocolate chip cookie but wasn't wow-ed.

There's some seating and a limited selection of pastries. I wouldn't go out of my way to get back here."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2016-06-07,2.0,"I went to buy ginseng. I saw this female employee using her phone as soon as I got into the place. I didn't mind whether she is using her phone or not since there was only cafe customers, however she looked at me and totally ignored me. I said hi to let her know that I'm here to buy some of ur product but she just ignored me and kept using her phone. Not only that, I was actually looking for specific product that I usually get but wanted to try some other product so I asked her for recommendation and tell me little bit about the difference between two products. Unfortunately she didn't know anything about the product that she is selling. I really wish that they come up with better customer service and at least train employee about the products that they are selling."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2016-12-03,5.0,"I love this place, I love ginger and red ginseng (though I'm not sure how much they put in their beverages, lol red ginseng is pricey). Whenever I need a pick me up I often come here, ginger and red ginseng can fuel you more than coffee I think! It's not more expensive than Starbucks or your other coffee shops. I have a strong sweet tooth so the cakes or roll cakes are a definite must try!!!! Musttttt!!! The flavors are very aromatic and delicate. There is some seating on the side of the shop but it's more of a grab and go place. They also sell Korean red ginseng products in the coffee shop as well. :))"
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2015-05-14,5.0,"Recently renovated to remove the bar tables so now it's small cute tables only. Definitely not a place to study as you can barely fit your laptop on the table or sit on one of those low chairs for too long. The atmosphere is calming and quiet, so it's a nice place to catch up with a friend or watch the crowds go by unperturbed...or have a morning date with your S.O. (here's to hoping!) I ordered the Morning Special, which is an iced banana misugaru (12 grain) smoothie with cereal flakes blended in so that it's pleasantly crunchy. It's also very filling and pretty sweet, so you should have energy enough for the whole day!

I got to sample the Chaps Pie ($1.99), which is short for Chap-sal (rice flour). It's basically a square rice cake that's lighter than usual and very pleasantly chewy. A small snack to chew on. 

I would definitely order both again, as they have the balanced sweetness that I like, and fool me into thinking I am eating healthy...heh. Could definitely make a habit of this place!"
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2016-08-16,3.0,Decent place to have some desserts and chat with friends. Desserts look really nice but taste just fine.
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2016-07-08,4.0,The ginseng latte tastes like hot milk. Nice atmosphere and interior design. The customer service people were noticeably friendly.
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2013-08-02,4.0,"Korean tea cafe with a focus on ginseng. The decor is modern and bright. I had a ginger ginseng tea and a peanut butter cookie. Both were delish and the tea was packed with slivers of fresh ginger! The tea was a too sweet for me but next time I will just ask for it unsweetened. 

Watch out, it's a bit pricy for tea. But it's fancyyyy tea so I guess it's understandable. I definitely shall return."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2014-01-23,4.0,"I feel so lucky to live directly above this korean ginseng cafe, their selection and service are great every time.

In the morning they offer Breakfast special - Coffee and a Bagel W/cream cheese for $2.75, and they open at 7:30am SHARP.

Their ginseng tea selection is vast. They have specialty ginseng-juice drinks and I've had the ginger and citron ginseng options.  Both are on the sweeter side, and unfortunately they can't adjust the sweetness level because the juice mix are pre-made. Sorry I had to duct a star for this.

For dessert,  I always come here for Van Leeuwen ice cream. They serve about 5 flavors here (strawberry, earl grey, pistachio, ginger and mint) Its not particular cheap/freshly made per se, but having this quick access to my favorite ice cream is pretty amazing."

This week's been hot...and I mean HOT, HUMID, and just nasty. I really needed something COLD and refreshing to quench my thirst before hopping onto the 6 train and wanted something 'healthy' and not 'coffee' so decided to try this place out as I've seen people (noth Korean and non-Koreans) buy drinks there and sit for a while. After browsing through the menu, I decided to get the Butternut Squash smoothie which contained Butternut Squash, Spinach, Mango, Carrot, and Greens. Cashier guy was friendly and my drink came out in less than 5 minutes. I took a sip expecting to taste funny/weird but it was actually pretty tasty!! On the other hand, the downsiide of the smoothie might be that the Mango flavor was pretty strong...so strong that it took over other flavors I thought I was just drinking a Mango Smoothie. 

There are other smoothie and their signature and cafe drinks that I'd like to try some time as it's pretty unique.

The location is perplexing b/c it's near the Empire State Building and Koreatown both areas are highly trafficked by tourists yet no one really knows about this place which allows for a calm & quiet atmosphere. It's definitely a well kept secret for tea aficionados and healthy living enthusiasts. 

This is a cafe is simple - ginseng served as a tea or latte as well as offer fresh juice mixes (that might include ginseng). It's a fantastic concept and look forward to trying as many items on the menu as possible."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2014-07-18,4.0,"I only stopped in here to have a chat with a friend while waiting for others to arrive. It was a nice cozy little shop with some super friendly staff.

The desserts were pretty choice too. I had the pastry with the chocolate chunks in it and my friend had the espresso muffin or something. We asked for both to be slightly heated up so the contents inside melted a little more and they happily obliged.

The place a a little small but it did have enough seating to not turn away any customers.

I'd come back here for a quick stop again and I recommend you do too."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2016-01-18,5.0,"This review is solely based on the roll cakes I've tried. I ate the green tea and milk roll cake slices and they were delicious! I usually don't like overly sweet cakes, but these had the perfect amount of sweetness so you don't get sick of them easily. The green tea cream in the cake had a pretty strong matcha flavor so I enjoyed it a lot. My friend bought it for me so I don't know the price, but I'm definitely coming back!"
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2013-05-03,4.0,"Amazing little Korean Tea place. I don't think its very well known, but its fantastic. I love their decor, the ginger roots in the window, free tea samples, and simple seating. Everything is simple and delicious and good for you.

Love it!"
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2015-03-17,5.0,"Cafe G is a Marvelous place that's often overlooked. I stumbled upon this place when waiting for my friends for the wonderful restaurant upstairs, Soju Haus. 
Cafe G is a store that sells almost everything korean ginseng related, from actual ginseng slices to ginseng cosmetics to ginseng tea, to ginseng latte. My personal favorites are Ginseng Latte and their candies. Some of the things on the menu may seem overpriced, but when you consider the circumstances of the product being a luxury imported product - it is honestly really fair. Their sources of korean ginseng is imported from south korea and mostly aged 6 years before hitting the shelves. Staff is extremely nice and very sociable. There are also outlets below the every seat in the bench areas if you need to keep your phone or laptop charged. 
I personally recommend trying the gingseng latte HOT. It tastes overly saturated with creamer in cold. 

Also, gingseng is known among asians for energy-boosting uses and to help sober up. 
Note: if you have high blood pressure, i recommend you to consult your doctor because ginseng naturally raises your blood pressure."
681,korean-red-ginseng-new-york-2,2015-06-30,5.0,"It was really good! I need this cafe near my office! 
I think better than drinking coffee! Oh, but their coffee is very cheap!"

Will definitely come back here. The only bad thing is that they don't have many tables, probably sit in the counter area will be the only option during rough hours."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2018-01-23,4.0,"I prefer HiLine Nespresso pods over the ones from Nespresso for two reasons:
1. The coffee is fresher. It's roasted weekly, as opposed to months in advance.
2. I don't have to buy so much coffee just to fill the shipping box from Nespresso. The order from Nespresso would last me about a year, and of course, got staler as the months went by. With HiLine, I can buy as much or as little as I want.

I only wish they would offer at least one more decaf option - and make it stronger. Just because people can't handle caffeine, doesn't mean they don't deserve options."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2020-02-13,1.0,"I'm sad to review this as a 1* as I've previously loved using this company. Instead of the usual Bed Bath & Beyond kcup pods, every once in a while I love treating myself to a mailing of HiLine pods. They are on the expensive side, but I always thought worth it - until my most recent shipping. 
First is a problem they credited me for, but I think it's important to note. In my order, I purchased a de-scaling powder to clean my Keurig (usually clean it with vinegar, but thought why not) and when it came, there were no real instructions. I know HiLine doesn't have a phone number, so I called the # on this powder pkg about how to use it and they said that package should never be used for a Keurig machine and it is dangerous. They said for Keurigs, they only sell a pod with the cleaner in it. So, although HiLine refunded my money after telling them this story, they assured me it was testing in Keurigs and it was fine (but again, the actual manufacturer said do not use it)....
Aside from that, I ordered 4 different flavors and now I have had time to try each flavor, they all taste like dirty water! It's crazy to me how this order could be so different from the others. I just emailed them (again) to say the coffee tastes terrible and also that the tops of the kcups keep peeling off while in the Keurig, so I'm ending up with grinds in my cup, but I'm so grossed out by the tastes.
I hope I can get my money back because I'll be throwing away all unused pods (and they are many)."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2020-06-09,1.0,"Good coffee and a wide variety. Pods have some issues as they are very hard to ""break"" by the machine and there is always one or two broken ones in the bag. Still, I kept buying because the coffee tastes fresh and they have a wide variety of flavors. However this has changed because of their customer service. After missing the deadline to purchase with a discount, I contacted them and Rei told me to buy the coffee and offer a refund equivalent to the discount. I did as I was told. After almost a month and many emails to Rei, the refund was never processed. I was misguided (cheated might be a better word) so I am never buying from this company again and will make sure everybody I know, hears about my bad experience."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2019-11-04,5.0,"I am very impressed with HiLine Coffee Pods!

1) I use a Nespresso Pixie and have shopped around to find an alternative to the Nespresso brand pods for a few years. HiLine coffee tastes so much fresher. Typically when you get a bag of generic pods there is no coffee smell. The moment you open the HiLine packages you can smell the roast. The shot pulls for a few extra seconds with the HiLine pods, but I think it's because the coffee is fresh so the water is coming in contact with all the grinds, unlike other products that where the water only filters through half of the year old vacuformed grinds. I prefer the variety and product of the HiLine pods better than the Nespresso pods. 

2) The HiLine customer service is AMAZING! The first order I placed, the pods were not pulling a full shot. There was only a few drops of liquid that would come out. I emailed HiLine and almost immediately they responded. I talked with Rei, who was very helpful. He got a replacement shipment out ASAP and the new pods worked perfectly. It was so nice to be able to talk with a person on the other end. I was weary of not being able to buy the product from Amazon (because of the convenience) but HiLine exceeded any expectation that Amazon has. 

Great Coffee, Great Variety. Great Company!"

Not sure about you, but I expect delivery much sooner than that and not to have to track down where they sent the order or email constantly asking for updates.

Never received any shipping information. Logged on a week later and my order was listed as cancelled. No notification of the cancelled order, the ""backorder"" or any delay.

682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2018-11-04,1.0,"False advertising
I've been a repeat customer and always enjoyed their keurig pods, fun flavors and the fact it was supporting a home-grown business. However after this last order i will not order again. This past order contained VERY EXPIRED PRODUCT!
Honestly i envisioned that they were running a Make to Order production line, but when my Oct. 23 order contains product that was BB-Feb2018 and BB-Sept2018 I have to provide feedback.  I noticed in the other product the pods no longer show the BB date, perhaps they've had this problem before...
 
HiLine coffee claims on the packaging: 
1) ""This coffee is roasted just prior to shipping...""  
2) ""Roasted to Order""

I beg to differ HiLine - i hope you correct your process, or your advertising."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2019-07-09,2.0,Their coffee is good. Their online customer service is terrible. I was told I could not add an additional pouch of coffee to my monthly autoship plan.
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2016-02-11,1.0,"While their coffee is good, their Nespresso caps are junk. Most of the caps are so tightly packed that the water can barely push through, after about a minute of trying my machine just stops trying and shuts off. Once you release the pod the foil cover pops open, shooting coffee grounds into the used capsule container.

Also, the foil seal on the top of the caps sometimes is loose. Its so loose that when I pop a cap into the machine, holes wont punch through the foil resulting in my machine shutting down. 

I ordered 4 different types of coffee and each bag has the same issue. When a cap actually does work, the coffee is delicious. However I'm afraid that the back pressure being caused by the caps is damaging my Nespresso machine. 

Naturally I emailed customer service to find out if maybe I had a bad lot, no response. With this experience I wouldn't order from HiLine again. Ill just stick with the original Nespresso capsules. Remember, in some cases you get what you pay for."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2019-04-05,5.0,I prefer HiLine coffee to Nespresso! Their flavors are superior to Nespresso!

HiLine might get shut down due to their ""theft"" of Nespresso's intellectual property."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2017-11-09,3.0,"I was actually liking the company for Nespresso pods, but they have an auto ship that runs in the background and charges $5 for shipping. This means I have to log in and turn this feature off. I tried to get their phone number to get the shipment cancelled ($5 shipping for one small bag of 20 pods is crazy) and found out they don't have one. They really need to walk through the customer experience and not have additional tasks for me in my already busy day.

Editing to 3 stars as they've stopped the auto shipments and credited back my account. Would be 4 stars if I didn't have to deal with the opt out. And 5 stars if they had more flavor. We'll probably stick with them."

I'd order and have it within 2 days but last time I ordered from them it was two weeks and my order was still ""pending shipment"" I had to contact them then all of a sudden it went out that day. I placed another thinking maybe it was just a mishap....it's now almost a week and still pending shipment. Very disappointed."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2016-11-28,1.0,"The star is only for their customer service. They were prompt and helpful and I am grateful for that. 

Per other reviews, the pods are overfilled and foil seal is very very thin. Stick with Nespresso. 

My biggest complaint is their inaccurate marketing. They claim to roast before shipping. Not true. Both my original and replacement bags were roasted in June per the date stamp. When I contacted customer service they promptly sent me a new bag. From the same batch. Same roast date. My first and last purchase from HiLine."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2018-06-10,4.0,"I tried the HiLine nespresso pods a year or so ago and sent them back because some of the pods were ok and with others, the coffee just dribbled and seemed to not work in my machine. I'm not sure if it was the grind they were using or the amount.  However I read recent reviews and decided to try again. So far they've been great! I went through one bag of Greenwich Village roast and am a few pods into a Broadway roast. The coffee is fresh and full bodied and there's been no issue with clogging or dribbling with these pods. I assume they must have adjusted something to make them better. Customer service was great both with the previous return and recent purchase."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2017-09-29,5.0,"I've looked at lots of 3rd party pods and reusable pods for the Nespresso.  I tested a few but either they pods didn't work well (design issues) or the coffee was not very tasty UNTIL I found HiLine Coffee.  I tried a sample pack and was very happy with the taste and performance of the pods and being almost 50% of the cost of the original Nespresso pods.  THey have been fabulous to deal with when I've had shipping issues or damaged pods due to a soft-sided shipping container such that they replaced my complete order.  I have been a customer for about 6 months and will be for the foreseeable future.  Note: Their flavored coffees all have great flavor, not too strong and not too weak.  I HIGHLY recommend their pods for Nespresso or Keurig. Some people will claim using these pods will VOID your Nespresso machine's warranty.  THIS IS NOT TRUE.  

Read the Nespresso warranty.  Here it is just in case you don't believe me.

Good coffee. Bad company. These people need to get their customer service and delivery act together. I've had a subscription for the past 4 months,they are quick to take your money on the first of the month but then fail to deliver. Every month it seems that they ""run out of coffee"" when I have to email them asking where it is ( like again this month for instance). Save yourself the hassle of working with these people. There are some new really great artisan coffee companies out there who are making Nespresso compatible pods."

I ordered a coffee pack and I got the ""free"" cup. Low and behold it is now 3 weeks and no coffee or cup. I checked online and the package wasn't even notified of being shipping. Great . I check tracking and it seems that it took a 3 week all expense paid trip around the US on my dime. After NUMEROUS emails I finally get a 10 dollar credit on my card. Great .. my order was 24$ . I asked if they are going to reship my order and I get a generic response that it takes 10 days to process refunds. I DON'T WANT A REFUND UNLESS ITS THE WHOLE ENCHILADA. 

I found a corporate phone number for them  (212) 951-0695 so please call and leave as many voicemails as you can as they probably wont check them . They also blocked my girlfriend from Instagram - REAL PROFESSIONAL . 

I am at the point where I want to contact the BBB for shady business practices. I would love to review the coffee but unfortunately, I cant smell , look or taste as it just returned from an all inclusive trip with my cup."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2013-12-16,1.0,"I bought a few boxes of Hiline pods and the very first one I tried broke my machine. The pod crumpled a little bit and the machine couldn't pierce the casing. Now my U leaks a little when we turn it on and the once rich crema is reduced to a thin layer that dissolves much more quickly than usual.

Worst part is, I bought these as an early Christmas present for my wife. ""Merry Christmas, honey! I broke your coffee machine! Think of me on your long, grumpy, coffee-less ride to work, please!""

After talking to the owner, apparently Nespresso randomly changes their machines so that competitor's pods no longer work, in an attempt to discourage competition. At least that's Hiline's official story. They say they have an engineer working out the new specs as we speak. They even asked to send me a label so they could take the leaky machine apart and see what went wrong.

I have to give the owners a lot of credit though; getting a refund was extremely easy and they replaced my machine quickly as well. Still... they knew their pods didn't work and chose to ship them out anyways. Worse, they tried to act like I had a newer machine and that that was the problem, but when they tried to replace it, it came to light that the style machine I had was discontinued. So they must have been doing that to customers for a while."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2017-09-27,2.0,"Compared to the Nespresso pods, these get a 0 for taste. I ordered online, it was simple and I got a discount for my new purchase.

682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2015-09-12,1.0,"Slow shipping (4 days - they used FedEx Smartpost which hands delivery off to USPS) and uneven customer service (one email question was answered but a follow-up was not), but if the product was good, given it's less expensive than Nespresso capsules I could overlook that. 

Alas, it's not - quality is definitely not up to Nespresso standards. I tried 3 HiLine styles -- Wall Street, Times Square and Broadway -- and despite the promising descriptions, they all tasted weak, thin, flat and watery and had lame crema, compared to the two (excellent) Nespresso dark-roast capsules I usually get, Kazaar & Dharkan.

What's worse, the HiLine capsules have malfunctioned in my Nespresso Citiz machine -- twice I've had to manually cut the brew cycle because barely any coffee was dribbling out (presumably because the HiLine capsules didn't puncture correctly), and I was concerned the struggling pump might get damaged. This has never happened in over two years of daily use with Nespresso capsules.

Back to Nespresso coffee I gladly go: much better (and reliably consistent) capsule quality is worth the higher price to me, and Nespresso ships a lot faster and has better customer service, too."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2013-06-27,5.0,"Very nice coffee!

I moved from France recently and was looking for some Nespresso capsules that I could use in my Citiz and save some money, since I drink sometimes 5 or more per day.  I used to buy capsules in a local grocery store in Paris and was surprised that I couldn't get them in New York.  So I went on amazon and bought some products, but was really surprised that it was more expensive than Nespresso and completely devoid of flavor.  

A friend recommended I try HiLine (I think his wife bought some and liked it) and so I decided to give it a shot, so to speak.  When the package arrived, I was surprised to see some coffee grinds in the box, but it smelled good, so I didn't mind.  The capsules are made of plastic and don't puncture as easily, so I really have to apply some pressure to close the machine.  I was expecting that, so  it wasn't a problem.  The coffee was really good, and smelled like it was made from freshly ground beans.  I think it was made right before they shipped it to me.  I'd order again."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2015-10-07,4.0,"Update:
Shortly after posting the original review one of the owners contacted me. He apologized for the problems and got me going. He also sent me some samples for Nespresso of their newest blends. In addition, I did join the monthly shipment service.

I give the coffee four stars. It is very good. It has good crema, good taste and I've had zero problems with the pods. In my opinion, the Nespresso brand pods have generally a better taste, but HiLine pods are very good and I will keep buying them. If I considered the cost saving of HiLint over Nespresso, then I could give five stars. But my opinion is based solely on the final product, regardless of the cost.

____________________
I haven't even got a chance to try their Nespresso pods yet so my 2 star is not about taste. The problem is they have a subscriber club, or you can buy packs of pods as single order. Some are packs of 10 and some are 20. How you order, and what quantity is different if you subscribe. Shipping is free if you subscribe, but some of the pod prices are higher based on the monthly subscription cost compared to individual orders placed. 

Then, I found a page on their site that talks about a free box for a trial, and still another page on the site talking about the first month free when you subscribe. I think I saw these pages from a Google search so maybe they're inactive, but there's no date for reference. So I wrote to HiLine and the reply was, the subscription price is already discounted so you can't apply coupon code. Really?

What a mess. Get a 15 year old to build a functional shopping site on Squarespace or something."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2015-08-20,5.0,"THIS POST HAS BEEN EDITED...  THIS IS MY ORIGINAL POST...

I can't remember wanting to post a review before I actually received the product. I also never posted a review prior to receiving product with both deep negatives and high positives.  Here goes.

I signed up for a 140 pod subscription on the 16th of August.  I left on a business trip, excited that coffee would be waiting for me when I got home.  No dice.  I followed up with Hiline today ( the 20th) via email, because they have no phone number.  I sent the message well after 5 o'clock Eastern time.  Within an extremely short window of time I got an email back telling me that my coffee would not arrive until the 25th.  Great service delivering bad news...

I emailed back later in the evening telling them how disappointed I was and that I would have paid for express shipping if they offered it.  Again, within a very short period of time I received a reply with apologies.  This was deep evening NY time.  Apparently they are not set up for express shipping right now.  I was told that a $10 credit would be posted to my account for  my troubles.

I hope their coffee is as good as their service.  I have this feeling that they are a small company who has marketed themselves into more business than they can handle and they are using account credits to smooth out problems created by their growing pains.    Nice problem to have.  

Right down the middle with three stars.  I will update once I have received my coffee.  END OF ORIGINAL
POST

UPDATED POST -  A HiLine owner just messaged me to see if I ever did receive my coffee....  well, do I ever feel like a jerk!  YES I DID GET MY COFFEE!

Posting reviews before giving a company a chance to prove itself is a good way to get egg on your face - and I am super eggy.

My HiLine shipment  showed up days earlier than first predicted.  On a Saturday morning, in fact.  I was so happy to see it having been without coffee for some days (probably the reason I took to Yelp so quickly for my first I'll-advised review - junkies can be very nasty people when they don't have their medicine.)

The coffee arrived in a box so whimsical that my wife posted it on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/lisa.b.nicholson/posts/10204957679236877:0

The pods were sealed in bags in lumps of 20 in each bag was a surprise meme-like business card with a funny saying on it, like  "" I have to get up, my coffee needs me"" 

The coffee is spectacular - it comes out a bit slower than a Nespresso pod, but I'm chalking that up to the amount of coffee in each pod.  Some of the pods are transparent and I can see that they are loaded with coffee.

I ordered several roasts and none disappoint.  

Sad thing is - I am not sure that 140 pods per month is going to get us through.  I am going through coffee like a madman and my wife is right behind me.  

I am now HiLine coffee's biggest fan.  Next time I will keep my mouth shut - because it will be full of delicious coffee."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2015-10-17,5.0,"5 stars awarded to customer service. Not sure why anyone would give them less than 5. Both times I've had to email them they've responded within moments. Today (a Saturday) I emailed them to check on an order I placed on the 9th to find out why it hadn't been delivered. They immediately responded they would resend. I then heard from the owner (again on a Saturday) with a tracking number for my order. 
The post office wouldn't leave the coffee with my doorman. (Apparently this coffee is even more valuable than I thought).  Then Mr Post Man not only left the ticket saying I had a package in the wrong person's mailbox but marked the wrong attempted delivery date so I almost didn't get it at the post office. (Again, maybe Mr Post Man was trying to keep the goods for himself).  Hiline coffee 5 stars. Post Office 0 stars.  Only suggestion to HiLine coffee is to send email notifications to customers with tracking numbers so I can monitor delivery and not have to email customer service."

Then I tried the coffee.

Good lord, the Hazelnut and Vanilla are some of the best I've had. I enjoy these more than I can say. Fantastic work on their part.

My family and I happen to be moving to NYC in the next month, and this will be a regular stop for us. Thanks HiLine!"

I am writing this review, though, to stop other people from ordering these Instagrammed mugs that don't work.
The lid would not snap shut unless I applied ALL my weight onto it, and after that I could not get the damn thing off. I tried several different methods about a dozen different times. Since I can't ask my husband to open and close my coffee mug for me every day, I threw it out."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2016-04-18,5.0,"I bought some HiLine nespresso pods and pods directly from Nespresso to use in my new machine. I was a little tentative after some of the reviews on here and got the Nespresso pods to do a side-by-side comparison. The HiLine pods looked cheaper, but once they were in the machine i couldn't even tell a difference. They worked perfectly! I got a couple varieties and have liked them all!

Nespresso certainly has more options, but for making a morning latte and the occasional espresso I really don't need that many choices and am more than happy with what HiLine offers. 

I had a great customer service experience as well. I got a quick response about the status of my package, and they even gave me a promo code to apologize for an expected delay in shipping. My package ended up arriving exactly when originally estimated. Clearly they have been stepping up their customer service game. I will definitely continue to buy HiLine pods instead of getting ripped off by Nespresso on their pods."

I also ordered something by mistake and emailed HiLine around 10:00PM asking to cancel it and within twenty minutes they responded and cancelled the order, no questions asked.  HiLine is truly an excellent company and I absolutely will be purchasing from them again in the future.  I highly recommend ordering from them."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2016-11-12,1.0,"The nespresso pods from hiline are mediocre. They don't have the strength, creaminess, or complexity you are looking for in espresso. Instead, they just taste like small cups of coffee. You are definitely better off with nespresso pods. Also, the flimsy foil lids on the pods get pierced in the bag and spill grounds out. I was excited to try this service but I won't be ordering from them again."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2015-11-06,1.0,"The coffee tastes mediocre.

Additionally, they send you an unbelievable amount of spam if they get your email. They also keep sending you coffee and charging your credit card whether you want it or not. All in all not a trustworthy company."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2017-08-15,3.0,"I have purchased and tried many varieties of the HiLIne Coffee capsules for the Nespresso machine. First of all, although they are compatible, I do think it is a strain on the machine to break through their capsule. Consequently I began using an older Citiz machine rather than my Latissima. However, the real downfall was the poor quality and coffee taste, some capsules barely flavored the water! If you want a decent tasting brew, you need to use 2 capsules brewing an espresso size to make a small cup of coffee. Yes, Nespresso capsules are more expensive, but it is well worth it for the quality product and great flavor.

I must amend my original review. I am still not completely satisfied with this product, however, HiLine's customer service is excellent and worked with me to achieve a very fair end result. You can give them a try without concern, to see if the coffee works for you."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2016-10-17,5.0,"Recently I received an email from Ted, the co-founder of HiLine Coffee wanting to know why I was.no longer.a.customer.   I explained that while I loved their coffee the shipping was.extremely.slow and I'd found another company with faster shipping. 

He actually paid attention to my complaint but more importantly ""owned"" it.   He also offered.to.send.me free coffee and asked what I wanted which was only 2 bags. 

I received my coffee today- a very generous 4 bags of the variety pack. Ted made me feel as though I.really was a valued customer and in the process has won back my business.

its never really about what happens, its about how a company makes it right. HiLine did just that. 

Highly recommend for.both their.coffee and customer service. 

Thanks again, Ted."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2015-11-11,4.0,"Coffee is so good, specifically the Exchange  (dark roast). Very yummy! Their online specials (where they send a free item such as a bag or tote) are a bit disappointing though. My bag is only a couple of months old and has a big hole (seams coming undone) and the cup had a quote on both sides but one side was very smudged. Free items for purchasing online  coffee, but still.

Long overdue update (January 2016): my bag was replaced free of charge which I find considerate!"
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2017-05-31,3.0,"So I ordered the Ethiopian fine grind for Aeropress use. Upon opening the brown bag for the first time, the aroma filled up my room. I was delighted. I aeropressed the first cup and it was equally flavorful/impressive. All was good and I was elated.

I re-zipped the brown bag and stored it in my coffee cabinet that has a silica dehumidifier - yes, I'm that hardcore with my coffee hobby.

On day two as I opened the brown bag, I smelled almost nothing. Please note that I wasn't suffering from allergy or cold so my olfactory ability wasn't impaired one bit. I brewed it and it lacks all coffee flavors, leaving only earthy/chocolatey/nutty flavors. Almost tasted like a hot chocolate. 

Conclusion: their coffee is way too perishable and loses aroma/flavors way too quickly. They need to redesign their tin foil packs from the ground up. Also, when they incorporate a check valve with every small pack, what's the environmental impact? Worse of all, these valves don't preserve the coffee one bit after you tear open the brown bag. Sorry, can't recommend this at all."
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2016-11-09,1.0,Their Instagram account deleted my comment and blocked me after calling them out for stealing another company's design. Don't support this company!
682,hiline-coffee-new-york-6,2015-10-27,4.0,"Unlike other reviewers I had no problems using their pods with my old (2011) Nespresso Pixie.  The packaging is high quality and the branding of HiLine capsules is terrific. To the impatient coffee drinkers here, it took maybe 6 days for them to send me the generous sampler pack of 20 pods, for just a $5 shipping charge.  They roast your coffee fresh to order, so have a little patience, will ya?!

The coffee flavor, to me, is like Nespresso meets New York.  The names of the pods are apt in that way.  Wall Street like you'd get from your favorite Lower Manhattan barista before riding up the elevator 75 stories.  Greenwich Village like you'd sip in the coffeehouse working on your novel, or sending out your resumes.  Chelsea like you grab with a donut on the way to the studio.  Brooklyn for a rainy work-at-home day in peace.

If you are a Nespresso user who wants to venture out into the world of coffee varieties out there - or who wants a break from 75 cent capsules - you owe it to yourself give HiLine a try."
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,"Stopped by this shop on my way out of work (was traveling for work) and it was such a gem. Their coconut and snickerdoodle cookies were absolutely delicious!! Their staff was very friendly and even gave me a free little sample of one of their cookies. I'm so glad I found this place here on Yelp because it's been bothering me that I couldn't remember where the heck I got those delicious cookies from during my last trip to NYC! 

I'll go back for sure!!!"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2020-02-18,3.0,"It's a cute little bakery shop with limited treats and exceptional customer service. We came here a couple times because it's in close proximity to our hotel, so it was very convenient to stop by and grab a quick bite to eat. Both coffee and breakfast sandwiches are good however they lack variety of baked goods. Overall this place is good."
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2020-02-06,5.0,"A cute little cafe tucked in midtown. If your lucky you'll stumble upon this gem while walking past and the smell of freshly baked cookies will waft into tour nostrils. A pleasant surprise from the usual city scents of garbage and who knows what else. There is even space to sit and enjoy your treats with a cup of coffee. The star of the show for me was the balsamic coconut cookie. Wow! What a mix! You can taste the balsamic ever ao slightly just at the tip of you tongue. It leaves it a bit tingly, balancing out the sweetness of the coconut. A match made in heaven if you ask me! And these cookies are big- sharing is optional of course but you could if your feeling generous. They are around 3$ & worth it!"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-11-09,4.0,"What a fun time! This NYC gem is cute, modern, and tasty!! 
It was a cold, rainy, dreary day and I needed a sweet treat to help make sure that the rainy day blues didn't hit me.

I had a couple of things here:
1. (I can NEVER say no to) a green tea latte that was made beautifully; not too milky and not too sweet.
2. a double chocolate cookie that i STG was one of the best cookies i've had in a hot minute. 

the staff was great, the vibe was chill, and the decor/aesthetic was a modern take on your classic little bakery. loved it. 

thanks to my fellow elites for their reviews that ultimately led me to this place! will definitely be back!"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-11-05,3.0,"I stopped by on a Tuesday afternoon, hoping to get one of their tarts. They didn't have any when I came, so instead tried:

Pumpkin pie: just plain weird. The crust was salty like a pretzel and the filling tasted like maybe the pumpkin purée they used went rancid or something? Very sour and watery. I actually threw half of it out, which isn't something I usually do. 

Gingerbread cookie: this was good. They had a $2 version and a gigantic $3.95 version. I went with the smaller one. Good molasses and spice flavors. The $2.95 size would actually be a pretty good deal.

Maple oat scone: got this one to go, really just meh. It was kind of tough and not flaky, although the flavor was good. 

I'm a bit disappointed because there are so many other yummy looking options here (like, literally everything here looks good)."
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-08-14,4.0,"Greed - Bad , Competition - Good, at least when it comes to the consumer.

I just recently did review on new Matto which is two doors down on their everything $2 everything deal. And today I was passing by and then notice that this cafe is practically doing the same thing, with their $2 on the entire menu deal. Now I don't have a MBA so I not going to dissect the business model here.

 But what I will do is participate in sampling breakfast muffins, coffee, croissants, lattes and doughnuts every time I time I pass by.

And why not we have good clean cafes here offering quality goods.  But I must say that New York Sweets offers inside and outside seating and table service when they are not too busy and has more items.  And with two modern mid size hotels on the same block I think they will do just find vs the grab and go Matto customers."
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-07-11,5.0,"I absolutely love this little gem. The interior feels like a home. You will notice the smell of buttery baked goods as soon as you walk in. 

I tried all the cookies (no shame) and I highly recommend the coconut balsamic but honestly they were all fantastic. The cookies are HUGE and only cost a little over $3 which is fair. Sometimes the batch might be a little hard but you can have them warm it for you. Usually they are perfectly moist and delicious. I love it with coffee. 

I also tried their bread pudding which was nice, soft and not too sweet. The tarts were just okay. They have gluten free options (cookies, muffins). 

At noon, they serve lunch such as salads, sandwiches and soups. I had their chicken pot pie which I don't recommend. The filling was way too dry and the pastry puff was too thick. I did enjoy their turkey and thai chicken wraps. Both very flavorful and fresh! 

Some items change weekly depending on the chef's choice which keeps me interested in coming back. Service is always top notch and helpful."
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-12-09,3.0,"The girl at the front seemed to be in a rush to take our order even though the bakery was empty and there was no line. I felt stressed trying to order and it was my first time there. She also didn't warm up my blueberry cheese danish even through I asked her to. It was just ok. The almond croissant was fluffy and just okay too. The salted chocolate chip cookie was the best thing I ordered but I definitely wouldn't come back for another one. The music and ambiance are great but the girl up front needs to learn people skills and to be patient, especially at a bakery!"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-04-19,1.0,"Saw 5 stars in Yelp and had to check the place.
Chocolate chip cookie salted cookie was too sweet and too salty. Orange scone was very dense and not that good. 
Very disappointing. Next time ill stick to breads bakery nearby"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-08-07,2.0,"Wow, this went awry in more ways than one.  And I really did not expect it to go south because the employees seem really friendly and helpful, and the place itself is a neat, cutesy place.  Please keep in mind, my judgement so far is based only on the lunch I just had, or at least attempted to have.   And that was NOT good.
First off, the girl at the front messed up my order.  I wasn't meant to have the chicken parmigiana hot platter (chicken parmigiana + bowtie pasta).  I was awaiting my chicken parmigiana panini getting warmed up.  But I ended up with the chicken parmigiana platter.  Which brings me to my second, and most important point.  That this food was 80% inedible and I'll be lucky if my acid reflux wasn't triggered by the amount of acidity in the tomato sauce and the amount of the tomato sauce itself.  I mean, wow.  The bowtie pasta was swimming in the lake of fire.  All the tomato sauce, garlic, and the black pepper mixed with salt was just a fkn disaster.  The chicken was almost but inedible.  I tried to eat as much of this horrid platter as I could because that's all the lunch I had and I had no other choice.  I really do not recommend this to anyone who's got gastrointestinal issues or even anyone who's not affected by them, because once you eat this shite, you might just get some.
Since this place is not really meant to be a 'lunch' spot or 'real food' place, but is essentially a bakery goods/cafe joint, I would say just try going for those type of goods.  Now I cannot tell you if anything else there is good because I havent tried them yet.  I am hoping for their own sake that their other food is good, because this place is new and that would be a bad way to start off.
I will think about going there again strictly to try their baked goodies to form a comprehensive and fair opinion."
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-11-20,5.0,"I'll start by saying the interior of this place is THE CUTEST. The interior feels so warm and fuzzy! The staff were really nice. I ordered a tea latte (it wasn't on the menu but they were able to make it tea with steamed milk!). Just your standard drink honestly, but it was at a good price point. Their desserts and pastries looked so good! Will definitely have to come back and try some!"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-02-27,5.0,"Stopped by today (Wednesday) during lunch hour for something sweet. Their cookies are ENORMOUS. When I say enormous, imagine a good size pancake on your plate. It's big. Cookies, I ordered Chocolate Chip cookie (has 3 different types of chocolate and sprinkled with salt), Shortbread Cookie, and Coconut Balsamic Cookie. The cookies are $2.95 each.  Coconut Balsamic and Chocolateship cookies have a crunch when you bite into it while slight chewy center. Absolutely delicious.  Shortbread cookie is slightly soft and crumbles a little like it should. 

I also ordered their mini tarts which are $2.25 each. They are cute little bite size and has a nice base to them.  Highly recommend stopping by to try these out!"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-10-01,5.0,"Run don't walk here! Stumbled upon this store today and they have the cutest place with the friendliest staff! Prices are reasonable and location is great so it will for sure be one of my regular stops! 
The coconut balsamic cookie is a cookie of dreams! 
They also have Sugar free,vegan, you name it they have it plus a $2 menu. Yes a $2 menu in NYC is unheard of! Nothing not to love here!"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-05-15,5.0,"Firstly, I would like to thank the entire team at New York Sweets for their hospitality and welcoming demeanor. Currently, I am working on the opening of a local business and the office(s) are under construction. So we were looking for a local place to have a few interviews. From beginning to end the entire team - Victoria and Mitchel specifically have been more than welcoming and have gone above and beyond to being hosts. of course, without saying, the coffee is amazing; also trying the salad, soups and pasties, having been in their shop for 8 hours a day! Though everything is amazing from decor, to taste it is their hospitality that will set them apart and make them so successful. 

Thank you all for being so gracious during our transition! We can not wait to send guests your way! :)"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2018-10-26,5.0,"I noticed this shop during lunch and returned the next day after looking at their website, flavors looked so enticing that I just had to stop in. The site does not lie! The cookies look are just as amazing in person and believe it or not, the taste is unbelievable. Cookies are probably towards the bottom of the list of sweet treats I gravitate towards and stopped in only to buy treats for my friends and use them as guinea pigs.  

After chatting with the owner who was so gracious to answer my questions about softness of cookies (hate crunchy) I opted for the traditional choco chip and the balsamic coconut. I also am not a fan of coconut, but know my friends are and they could not stop raving about how good the cookies were later at night! Even the next day the coconut stayed nice and soft. I did try both of them and was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of coconut that it didn't immediately taste like coconut allowing you to enjoy the cookie flavor. 

The chocolate chip was so AMAZING! It was sweet, with a salty after taste. Perfect texture of ooey gooey chocolatey goodness. I also tried the pretzel bark, while the chocolate is a little too milky for me, again I loved the contrast of salty and sweet. 

The owner was friendly, happy to answer any questions and give recommendations as was the rest of the staff. Excited to return!"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2018-11-10,5.0,"My friend and I visited this place earlier this week, and I will say this is probably going to be one of my new favorite bakeries in the city. The interior of the bakery is so cute, the inspiration was interior designs from the 1900s, which you can totally see, from the steel doors behind the counter, to the ceiling. It's also pretty big and spacious, so you don't have to worry about feeling cramped in there if they get busy.

They have a wide variety of desserts and sandwiches, as well as chocolates and everything is homemade, and of the upmost quality. I will say, everything that we tried we loved, from the tarts to the cookies. I have never heard of a French toast Tart until I came here. Same thing goes for a deep dish cookie. Overall this bakery is great, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is in Midtown or visiting the city, or anyone who has a strong love for pastries! And coffee, because they have good coffee too! I hope this business does extremely well! I'm definitely rooting for them!"
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-05-17,4.0,"I was excited to try new york sweets. The glass case of goodies is appealing because is is lengthy instead of being clustered together. The first stop on this yummy train for me was the brioche egg cheese and sausage pocket. When I think brioche I think soft and buttery. The brioche was not in this case, but it did have to hold up to encase the breakfast deliciousness inside. That being said the sausage was salty enough but not that flavorful.  The cheese element was not that present visually or flavorwise. Eggs were fluffy, but I got shell. This may not be a deal  breaker for some, but finding shell halts my feeding enjoyment. 
Next the Saigon cinnamon cookie. It boasts cinnamon, oats, and brown sugar. Delish!! Cookies appear to be where new york sweets shine!! Wow. Soft in the center, chewy with slightly crispy edges and VERY tasty.
I want to try all the other cookies!!
And I'd like to try the scones. They look tasty. 
Nice interior. Nice people. Worth the try."
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-11-08,5.0,The Saigon cinnamon cookie is so delicious. It's soft and chewy and contains the right amount of sweetness. My coworkers devoured them.
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-03-25,5.0,Ordered a green tea and a cheddar and chive scone.  Yea was average just a bag but the scone was very tasty.  Good flavors.  It's a place away from the popular areas so you'd have to find it.  If I'm in the area again though I would drop by for another scone though.  Also tasted a sample of the death by chocolate cookie and if I were a chocolate fanatic it would be great.   Still tasted good though.  Has seating for small groups as well.  Overall a nice cafe.
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,Quick. Cappuccino this place smells amazing. I couldn't have one cookie I need them all !
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-10-16,3.0,"Food and drinks are just decent, had a fairly disappointing parfait. There is always a table available though, which is rare in midtown."
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2018-12-07,4.0,"Leading up to their opening, I would gaze at the interior yearningly while scoffing at their uninspired name. Fortunately, my stomach overrode my brain (as it tends to) and I now have a new go-to afternoon sweets shop. Lesson repeatedly learned: don't judge a food venue by it's name.

New York Sweets started out as a catering company in the garment district. It had a brief stint as a storefront before it was shuttered by the recession though the catering kitchen remained afloat. Luckily for us (though unluckily for them) they lost their lease and relocated at their new location where they decided to give another go at a storefront focused on sweets, but also expanding into other easy-to-eat savory items.

Go to Culture across the street for a sinfully decadent chocolate, or Whole Foods a few blocks away for a quick and cheap cookie fix; but New York Sweets is where you go for something playful, satisfying, and big enough to share with multiple people. I've tried all their cookies to date and my favorite is still their coconut balsamic--which they'll likely recommend. Caution that it does have a bit of the coconut flake texture for anybody who's not a fan; my coworker hates flakes but still enjoyed the cookie.

I've found their cookies tend to have a nice shell with a chewy center (sans the shortbread which has a classic, flaky crumb). I tend to prefer extra crisp edges from spread batter and the staff were kind enough to sell them to me from their reject pile even though that's not their standard sale form :)

Starting in on the deep dish tart collection now and love that they're (I tried Banana Nutella + PB&J so far) not a sugary sucker punch to the teeth so long as you share. I can't wait to get to their pound cake slices and scones (they're not the British variety, but also don't seem as crazy as the usual American varieties).

Chocolate bark is meh, but I've also never had one made of milk chocolate I enjoyed so I'm biased. It's snappy, the candy bits are crunchy, and the chocolate is too mild if you're used to the 75-99% range.

The prices are GREAT for the quality and serving size. Not worth trekking here if you're not an NYC local or commuter, but a must have if you're in the area."
683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-01-09,5.0,This place is so cute. They are really nice... the owner gave me a complimentary tea and he is very nice. The people who work here are also very polite. I ordered oatmeal and green tea which were both good.. very fulfilling

683,new-york-sweets-new-york,2019-03-08,1.0,If I could leave no star I would. In my opinion the owner Phil @newyork_sweets is the worst business owner I've come across. Nothing professional about his character or being at all. I've even seen mice at this establishment. They cross contaminate and lie about where the food is made. His head chef doesn't wear gloves while preparing foods. I've overheard how he speaks to his staff and it's disgusting. Do not support this business. There are way better bake shops around.

Realizing that this location was only two blocks away from me, I've been finding myself stopping by here quite more often. Also, if you download their app, you get a $5 credit! Gave it 4 stars because some staff members could be a bit more friendly."

It one is the coffee damn good and the pastries are plentiful, but for In NYC, you'd expect to pay $5 or more; right; well the term ""get the best bang for your buck"" comes into play here..... All this goodness for $2 bucks! In the famous words of rapper Roxanne Shante ""Please believe it!"" Love the motto too ""Welcome to MATTO, the espresso bar that aims to change the world."" 

This will be my new go to spot for my caffeine fix. Lattes, Espressos, Cappuccinos, Cortados, they do it all. Quality coffee at a good price (can't stress that enough). Also, did not know they have so many locations in Manhattan; so there's no excuse for not enjoying this goodness that I'm writing about."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2019-10-23,4.0,"Everything costs 2$ and it's actually worth it! That means small, medium, large same price.

I usually order a large coffee whenever I go and sometimes I buy their pastries.

I've tried their brownie, chocolate chip cookie, and super food bar (made with coconut). They were all solid. But then again, I'm not a huge pastry person so what do I know. 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

If you're into value, I recommend this place for coffee related items.

If you want a quick variety of pastries, also come through."

i walked out super disappointed and would not return."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-08-22,4.0,"I love the MASS SELECTION... I dislike they don't have seating, which is annoying but it keeps the place clean and tidy. Everything is really fresh and $2. From unhealthy pastries to good looking sandwiches they carry everything! They also have coffee... obviously! Staff is friendly. No bathrooms. No tables, but great place to grab a bite. 

4 dollar credit card minimum.
Everything is $2.19 cents with tax. 
Good fresh food and drinks."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2019-09-24,5.0,I tried this coffee shop out today and everything literally $2!!! they have non dairy milk options to. I got the chai tea latte with oat milk and it was good! I looked at the bakery selections and they have vegan donuts for any vegans out there! I'll definitely be coming back because everything is $2!!! You can get a Chai Tea Latte for $2!!!
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2020-02-25,4.0,"i like matto espresso cause the 2 bucks  per item is such a simple way of ordering coffee, muffins, bagels , yogurt , and whatever else they  can fit in a small space . it can get a little hectic when the  place is crowded and you will get the occasion brave assho#le who will wedge in front of you and cut the line but keep cool cause they have plenty of workers behind the counter to help the customers quickly . the goodies are nicely displayed  so you just pick and point and hit the road.  i enjoy the muffins and giant cookies the most but whatever you order is worth the 2 bucks you will shell out. good coffee and the few times i ordered a cappy i enjoyed it just as much as the starbucks kind. good bang for your buck or should i say 2 bucks. In the Chelsea section of NYC , 27th st /off 7th Ave."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-05-14,5.0,"It's Monday! What better way to start my work week than with a nice treat and iced coffee. My coworker said he found out about this place near our office that just opened. To change things up, we agreed to check it out.

We are very happy we did. 

To my shock, this place had an incredible assortment of baked goods with exciting flavors. Oat bars, doughnuts, brownies, and everything else you can think of. The staff member working the baked goods kindly ran us through the assortment of goods they had. Notably, the place doesn't have a menu available to view that you can order from.

After making our selections, we went over to the guy making coffee. We were both able to get iced coffees to accompany our baked treats. Most importantly, everything in the store is $2 per item! 

My gluten free lemon doughnut was very tasty. The coffee is super strong.

I will definitely be coming around to this place again."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2019-03-11,5.0,"This place should not only be closed permanently, but required to pay hefty fines for not abiding by the NYC Coffee Shop code of ethics, specifically but not limited to, providing a well-crafted cappuccino (La Colombe beans) and a slice of delicious coffee cake for $4. To add insult to injury, all that with friendly service. 
Such heresy.  
#stopthemadness"
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2019-01-26,5.0,"Such a convenient location -- very close to Penn Station.  They have a decent amount of seating.  There's a lot more room than the location on W 37th, which has no seating.

I come here for breakfast, lunch, and coffee.  It's so inexpensive, but so good.  I recommend the almond chai tea latte."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-09-15,4.0,"Small cafe franchise in Chelsea, right down the street from the Fashion Institute of Technology, not a place to sit but a place to grab and go they have plenty of snacks but minimum of $4 for  credit cards and they don't take Ben franklins. Love their Cortados, they have simple syrup or agave on the side, no bathroom so just a pit stop."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2019-03-28,5.0,"Absolutely yes yes yes recommend. I guess they have this special often where EVERYTHING is $2, no exclusions at all, lol. It's pretty crazy but I ordered a large tea and probablyyyy the most amazing truffle brownie I've ever had, big too. They have tons of pastry options, savory too! Nice staff, very polite. Thank you!"
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-11-30,4.0,"Awesome little hole in the wall coffee shop! They have a variety of pastries, sandwiches, drinks, and snacks, each for $2!! Really good quality for that price point, everything is fresh, and the service is quick! And they have multiple locations all around the city with a little variance in their selection at each shop."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2019-09-24,5.0,"Very quick and VERY cheap. When I say everything, everything is $2!! I got myself an iced vanilla latte and a donut and of course it was only $4. Both items tasted good and fresh. The two staff members working were very polite and actually remembered returning guests (I'm assuming regulars but still). I definitely plan on returning to Matto for morning coffees and a pastry!"
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2019-06-25,4.0,I love this cafe for a quick snack or a coffee. They have many delicious baked goods and sweet treats for a mid afternoon snack! Its such a good deal too - everything in the cafe is only $2!!  Highly recommend stopping by and taking something to go.
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-01-25,5.0,"Italian company, with everything $2. Good looking Harlem baked goods and good roasted coffee. This place is another great addition to the nearby Nomad 'hood famous for fast, casual spots. Between Matto, Patent and Birch coffee, you could be well caffeinated on this stretch of West 27th Street."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-07-22,5.0,"Of course it was the $2.00 advertised cost that caught my eye, but it's the food and service that keeps me coming back.

Lovely staff and healthy food choices make this place my spot.  They don't have a huge selection l, but what they do make, they make well.  
And when in the mood for not so healthy, wow, the giant paperweight chocolate chip cookies are delightful.

The first thing I ever ordered here was a cappuccino. The woman made it utterly perfectly. Not an easy task. And, again, the people who work there are simply lovely."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-05-08,5.0,"This gem is a fantastic little coffee & snack spot!  I passed by on my way to the Flower Market on the next block and was so surprised to find that everything here is only $2!  That's a great deal, especially for La Colombo coffee, which is of a premium caliber.  

The staff here was extremely welcoming and very pleasant.  A taller gentleman waited on me this morning and I didn't catch his name but wanted to acknowledge his professionalism and fantastic representation of this business.  He gave me a card with all of the Matto locations so that I could visit their establishments all across town.  (And get a free coffee for following them on social media!)

Two thumbs up from this Yelper!    :)"
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-01-19,5.0,Everything is two dollars! Seriously everything. They have pastries fresh coffee cappuccinos tea yogurt sandwiches and more! Great counter service quick stop
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-09-19,5.0,"Its 2 dollars and delicious, impossible to argue with. I go to f.i.t. and many of my classmates get coffee or food from here every day because it's such a deal."
684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-05-15,5.0,"I came across Matto but never decided to go in because I thought $2 was too good to be true. I am so glad I did! I came into this location to get an iced macchiato and the barista was kind enough to clarify what I meant since a SB ice macchiato is an iced latte here and then he asked if I wanted more coffee or more milk. Totally unexpected for them to care about my order since ordering ice coffee in NYC is a grab and go kind of thing. 

I also tried their banana walnut bread and it wasn't overly sweet and had more of a bread rather than cake consistency. Their pistachio cupcake looks good too. I'll try that next time!"

684,matto-espresso-new-york-13,2018-03-06,1.0,"Horrible service. Don't bother. Coffee is not all that nor their food. Food business is all about service really, I felt pretty annoyed. I was in front of juice section just looking to see if there's anything and I decided not to get it. One of the girl basically accused me of taking the juice. And of course I didn't but she wouldn't apologize. Nice! Never walking into that piece of crap place that treats customer as their because they don't have enough business..."

685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2019-11-12,4.0,"I always come here because it has the healthiest and freshest options given what's in the area.
When walking from Grand Central toward 5th ave, the next best option-Whole Foods-just seems a little too far. 

This place is a refuge in the summer months when it's super steamy outside and can also be a great place to get a nice warm latte for the winter when the other next best option for coffee-Starbucks down on Madison is filled to the brim with commuters. 

The service here is quick and people are friendly! I feel like they have the midtown positivity vibe. 

My favorites are the small quinoa bowl, the salmon cup-awesome sides for a meal or a quick bite with a coffee and I also love their array of salads and other healthy options. My fav is the falafel and the salmon salads/bowls-which now come in boxes! :) 

I tried their lobster roll today for lunch.$9.99 which is far less than what you'd pay for at a seafood cafe and it SHOWS. There's not too much fish in the roll but I think it's totally fine for an afternoon bite. It was fresh, not overly dressed, and had a good amount of lettuce. 

My fav snacks here are the dark choccolate covered almonds and the trail mix. 

As a Native New York, Pret is and will always be one of my favorites around the city. I hope it doesn't close."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2019-03-15,4.0,"Some people thing Pret is a little Pret-entious. They're right. But that's irrelevant when put up against the fact that this chain feeds the homeless, for no other reason than - it's the right thing to do.

When you're right next door to a legendary salad chain that began in New York and started a whole trend of salad chains all over the country, in an era when everyone and their mother is eating salad, then you'd think that more people would go to the salad chain, but let me be honest - Chopt is overrated... it's really not that good.

And that's one of the reasons why I think a lot of people come in here instead which is exactly what happened to me. I got another Chopt salad and it was very disappointing like the other locations I've tried, so I came next door and got a good sandwich and honestly I mean they aren't bad sandwiches - yummy British style sandwiches, pre-packaged but as far as prepackaged sandwiches go you will probably not get much better than this place.

Better yet, as I said, they are strong with the morals - and they give all of their leftover stuff to homeless people for free at the end of the day, and almost no other company does that due to whatever, possibility of being sued blah blah - so massive Kudos to them and everybody should do that like really, f**king everybody should do that, am I right."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2019-08-29,4.0,"My interactions with Pret are usually limited to whenever I'm in Manhattan looking for food before a work meeting. This particular location is close to the train so whenever I'm looking for lunch I'll stop here.

This Pret is pretty spacious. While crowds are a given, there's a large open space as soon as you enter with the fridges along the wall on the right. They do a good job constantly restocking and I've never had an issue finding everything they offer. Their food is pretty good - I've had some of their wraps and sandwiches and everything tastes pretty fresh. 

Service is pretty efficient - I've been there during the lunch rush and have had no problems being rung out promptly. Overall, while I would argue that there's nothing too outstanding about Pret's fare - I also feel that's the whole point. They have solid go-tos with efficient employees - everything you want out of a lunch spot in Manhattan."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2020-02-27,2.0,"Come here for the drinks and quick bit and to rest. The food is nothing to write home about but it is reliable and fresh for take and go style. There is female employee there that works AM is a bit of a racist, maybe she don't realize she wears her attitude on her sleeve or think it is okay to treat customers differently. I find the staff at this location are the rudest. Really should close it down, rehire a brand new crew because it just keeps recycling bad hires. Even one old manager there was awful but I believe she left..I order catering from Pret (food quality). Makes me wonder how do they treat their employees, managers especially for attitude to trickle down. Did we not learn from Starbucks, and small businesses 50% food quality-50% customers service and environment is what keeps customers from returning."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2019-03-07,5.0,I loved coming to Pret when I worked in the city. My favorite is the Chai Tea latte with the works (cinnamon). I love getting the Caesar Salad for lunch and the Shrimp wrap. The brownie and chocolate chip cookies are my favorite to help satisfy your sweet tooth. The staff here was beyond amazing and friendly. Pret please open in Boca Raton!
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2018-09-06,2.0,"If you're from the UK, you'll know that Pret is almost like a religion. It's the breakfast/salad/wrap staple of the regular office worker. Coffee is great and only £1, sandwiches are freshly made and cut every day. All good.

Pret in the USA, not so much. The sandwiches are legit old. Even First thing in the morning. The sliced bread is actually hard and crusty. And that's the middle, let alone the crusts, which are rock solid!

To add insult to injury, they were out of decaf coffee. Isn't Pret supposed to be a coffee shop?

Pret does not live up to its reputation in the UK as a solid go-to choice. If you're visiting from the uk, try elsewhere."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2018-01-22,4.0,"I was sick of my go-to lunch spots and decided to try this Pret right across from my favorite park...Bryant baby!

I met up with my boo boo Andrea as she frequents Prets a lot. She made a great suggestion that some of these cold sandwiches can be toasted when you pay for at the register. I got a Ham Mac & Cheese Melt and it was under $8.00. I just waited a bit till someone handed me my toasted sandwich. 

Oooo hubba hubba *mama like* and so fulfilling btw...a big  slice of ham slab on the Mac & Cheese and yum yum bread!"
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2019-04-24,4.0,"My go to place for my morning coffee and breakfast treats. I love that the coffee is self serve, it really does quicken up the process when you are trying to be in and out. I like that they rotate the soups and sandwiches throughout the year. Definitely on the pricer end but there are many options and I appreciate the quality of their food and the customer service."

She was rolling her eyes and said u did not say "" iced "" and say was my mistake. I was like shocked. I am clearly tell her is iced and even the manager know my order since I am a regular costumer there. And that girl was not even say anything and keep rolling her eyes and give me attuidue. It ruins my day



Updated 1/16/18

This is such a horrible experience again. 
I order my iced green tea here and take it Togo. 
However they gave me a broken cup ( please see my pics) when I go to my office, all the green tea leaking out and spilt out my bags and my papers. 
Totally a mess and horrible store...."

Wraps, Sandwiches, salat bowls, soup and more with low calories, fresh fruit and vegetables. Most 9-15 $. Tastes really good, staff is friendly. I don't drink coffee, but my friends liked their coffee too. Went there 5 or 6 times while my vacation at New York."

685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2017-10-12,4.0,Well this was a great stop to fuel up on coffee and organic food/ snacks. We made a pit stop while walking around town and checking out the festivities at Bryant Park. Couldn't have picked a better place to grab a healthy snack and fuel up with caffeine before making the best of the rest of our day. Love that these are located throughout the city.
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2017-10-25,5.0,"This pret is great!! They are always eager to help customers and check people out efficiently.  The baristas are quick and smart.

Perfect for when you're on the run."

It's fairly healthy fast food with a decent selection of options, great when you want to grab something semi nutritious on the go."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2018-09-25,1.0,I watched my coworker pull a large piece of hard black/silver plastic out of his mouth today at lunch that came from inside the Pret sandwich he was eating from this location. We have no idea what it was but obviously not edible. Thank God he didn't chip his tooth! I used to go here almost every day for breakfast or lunch because it's so close to my office but now I'm afraid to ever eat their sandwiches again. Such a shame--so unsafe and unsanitary.
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2017-08-15,4.0,"Yum I love Pret! Any time I'm in a city that has Pret, I have to stop in. I love their sandwiches on baguettes. Some of their items can be overpriced, though. This location has a good amount of seating."

685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2016-05-25,5.0,"I started with a small , Grain, avocado , egg, spinach, & tomato bowl. Which was very good, 

I then had the chicken noodle soup. It had Tender chicken (Antibiotic Free)diced carrots edamame celeryonions mafalda noodles chicken stock sea salt spices. That too was very good. 

I finished the meal with roasted beets, sweet pea hummus, parmesan shavings, arugula, and a touch of mint on a freshly baked artisan baguette. The beets gave a great flavor.  


I first discovered Pret A Manager when I was in  London and ate there most days for lunch.  I also realized that they were in the USA when I found one In DC. They are a chain of restaurants that serve fresh and healthy food.  This Resturant lived up to my expectations."

I loved how they try also focus on bettering the community by giving away the food that is not sold by the end of the day the hungry. The egg and mushroom brioche was pretty good but he blueberry and granola yogurt parfait was definitely the star. At first glance it seemed a little small, but the yogurt was creamy and filling + the blueberry was just perfectly sweet making it overall satisfying."

There is always a line, but don't pret, it'll only be a matter of minutes to get to the register. They have a system here for getting people in and out, and they do it so effortlessly.
They do not have any vegan desserts but won't hold it against them. I'd like to add that I love getting my Americano or soy latte here, it's definitely a better price point than the Starbucks around the corner."

This little gem was a wonderful find on my recent NYC trip.  We ended up going 5 times to 3 separate locations.  Its quick, easy, and everywhere.  Everything is pre-made so you only have to wait in line to pay.

This place provides a tasty, organic and responsible meal on the  cheap.  Made today, gone today.  I love that they recycle and don't waste, everything left at the end of the day is donated.

I have had lunch items, breakfast items and coffee from Pret and all were delicious.  My favorite was the brie and tomato sandwich.  They also have little deserts like brownies, the perfect sweet treat to end your meal."

To make use of such hackneyed stereotypes is especially bad. The coffee is described as ""spicy"" and ""energizing"" and so you thought to equate that with Latinos? What is this, the 1950s? Is the coffee served with maracas? When Latino New Yorkers visit your store we want our coffee without being worn-down by your cliched and reducing stereotypes. Do better please."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2017-12-19,5.0,I ate here every morning on a rent trip to NYC.  It's great quality food for a low price.  The southwestern breakfast wrap is delicious.  Make sure that you keep the receipt.  The bathroom is only available with a code at the bottom of the receipt.

I also got a regular iced Americano for $1.99 - not bad or great, but cheaper than Starbucks. Good deal overall."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2014-06-15,3.0,"If you have not read the previous 101 reviews for this location and have the time, knock yourself out.   Can provide for an entertaining day indeed.  

Had never seen nor heard of this British chain before walking outside of Grand Central Terminal hungry and not being interested in any of the chains in it's food court.  

Was concerned about the fact that the wraps were in a hot hold instead of made to order yet the NY Meatball was reasonably fresh and filling @ $7.  

Berry and fruit cup were also fresh and tasty as well as the breakfast sandwich.  This place appears to be very busy and the register to the right (of the 6-8) seems to be the quickest.

A tad pricey but it is a chain from the UK right smack in the middle of NYC.  

Restrooms require a pass code to be punched in on an unsanitary keypad above the locked knob, which you can obtain at the register."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2016-04-04,3.0,Good location to meet up with friends. It is not crowded as Starbucks around the area and has nice bakery section. The only thing that made me uncomfortable was their filthy bathrooms. I am just weary of the places with dirty bathrooms in general.
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2013-07-23,4.0,"Preamble:

The depth and thoughtfulness of the following review should be taken as proof not that I love Pret, but that I am at work, facing a seriously abstract workload, and I am procrastinating.

Comments specific to this Pret: 

It's just like all the others but I'd say it handles the lunch crush pretty well, with rarely a wait greater than 1 or 2 min.   

Comments about Pret in general: 

* Good (or better than others) environmentally: I like this chain because I suspect they have good/hippie sourcing at the corporate level, eg they sell pole-caught tuna not trawled.  It's hard to suss out marketing from real corporate practice, and I'm not sure if they're as serious about this as Chipotle (whose practices are industry leading and impressive) but it seems like Pret's at least better than almost everyone else. 

* Vegan friendly: I'm also always impressed when eateries manage to make veg and vegan food on a par with the regular stuff.  Pret offers veg/vegan sandwiches that are as good as or better than the meat-based ones.  

* More roughage than your average NY midtown sandwich: An upside (or downside depending on your pov) of Pret when compared to your typical midtown deli is that their sandwiches have a lot more greens/roughage.  I'd say it's like 50+% greens/veg on most sandwiches, which is how I make them at home. In a deli you'll have like 85% meat. 

* Pricier and smaller:  sandwiches at Pret generally are smaller and pricier than what you'd get at the standard midtown deli.  I tend to think the cost is justified by the quality -- again, for ex, pole caught tuna is pricier than regular; bread is obviously superior to what you'd get in Subway; ingredients regularly include fresh avocado, kale, spinach, etc.

Epilogue

Friends, Yelpers, countrymen, thus concludes my analysis of Pret.  Back to work."

The sandwiches and wraps are all from the fridge....nothing is made fresh...With so many good reviews this was disappointing... as even global chains such as Subway prepares them fresh.... I had the fish sandwich which was fine... but the bread was so soggy and wet...tasted as it been sitting there for day....as expected....not fresh!"

People behind the counter are super friendly despite the sheer volume of customers they have. Try my favorite - chicken avocado salad. Surprisingly, there's always a seat available anytime during the day. Probably because people would rather take their food and eat at Bryant park."

Waiting on line is a basic for a customer, but the sales were just allowing other ppl cutting lines and pretend they don't see u. Then, It's not a good place for normal ppl to buy stuff here."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2016-10-27,5.0,"I've been to about 2-3 pret a manger stores and so far they are all really good and efficient, my friend who lives in the city always told me about this place, I thought it was just another gimmick but didn't wanna judge it until I actually got to try it, I was on my way to a course around rush hour so I decided to stop and get something from here, I really respect the way they list all the sandwiches calories and sodium levels, it really makes it easier to make some smarter decisions when you don't have a ton of time, there are a lot of sandwich options and I've heard that they make their items fresh throughout the day and only make enough for the day so they avoid wasting food and have fresh items, I had a boom boom chicken (I think) it was a wrap that had a sweet and savory mayo sauce and good veggies in there. I also had a bag of chips and one of their in house drinks which was a green drink without all the sugar of a naked drink, the food was really fresh and left me with a good impression, so good that I got another wrap on the way home for lunch tomorrow, this is a place I don't mind checking out next time in the city"

Now that I visit this city again, I know there will be many Pret A Manager I can go in to simply enjoy a couple of coffee/sandwich/juice/yogurt. What was an accident in the first place, (meant to walk into a starbux, next to this shop), let me into Pret A Manager. After ordering a coffee and realizing that I actually didn't bring my wallet, the store manager told me to have the coffee and sandwich both for free. :) I became a loyal fan. During my one week stay in New York, I frequently visited the Pret A Managers around the town and in Hong Kong, I was pleasantly surprised to discover another Pret A Manager. :) They had Peking Duck Rolls!  oh right.. that's it for today.. BAII"
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2013-12-07,5.0,"Pretty good salads that taste fresh even though they are boxed.  Tasty sandwiches, on the smaller side but bread and quality of the fillings are very good  
Great muffins that aren't too oily or sweet and same with their oatmeal cookies! Wholesome ingredients is the best part for me.  Actually no, the best part and 5 stars are for Pret giving their leftover food to charities every night.  Think of that! In a city where we are spoiled gluttons, taking pictures of our food and eating out way too much, there are people starving all around this city.  Pret helps them. Every day. AMAZING!!"
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2015-04-04,4.0,"If you're going to a Pret, this is the place. Make it to go and eat at Bryant Park. If you're lucky, somebody will practice yoga next to you. Oh, and make sure it is sunny outside. 
The pre-made salads were good. A nice break from all the fries and burgers. Decent coffee as well."
685,pret-a-manger-new-york-5,2015-10-10,4.0,"Sandwiches on a 9 grain whole wheat bread. Yes! I am not big fan of breads on hero bread. I discovered a pret a manger in the autumn on 42nd street while lagging a work items. The menu changes in the spring/ summer. In the autumn and winter the cranberry chicken salad sandwich is a joy. It has a nice savory sweet taste. In the summer time, spicy shrimp cilantro wrap is yummy. Overall, this place is nostalgic of living in England. The ginger beer/ale is perfect for year round!"
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2020-05-17,5.0,"Big props to them for being open during covid and supplying us with bubble tea - an essential service, as we know. Fact #2 - grape cheese tea is amazing and must never be skipped. Get it without sugar unless you like sugar. Pretty great options and they usually do a great job of following customization instructions. My go to from now on."

They accept cash only though."

I got the black milk tea as it's a classic and I feel like every shop should make it well. It was super creamy and smooth but did not taste much like tea. Pretty bland overall. However since it seems like a lot of people love this place, I may go back to try some of the other teas that aren't milk teas."
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2020-04-17,2.0,"Great location but did not live up to the other milk teas I've tried. Could be the flavour I got, that was recommended by the server!
- brown sugar: bland and no tea taste, lid wasn't put on properly so half spilt in bag 
- jasmine bubble milk tea: bland, watery, no tea flavour and not milky (I had no ice too, so can imagine with ice how bad), bubbles were hard and didn't taste fresh"
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2020-04-06,4.0,"- Small window to order 
- Lots of options (cheese foam too)
- Got the passion fruit green tea with tapioca and another time with litchi jelly and the bubble tea
- I prefer the passion fruit with lychee. It comes with two slices of oranges and a lime
- The bubble tea is really sweet, the tapioca is covered in sugar. I recommend cutting the sugar levels
- At the same time, the bubbles are so chewy I love it.
- NOT cash only"
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2020-03-26,3.0,"Came here because the picture looked appetizing. It was a smaller establishment than what I'm used to. There are no seating, it's just a window to make your order and grab it to go. 

HONEY PLUM ICE TEA- with white pearl
Not a bad drink, it was definitely different. It's not the american plum, but the tart asian plum. It added some texture and citric flavor. The white pearl was chewy, but not too soft so it was good to get some flavor and pearl all in one bite. I would order this again, but with a less sweet level.

MANGO GREEN TEA
This drink was too sweet for me and I didn't really like the flavor. It didn't taste like fresh mango, but more of an artificial flavor. I'll pass on this next time.

I might come back and try their other teas."

I've had bubble tea before but never quite like this one. It was so yummy. I can't describe it any better than that. 

Located quite literally in a hole in the wall -- the servers were really energetic and informative. 

I wish the place was an actual sit down restaurant. 

I ended up choosing the matcha bubble tea. It was great, I'll definitely revisit."
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2019-10-24,5.0,"Let me start off by saying I was just so excited to have another bubble tea option in Ktown! 

Although I like Kung Fu and Gong Cha, I like the flavor variety which I saw featured here.

I tried the cheese foam White Peach Oolong tea (medium with boba) for $5.44. I loved it! I tasted the hints of tea/oolong flavor, the subtle sweetness of the peach, and the thick/creamy tart flavor of the cheese foam all blended together perfectly. 

I will definitely come back."
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2020-02-23,5.0,"Not all bubble teas are created equal and this one is certainly a good one. Line was short, place was super clean, and service was good. Overall a good option for when you are in need of some boba!"
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2019-10-02,4.0,"I decided to try the cheese foam i saw online, so i got one bubble milk tea with cheese foam.

Unfortunately i was not a fan of the cheese foam, it tasted weird and salty.

You're probably saying ""so why did you give 4 stars??"" And it's because the core bubble milk tea itself is very good. The bubbles are fresh and everything there tasted very fresh and very good.

The right amount of milk and tea, next time i come back i will get it without cheese foam."
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2019-09-11,5.0,"Uhm okay this place is a m a z i n g. Full disclaimer I'm no milk tea expert but if I lived in New York I would be here all the time. 

This location has a huge poster out front with a list of some of the most popular teas. Not being a connoisseur of milk teas I appreciated this! I went with the cheese foam Oreo milk tea because I was craving something sweet but didn't want the sugar rush of a dessert.  

I ordered a large and the girl at the cash register suggested boba as the topping. The order came to almost $7. I don't know if this is normal, but the tea was HUGE and the price didn't seem crazy to me given that it's New York and the drink is so large. 

It came out and first of all was beautiful to look at. There were 4 distinct layers; the black boba at the bottom, an Oreo cream, the milk tea, and the cheese foam at the top. They placed some Oreo crumbs and a fresh spring of mint on top. I appreciated the care that was taken to make the tea. They are a tiny shop with a long line so they could breeze through orders to get them out but I watched it being made and it was done with care. 

The flavor was out of this world. Lightly sweet, very creamy and the boba was an awesome suggestion because it really broke up the creamy sweetness. I will be the first to say I have absolutely no idea what cheese foam is but it's awesome-a slight tang and smooth. The whole drink was really well balanced. The only con was the large was way too much; if I ever got to go back I definitely would get the small. A lighter tea on a hot day would be great in the large size though. 

Definitely recommend, this place was great all the way around."
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2019-09-30,5.0,"5 stars for the taste of their milk tea! It reminded me of milk tea you can pick up in Hong Kong. 

I ordered the milk tea with boba, pudding and grass jelly. The pudding tasted different in an odd way and the grass jelly wasn't as dense. I didn't necessarily enjoy the taste or texture of either and would order with just boba next time. 

The service was quick and they had a lot of options on the menu. Looking forward to going back and trying another drink!"

Location: it is located in Ktown! Just order and go! 

Service: I just ordered and go, no interaction.

Food: BROWN SUGAR MILK TEA: it is actually good, does not taste artificial like most of the bubble tea shop! Ask for CHEESE FOAM with the bubble tea, it good!! i only tried this and I hope other flavors are good too! 

Price rating: 7 out of 10. I felt its expensive cause 7 dollars for large bubble tea!

Definitely will come back! I want to try the roasted brown rice something! Please add cheese foam with your bubble tea! It is a must!"

Other places have gotten me hooked on brown sugar milk tea, and when I saw it on their menu I knew that was what I was getting. First time at a new spot I always do 100% ice and sugar, just to see what their standard is. This drink really hit all the marks. Delicious, sweet, tender yet chewy boba, a great brown sugar tea taste, not too much or too little ice... man. So good! And there was the perfect boba to tea ratio, neither too much nor too little. It was also a pretty reasonable price point, about $6.50 for the large. If I'm in the area again, I'll definitely stop by and try another one of their creations- the blue one looks awesome!"

My first boba milk tea shop in NYC! It was nearby NYU and in KTown so I definitely had to try it. My NYU friends also mentioned good things about Macao and it was worth the fun trip. 

Located in the heart of KTown, my friends and I bused here and coincidentally, it was the day of the Korean Festival! There were a bunch of booths and an outdoor stage with multiple acts of dancing, singing, theater, etc. It was super busy and I was star-eyed in the big shiny city. 

Macao Imperial Tea is a take-out booth and there was of course a line. It was a warm day and boba milk tea was the perfect way to end the day. I ordered the Oolong Tea Cheese Foam in the cute white glass bottle! It was $8 total, but worth it as I took my souvenir cup home and still use it to this day. The tea and foam were delicious and bold but the boba pearls left more to be desired in terms of sweetness. Drink itself was 3.5/5 but the cute cups, fun experience, and friendly staff bumped my review to a 4 stars.

All in all, a solid choice for boba. I get tired sometimes of chain stores like Gong Cha or Sharetea. Macao is lesser known brand to me and it was fun trying something new. Cheers!"
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2019-12-25,4.0,My friend and I came here for a quick bubble tea fix before having the Korean BBQ lunch. I had milk tea with no sugar and 30% ice. It was very smooth and so filling. The medium size tea was a little bit over $4
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2020-02-23,5.0,"Another bubble tea gem in the city with what I think is one of the best cheese foams I've tasted so far. Located on 32nd street in the heart of Ktown NYC, this little stall boasts quite a bit of variety in terms of flavor. I don't know what it's like on the weekdays but when we came on a Sunday afternoon, there was a little bit of a line. The orders came quick though and everyone in my group enjoyed our bubble teas and loved the flavors. Will definitely be back to try the others!"
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2019-09-09,3.0,"Great tea, but quite expensive.

LOVE CHEESE FOAM, So I was very very excited to stumble upon this place while I was walking through ktown.

I ordered the spring fresh tea (which was on their bestsellers list) with cheese foam. My friend ordered a large mango drink. I didn't really pay attention to the price, but when my friend mentioned bubble tea prices seemed to have been inflating recently- and that he was paying almost $7 for a drink- I was a bit shocked. 

We came here after lunch on a Wednesday, probably around 1PM. There were a couple people who had ordered before us, and a couple people that quickly lined up after us. We ended up waiting for our drink for around 15 minutes. They were very polite and apologetic about the wait but 15 minutes was definitely a lot longer than I expected, especially for a small stand. There weren't enough people waiting for drinks to justify the long wait, in my opinion. 

In terms of the actual taste, I thought the spring fresh tea was DELICIOUS. Again, I am a BIG fan of cheese foam, so that may have been a contributor to why I loved the drink so much... I thought the tea l, did in fact, taste very ~spring fresh~. I chose less ice and 50% sugar, but the tea was still a good amount of sweetness for me. 

I didn't try my friend's mango drink, but he said it was also REALLY GOOD - just not worth ~$7.

I don't think I'd come here again because of the price and wait (I walked by this place on Saturday evening and the line was INSANE) but i think the taste of this tea is great!"
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2020-01-13,4.0,"Super tiny storefront in Koreatown.  They have some solid tea here.  I stopped by for their fruit tea and it was very refreshing.  Not overly sweet and decent tea.  I do enjoy Kung Fu Tea, but this one definitely had fancier drinks on their menu.  The only downside is that there really isn't much area to wait for your drink so you're kind of just in the middle of people walking by.  But for a grab and go kind of place, the tea is great!"
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2019-09-03,2.0,"My friend and I were on our way to KFT a few stores down when we spotted Macao Imperial Tea. Decided to check out this new boba spot instead. I got an oolong milk tea and my friend picked up their regular milk tea. We did enjoy their milk teas and appreciated the rich tea flavors. What we didn't appreciate was how we were essentially tricked into ordering. 

While we placing our orders, the employee informed us that they were out of their traditional black bubbles. As soon as we heard that, we told him that we would go to another spot instead. The employee, however, reassured us that they had brown sugar bubbles which ""tasted exactly the same with the same texture"". We listened to him and opted for the brown sugar bubbles only to realize that they were NOTHING like the bubbles we were expecting. What a huge disappointment and a shame that the employees were either misinformed or desperate for customers."
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2019-09-13,5.0,"WOAH. One of the BEST places to get bubble tea in Ktown! Honestly, I already hit this place up three times and the drinks don't disappoint! I got the White Peach Oolong Tea (without the cheese foam) and it was delicious ($5.25). The tea flavor complimented the peach flavor very well. This will definitely be my go to drink! I also got the Taro Pearl Milk Tea which was also really good ($5.25) . It didn't have that grainy powder taste like other places (cough cough LOL) Lastly, I got the Cheesecake & Pearl Milk Tea which is the star of the show if you like sweet drinks! It's one you should not pass up on because it's so yum! ($5.50) Overall, Macao Imperial Tea is definitely a spot you should check out! You will totally find me there a few times a week... (what can I say, I love boba!) 


I just wanted to update- I tried the Cheese Foam White Peach Oolong Tea and I don't hate it! I actually really like it and 100% recommend this drink. My friend got the Strawberry Slush which was very flavorful and doesn't taste artificial! Great for a hot day :)"
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2019-10-07,2.0,"We came here because the bubble tea joint across the street ran out of bubbles, so we gave this place a try. What a bad idea it was. We ordered a HOT jasmine tea with bubbles, 30% sugar, with a cold green tea with bubbles, 30% sugar.

We received our order and left the place, unfortunately, before we had the chance to taste our drink. My HOT tea was room temperature at best and they gave us the cold green tea with 100% sugar. 

At that point we were far from the place that it didn't seem worth it to go back. Two mistakes in two orders is just too much in my opinion."

I walked around the neighborhood and found this little tea shop. I would say it is pretty decent, as the tea and service is as good as other tea shops, but nothing stood out to me the most. I ordered the regular milk tea with foam cheese, and it is pretty good, but again you can get the same quality of milk tea at any other tea shops in the area. I love the fact that they are pretty cheap, 5 bucks for large milk tea, and they accept credit card. So it's convenient for any travelers.

I had the original milk tea with bubbles, 50% everything. The creaminess of the milk tea balanced just right with the flavor. Bubbles were soft and chewy. 

How amazing was this tea? so amazing that I had trouble falling asleep from it's authentic non-watered down black tea."
686,macao-imperial-tea-new-york-2,2020-03-02,5.0,The Brown sugar milk tea is amazing! I will definitely go back. I recommend getting coconut jelly's in the drink. Side note : bring cash 7.00 minimum.

Basically I am scared to try they regular 100% sweetness and I definitely do not recommend it for health conscious folks. The drinks were expensive for boba and are also lacking in any other flavors besides the sweetness so overall it was a let down."

Cashier was nice and the drink was made quickly. Based on their menu, it looks like they have a Lactaid milk tea option for those who are lactose intolerant, which is nice. Some of their drinks also come in a cute panda cup.

Even though there are a lot of bubble tea options in the Ktown area, I could see this one becoming a new favorite!"

So there's no seating area. You walk up to the counter, place your order and be on your merry way. As usual I get the coffee with milk. It's just so good! It always has me thinking what kind of magical milk are they using that makes it taste so good! Bring back your panda bottles to reuse. I was told you'll get a discount.

If you go during work hours it can be pretty slow to get your drink and the line can get quite long, but understandable given the location
If you go outside of working hours it's a pretty nice spot to hang out or get work done for a bit, not usually too noisy though there aren't many outlets
Bathroom cleanliness has been an issue at times, but I feel like that comes with the territory of a high traffic Starbucks"
687,starbucks-new-york-308,2018-06-22,5.0,"My new FAVORITE Bux. The customer service is so great here. The people are very friendly and they always get my drink right. They are personable without comprising professionalism.  

The most noteworthy thing about this Bux is the size. It is extremely spacious with ample seating, two cleanish restrooms and outlets to work from ""home"" or just charge your phone. The location is right by many hotels so if you're staying in the area and checked out, you can kill time here with luggage until your flight."

687,starbucks-new-york-308,2017-04-26,4.0,"If there is construction in NYC, there is a 17%* chance that the resulting structure will house, in full or in part, a Starbucks. 

*based on no facts whatsoever 

Walking from my office on 33rd & Park to the Starbucks on 34th & Park was becoming a chore. Honestly, the mild gradient walking up? Nah. Thank you Starbucks - now I can basically run down a hill (definitely not a hill) to 32nd & Park, satisfying my coffee craving at any point during the day without having to walk ""up"". 

Well - that's all an exaggeration. I was actually surprised to see this location pop up, since it is actually really close to the other one I mentioned. But the new construction, endless light, and helpful, talkative staff (how's your day going, new friend?) has convinced me to turn left instead of right when I walk out of my office.

It's actually a comparatively small building, and doesn't have a lot of tables or room to hang out, so if you plan on going there to do work, you might be rolling the dice. Other than that, the location is great, it's basically all windows, and the coffee is tops, as usual."
687,starbucks-new-york-308,2018-11-19,2.0,"I was feeling generous of giving a two-star review.  Bathroom was nasty, toilet seems to be clogged, floor needs to be mopped, sink was dirty.  My biggest pet peeve of a food service establishment is NO SOAP in the dispenser. Why would you have no soap in the dispenser?? Do you have employees or managers check the restroom every hour to make sure there is soap and it is sanitary? People take care of their personal hygiene and there should be soap in the dispenser at all times.  Starbucks charges $4.50 for premium drinks, but fail to keep the restroom up to par. Wow! 

Please advise."
687,starbucks-new-york-308,2020-01-22,1.0,"It really should be called the ""Starbucks Coffee & Homeless Shelter"". It's become a refuge for a mixture of homeless people and psychotics. A homeless man and his friends have become a fixture 24 hours both in and right outside the store. And the bathrooms reflect the ""guests"". Last time I was there I asked a ""guest"" to turn down his music and he refused. That was after I asked for sugar for my coffee and was told that they ran out of all sugar because ""people come in and take it"". So, I just ended up leaving and I'd bet I'm not the first. It's a big Starbucks with great potential but it's a shame what they've let it become."

While I agree (with other reviewers here) that the staff are very friendly and often greet you by name, they are EXTREMELY SLOW at EVERYTHING else. There are often 8 or more employees behind the counter and yet the wait for coffee is often 20 minutes or more.

Tips for Staff: Less chit chat, less fooling around, and more chop chop. This is New York at a very busy location -- people want to get in and get out."

Yes in the mornings it does get crowded; but what do you expect when your in the heart of Park Ave, the space is bigger then most and it's coffee----of course it's going to be busy. If you expect faster service then buy your own coffee machine or get use to mobile ordering!!!!

I love all the staff! They are very accommodating and always gets it right. If it's wrong then they will do it again. Easy as 1.2.3 

Now PLEASE!!!!!!!! Do not get upset if the Baristas mess up your ""triple decker splash of this that foo foo extra drizzle latte "" up! Just saying!!

Time from ordering to receiving my coffee was less than 5 minutes, even WITH the long morning line. 

Well done Starbucks!"
687,starbucks-new-york-308,2016-01-28,2.0,"This Starbucks is probably one of the worst I've been to. The only reason why I go to this specific Starbucks is because it's close to my work. I rarely ever come, mainly because I hate over priced ridiculously corporate coffee shops, but when I do, I always have the same unfortunate experience. 

First, It's always crowded. There's really never any tables any time of the day except for late nights, so good luck if you come here intending to buckle down and get work done. 
Second, It's disgustingly dirty every time I come here. When I do find an open table, there's always coffee stains or stale crumbs left everywhere. Their bathroom, especially, is always disgusting. Nothing says a cup of joe like the scent of pee and sight of trash on the floors. Really yummy. 
Third, the baristas never seem to get my order right. I usually ask for a dairy free option of milk (all they have is soy at this facility, unfortunately) and it to be unsweetened. Pretty basic, right?  Yet each and every time, It's completely forgotten. The last time I came here, they never asked me for a size, just assumed I wanted a grande so charged me for one. Alright, great, thanks. 

Next time you are craving Starbucks (which honestly, I don't know who does), I would recommend avoiding this one as much as possible. It's just not worth it."

687,starbucks-new-york-308,2017-06-14,5.0,"I wanted to give a quick shout out to Stephanie! She always works the morning shift when I am running into Starbucks with minutes to spare before work. I try to do mobile orders when I plan enough ahead - really saves so much time. Stephanie always checks in with the customers waiting and always makes sure that people haven't been waiting too long for their orders. Much appreciated. 

The location is always kept clean and is the classic starbucks vibe: people either working at a computer or talking with a friend. 

Tip: If you have not already - Download the Starbucks App and become a ""Rewards/Gold Member."" It costs nothing and if you go to Starbucks (like most people do) it allows you to quickly pay, order ahead, and acquire points when you purchase something. Eventually it adds up and you a free item. I always save my points for a day I forget my lunch and just run by my local Starbucks and get my free, fresh lunch!"

The staff is for the most part friendly but when they are very busy you can feel kind of rushed and unimportant.

One stand out of this location is the Manager Jarvis.  He is always in command of his team and jumps in whenever it gets hectic to help out.  He is always friendly with customers and thanks each person he deals with.  

As long as I work in NYC I will be coming to this Starbucks!!"

687,starbucks-new-york-308,2015-04-30,5.0,"Let me preface this by saying the following: i'm not a coffee person. I never drink coffee. I don't even like going into Starbucks and I never buy anything from any of these places. This is important, because i want you to know just how much i DISLIKE even entering these places. 

One of my gigs has an office not too far from this particular starbucks, and sometimes I have to go by here and grab coffee for our clients. sometimes it's a cup or two...sometimes it's a LOT of coffee. In every case, I have literally no idea what these people order because, like i said, i'm not a coffee person. I usually show up with a list and just hand it to the baristas there. I'm there so much that they're just like ""oh you're back huh? cool."" and they just start typing in my order and marking it off with people's names so i'm not confused. they realize that i'm not a coffee or a starbucks person and they make it very easy for me to interact with them and get the right thing. I've met a lot of the people who work here and they're all really nice. People walk in all the time and the barista will just tell them their order before they even speak. it's pretty cool. 

in fact, one particular flustered day for me, the manager was helping me with my order and noticed my frustration, and asked what i normally get from starbucks. i told him im not a coffee guy so i never buy anything from there. he asked if i like tea. i said, yea sometimes. so he made me a fruity ice tea thing and gave it to me for free, just to try. pretty nice guy who you can tell when you talk to him cares about literally everyone single person who comes into his establishment. This place is just a good establishment and it's just run exceptionally well. well done."
687,starbucks-new-york-308,2017-01-26,1.0,"I've never been to a Starbucks where cashiers blatantly speak about their personal problems, while asking for your order, have you repeat 3 times and continue to go on about their business. I said to myself ""I get it, it's rush hour so minds are going in every direction at the moment???""

I'm waiting for my order, minding my own business and i hear a ""psssst""...  I look up and a finger points at me, asking ""what's your order again?"" 

Safe to say flat out rude and severely lacks work ethics."
687,starbucks-new-york-308,2016-11-16,2.0,"Want to give 1 start but giving 2 starts because it was a rush hour (benefit of doubt). 

""There are no spice powders left. Could I get some cinnamon please?"" 
""If there's none out there, there's no more.""
... um excuse me, miss barista - there's a almost full bottle of cinnamon right next to you... 

Basically, they can't be bothered for any extra anything during rush hour. And my grande hot drink didn't even come with whipped cream I've specified during order, so I had to wait even longer than regular rush hour wait to get a barista's attention for whipped cream. 

Yes, #FirstWorldProblems. But I went to Starbucks to kind of treat myself for a pretty sucky morning. So... what the heck. Ya know?"
687,starbucks-new-york-308,2016-11-11,3.0,"I come to this Starbucks often to do work and it definitely has its positive and negative qualities. The one great thing about this location is the size. It's huge and there's tons of seating inside. There's only one row of seating when you walk in to the right of the entrance that has outlets. Everything on the left side has no outlets so this can sometimes be a problem. I also find that when I sit on the row of outlets, the speakers are right there and are super loud and distracting. I wish Starbucks wouldn't blast their music so loud and be aware that people are actually trying to do work. I can hear the music sometimes over my own music playing from my headphones. 

The other thing about this Starbucks is that the drinks take a pretty long time to make, especially when it's crowded which it normally is. There's also been times where I've waited for over 10 minutes and they've forgotten my drinks. The baristas are either friendly or they're not. When the drink eventually does come though there's no complaints there - always hot and made just how I asked. Overall it's Starbucks, so this is what I would expect. At least you can usually find a seat and get a little work done."
687,starbucks-new-york-308,2016-06-14,4.0,"This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations in the city.  Even when it's packed, it never seems crowded because the seating area is large, with ample space between the tables. Plus; there is almost always an outlet open. I go here often because I work across the street, and I've never been disappointed with service. My orders are correctly made, and the associates are always friendly.  The only downside is the bathroom, which has been closed on several occasions.  It's not always the cleanest when it is open, but let's be real--it's an NYC public bathroom. 

FOOD/DRINK - Starbucks...need I rate it? You either like it or you don't.

SERVICE - 5/5

ATMOSPHERE - 4/5
5 stars for the large space and dependable wi-fi. 3 stars for the frequent bathroom closures, and the fact that the floor generally looks unswept."

This location is very spacious and has tons of room for studying, without feeling like you're on top of people. Had an error with an online package and the employee could not resolve it for me. Jarvis, the manager, came in and took care of the situation in a matter of minutes. I've interacted with him a few times and he always has everything in order. If something is not right or a cashier is slow, I see him getting another employee to man the lines or take care of the problem--which is important in a busy Starbucks.

688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2019-11-11,3.0,"I've visited Optimistic Cafe a few times when I needed a quiet(er) place to make short phone calls. My go-to for coffee in the area is Corvo, but it can definitely get very hectic over there.

Optimistic Cafe is usually pretty empty and has a great atmosphere. The interior is clean and beautiful, but maybe a little too much so since I feel the need to finish up and leave before getting too comfortable. I'm also a bit confused about the menu here - maybe I come at the wrong times, but when I visited here at around 10am on a weekday it seemed like the store just opened up since the menu was blank and the barista was still setting everything up.

I can't get myself to like the coffee here either. It's oddly bitter and adding cream or sugar only makes it taste weirder. If I do come back in the future, hopefully the menu will be up and I can try something a bit more enjoyable."

The service was a bit aloft and I wasn't even sure if he was talking to me half the time or not. I ordered a cortado, which I was served promptly. I guess they don't have designated cortado cups, because it was served in a half empty latte cup. Cortados are supposed to be small, but they look a little sad when the serving dish is half full. As for the taste, it was almost sour, definitely not smooth and silky as I would have liked. Cute shop, quiet, but wouldn't spend $5 on an almond milk cortado here again."

It is right off of 8th so it is convenient, but not as crowded as most of the coffee shops right on 8th. The espresso has a rich, velvety flavor. I love the lattes from here... hot or iced!  

Not only is the coffee delicious, but the actual shop is adorable! There is a grass wall and the whole vibe is very aesthetically pleasing. There is not a lot of seating, but because it is a little bit quieter from other shops in the area, I have never had an issue finding a seat. 

Overall, a 5/5 experience here! The workers are always friendly and the drinks come out quickly. I have not tried the food items here, but they always look good! Definitely give this place a try if you are in the midtown west area!"

It was 8 am so maybe i went too early but I was really looking for breakfast on the side of my coffee and nothing ! The iced latte I got was good but I couldn't drink it without adding some sugar and I usually drink lattes without any added sweetness. Maybe the espresso was too strong or burnt? I don't know. But the floors were dirty with coffee stains and the station where you can get your sugar and milks was so messy. I love the grass wall they have, but I would try another place nearby."

My only complaint is that the seating isn't the most comfortable, but not enough to take away a star, especially because the wooden tables are really cool and they compliment the plant wall.

688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-11-14,4.0,"Walking into Optimistic makes your feel like you're in a quaint coffee shop in your home town, not midtown Manhattan. However you will flash back to reality REAL QUICK when you pay $5.50 for a small latte. 

Last time I came to Optimistic my friend and I got there at 8am. It was painfully quiet inside. they weren't even playing music. It was the kind of quiet where you know the baristas are listening to your conversation but there's nothing you can do but embrace it and try not to make eye contact. I think about 20 mins in it was finally too much to bear and they turned on some music to make us all a little less uncomfortable. 

Optimistic has a few seats and if you get there early in the morning it's a good place to do work or catch up with a friend. However I think most people use this shop on their way to work when they're tired of Starbucks and want to treat themselves. 

*Note to millennials- latte art is available for your instagram story AND they have a leafy green wall which I feel could be an excellent backdrop for a photo opp."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2019-06-27,2.0,"The place is cute, has some good energy to it and is located away from the busiest area, which makes the atmosphere pretty special. However, the golden latte I ordered was watery, it lacked smoothness and all of the spices we're condensed on the bottom of the cup. 5 dollars seems a bit two high for this coffee, I'll be trying another place next time."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2017-11-20,3.0,"Got the Golden Latte. I've had better turmeric lattes. This one is a bit too watery for me; it lacked that silky smoothness I love in my lattes. On the plus side, since it's so light, it's probably lower calorie than others. However, $5.50 is too much! I couldn't keep coming back here. 

No WiFi or bathrooms, so clearly a place intended for brief meetups or pay-and-go. The plant wall is a sweet touch. What was even sweeter was the peanut butter and chocolate cookie samples at the register; I couldn't get enough of it! The people behind the counter didn't even mind. They were super friendly. I hope they kill it at this new location!"

I came in looking to kill about 20 minutes, and loved the ambience and the coffee. 

The barista was very friendly and made a darn good  iced latte! I got mine with whole milk, but they had several non-dairy options. I drank my latte sans sweetener and it was absolutely perfect, rich and balanced. I would absolutely order it again! 

The price was on point with most other small coffee shops, $5. Totally reasonable. 

They had a decent amount of seating and I was able to snag a seat by the window. Chairs were quite comfortable. 

Will be back soon!"

At some point, I thought there was a camera hidden somewhere in the coffeeshop and would find myself on TV.

So it starts with the ordering, I asked the girl behind the counter if the latte contains two shots of espresso and she replied ""yes"", so I asked her if mine could just have one (my go-to order at every coffeeshop). She immediately replied ""No"". Surprised, I asked again and she said ""it´s not possible"". After going back and forth, telling her that I order this all the time at other places, I told her that she could pour the two shots and I would throw the second one before she adds the milk. At this point, she goes like ""ok, I will do it but it will taste like water"".

At this point I was already surprised by the service, but it goes on. When she was starting to make the latte, I told her ""oh it´s to stay"", and, as she was speaking to a colleague seating next to her, she replied to me ""I´m not talking to you"".

Already a bit shocked, I picked my latte and went seating. A bit later, I went back to the counter to ask if there was wifi, the colleague replied ""yes... but no"". Confused, I asked him if there was or wasn´t wifi, he replied ""yes but later in the afternoon, around 3 or 3.30 PM"". I looked at my watch and it was 2.50 PM so I told him ""so within 10 minutes"", and he goes ""yep, within 10 minutes"" and doesn´t give me passcode. 

All of this for a 5.25 dollars latte. I have to say the coffee wasn´t bad and the location, while tiny, was actually good for someone who doesn´t like AC (the only reason I stayed when fighting the staff with the order), but definitely the worst service I´ve ever had in a coffeeshop. By the end, I was actually laughing about it. I still hope I won´t find myself on TV."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-10-09,5.0,"This place is great - my current go-to for coffee and if I want to indulge.. an egg sandwich. 

The cold brew is actually perfect, and they have this whole wheat croissant that is solid and does not flake apart like other croissants. I am sure all the other breakfast items are amazing/unique, but they might take some time to prepare.. which I don't have in the morning. 

The dudes are mad chill and are always playing some decent music even in the AM. Have been mostly in and out, but the vibe is right for a coffee shop and the massive greenery that fills up a wall is beautiful. 

My only complaint is not leaving milk out - since everyday I ask for whole milk. Other than that.. keep doing your thing, Optimistic!"
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-08-22,5.0,"The tile on the floor drew me in at first to this cozy, warm cafe! The wooden furniture and plant wall give great aesthetics. The staff were super friendly and patient. Lots of effort was put into their lattes. They have tabs for cold brew and nitro cold brew. I had the cold brew which was very smooth. Milk wasn't out in canisters, but you can ask and they will provide you with a carton of any milk you want (I enjoy oat milk). Prices are average for a small coffee shop, but they have a punch card which is always appreciated. Wish I came in here earlier!"
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2017-12-01,5.0,I pass by this place often but I rarely get coffee. Today they were advertising cider and I love cider so I decided to go inside. this place is pretty much everything I'd dream about in a coffee shop from the cool tiling to the plant wall to the wood chairs. The cider is magnificent- it's got a good mulled flavor and was the perfect temperature when poured. Also props to this place for choosing the best lid for drinks- it's got a bit of a sippy cup design so you don't spill on yourself and can drink while walking! They recently started serving food so I hope to be back to sit down and enjoy the atmosphere.
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-11-02,5.0,"It's a very pretty space inside and I love the ""be optimistic"" sign at the door. They have few small and one big table at the wall with plants. My latte was very pretty and delicious. It was served in a nice blue cup. The barista was nice and quick. The also do pour over."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2019-04-30,5.0,"Outstanding drip coffee from Counter Culture roasters. Very knowledgable and friendly staff. Small, but cute and pleasant area to sit. Nice addition to the area."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-11-25,5.0,"My favorite coffee shop, such a little gem. I always stop here on my way to work. Staff is super friendly, warm and inviting. They take their time and make sure that you're satisfied with your drink. Overall I would say that they're very consistent. I'll always rave about them.

I've honestly gone through about 8 of their rewards cards (buy 10 drinks, 11th one is free!)"
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2019-11-21,2.0,"I visited Optimistic Cafe tonight looking for somewhere to do a bit of work. I came in and tried to order off their menu and was told that they are not serving any of their seasonal drinks. Already, half of their menu was off the table. I asked if they had any sort of tea and I was offered a lavender tea. I asked for an iced tea and paid for my drink. I was handed a hot tea. When I asked the woman behind the counter, she replied ""sorry I forgot to tell you. We don't have ice right now"". I would think a cafe would have ice 3 hours before closing. I will not be returning."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2019-03-11,5.0,Certainly the best cap in entire NYC I have ever experienced. Very small shop but unarguably the coffee is worth every penny ! Been a regular here for the last 3 years and I am glad that this cafe is a part of my every morning commute !
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-11-26,5.0,"My daughter invited my husband and I  to this place on our recent visit to the city and we were completely charmed. My husband had a pour over, I had a a latte both and my daughter had a Matcha latte all were perfect. They also have food and snack options, Avacado and Salmon toast, crossiants and pastries also delicious. If you're ever in the area stop by, enjoy the ambience and everything this gem of a place gas to offer."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2017-09-21,4.0,"I love this place! If the ""Be Optimistic"" tiled doorstep doesn't pull you in, the plant wall, uneven cut wood tables and friendly staff will.

This will definitely (and quickly) become my go-to coffee shop in the area. The atmosphere is wonderful, it's truly unlike any other cafe in the area, and the coffee is really great. I love the cold brew and nitro cold brew. I'll report back on the lattes, etc. once the first cold front rolls in....

Plus, they have a rewards card where if you buy 10 you get one free (or buy nine get the tenth free, something like that). And I always appreciate places that realize the value and loyalty that comes with offers and promotions like that."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2017-06-11,5.0,"I was their very first customer today!!! Deal with it b*****s! Lol! 

Seriously, I work nearby, so I will be dropping by frequently, not just because it's close, but because (a) I am a FAN of good coffee (meaning, not a fan of Starbucks) and Be Optimistic's is real coffee; and (b) I love people with good vibes, and my first impression in this sense was just perfect! Also, the fact that the place looks good doesn't hurt! 

Shoutout to Stanley for making the perfect cortado!

New fave coffee shop! ^_^"
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-06-06,5.0,"Today's find was this little gem; they have some Fun stuff going on here such as really cool high bar stool wood tables, a plant wall, and some fun people working behind the counter. Since I can't have milk, I really like the options I was given for my latte. Now, I didn't eat anything but I saw the folded eggs and boy did they take their time in making it and it looked bomb! I couldn't find any stir rods when I went but if that was my only problem I really think I'll be going there more and more."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-12-13,5.0,It's true.. $1 more for better coffee and better customer service! Only reason I went to other is because better food selection but if you worked on that it's unbeatable! such better coffee and better experience overall.
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2017-11-18,5.0,"No doubt there's a lot of competition in the area but I stumbled upon this café via yelp and it's worth checking out! it's not sleek, but warm, I like the lighting and the plant wall of course! the atmosphere made me especially comfortable while meeting up with a colleague.
and as an ice tea connoisseur I especially appreciated that they had a variety. try the hibiscus tea!"
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2017-09-01,5.0,"Coffee is coffee, but excellent coffee is Optimistic Cafe's coffee! There are delicious choices, and the baristas there are so sweet and welcoming (very unlike some New York retailers and store associates). The setting is beautiful - there's a wall of fake plants and the chairs and tables feature a natural design using wood as the medium. This was my second time there this week."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-07-17,5.0,"I work in service, because of this I never feel inclined to write Yelp reviews. But this place was a real surprise to find in Manhattan. 
A friend & I popped in and ordered some drinks & the poached egg toast. The place is quite tiny with incredibly styled yet comfortable atmosphere (one wall is entirely plants & the thick wood stools + tables were out of my home decor dreams). 
I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of food quality, but the man who served the dish clearly took abundant care in preparing it. It honestly makes me wish I was a foodie photo person - it was BEAUTIFUL. Extremely generous serving of 2 thick, fluffy slices of crusted bread topped with smashed avocado, 2 poached eggs, crushed nuts, sweet baby tomatoes, & topped / surrounded by the perfect portion of vinaigrette tender greens. What really made it spectacular was the seasoning - the vinaigrette and gracious seasoning asked for nothing else (and I'm always reaching for condiments). Even splitting it, we were both full. Hats off to the man working for his kindness as well. 
Definitely recommend, very pleasantly surprised."
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2017-09-26,5.0,"Fantastic coffee spot.
Awesome vibe, quite excellent coffee.
Staff is super friendly. Love it here"
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2017-08-01,4.0,"First go here and it's excellent. Will need to keep going to check consistency. 
Don't sit too close to the plant wall. It doesn't smell great"
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2017-11-10,4.0,Good coffee and cookies. They don't allow electronics if you are planning to go and work there.
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-05-02,5.0,Great coffee and very cute & cozy coffee shop with friendly employees. Thankfully it's right by work so I will be coming back often!
688,optimistic-cafe-new-york,2018-05-08,5.0,"Best salmon sandwich and latte! 
And the emploees are very kind and nice :) 
Also, cookie was so good."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2020-02-07,5.0,"How many Mattos are there ?

This shop has the logo sign that looks just like the zero Tarot card , the FOOL card, Matto is Crazy in Italian.

This shop doesn't have some of the wall art as others do, but they got your usual list of espresso coffee and then some I rarely seen, like 'Red Eye'  and 'Cortado'.  

They have a decent number of muffins , cakes, cookies croissants that are good for $2 and so was the coffee I get here. 

I'm always impressed with Matto and $2 doesn't mean you get cheap and tasteless but good and equal or better to some higher prices places."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-06-08,5.0,"I love Matto! Everything is $2, so you can get a soy mocha and a breakfast sandwich, buy the same for a friend, and still have change left over from your Hamilton. In a city where a medium espresso drink easily runs $4-5 and nondairy milk frequently adds an extra $0.75, Matto is a true treat. It uses La Colombe, just like your fancy hipster spot. 

This isn't a spot to sit and enjoy yourself or whip out a laptop, but if you're looking for treats to-go Matto is just right. Plan to pay by card if you don't love coins; the $2 price point means after tax everything is $2.18."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-06-15,4.0,"Fast service and most importantly, everythings $2!!! Great cafe for grab and go! Lots of options for pastries and has breakfast sandwich. I got the 1L Evian water bottle for $2 too. Amazing deal!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-06-02,4.0,"I was walking near my office area and a sign caught my attention. Everything $2?? I was curious and entered the store immediately. 

I ordered a latte with almond milk and it was indeed two dollars. They even didn't charge me extra for almond milk which was really nice. 
Other places usually charge 50 cents to 1 dollars for nondairy substitutes. So it was definitely a steal. The coffee was just okay but I don't expect two dollar coffee should be superior. 
  
I didn't have any cash with me and they said four dollar minimum for cards. However, there was the owner and he said it's okay. I will make sure I bring some cash with me next time. 

You can grab some pastries and everything is two dollars as they advertised. The seating area is not too big but there are several tables and chairs too."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-10-21,4.0,"Came in due to the fact that everything is only 2$. Very small, clean coffee shop with a large selection of pastries and small bites. I tried keeping it simple and healthy with a homemade granola bar that was huge! To be honest I didn't expect much but it was absolutely delicious and I ate half before taking a picture. Tasted like a super chewy and buttery oatmeal cookie. I got an almond milk latte as well which I have not much to say about. It was definitely not the best coffee I've had but it was ok and 2$ so. I'll be back to try more pastries but I wouldn't go out of my way for the coffee"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-01-26,5.0,"This location is so small, but they have big hearts!! Very friendly baristas and of course, like all Matto Espresso locations, great pricing!

PS - No extra charge for vegan milks!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-05-20,4.0,"Living in New York is expensive, there's no way around it or disputing it. With that being said, I'm always on the hunt for great bargains and bang for your buck eateries especially around Manhattan. Matto Espresso is exactly that and more! Everything is literally $2. Yes, you read that right, $2. Initially, I had reservations and was hesitant to go in upon walking by on my commute to work because I figured I'd be sacrificing quality for the price of the goods. Thankfully, that wasn't the case whatsoever. Their latte was strong and well balanced and of course the latte art didn't hurt. Their cookies and donuts were fresh, warm and tasty. I have a bit of a sweet tooth as you may have noticed. Last but not least, the bar was nutty and packed a punch of flavor along with the varied textures. Aside from breakfast options, they do have some lunch items in the form of sandwiches and wraps (vegetarian included), which I'll certainly be trying on my next visit!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-10-25,4.0,"This place is amazing--anything you want for $2...in NYC?? 

I got an iced chai latte and a chia seed pudding which was also pretty tasty. Service was quick and friendly. This is definitely my new go to spot for a quick drink and/or bite."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-12-05,4.0,"TLDR: Good place for a grab and go snack/caffeine fix. Overall rating: A


Everything is $2 plus tax here. I got a brownie and a cheese boureka. The brownie was delicious, fudgy, dense, and crispy on top just how I like. The cheese boureka had an interesting cheese filling that I would describe as a dry feta cheese. There were black sesame seeds on top. They shut down the toaster after a certain time. It was fine for me since I was eating it later. They carry the standard cafe stuff: various coffees, muffins, scones, cookies, cakes, bagels, some simple pre -made sandwiches, juices, water, oatmeal, etc. Very impressed by the variety in such a small space. Expect smaller portions though! $4 credit card minimum. No seating or bathroom from what I saw. There are 10 locations of Matto in NYC according to their website. I would definitely stop by if I'm in the area of one and feeling peckish!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-03-15,5.0,"Was a bit skeptical about this place, only because on first impression, there was a large sign that screamed ""EVERYTHING $2"". Little did I know that this was going to be the best two dollars that I have ever spent. 

Something as simple as a latte or even a hot chocolate was the creamiest drink I've ever had. Four high quality coffees for $8 in the heart of New York City? That's unheard of. We came here everyday, sometimes even twice a day on our one week trip."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-05-17,4.0,"Am I the only person who wonders how these people manage to pay rent?!? I've been told to shut up, appreciate the $2 inventory, and not ask questions, but it just blows my mind how they stay in business with these prices. Anyhoo, Matto is magical. All coffees and food items are literally $2, not including tax. There's a $4 credit card minimum, which is totally reasonable. Their coffee isn't my favorite around. I rate it better than Dunkin' and not as good as Gregory's. But they get major points for having not only almond milk, but also several pastry and food options! Seriously, you can even come eat an average lunch here for $6. What a deal. For this neighborhood, this is pretty cool. 

There's two stools and some counter space inside, but it's literally a small coffee stand, so plan to grab and go. Don't forget to observe the incredible painting on the wall that totally sets Matto a tiny bit apart from their cheap cafe counterparts around."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-11-19,5.0,"Whoever is behind Matto Espresso is a marketing genius. Half sandwiches for $2, chia pudding for $2, fresh made lattes for $2?! What the heck?

For those wondering how this place benefits from business, it probably gains more customers from its fair pricing, appealing to people of all tastes, frugal or picky. They don't even charge you additional for non-dairy substitutes, such as almond or soy. Don't you love this socialism? I can believe the person behind this franchise/chain is not white. Also, the quality behind the $2 shows. Once you've gotten a taste of it, it's likely you come around buying second rounds. That's what happened to me, I bought one potato puff pastry, and it was so good I came back to the counter to pick up a couple more goodies before I left. It's a marketing strategy that totally works. I told my sister I snagged a whole lunch, drink and dessert for $6 in NYC. She was befuddled and jealous!!! Hats off to Matto. If it becomes a super chain that's unavoidable from every corner like amazon.com, I wouldn't be mad. Oh and I think the domestic goods like nuts and granola bars are Israelian/Kosher for those of you wondering. Okay, that's all for now!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-10-02,5.0,"This location is much better than the one by Grand Central. Service is always excellent. I recommend the iced coffee, which a great value at $2 like everything else ($2.18 including tax). 

FYI - credit card purchases require a $4 (2 item) minimum."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-06-02,4.0,Everything here is $2?! Whether it's a pastry or a small / large coffee its $2 and the quality is surprisingly good. They have pastry's that are similar to Boreks. Definitely recommend stopping in if you're in the area
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-02-23,5.0,"This place has saved me from starvation and the grease buckets that are affordable food in Midtown. Their Vegan Burgers and Avocado Egg Sandwiches are health heaven at an affordable price - everything is $2! There is such a variety of great, healthy food here. I have yet to try their drinks, but I'll get to it soon (Maybe they judge me for not ever buying a drink, but they're really kind!). The branding is great and their pay cards have the raddest design. I want to try almost everything here and I will be back whenever I don't have Mealpal. I hope this place stays here forever- it's the best thing in Midtown hands down."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-10-11,5.0,"This is probably going to be my go to place to get coffee and a small bite to get my work day started. Everything is $2 so I can save money on coffee. My usual is going to be a large Black Eye with caramel flavor and a toasted Cheese or Potato Bureka. 

I use the the Ritual app to order ahead and it auto places my order when I'm heading there so my order is ready when I arrive. Pretty cool efficiency feature. I also won't have to wait on line to order, but if the line is long it moves really fast. It's a small place so don't plan to sit down. The seating area is really small and right next to the milk, sugar, etc."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-01-10,4.0,"This coffee shop is very tiny, so don't plan on staying a while. It's a bit cramped, so you have to get your food and get out of there quick. That being said, the coffee is great and so is the food. I had a great cookie and pretzels with hummus that was one of the best I've ever had. Everything else looked delicious too. Also, the everything $2 makes it very affordable and also extremely convenient. I will definitely be back, but perhaps at one of the more spacious locations."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-10-07,4.0,"Ran in for a quick espresso and bite before a meeting.  Friendly service, small but nice selection of food and drinks.  This place is tiny but managed to have a spot for 2 or 3 people to have their drink inside.  

Overall a good place for a quick pick me up."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-05-17,4.0,I love good coffee and a little baked good to go with it.  its always a favorite part of my day inNYC..  It can get expensive to spend $8 a day on capucino and a muffin.  This place is just about perfect $2 for anything you get... so for half the price you can treat yourself daily. Glad i found them.
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-04-03,5.0,"I can't believe everything here is $2. No indoor seating available, but a great place to grab a coffee on the go. Will definitely return to try their lattes and other drinks. I only got a plain black coffee and no complaints there. I also loved that they had almond milk to add to your coffee next to the other regular milks, I feel like most places always charge extra for almond milk so that was a nice surprise!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-12-13,5.0,"Absolutely in love with this place. I end up picking up at least 5 things every time I stop in, so my attempts of saving money actually costs me an $11 breakfast and I never regret it. Really glad to have found this place. The multigrain croissant is pretty bomb and how is kombucha for $2 even a thing."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2017-05-04,4.0,"Man... everything in here is worth trying but I must advise, don't have buyer's remorse.  This place will keep you coming back for more and more.  The staff is friendly and very appealing like the pastry and latte's they serve.  I feel very fortunate to have this establishment near my job!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-09-19,4.0,"What's not to like? Everything is $2, good quality, and service is fast. I got an iced latte, which was great. Just about Starbucks quality for half the price. I also got a piece of chocolate babka, which was just ok. I wouldn't get the babka again, but it wasn't terrible. The service is great. The people who work there are fast, friendly, and competent.

I would recommend this place and come back probably every day for coffee if I worked nearby.

When will Yelp allow 4.5 stars? That's really what this place deserves. I'm deducting a point because of the dry babka.

Also - this is an in and out kind of place. There are only two stools. Not a place to sit and work, but a great place to grab something quick on the go."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2017-05-04,5.0,"Absolutely love this place. Everything is $2!!! Place us small but great and fast service. $4 minimum credit card charge. Definitely a fan. Came back for more goodies. 

Awesome 2 shit latte and cheese bureka."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2019-06-12,5.0,"I'm not gonna lie, I thought since everything was $2 things would be low quality but I was pleasantly surprised in how nice everything was. I've gotten delicious tea, iced lattes, hot cocoa, etc here and everything was prepared fast and with courteous service. I haven't had much food here but their chocolate chip cookies and omelet on a croissant were simply tasty! Definitely recommend, if only this place was larger so I could sit down and enjoy my drinks and stuff!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2017-05-17,4.0,"Yay for $2 for everything! Also yay for having multiple gluten free options! 

I got the gluten free cookie and gluten free quinoa muffin. (They also have gluten free oatmeal and granola with yogurt) Unfortunately they weren't that great. Muffin was dense and dry, and the cookie tasted too healthy. 

But props for having a decent gluten free selection and for it being $2!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2017-12-06,5.0,My office is in 39st and I passed by this coffee shop for several times during my commute. The sign of everything $2 with heart really caught my eyes. I thought it was just a joke before. This morning I finally got inside and I found out that it was really everything for only $2. The coffee is okay. They also provide sandwiches and other food. They all look good. It's worth a try.
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-10-24,5.0,I love this place. Come here every morning and order the same thing. Spinach burekas and dirty chai. People are friendly and the coffee and cold teas are great.
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-10-16,4.0,"this chain coffee, pastries , soups, salads , sandwich  and more shop is taking over manhattan little by little and why not when each item is 2 bucks straight up. the location is 37th st between 7th and 8th ave in an area where you have plenty of working folks looking for cheap eats . place is small with very little seating options so it's order and grab and go . good coffee and the amount of sweets and other stuff to munch on for breakfast and lunch . i personally like the muffins and egg brioche sandwiches and for 2 bucks each you can't beat the prices . it tends to get crowded inside so be patience with the workers especially if they are making coffee orders .with so many choices at 2 bucks a pop you can't go wrong at matto's."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-05-24,1.0,"I went to get some coffee and accidentally left my phone at the counter.  Went back to retrieve it within 30 minutes and was notified that it was never found.  When i spoke to one of the employees, they informed me no phone was found. Another customer was there and offered to call it just in case and to my surprised, it was behind the counter under the cash register. This a shady practice and should be bad karma to this place.  They have cameras and i have GPS in my phone but still they were trying to find a way to snatch my phone.  Bad people here, stay away"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-06-19,3.0,Matto is essentially a discounted coffee shop where everything is $2. I like the cheesecake in a cup here but they rarely have it in stock. It's a bit annoying that they have a minimum $4 credit card requirement and also the coffee tastes subpar but it is a bargain.
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2017-03-03,4.0,"I passed by this coffee shop and say a sign that ""Everything is $2"", in a world every everyone is trying to nickel and dime you, this is a treat. I tried several of their pastries which were decent. Their beverages were delicious and very affordable for the price. Staff is very friendly and efficient.  Will definitely visit again!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-06-05,5.0,Good place for a good price; everything is $2 ($2.18 with tax) so I think it's a great place and it has lots of vegan options too!!
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2017-11-29,5.0,LOVE this place. Best iced mocha I've ever had and a price you can't beat especially in NYC. I try different pastries each time I go and have yet to be disappointed. The staff is also very friendly and efficient!

Go...and ENJOY!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-01-17,5.0,"It makes you feel good when a place is reasonably being priced, especially in such an overpriced city. Everything $2 is great- and everything seems good! My latte was a bit bitter, but hey, definitely not the worst and the fact that it tastes better when it's $2. Anyway. Babka also decent. $4 card minimum- which I feel is also reasonable. And the barista/manager European lady was very nice and efficient."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2017-09-29,5.0,"Absolutely random find and extremely happy about it. Everything here is 2 dollars (it says for a limited time but it's been going on for months now). They have from fresh coffee to little packed salads to  easy breakfast sandwiches to fresh pastries. What can go wrong? Nothing. The food is amazing and it's not exactly your average American shop since they do have a few... I would like to say, maybe Turkish pastries-- which by the way, they're amazingly fresh and toasted! It's not overwhelmingly crowded on a Friday morning (10:30am) but I could image their lines going out the door. The place is extremely small with only two seats looking out the window/door and just enough space to fit in 5 other people inside ordering. To my fellow New Yorkers heading to work and not feeling like spending more than 5 bucks for breakfast, this is the perfect place for you!"
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2017-08-18,4.0,"Yes, everything is $2 and it has been like that for months now. (They have a limited time sign outside but it's been months.) Size is a bit small, but can't complain. Where else can you get a latte for $2 without being charged for almond/soy milk?!?! The espresso is solid since they brew la Colombe, but their muffins/brownies were meh, nothing spectacular. They have half sandwiches, oatmeal, yogurt/granola too."
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2017-07-21,3.0,Really cute little coffee shop in midtown. And cheap too! Wish there was more of a seating area (and that the staff spoke better English) but overall good!
689,matto-espresso-new-york-3,2018-02-26,5.0,Lucky to work a few doors down from this spot. Always a good selection and you can't beat the prices! Great in a pinch for a snack and a coffee. Mario makes the perfect cortado!
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-12-28,5.0,"Came here for a networking meeting, and to be honest, the coffee here is priced higher than what I see in San Francisco (where rent is $1k-$2k more than Manhattan on average).

Still I have to say that their lattes are the best I've had anywhere. So I'd say the coffee is worth the premium price."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-11-23,4.0,"No joke they have one of the best chocolate chip cookies I've had and that's saying a lot because I'm a chocolate chip cookie snob; I bake my own typically.  

I saw the a-frame saying best cookies in NYC so I ordered one with my vanilla latte with oat milk.  There's a ton of chocolate in the cookie which made it nice and gooey since it was still warm. It had the perfect amount of crunch yet gooey softness in the center. Yummy! 

The vanilla latte was good too. They make their own vanilla syrup and they use Tahitian vanilla instead of normal Madagascar vanilla.  I'm a big fan of Tahitian vanilla as it has a different flavor profile than the more common Madagascar vanilla.  Their coffee is from a toaster in Oregon.  The coffee profile is more on the acidic side.  

The nice woman that took or order and made or drinks was super helpful and was patient with us as we asked all of these random questions about the coffee and the type of vanilla they use."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2020-01-20,5.0,"5 rating for their Chocolate Chip cookie alone!!! If I'm around midtown I'll definitely stop in to pick up 2-3 cookies. Even if you save some of the cookie (if you haven't devoured it) and eat it the next day the cookie still chews soft. The perfect dough to chocolate chip ratio. Love the texture and taste of the cookie, just enough crunch and chewy soft sweetness! I almost don't want to leave this review because I don't want them to sell out of those cookies. The cafe is small so I don't recommend coming here with a big group. Nice for a short catch up with a friend. There are always customer at the shop. Never have I had to wait in line for longer than 10mins. Please don't ever change your chocolate chip cookies! I dare to say it's better than Levain's chocolate chip cookie."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-10-08,4.0,"When I'm in the Bryant Park area after some activity and want to take a break, Culture Espresso comes to my mind often. The coffee shop is small with no bathroom unfortunately, but it's charming and you can sit on one of the comfy chairs on the side if you get lucky. I haven't witnessed any rude customers hogging the space for hours on end and that's a plus too. 

As many reviewers are raving, the chocolate chip cookie here is pretty awesome and goes great with the coffee. I see that couple other branches opened up nearby so I would love to visit them sometime too."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-07-24,5.0,"High quality coffee/espresso drinks  with some of the worlds most amazing fresh warm chocolate chip cookies.  

My go to drinks are either an iced latte or a hot latte prepared with  Oatly oat milk.  Oatly is THE best! 

The baristas are genuinely friendly. Like they never have an attitude when I ask for my latte with half oat milk, half 2% milk.  It's obvious they have a passion for what they do. 

May I suggest you order one cookie for while you enjoy your drink and get at the minimum 2 more for later.  They heat up nicely in your microwave at home. You will regret it later if you don't. 

Not a lot of sitting space but there is some if you are lucky. I was able to sit with my laptop and do some work before I had to leave for my train."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-09-17,4.0,They have good coffee and great baristas. I tried their Iced Latte and it was enough to satisfy my caffeine cravings. There weren't any special notes on the coffee that would make me want come back. But it was good!
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-02-10,4.0,"Coffee was okay but the cup was cute. Honestly I came for the adorable to go cups. There was only one design and it came in a small size.

This place has great vibes and isn't big but has some seating. The barista was friendly and didn't charge me extra for almond milk. The coffee wasn't cheap at $3 for a small cup and was a little bitter for my taste. This place is centrally located though and I like the ambiance enough to come back again in the future."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-12-10,5.0,"This is a cute little coffee shop off the craziness of 8th avenue! It is a little off the beaten path so the times that I have come here, I have rarely had to wait long. The espresso is divine and I love the lattes and cappuccinos here. There is barely any seating, so it is more of a grab and go situation unless you luck out and grab one of the few tables. The cookies always smell amazing and after reading some of the reviews here, it seems like I will have to be trying the chocolate chip cookie next time!"
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-07-28,4.0,"I've been here twice and usually managed to snag some seats - there's a big long table in the middle.

I ordered a cold brew and they have oat/almond/skim/cream on the side counter at no extra cost!! The counter also smells like luscious butter because of the cookies and croissants which I shall try next time!

I would definitely visit again for a quick coffee fix or even a chat - it's not crazy noisy!"
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-11-16,3.0,"This was my first time here. It was nice. The vibes were somewhat okay. Would I go back? Yea I would, it's different. 

I do like their logo on their coffee to go cup."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-09-09,5.0,"My friend said ""Culture has the best cookies!"" so I had to come here to take a peek-a-roo! And indeed, it's a really good cookie. It's maybe 4.5 inches in diameter and very sweet -- so in that regard, maybe not a good fit for my Asian friends who don't like overly-sweet American desserts -- but it goes perfectly with a nonsweetened british milk tea or coffee. But in regards to a chocolate chip cookie, it hits all the right spots - warm/toasted, a bit crispy on the outside and gooey chocolatey center. The taste slightly reminds me of what I'd make with my toll house or whatever, except higher quality ingredients and baking done right. Most importantly, it has that baking soda and nutty taste to it which puts it on a higher bar. It IS pricey at $3.50 a pop, so I'd really give them 4.5 stars. Note, the cafe is absolutely tiny! There are only three small 1-2 person tables and maybe some bar seating along the window, so I wouldn't necessarily count on bringing my laptop here to get work done."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-01-31,5.0,"Really nice small coffee shop. Aesthetically pleasing and clean interior. Found this place by accident while waiting for a friend to get off work. Ordered the Color Brew with house made vanilla and soy milk. Coffee tastes great and they use organic soy milk (they also have almond for my soy-free friends) 

Barista was very nice and let me try one of their lovely chocolate chip cookies on the house. They've made a return customer out of me!"
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-01-07,5.0,Highly recommend their Chocolate Chip Cookie as it has bits of melted chocolate in a nutty malt-like cookie with crispy edges and a soft gooey middle. It pairs harmoniously with their various coffee offerings!
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-09-06,4.0,Saw a sign that said voted best cookies in NYC so decided to go in and give it a try and believe me I was so happy I did! Cookies are amazing! I got chocolate chip. They're $3.50 per cookie which is pricey but standard for NYC.
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-12-23,5.0,"I'm rating the cookies here but if I could give 6 stars I would. These are probably some of the best I've ever had and I'm harsh about chocolate chip cookies! They are crispy and buttery and just out of this world good. 

The staff is pleasant and it's a small, cozy spot that you should support. Check them out!"
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-06-07,5.0,"Very good cortado, probably one of the best in NY. Also one of the better chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. I went in one time and also tried their banana nut muffin, or it may have been a pumpkin flavor - regardless, it was awesome. Cool vibe going on in all three locations and the line always moves fast. Enjoy!"
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-12-10,5.0,"Nice little coffee shop. Good, quick latte and a nice little selection of pastry. A few seats, but probably more of a grab and go spot. Would recommend."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-05-29,5.0,"Stopped by Culture on a friend's recommendation just after arriving in NYC, and it did not disappoint. They serve one of the best cookies I've ever tasted, and everything is reasonably priced (especially by Manhattan standards). Definitely recommend for a pick-me-up!"
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-08-12,3.0,"Tried their chocolate chip cookie after reading about it on a list of best cookie places in the city.  It was $3.00.  While the portion size is generous, to my taste buds it reminded me of a bigger Mrs Fields cookie.  I still think Schmackarys, Fat Cat Kitchen and Levain are much better options."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-10-26,4.0,"Good place for breakfast. They have all the beverage selection you will find in a coffee store, they serve oat milk too!"
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-05-13,5.0,"Culture has what I think are the best chocolate chip cookies in Manhattan, and its coffee is pretty rad too. I'm no coffee connoisseur, but I find Culture's iced coffee to be the perfect afternoon pick-me-up.

There isn't a lot of seating, so you probably shouldn't plan on being able to hang out at the cafe for long, but it's a great place to stop in and grab a sweet treat and drink."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-03-09,5.0,"They knew what we wanted when we arrived. We came for the chocolate chip cookies, and I guess it was obvious. ""How many?"" asked the tattooed barista as soon as we approached the baked goods display case. We started with one, and it was everything we'd hoped for. Big, thick, slightly crispy on the outside, and a delicious gooey chocolate mess inside. I love when cookies maintain that doughy mushiness, and these cookies do that perfectly. I will be back but know I have to be careful with this new found experience."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-05-16,4.0,"Solid oat latte here which came up to $5.50 (standard NYC latte price- perhaps $0.50 to $1 cheaper than some places even). They have oat milk, almond milk and soy milk for non dairy options. They have your regular espresso menu such as lattes, cappuccinos, etc. There are a few pastries including homemade chocolate chip cookies and on weekdays only they have VEGAN chocolate chip cookies!

Pretty small cafe with only a few seats. Probably best to take your coffee to go. Friendly barista!

Culture is one of those coffee shops I trust to serve up really great espresso- smooth and strong. If you haven't had oat milk, it will change your life as it has changed mine"
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2020-02-08,5.0,best cookies in nyc. forget levain. this is it. good coffee and good work ambiance too!
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-12-28,5.0,Great latte and chocolate chip cookies. Interior is clean and simple.  No bathroom on premises.
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2017-03-21,5.0,"Nice staffs, good price for a location at midtown west where everything is more expensive, good atmosphere (it's quiet but not dead silence, there's rock music playing in the background), the place is clean, and looks fairly new but I've seen it here months ago. I'm surprised and happy to be the first one to write a review. 

I don't drink coffee, maybe once in 5 years, but today I came here for a cup of coffee and I actually like it. (I was falling asleep at work that's why). A cup of coffee is $2.50; you add sugar and milk yourself. I would prefer coming here for coffee over Starbucks because everything looks cleaner, and the place is less crowded and more quiet compared to mainstream coffee shops like Starbucks or Gregory's coffee. You can definitely pull out your laptop and do your work here. It was quick, there was no wait. It's a nice coffee shop. Good if you just want coffee or some time to yourself. I wouldn't recommend it for hangouts or chats because there are not a lot of seatings next to each other. Like in the picture I posted, one table have one seat. You might not always get a seat next to your friend."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-09-28,1.0,"I love coffee so much and after doing an artisan coffee tour of Manhattan, other reviews to follow, this was the worse service and coffee known to man. The barista never made eye contact or give any emotion in acknowledging a human in front of her. Therefore the coffee was not made with any love. (I should have gone to Starbucks at least their high volume autopilot has consistency) It was like she was shell shocked from hearing a family member had died. I ordered an Americano with room for half and half. I watched her fill my mug with hot water, dump the espresso in and plonk the coffee cup in front of me. 

There hadn't been anyone enter the store for 5 minutes. The smaller of the 2 baristas tried to serve me twice, with no recognition. Maybe it was a bad day. 

The coffee was bitter / burnt and sooooo watery the best thing was the half and half.  I questioned whether this coffee venue should be called in-cultured coffee. Note I'd never go back even if they offered me a lifetime supply of coffee."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-09-11,3.0,"Came here on the premise of delicious cookies. Unfortunately by 3:00 PM, they had only 2 cookies left vegan chocolate chip and oatmeal cranberry cookie. The oatmeal cranberry cookie is pretty good. Vegan chocolate chip seems like a good treat for someone who is vegan (?) Honestly, I have low expectations of vegan cookies, and this is the first one I've ever tried. It wasn't bad, but not comparable to a good ol' ""regular"" chocolate chip cookie. Both of which were sort of small for $3 a pop. I personally had a dirty chai latte - meh. Temperature's a tad bit more than lukewarm, drink tastes flat instead of frothy and thick. 

Service was quick, indifferent. They are unable to warm up the cookies which hurts my heart a bit. They also do not print receipts. The space is really small. The station where you put your milk and sugar, grab straws and lids, is tiny and next to bar seating, which was occupied when I was there, making their conversation fully audible and my anxiousness to get out of their space increase. Additionally, all our drinks were picked up right at the register, so my coworker and I were trying to assemble our drinks while someone else was behind us, ordering over us. Awkward. Before heading out, I also had to wait for someone to finish making their coffee at the little station before we could grab two straws. Overall wouldn't recommend it as a place for a big order."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2017-11-10,4.0,"Beyond impressed with the 36th street Culture location, I was out to try another one. I can always trust Culture to make me a pretty smooth latte with almond milk. Foamy and slightly bitter, made with warmth and love. There are three small tables here, which could fit about 6-8 people in total. It's smaller than the other spot, but there's space to stand. They just won for the best chocolate chip cookie in New York, so give that a shot if you wanna treat yo'self."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-09-13,2.0,"I was looking for a place with decent coffee. This is not the place for warm smiles and good vibes because they were pretty cold overall. The shop itself is very comforting and nice but the vibe I get from the people at the bar is pretty standard, cold New York. 

I ordered a cortado, and it was good for the area, and above average in overall for new york, but definitely won't beat leading coffee shops. The unfriendliness of this shop takes my 3 rating to a 2."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-11-24,5.0,Love it. We will be going back. My little girls and I stumbled upon this place while we were waiting on the parade. The coffee was really good and the hot chocolates were amazing. They were the perfect temp. Not too hot so my kids could drink it right away. They split a huge donut and it was amazing also! The staff was so nice! We sat and people watched as we had our goodies.
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-09-13,5.0,"Great coffee. Ordered a latte and it was definitely on point and not trying to be overcomplicated.

Berry and peach muffin was a good match and the service was polite and prompt."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-04-29,5.0,The best cookie in nyc for sure (for true choc chip cookie aficionados) and best coffee I've had here. Get the flat white
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-03-25,5.0,"My only problem with Culture Espresso is it is too good and I spend way to much money there. There coffee is SOOOOOO good!

My favorite coffee shop in all of New York City.

The staff are awesome and friendly. Generally not super crowded so you can be in and out if you want to get coffee on the go or find a seat if you want to stay.

Note to computer users there is WiFi but no bathroom."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2017-04-24,4.0,"I'm a fan- my coworker recommended this place as the best cup of coffee he's ever gotten. I went meaning to get coffee but accidentally ordered a Chai... because I love Chai. It was a great Chai, on par with Corvo coffee around the corner (intensely sweet). The barista was kind, quick, and inviting. I hope to be back and actually order coffee next time. One thing that I really love is the design of the place- it's small but can fit a pleasant amount of people."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-09-17,2.0,"I had a half caffeinated brew coffee and half defcaffeinated Amdricano, because they don't have plain brewed decaf for some reason. They charged me $3, as though it were a full Americano, ,50 more than brewed. The coffee was ok but not worth $3. So even though I'm on that street regularly, I'll make Culture history."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-07-23,5.0,"A great latte. Tucked away on a side street. Good temperature and well a well made espresso,  if you are used to Australian coffee."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2017-04-26,5.0,"This is one of the locations for Culture Espresso. It's a small place and only seats around 6-10 people. I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and it was super quiet and the perfect place to do my work. The staff are very nice and attentive.
You MUST get their chocolate cookie. It is the perfect amount of crunch on the outside and is soft and chewy on the inside with huge chocolate pieces. Seriously, this stuff is amazing. I also got a macchiato which was slightly bitter as expected to go with the sweetness of the cookie."
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2019-01-21,3.0,Good vibe. Definitely need work on dial in espresso. My cortado is soul like vinegar.
690,culture-espresso-new-york-3,2018-06-20,2.0,Shut down by the health department. Was the best coffee shop...but yikes. Still giving it two stars because the cookies were so good.
691,softbite-new-york,2020-04-27,5.0,"As we are all holed up at home waiting for the Coronavirus situation to get better, I can't help but reminisce about the time I came to Softbite for some decadent soufflé pancakes. I had gotten the creme brûlée soufflé pancakes with taro/vanilla ice cream swirl. My friend ordered the ube soufflé pancakes with taro/vanilla ice cream swirl. Both tasted really delicious but I especially liked the crunchy caramelized sugar texture mixed with soft pancakes. I just wish I had gotten the ice cream cookie topping instead of the popcorn toppings. Next time, I'd be sure to ask for it! 

The only downside was that it took awhile to make even though there were no other customers. But I have to say the wait was totally worth it. The interior is also very spacious and clean."
691,softbite-new-york,2020-03-13,3.0,"Pretty average?

Yes, it does take a really long time, but it's one of those things that are made to order (so you can see the cooking process), but I don't mind waiting if it wowed me. The ice cream of the day (genmaicha) wowed me a lot more than the souffle pancake itself. 

I've come to realize souffle pancakes are just glorified paper-wrapped sponge cakes from Chinese bakeries (think Kam Hing's cakes) at nearly quadruple the prices. I can only speak from my batch: the inside was pretty soft, fluffy, airy (yep, like the inside of a sponge cake) but the ""skin"" of the pancake was definitely really dry. Understandable since that's the part that touches the ""grill"" but the contrast of soft and and hard layer was tough to chew (literally). Matcha drizzle is okay. Overall, just didn't think too highly of the souffle pancake itself

Each order comes with ice cream on the side, which goes well with hot pancakes, but I wish they had the option to NOT include the ice cream. Despite the fact that their flavor of the day was realllly good. Consistency is like Bar Patea's in that it's more icy than melty creamy. But very strong tea flavor!"
691,softbite-new-york,2020-03-09,4.0,"Softbite has great Japanese style souffle. They have 9 flavors you can choose from and they all come with ice cream for $13.50 each. The ice cream comes in two flavors, which are vanilla, chocolate, and mixed. The pancakes are made from scratch each order and is about a 25 minute wait. We got ours in 24 minutes. 

We ordered Chocolatella and Ube Sparkles. They put sprinkles on ours and both souffles were beautiful. The taste was also good. The were sweet and fluffy, like eating a cloud. 

The seating is very limited. There were only 4 seats total available. There was a couple who stood by the counter where they make the food. We felt bad for them and they took our seat once we left. 

If you want cute, special and artistic pancakes, this is worth checking out."
691,softbite-new-york,2020-01-20,4.0,"Been craving the soufflé pancakes even since seeing it on social media. There aren't a lot of places I know serving souffle pancake so I was excited to find this place! I called 30 mins in advance to placed my order because it does take time to make the pancakes as they are served fresh! 

I got the chocolate souffle and the matcha souffle, both served with vanilla ice cream! The taste was very fresh and fluffy. The flavor tasted like egg foam. The chocolate and the matcha toppings definitely made the flavor sweet but the vanilla ice cream help balance the sweetness so the flavor combo is perfect.

The price of the two pancakes comes to almost $30 which I think it's pretty pricey and the portion size isn't that big! For me, it's a good snack and it's worth trying!"
691,softbite-new-york,2020-01-28,3.0,"Like many other yelpers I have the same qualms- long wait, not enough seats, sky high prices, but delicious pancakes! There was barely any customers there but we also waited 25 minutes. We stood while we waited and ate standing until someone left. I'm not sure if I can say that it was worth the wait or if I'll be going again, but I'm glad I went! The boba pancake was so good!
PS- do not drink the water, it's gross."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-10-22,3.0,"Everyone said I had to try this new place. So I walked 20 blocks over in a strange October heatwave to arrive at Softbite... non-air conditioned Softbite. Did I mention it was sweltering outside? 

Please bear with me. This review is full of ups and downs with my experience at Softbite and I feel that experiences are part of the entire restaurant review.

I wanted the Ube Pancake but was scared off by a review that it was ""fake"", so I went to my go-to, Matcha! While I was waiting, a couple said they were waiting 15min and inquired about their order. The owner apologized and explained that the pancake was not fluffy enough and not up to her standards and she was remaking one for them. I commend her for sticking to her standards, but I feel 30min (15min each) for a pancake is too long for a quick bite place like this, and plus, she never updated them on what was going on. 

While waiting, I asked her about the Ube being fake and she did not confim nor deny, but she was kind enough to let me try some as she was prepping an ube pancake at the moment. I thought it was delicious, delicious enough that my next order would be Ube. 

Shoot! I forgot to use my 20% off Yelp Coupon (10/2/19). I showed it to the owner and asked if I could use it and she said sorry, its too late once the order is in. Fair enough. 

My Matcha pancake with Green Tea with Roasted Brown Rice soft serve was DELICIOUS. The souffle pancake was perfectly fluffy and extremely palatable. The matcha poured over the top was just sweet and bitter enough, as it should be. The soft serve was so good paired with the souffle pancake. I would say its worth $15 for the experience for sure. 

That little tastes of Ube left me wanting more and I still had that Yelp coupon, why not get an Ube Latte? I ordered and showed my coupon, they said it was no longer valid, it was removed 2 weeks ago. I showed them my phone again from my check-in (yes I have a date stamped screenshot). They said it was not valid. Okay - this is annoying. If it's not valid, fine. Why not say that earlier when I showed it to you? Ok, the pancake WAS delicious, I'll let it go. 

Ube latter arrived. This is no latte. The best I can explain is a thickened sickly sweet version of taro bubble tea, minus the bubbles. It tastes like 5 cups of a medium taro bubble tea, evaporated into 1 cup - same amount of flavor and sugar, 4 cups less water. I hated it, and being honest, the negatives above had no weight in my disliking this beverage. I ended up giving this to my sister, who also thought the same thing and she never went to SoftBite before. 

So there you have it. Pancakes great. Takes a long time. No AC during heatwaves. Kind owner. The Customer is NOT always right. Avoid the Ube Latte, Ube pancake should be good."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-11-11,3.0,"I was excited to try this place out after seeing it combine two of my loves: fluffy soufflé Japanese pancakes and ice cream! I ordered the Ube pancake special, and the options for ice cream on the side were chocolate, vanilla, or mixed. I went with vanilla, but I was hoping there would be more flavor options. 

I was told it would be a 30 minute wait, and that was pretty accurate. Luckily I had company to keep me entertained, as well as people watching the eclectic variety of passersby coming in and out (the store happens to be located on the first floor of nomadworks, a coworking space). You can also watch them making the pancakes fresh for you. 

The pancakes were topped with a purple ube sauce which didn't have a strong ube flavor. The pancakes were light and fluffy as advertised with a good wobble, and the eggy flavor you expect from this type of pancake. However it didn't quite compare to the soufflé pancakes I've had in Japan. I wanted more sauce because it provides the sweetness normally provided by syrup but the ratio of sauce to pancake was not great. The ice cream was nothing special and was topped by a mini chocolate filled cone. I definitely appreciate the presentation and time that goes into creating these pancakes, but it was more of a onetime experience that I probably wouldn't repeat."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-10-12,5.0,"The staff members here are super friendly. They make it fresh so you will be waiting for about 20-30 mins for your soufflé, don't worry it's worth your wait. As you wait, you can try their drink. I had their aurora ( butterfly pea, lemonade, crystal boba and grape grape). If you like lemonade, this drink won't disappoint you. 

As you taste your first bite of your pancake you can feel the texture, it's so fluffy and airy, literally melts in your mouth. You get to pick what flavor soft serve you want with your pancake. 


I will be back to try the something else from there menu."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-10-11,5.0,"What we ordered:
1. Boba Lava Souffle Pancake with UBE ice cream
2. Tiramisu with Vanilla Ice Cream
Ube ice cream is better than vanilla. Each souffle pancake is $13.5. I want to try the cream brulee souffle pancake!"
691,softbite-new-york,2019-09-27,3.0,"I gave this place two chances today. The first time was during my lunch break. I was curious to try the airy, fluffy soufflé pancake. The cashier gave me a heads up that the pancake would take about 15-20 minutes to make. I didn't have enough time to wait for it, so I ordered an iced matcha latte with oat milk instead. I like how they use Oatly milk, but the matcha was so rough. It was not blended well at all. It took me such a long time to finish it. I've tried A LOT of matcha lattes around the city and this is probably my least favorite. 

Fast forward a couple of hours later, I decided to go back and order the soufflé pancake since I had more time to wait. I ordered the Ube Sparkles with coffee ice cream and maple syrup. They give you 20% off your purchase since it's still their soft opening week. The cashier told me it was gonna take 20 minutes. Okay no problem. Well, That ""20 minutes"" turned out to be 40 minutes. The cashier did apologize for the long wait. 

The Ube Sparkles pancake was no bueno for me. First of all, it tasted NOTHING like Ube. And I KNOW what Ube tastes like. It shouldn't even be called Ube! It was so bland. The only flavor this thing had was the coffee ice cream. Even that tall skinny cone on the ice cream didn't taste like anything. If anyone knows me, they know that two of my favorite flavors are Ube and matcha. Both the iced latte and pancake were a huge disappointment. 

Sorry, but it's not worth the $13.50 and 40 minute wait. I'm giving this place 3 stars because the cashier was nice and it was their soft opening. Probably should've given it 2 stars for the lack of taste and long wait. Maybe their other pancakes taste better than this one. If you're gonna try this place out, make sure you're not in a rush to go anywhere else after because you'll be there for a while."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-10-09,2.0,"For a month or so after the place opened, this place was open earlier, around 8:00 or so, but it appears they changed to 9:00. I'm not exactly someone who would want to order a 12-14 dollar pretty dessert (their signature fluffy pancakes) so I stopped here twice for drinks as I am usually around this area prior to work. 

The ube latte the first day was fine. There was some good flavors but I found there to be way too much milk and it got progressively weaker over time due to the amount of ice. Overall, not really worth it without the discount and it paled in comparison to the similarly priced nearby Grace Street. I liked their cup.

The sparking mango matcha was a unique take on the matcha soda/sparking matcha found at some other local places though there were problems. While I liked the mango puree at the bottom, it was added first and even with vigorous shaking, it wouldn't mix. I think it would have worked way better if it was added afterwards but at least it looks prettier. The matcha had similar issues to a place a block away (Cha Cha) where it wasn't stirred enough so there was some unpleasant bitterness/chalkiness. I simply prefer this drink without the mango (as it didn't do much) at Blank Slate Tea.

They had a 20% off for the first month which was nice but these drinks would be way overpriced otherwise. This place is fine but not worth it for the prices. 2.3."
691,softbite-new-york,2020-01-24,3.0,"UGH. Such mixed feelings about this place at the moment.

Came here with a friend after dinner and was decently full, but all good because it took them 25/30 minutes to make our order so gave us enough time to get our stomachs hungry. 

They do tell you when they're making the souffle pancakes that it'll take ~20 minutes, but we definitely waited closer to 30 minutes. We ordered the Boba Lava souffle pancake and the Yogurt Berries souffle pancake. All of the souffle pancakes here are great options/flavors. Previously I've had the creme brulee, matcha, ube, and boba one. 

Ok, so here are my issues:
1. I've had SoftBite SOOO many times at Japan Fes... each time the portions are great. This time.. they were the TINIEST souffle pancakes ever. Each order is around $15 with 2 small pancakes and soft serve... They definitely can make them bigger.
2. We were asked if we wanted milk tea or vanilla or mixed soft serve. We both asked for mixed and got vanilla. I didn't want to cause a scene since I was with a friend, but if the store realizes they can't do mixed or the milk tea portion isn't working.. they should inform the customer.
3. This place is attached to Nomad Works and nobody can seem to figure out how to open the door to leave.. they should just put up some signs.. 

Softbite tastes good and is aesthetically very cute! But was so incredibly disappointed by the size/price and the lack of service. 

2.5 rounded up and only because I've had it so many times before and was never disappointed until last night."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-09-24,5.0,"Their soufflés pancake was super soft and fluffy!
And taste really good!
I got boba lava flavor. The boba texture was good, sweet and chewy with brown sugar flavor.
The earl grey cream was very creamy, I like to eat with vanilla icecream more. 
It was made by order, so even the store is not crowed at all, it still took about 20-25 mins to get my pancake. 
So prepared longer wait time if it is rush hour!"
691,softbite-new-york,2020-02-23,3.0,"I should start with I really do love these soufflé pancakes they are super fun and yummy and always instagram-able but the downside to this place is the location and interior. This place has hardly any place to sit and sometimes you have to wait up to 20 minutes for your order. It takes too long for a take away place. Additionally, this place isn't near a park or anything so you can't even go somewhere outside and sit to enjoy. I hope they find a better location and make this place more like a cafe!"
691,softbite-new-york,2020-01-09,4.0,"This place was great, only reason I'm giving a 4 star review is because they didn't have one of the flavors and it was mid day so I don't understand how they couldn't have toppings for it as it wasn't busy and a weekday felt unprepared. But anyway the actually souflee pancake was delicious. I always wanted to try this Japanese dessert and I'm glad I did because I want to go back and try other things. I'm a huge matcha fan so I was excited to try that flavor which I had the pleasure of doing. Super soft, jiggly and tasty just like I expected!"
691,softbite-new-york,2019-11-07,5.0,"This is a cute little open spot for dessert! They are known for the fluffy soufflé pancakes but they also have other things too plus coffees and lattes.

There isn't a lot of seating, just a few benches outside and a bar on the side with some seats where the utensils are. 

My friends and I got the matcha soufflé pancakes and it took 4
30-40 minutes for it to come out because the it's made on the spot and each pancake takes so long to cook. 
We got ours and it was good! Our first time trying a soufflé pancake and it was very fluffy and light! The matcha one is just a regular soufflé pancake with matcha cream on top. It also comes with a side of matcha ice cream which went perfectly with the soufflé pancake.

NOTE: Don't let the word pancake fool you though! It's not a pancake texture! It's very airy fluffy and kind of eggy (not like a bread). We loved it not knowing what a soufflé pancake was going to be like! 

All in all, I wouldn't go back a lot only because it takes so long to make but I definitely think it's getting once in awhile here and there! It's yummy!"
691,softbite-new-york,2020-02-16,4.0,"I really wanted to try this place and I am glad I finally did.  This place has a lot of bad reviews and I can see why.  It's expensive for what it is and takes a long time to make.  If you can get over that, the souffle pancakes here are pretty good.  I got the ube one and it did take a long time, but once I got it, it was delicious.  I was surprised because based on the reviews, I was expecting it to be bad.  

For a place like this, you can't really premake or prepare the pancakes ahead of time. You need to do it fresh.  I'm not sure how this place is going to survive since it's a bit off the beaten path and unless you come here specifically, you won't really know this places exists unless you're here for the gram.  

The one gripe I did have though is the service.  The girl behind the register and making my pancake could smile a bit more and be a little more friendlier.  I got the impression that she didn't want to make a pancake for me or even serve me.  I felt like I was being indirectly hinted to leave.  I'm glad I didn't because the pancake was pretty good.  

If it wasn't so expensive, I'd probably come back."
691,softbite-new-york,2020-01-06,5.0,"Softbite

OVERALL: 8.5/10

The souffle pancakes are pretty good. They are jiggly. Only negative about this place is there isn't much seating. It's like a grab and go type of place. 

Wait wasn't long when I went, and I went during the nighttime so I think the hype is easing up a bit. 

Expect to pay around $15 per pancake."
691,softbite-new-york,2020-02-24,4.0,"I was in the area and in the mood for some dessert and found this place! Recently, Japanese jiggly pancakes have been the hype and even better with boba! I went into the store and it was more of a pop up vibe since it was located in the lobby(?) Of a co working building I think. It was small but there was a bench and three to four seats off to the side. 

I decided to order the boba lava soufflé pancake and a sparkling lychee drink. The drink was alright, a good refresher! With your soufflé pancake, it comes with soft serve ice cream and they have assorted flavors everyday which they post next to the register. 

The soufflé pancakes did take a while because they had to make a new batch of boba and they kindly informed us it's would take around 30 minutes. We were okay with it and didn't mind since we weren't in a rush. We received our dessert and it looked really good and was indeed extreme fluffy. The bubbles were nice and sweet as well. Overall, it was a good experience, but not good for a large group. However, I do feel the price was a bit steep for the dessert at almost $15 after tax. It's a cool and cute place to try out though!"
691,softbite-new-york,2020-03-07,4.0,"3.5 stars to be exact. Came here specifically looking to try those jiggly Japanese Souffle pancakes and found this little place tucked around the corner building. Ordered their Chocolatella Souffle pancake with Vanilla soft serve ice cream ($13.5). Wait was about twenty minutes for my pancake, so in the meantime I sat on the stool chair enjoying my Lychee Sparkling drink. While waiting I noticed a few fruit flies swarming around the condiment table. Counter person saw the flies, but made no mention to do anything about it. Finally my two pancakes are done, along with ice cream on top and pocky stick for an Instagramable picture. It doesn't take long for the pancakes to topple over the small paper plate (so hurry up and take the pic), a bit messy. I really enjoyed the texture of the pancakes as it's lite and fluffy and super eggy. Ice cream was an added touch of sweetness to the warm pancakes. At close to $14bucks for a small plate, could give one more pancake. As I was about to finish my last few bites a fruit fly landed in my plate, lost my appetite. Still glad I tried this place though."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-12-21,3.0,"I had a chance to try Softbite during one of the JapanFest events. Went for the matcha one. The pancake was nice and fluffy and the matcha flavor was there in the sauce. It's good for what it is, which is ultimately a pancake... with your choice of sauce. I think the hype is because it has a souffle texture, which is cool, but there isn't anything else really special about it otherwise."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-10-08,5.0,"I have been wanting to try the soufflé pancakes from Softbite at Japan Fes but the lines are like 2 hours long so I had to give up. Finally walked past their store one day and there wasn't a line - I knew this is the day to finally try it!!

They offer so many flavors and they all looked so good, but I finally chose the Tiramisu Soufflé Pancake. Since all pancakes are made to order, I really enjoyed seeing them prepare my pancakes!! Only downside is that it takes a while (soufflé pancakes takes longer to cook), so I still ended up waiting for 30 minutes. But it was all worth it! The pancakes are soft as a cloud, and I really enjoyed the flavors and the presentation! 

One thing about the store is that it's just a little corner in an office building. They tried their very best to create a few seats for customers, but when it's crowded you might not be able to find a seat, and souffle pancake isn't really sth that you can eat standing up.

But in general, I would really want to come bacj and try other flavors!! The Crème Brûlée one is on my list next!"
691,softbite-new-york,2020-01-17,2.0,"I was incredibly excited to come here to try their boba lava soufflé pancakes after seeing them on yelp but unfortunately the pancakes left much to be desired. They were fluffy but the pancakes themselves tasted too much like egg whites. I've had soufflé pancakes in Tokyo in the past and they definitely should not taste like that. At one point, it felt as though we were simply eating fluffy egg whites. 

It is a shame that the pancakes themselves were bad because the boba topping was deliciously chewy, the milk tea taste of the glaze was spot on, and the earl grey soft serve was light and had the perfect earl grey tea flavor. The pancakes were definitely NOT worth the $14-$15 (about $16 after tax) price tag since the star of the show was so lacking. The order itself is also tiny and took 20 minutes to prepare (they make them fresh). Trust me and go elsewhere if soufflé pancakes is what you're after. However they do serve drinks and just soft serve, so those may be more promising choices from Softbite.


Note: There's barely any seating (4-5 seats) so is definitely more of a grab-n-go place."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-09-29,5.0,"Eating literal clouds! 

I first tried Softbite's soufflé pancakes at the Japanese event--Japanfes in the summer. Since then, I've been eagerly waiting for a permanent location in NYC, and here it is....

I ordered the Creme Brûlée soufflé pancake w/ vanilla ice cream. The owner asked us if it was ok if we waited a few extra minutes because our pancake (the last pancake from the previous batch) wasn't fluffy enough. Of course, we gladly waited for a fresh fluffy one. I appreciate an owner who cares about quality and service. It took 20 mins (including the few extra minutes for a fresh pancake). It takes longer than your typical dessert like ice cream and cakes, but you have to keep in mind that they make each order fresh to create a happy experience in your mouth. 

The pancake itself was super fluffy and soft, that each bite melted in my mouth. The warmth of the pancake was perfect with the cold ice cream. A dream combo!

I plan on coming back and trying their many other flavors, especially the boba lava that was sold out when I went."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-12-27,3.0,Came here for dessert after eating for Let's Meat for dinner which is 4 minutes away. We got the ube sparkles which mixed ice cream. The souffle which was okay since it is fresh and not sweet but I don't really enjoyed the ube topping which made it too sweet.
691,softbite-new-york,2019-12-15,3.0,"I've always wanted to try soufflé pancakes.
Atmosphere: Trendy music, brightly lit, and friendly staff. Small space, but there's a bench and small counter space you can sit at. 

Wait Time: About 45 minutes, which was extremely long. Being understanding of the prep time for batter making and two other customers before me, it just seemed like a very long time to wait for two pancakes. 

Quality: A freshly made batter if you're willing to wait for the prep and cooking time. The pancakes were light and cloud like/meringue-y. Kinda bland. Just an egg white flavor. Nothing to hype about besides the fluffy texture.  The berry sauce was sweet, in a delightful way that balances the plain pancake. The blueberries were fresh and just ripe enough to pair well. The soft serve, matcha vanilla twist, was very flavorful. Although the texture was more froyo like than soft serve. The sprinkles added a nice crunch and the pocky was just extra fun. Social media post worthy- yes."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-11-24,4.0,"This place is in the lobby of an office building. The place is very tiny. There is one 3 people bench and 3 counter seats. Once in a while office workers walk past you. I went on a Friday morning. There was no rush. In order to beat the crowd, I reached there at exactly 11 am, which was their opening time. But they said the bobba will not be ready at least for the next 1 hour. I was surprised on why they will not make bobba before opening the store. I went for the boba lava pancake. Pancake had a very strong egg flavor. But it was super soft. Just with a spoon I could eat it. The coffee ice cream was the best. I went for the coffee and vanilla ice cream combination. I should have gone for just the coffee ice cream. Boba was also good. It take atleast 20 minutes to cook the pancake. He will start cooking only after you order. There is only 1 stove, which can handle probably 4 pancakes at a time. So if you see a small crowd, you are going to wait for ever.

For drinks, I went for aurora. It was a refreshing drink. It had 2 types of bubbles. One which burst with flavor and the other which is similar (not the same) to a regular bubble. Grape fruit flavor was nice."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-10-16,5.0,"Love this place!

So glad they finally opened a brick and mortar shop. I first had them when they were doing pop ups and really loved all the unique flavor combinations they were doing. And very inventive - they always have new flavors to try and taste!

They also serve soft serve now and they do also change the flavors which I also like because there is always something new to try on the menu.

I had the chocolate and Thai tea soufflé pancakes, the soft serve which had a coffee flavor which was super good and the aurora drink which was very pretty."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-11-17,5.0,"Yelp recommended this place, and I just had to try it out from all the enticing photos.  This place did not fail to deliver.  The boba lava dessert was insanely delish!  OMG! I am still dreaming about it to this day, but I have to control myself.  As sweet and yummy as everything is, this is not something to have on a daily basis (even though I want it every day).  

The pancakes were so soft, moist, yummy, and the bubbles with brown sugar, vanilla ice cream, and caramel popcorn just made everything even more uber fierce.  The bubble milk with brown sugar drink was only ok.  I will definitely be returning, so I can try out their other flavors.  So glad Yelp recommended this place, I would have never known about them without the recommendation.  I probably would have completely missed this place if I was walking around the neighborhood.  Check them out and support them!"
691,softbite-new-york,2020-03-05,3.0,I was very excited to go here after seeing pictures on Instagram and wanted to try the pink cloud pancakes however when u went the girl at the front told us that the person who makes it not there ? Even though it's still advertised outside and was not discontinued yet . I got the yogurt berry one and my bf got the bubble tea one. Now I really have no complaints with the food not with the wait it was amazing presentation but I think I have to let people know that I saw a rat right under the soft serve machine right when we were leaving and I was shocked as this place has an A grade . I think they should really check what's going on in their kitchen as I wouldn't return to place that had rats
691,softbite-new-york,2019-11-17,2.0,"The boyfriend wanted to come here to try their souffle pancakes after having dinner nearby. We searched high and low for this place but couldn't find it since the address wasn't correct. Finally found it tucked into one of the streets. This place is located in the lobby of a ""wework"" or ""nomad works"". 

The wait was long. There is very limited seating. The photos online are also very deceiving. 
We ordered the boba lava fluffy pancakes. Every pancake order comes with your choice of ice cream. From the photos online, I thought we could choose matcha or ube or any interesting flavor that's not just vanilla and chocolate. The day we went, they only had vanilla and chocolate... which is extremely basic. 

They quoted our wait to be half an hour and if I had known that, I would've just left but my boyfriend agreed and paid so ofc we had to stay for it. The wait time was pretty accurate and thankfully we scored a seat. The best part of the pancakes was the ice cream and I don't even like vanilla/chocolate ice cream....The pancakes itself were too raw and not cooked long enough. 

We also checked in for a free coffee which tasted bad. The cashier didn't put it in our order so we had to ask and one of the staff/owners was hesitant to give it to us even when we showed her the yelp check-in because we already ""marked the offer as used"" on yelp for the cashier so we couldn't do it again... 

Near the end, when more people started piling in, the wait went up to 45 minutes.
I'd have to pass on this place. I wouldn't come back, especially since there are way more souffle pancake spots all over the city."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-11-13,3.0,"Had tried to go a month or two back but they were closed for the day since they were at the Japan Festival on that day. Finally, when my friend was visiting, we decided to come here after dinner to try the souffle pancakes. Honestly, I almost walked back out the door when I saw the price of the pancakes. $13.50 for two small pancakes and a swirl of ice cream on the side. Also, the pictures are deceiving. I thought certain flavors came with different flavor ice cream, but it turns out they only had chocolate, vanilla, or mixed for that week.

We ended up getting the Matcha pancake with a mixed flavor ice cream. The texture of the pancakes were pretty good. If you don't like egg-y flavors though, this is probably not for you. Unfortunately, the price of these pancakes is way more than what I would like to spend so I probably won't go back again unless a friend wanted to try it out."

It's close to my work, oh I'm in trouble. 
We tried Tiramisu and Creme Brulee. 
Yum! It was nice and fluffy and yummy. 
The presentation is def on point n I love watching them prepare your pancake cup it's like making eatable art!

I'd highly recommend the Aurora drink. It's so pretty n romantic and there are two types of bubble in the drink. One burst in your mouth and the other texture is in between aloe and regular tapioca
What a pleasant surprise:)

I also saw them throw out pancakes that are not up to their ""fluffiness standard"". Thumbs up for sticking to their standard. 

Definitely coming back to try other flavors!"

The best part was the soufflé. We had the Boba lava, the soufflé itself had a slight lemon fragrance and tasted extremely soft. In addition, my bestie here declare she loved her the boba on it so much. The matcha here was not bad either."
691,softbite-new-york,2019-10-23,4.0,"My favorite was the matcha pancakes. Their soft serve ice cream was amazing! I got the mix ice cream. The tiramisu pancake was good too. I didn't really like bubble tea pancake. Also, they need to put more table and chairs. And it's takes a very long time to make the pancakes like 20-30 minutes. They need a way to make faster pancakes."

691,softbite-new-york,2020-01-15,4.0,"I give this props for being a unique and fun idea. The price point was pretty expensive for such small dessert but definitely worth a try if you split it with people. It's about $14.99 for a soufflé which comes out ~$16 with tax. I would definitely recommend getting a seat at the small counter before ordering though! Because we luckily got a seat and if we didn't then we would probably have to take it home or eat standing up. There's only a small bench outside and 4 bar stools at the counter. Also, it takes ~25 minutes to make the soufflé so you will have to wait around for a bit, more reason to get a seat before ordering if you can. It was super delicious and fluffy!"

692,st-kilda-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-26,5.0,"As soon as I saw this place pop up in my neighborhood, I knew it was gonna be a great coffee spot. You can just tell from the vibe and interior. One morning on my way to work I decided to walk a few extra subway stops and got a cappuccino on my way. There was no line when I walked in and I was greeted properly. 

I drink at least one cappuccino a day and consider myself a coffee snob at times. In my opinion there are a few signs if a coffee shop makes a great cappuccino or not. 
(1) They don't ask what size you want (it should always be a small and I don't mean a Starbucks ""tall"") 
(2) They don't ask if you want it iced or hot (caps should only be served hot) 
(3) They care enough to make nice latte art (which means they know how to foam the milk properly)
(4) They sprinkle some chocolate powder as the cherry on top (it's so French but I love it)
Alright, that was my rant about cappuccinos. Now back to St Kilda: They hit all four items on the list, so I'm very happy!

The place is small, but feels pretty airy. They seem to offer pastries but no food. You can also buy their merch in the shop. I'm not sure if they have Wi-fi but if they do, it is a great place to get stuff done.

Either way, I will definitely come back for more."

Will come back!"
692,st-kilda-coffee-new-york-3,2019-09-09,5.0,Amazing coffee place! I'm super picky about my coffee and the coffee here is def on point. They staff is super friendly as well. This is my new go to place for coffee.
692,st-kilda-coffee-new-york-3,2019-05-01,5.0,"Had the best espresso in years , possibly the best pulled shot I've had! Filter coffee is always extracted well, coffee at their shop is mostly light roast so it's very complex! I don't really come here for pastries as I know the coffee is the main focus . Come here and you will be spoilt for life!"
692,st-kilda-coffee-new-york-3,2019-05-01,5.0,I work in Chelsea and have been a fan of this Aussie gem for years back when i used to reside in Hell's Kitchen. And I'm very happy they opened in Chelsea as they're coffee is always top notch . They serve the freshest single origin beans and they're cold brew is super refreshing and fruity! Love the fact that they work with the finest baked goods out there in the city ! Love me some st Kilda highly recommended
692,st-kilda-coffee-new-york-3,2019-05-15,5.0,"Great coffee and exactly what Chelsea needed in a strip of way too many Starbucks. Several tables, great light, a cozy place to spend a morning"
692,st-kilda-coffee-new-york-3,2019-05-25,5.0,Really feeling this place ! I've tried their geisha Panama on espresso and it was pretty amazing . Th barista pulled a long shot and brought all the beautiful nuances of the coffee. I dig that they know what they're doing and take special focus on various brew methods in coffee. Check these guys out
692,st-kilda-coffee-new-york-3,2019-05-23,5.0,Great new spot for coffee in Chelsea. Good quality coffee and great atmosphere to get work done and relax for a bit. Recommend the flat white and the scones are nice as well. The staff was friendly and helpful. Will definitely be going back!
692,st-kilda-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-25,5.0,"Stumbled in here when Starbucks a couple blocks away let me down. Very cute and quiet little place, super friendly barista, good coffee, and they have electrical plugs to charge your phone when you stupidly let yours die! Thank god. :) highly recommended, but I'll be sad if it gets super popular and no one can get a seat anymore! :)"
692,st-kilda-coffee-new-york-3,2019-08-29,2.0,"Only in NYC could a place this small call itself a coffee shop. This is, in fact, a take out counter."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2020-04-05,5.0,"This is a great place for fresh salads, tasty wraps and platters and super friendly service. Also general grocery items like yogurts. Love the fish tacos and Philly cheesesteak. And they'll make any sandwich a low carb salad platter. My favorite lunch place! I haven't been able to go since the quarantine because it's near my office not my home. I miss Ulysses, Maria, Luis, & Luis!!"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2020-04-17,4.0,"Ugh, I miss Taza. I used to work next door and this was THE go-to lunch spot (I'm talking literally every day). They also have the friendliest, hardest working, pleasant staff in all of NYC. Yes, I will stand by this.

The salad bar is to die for, and even what seems like the longest line is gone within 3 minutes (the salad guys are amazing ninjas). Not to mention it is FRESH! Seriously, probably fresher than the chain salad places that plague the neighborhood and charge you $20 (the salad here was like $10 with the same portion size). 

Also - THEIR SANDWICHES! So many bodegas/delis in the area pre-make them but not Taza. Taza makes it fresh to order right in front of you - my chicken cutlet/cheese/chipotle mayo was my guilty pleasure here.

If you're an early bird, head here before work and get a smoothie! While I've gotten personalized smoothies, once I knew the play, I always got the green smoothie (honestly forgot the name of it) and for you anti-veg haters, you can't even taste the spinach - it tastes like peanut butter (sounds weird but actually insanely good). You feel healthy - and it is huge!

Okay lastly, free cookie Friday. Come in on Friday, get your lunch and get a free cookie - treat yourself, it's basically the weekend :)

4 stars only because it IS an NYC deli and I might have had one or two weird issues with my food but I also came here literally every day for a year so the good 100% outweighs all else."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2019-12-16,3.0,"**Free cookie on Fridays with your purchase**

Decided to try out this place after years if walking past the place. I went at lunch time and it was pretty busy yet everyone seemed to know what they were doing and everything seemed to run somewhat efficient. 

Got myself a salad bowl in which i was able to to choose my protein plus five toppings for $8.95. The salad wasn't bad at all. Also found out free cookies are given out every Friday!"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2019-08-21,5.0,"Love this plaza. Ulysses and Luis are the backbones of this organization in addition to the girl behind the counter whose name I don't know :). 

Salads are absolute fire and so affordable. You actually get decent protein and in great mass rather than spending $20 for a salad at sweetgreen. Sandwiches and hot food also good but I'm allergic to carbs (and bad vibes) so never really dabble. Breakfast is perfect as well, Luis remembered my order for months after only coming a couple times. 

I'm sure this has been established but free cookie Fridays are a thing. 

Timeless spot hope it never leaves. One love."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2018-11-29,4.0,"Say hello to my new go-to lunch salad spot. That is actually how specific every one of my visits has been. During lunch, and only a salad. 

Surrounded by the dreaded $15 salads in spots all over Flatiron, Taza makes a huge salad that is fresh, delicious and doesn't cost extra for avocado. YEP.  YA HEARD RIGHT. Avocado. Is. Not. Extra. 

During lunch hours, a large salad is $8.50, and you choose all of your toppings. The staff is very friendly and even when they are busy, which they usually are, they don't mind when you ask questions. And what would salad be without dessert. To, you know, celebrate that you just had a salad. If you go on Fridays, you'll be treated to a free cookie. I always opt for the red velvet but wouldn't dare turn my nose up to any of them. Free Cookie Friday has become mini weekly holiday for me and many others from my office. It's the little things right? 

They have so much more than just salads. Sandwiches, soups, paninis, etc. They have a lot, but like I've said, I really have only ever had their salads. And their cookies. I can vouch for them both and they are both wonderful."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2019-06-11,4.0,"I have gone to Taza probably 40+ times. I don't often check in. But I've gone because work friends went, or because it was close, or because I really craved one of their sandwiches. 

Taza is a case of the midtown deli. Their staff is great and friendly, and Friday it's really good because you get a free cookie. But here's the pitfall: sometimes it's just too much. I'm a big dude and going in on a foot long hero of fried chicken, bacon, ranch, Swiss... it's too much. And I hear you, ""But Alfie this is what you ordered!"" Yes, you're damn right it is. Read those ingredients again- would you NOT order that?

In all honesty the only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 is for weekend availabilities and because it's good, but not great.  Definitely worth going to, especially if you work in the area."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2019-03-09,5.0,"Taza, my love my light. I don't know what a world without Taza would look like and I never want to find out. It's more than your typical fast lunch spot. The staff will become your family and you'll feel instantly at home every time you step in the door. 

At my peak I would come here every morning for my usual bagel order which I never even had to say since they knew me so well. I would work for 3 hours then be back here for my lunch time salad or grilled cheese (highly recommend). Those were the days. Out of all the stellar lunch options in the Flatiron area save yourself some time and money and just come home to Taza. 

Special shout outs to Ulysses and Luis who you may also have the pleasure of running into around the corner at Snafu 28 after work. 

Xoxo"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2020-02-09,4.0,This is a great place to grab lunch if you work in Flatiron. They have fresh salads and sandwiches and everyone loves Free Cookie Friday. The prices are also lower than a lot of other lunch spots in the area.
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2019-08-01,5.0,Taza! Your hours are wrong! This is why you need to claim your page. That being said Taza is the best place ever. So affordable! You can get a salad with chicken and avocado and 9 dollars. They also have amazing sandwiches - the chicken cutlet sandwich is a fan favorite. They also have great breakfast. I love the low carb omelette option. The line may seem like it will take a long time but they know how to get people in and out of there super fast. They also have great smoothies. A must go to for lunch - Taza really does it all!
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2019-04-06,5.0,"Great local deli with excellent/ fair priced sandwiches. From eggs to Greek to traditional deli can not go wrong.

All New Yorkers need a reliable bodega. Given Taza is actually clean I'm hard pressed to call it a bodega, but it has everything you want from a reliable bodega ( and it's clean)!

Food uses better ingredients than carts and is more fairly priced than all of the local fast casual. If you live or work in area highly recommend."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2019-10-29,4.0,"To put it simply, Taza is such a reliable staple. I frequently come here and take advantage of their create your own salad bar. You get to choose your greens, a protein, and 5 toppings. My go to is mixed greens with falafel, feta cheese, garbanzo beans, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and olives. To top it off I get one scoop of the  balsamic vinaigrette and the salad chopped. The place is frequently busy around the 12 lunch hour, however, the workers and the cashiers work fast to quickly get their customers served."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2020-01-07,5.0,"I absolutely love this deli! I have never had a bad meal from here, they're clean, everything is delicious. I order from here everyyyyy day for lunch and it's here instantly! Love love love !!!!"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2017-12-01,3.0,"I loved Taza. They are a quick walk from my office or when I'm on the lazy side they are listed as my ""go-to"" on seamless.

They have fresh salad which I usually opt to add falafel, crispy chicken or crispy fish on top. All very delicious. 

Now the reason my love for them is past tense, is because of the price increase. They were already overpriced to begin with depending on what you want, but to increase the value of a salad? Why do this to me Taza. The pricing no longer makes sense for what you get."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2019-10-08,5.0,Great fast service. Food is fresh. Great salad bar. Friendly small business vibe. Recommend!
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2017-02-10,3.0,"At Taza, you'll be spoiled for choice. Salad, soup, sandwiches - they seem to do it all here.

I ordered a very serviceable BLT which appeared swiftly and set me back a mere $6 (actually, a shade less than that). The bacon was hot, the bread toasty and the mayonnaise and mustard application perfect. I'd definitely order a BLT here again.

To me, Taza embodies everything I love about the ubiquitous New York deli."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2018-03-22,5.0,"I almost don't want to write a review about this place because it is MY HIDDEN GEM. Where else in flat iron are you going to have a big salad for under $9!? And the best part is - you choose all of your toppings. AND AVO AIN'T EXTRA. 

There are a bunch of other options here - you can make wraps, they have a deli-ish thing in the back for different meats/vegetables, soups, and even cookies. THEY GIVE YOU FREE COOKIES ON FRIDAY WITH ANY MEAL. K, need I say more?"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2019-08-15,5.0,"Been coming here for 2 years.  The staff is great! Even in morning and lunch rush, they make a point to say hi.  Breakfast is made to order with real eggs and it's quick! They also have a fresh juice and smoothie bar.  I cannot day enough about the people who work here.  They are the reason to keep coming back!"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2015-08-18,1.0,"I am so over Taza Deli and I hope to never have to give them money ever again. I've been coming here nor for a solid 7-8 months. I work right next door to them and in a world where I oftentimes don't get a full hour lunch, their location is king because they're sooooo convenient being right next door.

The lines here around lunch time generally aren't too bad. They move rather quickly and the sandwich guys whip up orders in lightning speeds...in fact, they prepare orders so quickly that in the past 3 weeks they have gotten my orders wrong 4 times. 4 TIMES. WRONG. IN THREE WEEKS. Since I've been coming here they've also managed to mess up my former boss' orders at least 3 times as well and in my 7-8 months of being a regular customer here it's been about 6 or 7 times that they've messed up overall...but 4 times in a little short of a month? That's just plain RIDICULOUS! 

Aaaaaaaand I know what you're probably thinking - ""Hey Steph, if they keep messing up because they're clearly not very bright, why keep going?"" - well again, they're right next door. Coworkers often go. I sometimes walk over with coworkers and I pray that don't get my order wrong (it's usually the same damn things too! I'm a creature of habit!"") because when they don't get my food wrong then it's usually great stuff.

I'm not a complicated person with my lunch orders. They generally involve 3-4 ingredients max. I don't understand the disconnect when I've placed my orders in both English and Spanish.

Today was the 4th time they made an error. I only went back to them once to complain about there being iceberg lettuce and tomato in my wrap when I specifically asked for arugula and NO tomatoes. The other 2 times I threw out the items I didn't want (but sadly enough probably got charged more for) and just dealt with it.

Today (being time #4 damnit) I went downstairs and back to Taza. I demanded to speak with a manager and instead was given an assistant manager - that's fine. I don't care, but the last time I had an issue and went back to speak with them, I went to the sandwich guys so that they could remedy it and not get scolded by anyone. I'm angry now. I hope they get scolded. If you can't understand customer's orders then you should get a new job. One you're actually skilled at. 

The assistant manager offered to have a new wrap made. One that didn't have mushrooms or avocado when I simply wanted spinach, egg whites and cheddar cheese on a whole wheat wrap. You see that - it's only 3 ingredients inside of a wrap. I fail to understand where the difficulty was. I asked for a refund and after I adopted a more stern tone I was given one. I decided to take my money elsewhere and went to Eddy's Eats (located across the street and one block over towards uptown) where I got a grilled chicken, cheese and pesto mayo wrap (3 ingredients! Lol) for LESS MONEY and with FREE "" Deep River Snacks"" POTATO CHIPS. Their error cost me 30 minutes of my lunch hour. Sigh.

As the assistant manager was getting my refund together, I muttered that maybe had I ordered in Spanish there would be less mistakes. He nodded enthusiastically at my suggestion and said that I should because they all speak Spanish...BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN THE POINT, WHAT IF SOMEONE DOESN'T SPEAK SPANISH? Is a customer not given the right to pay only for food they want if they can only speak English or don't speak Spanish? That's ridiculous! 

Pricing here is also NEVER consistent. Salads (which are a great deal here...), sandwiches and wraps are always a different price even when I order the same exact things repeatedly. Sometimes they'll give you a free cookie - but that's never consistent. Nothing here is consistent in terms of customer service, food quality, pricing and food preparation wise. Don't come here unless you're getting a grilled cheese. They MIGHT be able to handle working with a 1 ingredient sandwich - I've never tried though and I don't intend to.

Definitely 1 Yelp star and that's only because I can't give 0."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2019-06-26,4.0,I do like this place. Friendly staff etc. Best salads anywhere!
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2018-10-25,5.0,Really great fruit & veggie juices. Their salad is always really good also. I work really close so I usually order delivery and the food always super quick.
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2018-10-01,5.0,"One of the best gazpacho's in town (but only  in the summer months!). They have a wide variety of deli sandwiches and make almost any kind of salad to order that you can think of.

The counter staff are friendly and very fast."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2017-09-06,2.0,"This place is terrible. I work next door over the the years have stopped in when I miss breakfast but need something quick before the day gets busy. I prefer Bread and Butter or Essen but Taza is closer. Each time I go I kick myself. I hadn't had food there in months and I broke down this morning and went in for an omelette only to be reminded why I hadn't ordered hot food there since last year. The ""omelette"" was some kind of choppy mess but I didn't have the time to chew them out so I just left but I was compelled to write a review. Stay away - take your money elsewhere."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2018-03-23,4.0,"I've only been here about 20 times! And I have to say overall I'm impressed how consistent they are! The chipotle chicken cutlet is my go to choice but they also have a ton of other options! 

Just a warning, their reputation most certainly speaks for itself, so expect it to be cramped and crowded during lunch!"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2018-08-24,5.0,Really good value for the price! Highly recommend the falafel and crispy chicken. Endless combinations so you'll never get bored. All around great underrated place with fast service.
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2017-03-23,4.0,"I work right above this place and have to say they make the best and most fulfilling salad in the Flatiron. Did I mention it was $8? I'm on a semi-gluten-free-diet and have scoured blocks for a good, cheap salad and have come up empty time and time again. It's either too bland, too light but usually too expensive - paying $15 for some greens and chicken is absurd. Point is, if you're around the hood, eat here. Oh, and the service is always top notch!"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2015-09-21,3.0,"Average deli with lots of sandwiches and wrap options.  Nothing that really stands out in making you want to come back for.  I usually come in for a reuben, or philly cheesesteak or even a gyro wrap.  The staff is nice though and preparation is quick.  

I would come here if I run into meetings all day and need a quick bite.  

Their iced coffee is pretty good at times, however there has been some inconsistency on this."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2018-12-18,4.0,The salad and lunch meal overall was really good. Great experience overall the staff was chill and the atmosphere have a nice vibe as well
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2018-02-14,5.0,Wow are these guys quick. They all look like tiny ants running around getting orders from people but man is it good. I always got the chicken cutlet supreme. It was very good here. I highly recommend.
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2017-02-16,2.0,"So I ordered a Mexican sandwich and it came with Guacamole....but the Guac has cucumbers and carrots in it which just did not mix well. Weirdest tasting Guac I've ever had and not in a good way. Also I am allergic to carrots, and obviously didn't expect there to be carrots in Guacamole so there goes $$ right down the drain. 

Also got an iced coffee that was so burnt it actually tasted like they threw in some cigarette ash instead of sugar."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2018-01-12,3.0,"For the price, great salads for a quick lunch grab n go. Very customizable and they have so many different kinds of chicken! (Chipotle Cajun pesto etc). I just wish they had multigrain croutons or a healthier crunch option but the fact that you can get a salad with avocado for under 9 dollars is awesome."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2016-12-01,4.0,"Need a quick lunch spot? Good salads and sandwiches with the ability to customize everything. I came here almost every Friday when I worked in the area for free cookie Friday. Any sandwich/salad comes w a free cookie. 

This place isn't gourmet or the freshest ingredients but it for sure gets the done. 

They are super quick and might even seem rude but I promise it's so they can get you in and out quickly."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2017-08-07,1.0,Horribly over priced. Even a simple nutrition bar is $2.5 and it's THE MOST TERRIBLE  nutrition bar I've ever had. How can nutrition bar be SO BAD???
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2011-11-13,1.0,"Starve off a salvation OR grind and bear the nasty customer service??

One time:  One small bag of Cape Cod potato chips at $1.25 which after three requests for a sales receipt it goes into deaf ears.  
Two time:  To request for a takeout menu was like asking the associates and servers to do actual work!  The dude simply pointed where the takeout menus were rather than simply handed me one.  ""Go straight, back up, no right there.  NO it's over there! There!""

Three strikes:  Extreme pricey for a deli convenience store with nonexistent customer service and uncultured, uneducated mannerism, no etiquette.

I'm outta here!"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2016-01-29,1.0,Run away - there are plenty of better places to eat. I found something black and carbon looking in my salad today and my stomach hasn't been keeping well since. The quality is downright awful - how can you poison your regulars ? Serve them crap
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2016-03-30,4.0,"This is place was so good. I had a chicken parm on a roll and it was great. It was fast and affordable. They have so much variety and i really enjoyed my lunch from there. Only negative thing was the tables were that clean. Other than that, everything was great. I really enjoyed my time here. Also, a great location right next to my school!"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2015-09-03,4.0,"I used to think that waiting 15 minutes on line for a salad and then spending $10 was okay. NYC, right? Then I found Taza! Not only were the lines minimal right after the lunch hour, but the prices were a dream and the staff was nice. Even during the 12-1, the line was bearable and fast-moving. My favorite part? Fresh, delicious chopped (or regular) salads with all the fix-ins (up to 6) for less than $7!! There is some price variance, but nothing too crazy. And if you have a sweet tooth like me, definitely try the red velvet, or even the original, chocolate chip cookies. Can't wait to return!"
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2017-08-18,4.0,"I work across the street from this deli and only just discovered it a few months ago - and now I'm a regular. The service is speedy, friendly, and easy. This is such a solid spot for breakfast and lunch. Awesome salads that are affordable, great breakfast sandwiches/iced coffee, and a good selection of lunch options too. 

The place is clean and the experience is always pleasant. 

Definitely recommend."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2015-07-20,3.0,"The staff is great and the food is average. The frustrating thing about this place is you can go here and order the same thing 5 days in a row and pay 5 different prices. Not just a few pennies off, but more like 10-15% different each time. 

I keep going back because it's so convenient and then hate myself after going."
693,taza-cafe-and-deli-new-york,2015-03-04,4.0,"Lots of options for a fast lunch, especially in the hot sandwich category. There is also an unpretentious salad bar. For $7, the pulled pork sandwich with avocado was very tasty and ready in less than two minutes. They have quite a variety of choices, with half a dozen in the pulled pork sandwich category alone. Will definitely be back to try out some of the other options."

In a city where quality is going down, prices are going up, portions are getting smaller and people are just stupid and rude, Taza Deli is the example to show others how to run this type of business.  Food is delicious and fresh and always well prepared! Prices are great in consideration to the neighborhood and area.  Delivery is first rate, quick, polite and dependable - all the time!!! The people who work here are all wonderful, ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL and that is the best part about Taza! I'm a loyal and devoted customer.  I've been eating in and taking delivery for about 4 years now and never had a bad experience and I can't say that about any other food establishment in NYC.  This place is simply the BEST!!!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2019-10-12,4.0,"Pret a Manger is a brand which I am familiar with as they dominate London with 67% of their stores in the British capital with a good amount of branches elsewhere in the UK, so I was pretty pleased to see them expand across the pond to the United States - this branch is at the beginning of Park Avenue, NYC.

The store is pretty spacious and has a good selection of fresh food and drinks, which they prepare in-store daily including a good gluten-free selection too - they even had Chipolte boxes here, some of them being gluten-free which I found confusing as they were only a few stores down themselves and not all Pret locations in NY have them.

They did have a good selection of soups - I went for the Pumpkin Bisque which is one of their two seasonal soups right now as well as a Turkey Chill which sounded unappetising to me - unlike the UK they seem to do the same soups every-day rather than doing a soup of the day based on multiple visits to stores.

My soup tasted quite good - I would say it was rather overpriced for a small soup as it didn't fill me up - it ended up costing $5.43 which would have got you a full ""large"" soup in the UK with a charitable donation, and change - so this does need a review.

The staff seemed friendly enough and there was ample seating - the latter seems to be impossible to find in New York coffee shops so that's a bonus too.

One of my favourite Pret's in the city in terms of selection and food quality to warrant four-stars!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2019-04-17,3.0,"The store manager (Manika?) was such a doll today! My app wasn't working, so she gave me a coffee on the house. I know this is something Pret does on a regular basis, but she was so genuinely sweet and happy. Plus, the coffee was piping hot and delicious. 

Their lunch line is bonkers, but they hold it down pretty great. Looks like the entire team rolls up their sleeves and gets through all customers as quickly as possible. They're in it to win it! 

I think this location is homier than others, maybe because of the narrow layout. There's a bunch of seats by the front of the store, including a long, communal table, and none in the back by the cashier. FYI, they only have two outlets and they don't work. 

Thanks for the friendly customer service, as always!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2019-02-21,5.0,"I've heard a lot about this chain, esp in London. I've had it there and was surprised to see it in NYC. Stopped here with my boyfriend on our weekend getaway. 

This particular location was satisfactory. The staff was friendly and sufficient. The manager knew what he was doing.

Place is clean, up to date and serves fresh food."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2020-02-20,2.0,"Ummm wth Pret, you left a sticker on my veggies!  Midtown stinks enough, we don't need a lackluster Pret as well, especially now that sweetgreen is right next door.  Guess I'll have to switch to salads now instead of sandwiches..."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2019-02-07,3.0,"Pret a Manger is so convenient when you need a quick, healthy snack and coffee. I wish Hawaii had a location here.

During our visit to NY we visited several locations. I like their ginger and cayenne shots. Especially while traveling and feeling a little under the weather, these shots make me feel a little better. My espresso always tastes good and I receive satisfactory customer service. I didn't buy any food items this time but they have a selection of sandwiches, salads, soups and other items. 
The tables were clean and so were the restrooms. There was an outlet to plug into which is great.

No complaints. And I would recommend coming here or to any Pret A Manger location."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2018-10-02,4.0,"Idk what took me so long to try Pret out being that they're down the block from my job. Everything was really clean & fast. I was in & out in less than 10 mins even though it was a little busy. I had the California Club sandwich. It was really good& fresh but just a little lacking in flavor. Can't wait to try the iced coffee & avocado toast for breakfast. 

It's in a really convenient location, right by the 6 on 33rd Street. It's nice & spacious enough to get work down/ chill out but either before or after the lunch rush as they tend to get a little packed."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2019-04-15,4.0,"Today in particular, the cashier was unable to take card because the system was down but aside from that, I am leaving this place with a huge smile and feeling healthy.

I had a Mediterranean salad from the take away section and it was pretty much the best salad I ever had. Comprised of chick pea, pomegranate, beet hummus, field greens, and a sweet dressing, it was a meal straight out of avatar. 

Pret will always be pricy in my honest opinion, but today in particular, I felt like I got what I paid for."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2019-06-14,4.0,Typical Pret. Small but well run. Clean.  Pleasant staff. Consistent experience.   Great oatmeal.
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2018-02-03,4.0,"This was my favorite breakfast spot on my walk to work. They were fast and efficient, and their food was always fresh. I really enjoyed their oatmeal and turmeric latte. If I was feeling sassy, I would also grab one of their buttery, flaky croissants.

Despite how busy it is on a work day, the staff is always friendly and helpful if you ask.

I would also recommend their protein cups or salads for lunch. They are the perfect amount of food and calories for a person trying to eat better and healthier.

This location is clean, but a little smaller than most other locations as far as I can tell. This can make navigating during rush hour somewhat challenging, but it's definitely worse battling the crowds to get a decent bit of food!

I would recommend this location to anyone looking for something that isn't Starbucks, has decent coffee, and a great selection of breakfast and lunch items."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2017-10-23,4.0,"The staff here is sweet and service is pretty quick. Pret's coffee is yummy, an iced americano totally hits the spot.

There is apparently a new Pret app and a rewards program too, so you can earn points toward free coffee, treats and lunch fare. If you frequent Pret, download it!

There have been a few times in the afternoon where they have ""run out of half and half"" for the coffee--huh? How do you run out? Can't you go to one of the 14 drug stores within 0.1 miles and buy some? So that's a little weird and annoying.

Overall super convenient location for a quick drink or bite."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2019-04-05,4.0,"Pret improved a lot from the first time i posted my review.  Good coffee, improved ambiance and customer service,  finally stevia is available and   never run out of coffee or milk anymore :)  Kudos to the manager!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2017-10-07,5.0,"Love this location, right by the 6 train. Food is always so fresh, hot and/or cold, and the staff is very kind. Lots of traffic in here, shelves go empty quickly but are constantly being restocked.

I will be coming back here many more times. The fresh juice is delicious!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2017-09-27,1.0,"I love the lay out and look , Coffee is 5 star . Service and attitude are awful.  No customer experience at the store level . Some really smart , capable corporate restaurant people got together and had a really good idea.
They poured a ton of money into it , but no one remembered to train the staff?
Food is great looking , pedestrian tasting.  Sandwich is extremely inconsistent,  condiments are typically a spit in center of sandwich . No love in the food. The service truly kills it for me . This location is large and comfortable."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2017-09-04,5.0,"My favorite place in the whole wide whole. I eat at Pret all the time at many locations. This is the freshest food you can find in the city. The price is well worth it, everything is tasty. The soups are fresh and tasty as well. I love this place and I always look forward to go going back.  I recommend this place to everyone, we should all eat this healthy. A+ for food and service, the workers are extremely friendly!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2017-03-05,4.0,Prey is my go to lunch spot when I want something fast. In the am your best bet is to grab a blueberry muffin and a yogurt. Best lunchtime fix is the tomato feta soup and a small sandwich. The staff in prey can turnover pretty quickly however they are always courteous and super efficient. The line is always zooming even if it has a long one at 845 am.
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2014-11-25,5.0,"I go to this pret location regularly 
Everything I've had so far is the best! And great just for quick coffee or tea.
Highlights:
Moroccan lentil
Mac and cheese (yes I know Mac and cheese you would have never guessed)
Mediterranean baguette 
Lobster salad 
Tomato and cheese croissant for breakfast

Staff is friendly. They keep the lines moving and shelves stocked!

I love how environmentally conscious pret is and that they use fresh ingredients. Best part is they donate leftover food to the hungry!!!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2018-03-27,5.0,"The manager is very helpful when there's an issue and Natasha is just as helpful as well. They go out of their way to help their customers and they definitely deserve 5 stars 

Thanks again 
Tina :)"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2015-07-06,3.0,"This Pret location is probably the smallest in NYC, however it still delivers (at least for me). I work within a few meters from here, been coming here regularly since it had opened. I love the candied almonds (a bit pricey but relinquishes my sweet cravings), the croissants are to DIE for (I had one every morning this past winter and gained 15 lbs -also I just got married last year so give me a break :) the blueberry muffin is wonderfully moist and DELICIOUS and the chocolate cookies (esp when they come out fresh from the oven) is heavenly!

I usually get the Chicken Avacado salad, although its really a hit or miss these days with the quantity of chicken they give you. I said QUANTITY, not QUALITY. The quality has always been great. A few months ago (earlier this year) they had increased the price for all salads and had been serving them in slightly larger bowls and I'm telling you- they only increased the portion sizes of the greens (not anything else). The pieces of chicken in the bowls are really scant. And its not consistent- each salad bowl has a diff amt of chicken- some have scraps, and some have even less than that. There are def less cherry tomatoes as well. The average I get is 3-4 in a bowl. Haha Im getting really down to the nitty gritty- but trust me you start to notice these little things if you eat the same thing everyday!

Please Pret, increase the chicken portions slightly in the salads and please make every bowl consistent and I will post an updated review! Thank you!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2018-10-29,5.0,"I am addicted to Pret but this one is the best one! The staff is helpful and friendly. They go out of their way to make sure that you get what you want. If it is not on the shelf, they will go into the back to see if they have it. If you are a long time customer, they remember what you like so I  often do not even have to ask for it. It is a true neighborhood place where you always feel welcome. I feel beyond lucky that it is a half a block away from where I live but even if it wasn't, I would make the effort to go to this Pret A Manger!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2014-09-27,4.0,Pret is an easy stop when I know I want fast decent food and there is nothing interesting nearby. My daughter loves the tuna Sandwiches. Their bakery goods are usually tasty too.  They get an extra star for feeding the hungry with their leftovers.
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2011-08-29,4.0,"I like Pret a Manger. I can't help it. Good selection of freshly made salads, sandwiches, and soups at a fair price for this area. This location close to my office opened up a few months ago and today was my first visit there.

Some of my favs are the chicken balsamic sandwich with avocado, the chicken ceasar salad with some balsamic dressing, and the moroccan lentil soup. I like the bread you get with the soup too. Good quality ingredients, fresh and tasty. Portion sizes are just right so I don't feel like a total slug when I finish lunch and have to go back to work.

This location is on the smaller side so there is a limited amount of seating at small circular tables. Very clean and bright. Friendly staff and counter people too."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2013-07-24,3.0,"Great location and super friendly staff. They are good at keeping stock of all the sandwiches and salads during the lunch rush.  

Came here today and was even able to get one of the booth tables all to myself while I had time to kill.  I had the roast been 1/2 and a shrimp corn chowder, pretty good, the soup was super watery and I wouldnt classify it as a chowder but I guess thats what makes it less in calories. 

My only gripe is that you need a network code at the bottom of the reciept to access the wifi.  I wasnt given a receipt ...and by the time I realized this I was already a 1/3 done eating.  Oh well I guess for the future I will know to ASK for my receipt instead of them just throwing it away."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2017-08-23,2.0,"The cashier withdrew an additional $ 2.5 for a coffee macchiato which I did not order. When I got a receipt I saw 3 coffee instead of 2 I ordered. And when I said the cashier about it she laughed and said "" this happens every time with me "" and returned the money. Please check your receipts. It was on the 23rd of August at 10:40 am."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2015-04-11,4.0,"I love coming for breakfast or quick snack. Their quality is amazing and proportions are just right for me. When I picked up a quick breakfast, a croissant and small chai latte was under $6!!!!! Comon' you can't even get a cup of joe at Starbucks for this price. Although, their chai latte isn't very good, watery and weak chai tea. The buttery croissant is crazy good!

I saw they added a line of sparkling juices and I can't wait to try it!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2013-04-23,4.0,"I love this place - the people are nice and the company's social responsibilities are values that I uphold.

Love the salads here - really good."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2017-07-12,4.0,"Love their iced caramel latte, literally get it every morning before class. It just tastes perfect, not overbearing in sweetness at all. Only deducted a star because they often forget to add caramel syrup to my drink when I pay EXTRA for it."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2015-03-13,2.0,"This location is pretty good in terms of food but sometimes can be lacking in availability. 

The drinks are a hit or miss. Sometimes they're good and other times it tastes burnt. 

The wifi isn't easily accessible like other locations. This location makes you enter a password which is usually printed on the receipt but they don't always give you your receipt so you have to ask them for the receipt or the password."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2018-05-18,5.0,"I love this Pret because of the people. They always make me feel like an old friend when I walk into the shop. I also appreciate the surprise and delight moments when an item is given on the house.  It's also pretty nice to see that their gold star treatment is universal since I take note of how they treat the other patrons as well. Way too much of my paycheck goes to your shop, lol, but with customer service like this, I feel guiltless when I treat myself to lunch here. Also, obsessed with the almond croissants + chocolate chip cookies (and I have the hips to prove it). Yup - I'm a fan of this shop. - Cassie"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2013-07-09,5.0,"While I'm not a massive fan of the food that Pret serves, I am slightly (actually, really) obsessed with their coffee.  It's fresh, doesn't have that crappy free coffee flavor they serve at the office, and is sufficiently caffeinated :)

The iced coffee (which is what I mostly get) is reasonably priced.  One thing though, they don't have simple syrup, but just packets of sugar.  Somehow I prefer this from Pret.  Strange.  Free soy milk!"
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2013-04-07,4.0,"Always passed by this place en route to work but didn't stop by until recently.

The breakfast baguettes, oh my! So fresh and so good.  

I've had the egg/bacon with pesto baguette for breakfast.  The turkey/ Parmesan sandwich and the pop corn. Can't go wrong really with their sandwiches.

Prices were fair for the area. Staff is very friendly and the seating area clean and welcoming."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2013-04-01,3.0,"Food is alright.

PROS:
- food is organized. everything is labeled and shows what ingredients are in each sandwich
- many options from sandwiches to soup
- you can mix and match your half sandwiches.

:::::::Chicken Avocado & Balsamic
One of my favorites. If you love avocado and Chicken this is just for you!! Plus you can get this in a Small for only $3.59. Super cheap.

:::::::Avocado Pine Nut Wrap 
Love the amount of avocado they put into this wrap! The pine nuts add flavor to the wrap. Delicious. Only downside was I kinda wanted some meat in it as well. I like to have a little meat in my wraps.

CONS:
:::::::Spicy Shrimp & Cilantro Wrap: 
Overrated - I didn't really like the wrap - I should have known it'd be a turn off since it contained red peppers - I definitely won't be getting this again. What made me get it was because of my overly fond love of shrimp. The Spicy part was ehh ok. 

- Food is a little overpriced. e.g. Wraps and Sandwiches are like $7 each but its like that in midtown.

Note:
It's a good place to come once in a while for lunch just not everyday."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2014-11-30,1.0,"I'm fed up with this place. 
First, it is supposed to be open according to the schedule and it is not. Randomly closed in the morning without any explanation.
Second, I had a very unpleasant experience with a woman of the staff. She literally threw her tray on the desk and served me with the most disrespectful manner. See, I'm a waitress myself so... I can talk about leaving your problems behind you when you interact with people. Well, she didn't carefully listen to my order and ended up serving (or rather throwing at my face) my croissant for free rather than typing a new order on her computer.
That's bad really because they serve nice food and I love their concept... But now I think I'm going to avoid this place."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2016-01-14,5.0,"loove this place. fresh food, grab and go. what else can you ask for? 
I like pretty much everything but their sandwiches on sliced bread. Just tried their chicken burrito, it was delicious. Better known for their cold food, but their hot food is also on point."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2016-06-08,4.0,"We grabbed a veggie quinoa roll and a couple of coffee to go. I like the convenience of the place. Food is interesting, but I haven't gotten a chance to try something else. Service is good, even though it was kind of a busy morning."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2015-12-30,2.0,"I love pret and we just moved our office near this location. This location sucks, the staff made me feel so uncomfortable my first visit. I'm just trying to get my breakfast and go, I don't need your passive aggressive comments and rudeness. The food is excellent if you don't get the burned pastries. I'll be looking for a different location to frequent."
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2016-07-14,2.0,The food is pretty good there but to be quiet honest the service and mix ups are ridiculous. I understand that it's morning rush hour but they need to have better organization. Why not have someone do the cold drinks and another person in charge of the hot drinks? .  I ordered a hot chocolate and waited almost 10 min. for it. Not good!!!
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2013-09-07,4.0,"Pret is one of my favorite spots for quality eats on the go.  Their soups are delicious and the perfect solution for a cold, brisk day (make sure you don't leave without one of their amazing pretzel rolls in hand).  

I also have a slight obsession with their Hot Falafel Wrap (a great option for vegetarians) because it's full of flavor, the perfect portion and well-priced.  Gotta give props to their philanthropic side too as they don't waste any of their unsold food.  Instead, they give it to the homeless!  Now that alone is a chain worthy of supporting."

694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2016-08-07,5.0,Love this location. The staff here is super friendly and they have organic coffee. They don't fill it with ice like other places do ! And it's cheaper than Dunkin donuts #crazyyyy
694,pret-a-manger-new-york-28,2016-05-11,1.0,"The staff at this location is rude, inattentive and beyond childish.  Who was on staff the evening of May 11 from 5:00 pm on??  The music was blasting, as usual, and one could not even have a conversation without shouting.   The staff was asked to lower it and they did.  However, then they started singing rather loudly.  I was not the only one who was unable to enjoy my time there.  Another woman made a comment and got up and walked out.  My friend went over to them and very nicely asked them to stop and in response they totally ignored her and carried on.  I left in disgust.

These employees have no sense of professional responsibility at all and fail to realize that they are not in a playground but are employees who are there to do a job and make their customers feel comfortable. 

This is not the first time I have had to ask for the music to be lowered.  On a different day the response, on a cold day, was to blast the air conditioner on and off. 

You have a serious problem here and I see there is another post below placed by a customer who was rather put off with the staff.  It would seem to me that you need to get some responsible adults employed  at this location, and fast.

P.S.  You're new lobster salad is delicious.  Keep stocking it!  :)  It seems to run out very quickly."
695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2019-07-11,4.0,"So I went here around an hour before the place closed because I was transferring buses in less than an hour and I wanted a quick bite before I got on the bus. Since it was so late into the night and they were almost closing, there were not really much to choose. I eventually chose a wrap. The staff was friendly and took my order. When I asked for the bathroom, the staff told me the passcode and pointed me the right direction. The restaurant itself was spacious and had enough seats. The wrap was delicious but definitely overpriced. 

Overall, definitely a plus for being one of the few around the area for being open late in the night, and a plus for a delicious wrap. A minus for the price."
695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2019-05-20,4.0,"I don't know why I just haven't gone into Pret's more often, in fact, I think the first time I bought something from one was on my way out of Edinburgh airport. At this visit, I was early for a dance class in the area and decided to fuel up with some coffee and whatever offerings Pret has, and I found the perfect fit in the Greek egg white frittata. It was a perfect portioned meal, perked up with delicious feta and herbs. There aren't many healthy to-go breakfast options I can have (most yogurts are often high in sugar and my body no longer agrees with sugar) so, finding this will be a real gem when I need to grab something on my city forays. 

Staff was nice and speedy, the place was clean and I couldn't think of better way to plop down on a Sunday morning, enjoy a sun shower and read my book before class."
695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2019-03-21,3.0,The only reason I gave Pret a 3 is strictly due to the prices there. They have amazing food - don't get me wrong. But it's just a bit pricy for me. Ended up paying like $20 for a sandwich soup and drink. Gotta save my money.

It's also not a place that you would want to visit for amazing food. It's a casual takeout place that has seating, but most of the food is ready to eat. It's amazing for a quick lunch, but a bit pricey. I usually get the chicken avocado salad or the balsamic chicken baguette. The ingredients always taste fresh and never fails to satisfy me during my lunch break!"
695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2018-06-01,3.0,"I really love Pret's service. The manager and employees here are top-notch and super friendly. They handle the morning rush decently and there's usually no longer than a five-minute wait. There's not much space or many outlets at this location, but it's mainly a commuter cafe anyway. But the past couple of coffees I've gotten here have been very watery or off in taste. I got almond milk iced lattes here twice this week and I couldn't even drink half of the cup. The almond milk isn't even out for me to add more. Pret usually isn't disappointing, but for some reason, this location has diminished in quality and it makes me sad, because I have a special love for the company. Guess I'll stick to their other locations for now."
695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2019-07-26,5.0,the almond milk vanilla latte here is the best latte ive ever had in my entire liiife so so good! i wish they used paper straws instead of the plastic ones but the coffee was amazing.

He was belligerent, extremely rude, and very disrespectful as I sat down. He assumed I had not purchased anything and instead of just nicely just asking me, he aggressively approached me pointing at me and I felt extremely uncomfortable. I had taken a picture of my coffee that I bought so I showed him that as he continued to yell at me. I hope someone speaks with him as that is NO way to treat a customer. So disappointed because I really liked this location."
695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2018-09-24,5.0,I'm giving this store 5 stars because they let me use their restroom without buying anything and then gave me a free croissant on my way out. Service is impeccable and the staff is truly one of a kind!

This staff goes above and beyond to make you feel taken care of and it keeps me coming back! I've even spilled a fruit cup all over the floor here and someone ran out immediately to help clean up and crack a joke to make me feel at ease.

The food is always stocked freshly with my favorite items and their cappuccinos are ""made with extra love"". Lol.

695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2015-10-08,3.0,"I'll keep this short. There's not much to say about yet another Pret a Manger in the city. This one is adequate, which is all I can say of a lot of these 7th ave lunch places. I'll pro/con it up to make things easy.

Pros:
+Food is relatively healthy
+You've got a decent selection of sandwiches, salads and ""power bowl"" type options - not many vegetarian options but I can vouch for the falafel salad - surprisingly good (I wasn't expecting much). Though I did not look for a bird feather in mine, so I might've just had some animal protein in my veg salad after all. They eat pigeon in some countries, right?
+Friendly staff
+Calories, grams saturated fat and grams sugar are posted next to the description of each item - good for sticking to healthy diet (though relative calorie counts do not necessarily equal health, just so y'all know)

Cons:
-Overpriced for the what you're getting. That's my biggest gripe with Pret. The salad packages are deceivingly big. In reality, you're really not getting much bang for your buck. I thought I was saving by getting a pre-packaged salad here instead of making my own at Fresh & Co across the street, but these salads are simply not worth 10 bucks. 
-While the ingredients are purported to be fresh, I've steered clean of the chicken avocado salad on several occasions after spying a few avocados that were more brown than green
-This might be nitpicky, but some of the salad container tops aren't secured. Oh wait, mid-review revelation..MAYBE THAT'S WHY THE INGREDIENTS DON'T LOOK SO FRESH?? In any case, that just seems unsanitary to me. 7th ave in Midtown is not a clean place...so I prefer my food toxin-free to make up for the air I'm breathing in constantly 

All in all, adequate."
695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2016-07-14,5.0,"Lots of fresh healthy selections of salads, sandwiches, soups, et al. Baked goods as well and fresh pressed juices. 
My kids had mozzarella and tomato sandwiches / baguettes and I had the tuna. We all had the fresh pressed juices and had a Cacau pot to share and some chocolate almonds. Great counter service. 
The air was out and over our table. When the employee asked us if we would mind moving so it could be prepared, she offered a coffee. It was too hot for coffee so we refused but it was a nice offer. 
My daughter who's here taking pre college classes was told about this place by her professors. We had been planning on meeting for lunch today and it was a great place to have a healthy, fresh meal. SO WISH this place was in our native Michigan. It's itching for a place like this. Love the environmentally consciousness as well. Loved reading how intricate the entire production of ""fresh"" takes. Impressed!!  
Ah--- while still deciding on what to do with the rest of the day the same young lady is saying aloud, cold lattes, coffee Etc. Perfect!! Literally perfect."

695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2018-08-17,3.0,"I got a turkey avocado sandwich here and it was just okay. Nothing special, but not bad. They have a lot of healthy choices (tons of different sandwiches, salads, wraps, and then baked goods located at the front). They list the calories of all their food and drinks which I appreciated, and none of the items calorie content are super high or outrageous.

I also got a cappuccino which was great! My guess is the coffee is where their strong suit is, though I've only been here once."
695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2017-06-08,4.0,"I am a semi-regular at this Pret. They don't have anything ground breaking as far as menu, but their food is quick and reliable. For someone with a sensitive stomach, this is key. I generally have excellent service at most Pret locations. The staff is usually friendly and helpful!

The Pret website doesn't have a place to write in for comments or complaints, so I hope this finds management. I was at this location today. The center cashier appeared to be open so I stepped forward. He corrected me and said another customer was first, but that customer looked like he was in a different line originally. I didn't question it though cause the lines were kind of a mess. You are supposed to have single file lines per cashier, but it was kind of just a bunch of people crowding to the cashiers. I stepped back in my original place. The couple in front of me were taking forever so when the center cashier opened up again, I stepped forward again into that line. The woman behind me said ""excuse me miss, but aren't you supposed to be in this line?"". The cashier proceeded to rudely answer for me ""Yes. there are supposed to be single file lines in front of each cashier, except some people just don't respect those lines"". Then looked straight at me. I really wanted a Harvest Cookie, cause those are the best, but I was put off by his passive aggressive comment. He didn't offer if I wanted anything else or if I needed napkins. He bagged my items, told me where to swipe and sent me on my way. I suggest for next time, to kindly explain to someone if they are doing thing incorrectly, or to take some leadership and explain to the clustered crowd that there are supposed to be lines at each register. My intentions were not to cut any one or be rude. I was simply proceeding with what made sense to me. Its possible that there were people in line behind me that I did not see, but instead I got a passive aggressive comment."

Today, however, marks the third time I've come here well after the advertised opening time (6 am on weekdays - I arrive at 7:30 or so) and they are closed.  This morning, there was a sign on the door saying no credit cards as their machines were down, but you could still buy with cash.  Except the two or three staff members inside would not open the door despite our knocking and them seeing us through the window.  Finally, the manager came out and told me that they were closed due to technical difficulties. 

There's a Gregory's Coffee up the block."

I have been a fan from the first time I tried a sandwich from this place so every chance I can, I'm here. I never really pays much attention to the sweets but those two cakes were my go too when I did crave something good.

I'm not sure why the banana cake and carrot cake were removed from the menu but WE NEED to get them back.This review is to show my appreciation of how great the orange juice was but most importantly to say that those cakes should be brought back."

Walked in here hoping and sure enough I did. I got the black bean chipotle avocado wrap. I was worried about the chipotle some places add milk or mayo. I asked the manager a very sweet lady and she made sure with the kitchen that it in fact was vegan. Thank you! If I am ever in the area again I will certainly return.

695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2015-11-06,2.0,"I used to have a love affair with my Pret a Manger at 50th and 8th - I'd tie my dogs up outside, grab an organic coffee, often a free cup, and once they even gave me a free lobster salad! Always friendly customer service and a delight to patronize.

I've been going to the Penn Station Pret on my commute, and I am very disappointed after my visit this morning. When I would take my own cup to the 8th Ave location, they would charge me for a small, even though it was a large, and I assumed this was my ""personal cup discount."" This morning, I was  told by the employee at Penn that not only do they NOT give a personal cup discount, they don't like us using our own cups as customers. 

Either she was misinformed or this is actually a Pret a Manger policy. If the former, this location needs to get it together. If the latter, the whole company needs to get it together. Saving paper cups that are going straight to a land-fill should be encouraged amongst customers. I can't imagine why Pret isn't doing this (if the employee was correct) and if that's the case, their stock is falling in my book."

At least 3/4 times a day.
Well, today one of the employees here, a guy called Erik,
wanted to charge me for a salad dressing although I was buyng a small chicken salad (which is supposed to come with a dressing).
I explained that nothing like that hasn't ever happened in 5 years, and he said: ""well, if those kids never charge you for that it's their problem, not mine.""
We were all speechless.

Well manners please"

695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2014-01-13,3.0,"Pret A Manger is undoubtedly overpriced for what it is, but the refrigerated sandwiches are not bad at all, and you have your calorie counts posted if you're concerned about health. It's clean and warm and safe, but essentially it's a prettier version of Au Bon Pain. As chains go, it's a reliable one.

Tip: There's free WiFi for customers (you can catch it from the Indian place down the street, too, once you're ""IN"":)."
695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2015-11-17,5.0,"Me and my husband were in city early morning for some work and while walking past by this place my husband mentioned that they had good breakfast and within next 5 minutes we were inside the store grabbing our hot breakfast wrap and avocado chicken sandwich. Didnt have to wait in line to put our order and then wait. We just grabbed our breakfast went to the counter to pay. 

For some reason they don't have napkins accessible to the customers where they put sugar/straws etc. When I was looking for napkins the staff asked me what I was looking for and told me I can ask some at the counter. It was very helpful - I didnt even have to go and ask anyone... they just saw I needed something and thus were ready to help."

It has a story and a mission which is evident on the walls, in the packaging and through the staff. It was lively and the staff were chipper and provided great service. The fresh fruit and granola/yoghurt options were utterly delicious. I was thoroughly impressed. The coffee options also great. Excellent spot to grab breakfast if you're wanting something fresh and simple (I found that hard to find in NYC)."
695,pret-a-manger-new-york-53,2014-07-10,3.0,"I fell in love with Pret when I was in London a few years back. Not so much now. 

The place is a clean, bright, well organized space with a modern, cheerful decor. The prices are ""moderate"" but what are you getting? A thin, cold sandwich and a drink? There are heartier options. This makes pricing not so moderate, but it is a comfortable refueling spot.**

I'm a foodie, but I'll eat almost anything.  But I must tell Yelpers that the egg salad here is just plain vile and downright medicinal. The bread, too. The problem is  company-wide, not just this store. I've had a few sandwiches here, tuna, salmon, chicken salad and egg salad and I find them all to have a certain strong chemical aftertaste. Maybe get a salad?

Really lovely and friendly help, (some are very nice looking). Clean organized, bright space!

696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2015-10-24,5.0,"Why did I find this great little coffee bar only after I moved 4 hours away? 

I pondered the above question while my friend ordered a latte and I ordered a shot of Joe's house Waverly espresso. We finished our first drinks and liked them so much we went for a second round of drinks from a different barista who made us a couple of Neat Guji Oromia Ethopian Heirloom espresso drinks. My friend and I looked at each other and wondered why this second coffee reminded us of the exact same thing, rendang curry spice with a coconut finish (huh?!).

Even at the best coffee shops I've been to, it's very difficult to find a place with multiple talented baristas who take the time to dial into the grind to hit the sweet spot for two different espressos in succession. Joe Pro Shop did just that, and of all the Joe's shops I've frequented around the city, this Joe's shop made me the best drinks. This particular coffee bar was Joe HQ ground zero, so coffee education and equipment is available on premises and it's geared for the specialty coffee business folks or the pleasure of good coffee on the go. It's not the type of cafe to hunker down to kill time for those that want that (although there are a few seats in a small space available if you're lucky).

Worth a special trip, I'm sure to back for the good stuff when I'm in back in town."
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2019-05-10,5.0,"Good place to stop in for a quick cup of coffee to go. The space itself was on the smaller side so when busy I could see it being crowded.

696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2019-10-13,1.0,"Coffee is good, but the staff is cold and rude. I don't know why the staff is always in such a snippy and bad mood but they need to learn how to treat their customers. I went there with my husband and kids for coffee only to have a barista make a scene and give me an attitude and stare me down as I was leaving over spilling some coffee in the garbage because it was overflowing. Then going on and telling me how water shouldn't be in the garbage and stopping everything he was doing to go and take out the empty garbage bag and making a scene as if I did something catastrophic. It seemed the more I attempted to ignore the situation and enjoy my coffee he continued to antagonize the situation."

Well, this place has it all but barista. We went to Joe on Lexington Avenue, Upper East Side every other day. Joe won't see us and our friends at any of its locations. All because of the barista who served us yesterday on west 21st street. I was running late with my meetings and my friend of course went to our former favorite Joe coffee. Ordered latte and waited till I arrive. Even thou we had to leave I couldn't resist a cup of latte. So my friend turned around, barista looked at us and since there were no one at the place but us  and a mother with son next to us, my friend said: ""Could we have one more latte, please?"" The answer barista gave us was shocking: ""why do you yell at me. You have to order standing at the register."" Tiny place with no one in the store. And no one was yelling at him. He gave us a horrible attitude and looks. Insulting. If there wouldn't be a mother with child - I would definitely say about the level of his ""hospitality"". I took the coffee and throw it in the garbage. Joe coffee Never again."
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2018-05-05,3.0,"I took a Latte Art Class here and had mixed feelings. 

The coffee shop itself is small with pretty much no sitting room. The back room is spacious for a small class, but there was storage and boxes right behind the space. Comparing it to Sur La Table class space- it was probably a 2. 

The class was ok. It was a group of 7 people for 2 instructors. We had some demonstrations and hands on experience. I feel like the teaching portion of the class was good, they demonstrated a few skills and then had us practice them. 

Here's what I found to be a negative: I was expecting to at least drink the latte that we made, but we were told that they use old coffee beans for the practice so the drinks aren't made to be consumed (someone even asked if we could have the proper coffee beans for our last cup to drink it,  and we were told no).  For the amount this class cost, I would have expected at least a cup of coffee and some pastry or something. Sur La Table charges around the same amount for a class and you get to eat the meal you prepare, and you are offered coffee/refreshments) 

Overall, the class was good- I learned the basic skills and technique to make simple latte art. I do not think it was worth the price, I would have paid less for this. I wish it was more consumer friendly and we were at least allowed to drink the latte we made."
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2016-11-25,3.0,"This tiny sterile shop felt a bit like a closed kitchen or a dimly lit bacterial research lab with little sit down space and a droll zombie scruffy hipster in a gold  faded vintage Hawaiian shirt.

A small moveable letter board continued the simple impromptu theme with a few choices - drip brew small and large $2.50/$3, espresso in two beanerys $3/4 and pour overs for $6.  

Not necessarily friendly or warm it felt good enough and local.  A tiny plastic counter cased displayed a few donuts, one with a pastel sort of tie dye pattern in one of the sugar glazes, presumedly from the baristas Scooby Doo mystery van.

Hell I felt like I should've been purchasing some dispensary made THC baked goldfish from Colorado, cause the coffee was a bit thin for my taste, tho flavorful as such.  

One woman claimed the only small counter perch, so acted cool and scrammed outta there with a lilt in my step feeling high perhaps from coffee, second hand ganja or maybe it was my clean Paleo diet.

The Pro Shop is the headquarters and sells coffee gear and coffee beans on a rotational basis. They didn't have much of a selection of coffee beans when I went - the only kind they had other than Joe's brand was George Howell. I ended up buying the 12oz Karinga AB Kenya roast by George Howell Coffee and was charged $30. 

However, later I found out that you can buy 12oz of this coffee online from georgehowellcoffee.com for only $17.00. Even with shipping fees, I could've gotten this for less than $30. I'm not sure how they usually price the coffee, but from this instance, I am very disappointed that I was overcharged so much and will definitely not go to this place again for coffee beans."

Think coffee, drink and smell the coco beans.  Learn how to brew coffee and espresso with classes and espresso makers plus accessories for sale.  Coffee is, of course, for sale.  Albeit, I am NOT a coffee nor espresso chick but the atmosphere does entice an interest with all their retro machines all things coffee related.  It reminds me of Kato in 2011's ""The Green Hornet"" who built a customized espresso machine for his master.  The final touch of the coffee brewing was finished with a very subtle signature, a leaf shape made by the impression of milk.

Joe's Coffee is not for the faint hearted as it is for the serious coffee and espresso lovers.  For tea lovers, stay away as this is not your place to be."

If you are familiar with any of the Art of Joe's in the city (Waverly, Union Sq, West Chelsea, GCT), then you know how delicious Joe is.  I put Joe in my bucket of amazing 3rd wave coffee bars in the city, including Grumpy, Stumptown, Blue Bottle.  

The beauty of Joe Pro Shop is the LACK of line.  Beautiful espresso, single pour coffee without the hectic pace of most of the other Art of Joe locations (GCT - M-F is a ZOO!).  If you are a brew your own aficionado, they sell a ton of gadgets, gizmos, props, toys, and ingredients to the delight of any coffee connoisseur.  The corporate HQ is also in this locale, so you feel like you are more in a coffee lab. There isn't a lot of seating, but if you are wanting to enjoy your java in peace, the place is completely chill. 

Only downside are the hours.  They close early (check the website) and only open at 8am during the week, and maybe 9am (Sunday and Sat ? - unsure).  If you are waking up with the birds and jonesing for Joe, go to either 23rd and 9th Avenue, or Cafe Grumpy (my favorite) on 20th between 7th and 8th Avenue."

Pro: Convenient location!
Con: Inconvenient hours! (Don't open until 8 on weekdays, take an hour lunch break at noon)

I knew from the color of the coffee that it will not be a water drip dark iced coffee, which is fine but it was very acidic. 
Maybe I am jumping the gun a bit but if that's how their iced coffee tastes, diluted, weak and acidic (wrong kind of coffee beans for iced coffee), I don't think I am going back there."
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2016-11-02,2.0,"I discovered this shop 4 months ago, and have been buying my coffee beans from here ever since. I'd been appreciating their curation of beans, which includes local roasters with the roasting date printed on the bag. This morning I couldn't remember what I had and hadn't yet tried, so I asked if the shop's iPad register keeps customer profile data with purchase history. Apparently this warranted a sarcastic, condescending, dismissive response. Luckily, there are other shops in Chelsea that offer the artisanal selections minus the snobbery and disdain for their customers, who might even recognize and appreciate a good idea when they're presented with one."

People that work there are also very cool and love what they do. As other people mentioned their is not much seating here, it is more of a grab & go type place, but they do have a few benches outside. 

Oh yeah, and if you get there early enough you can get what is possibly one of the best chocolate croissants I've had in my life."

We're talking serious science behind the cup here people, from timing & pressures to grinds all adjusted for the specific bean.  

The end result is the perfect cuppa everytime.  These guys are sooo consistent, and at HQ you can see why.  It's a whole laboratory for coffee here, where barristas cut their chops on the best equipment pulling the finest first rate shots you can get in gotham.

The latte itself was good but the customer service could have used a bit more work... The two baristas were busy talking to each other they barely acknowledged me. But whatever. I guess the main point was the coffee taste. 3 stars cause I'm still salty."
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2014-11-22,5.0,"Not sure why I haven't thought to review my favorite coffee house in all of NYC before now.  I first ""found"" Joe's coffee on the UWS 4 years ago and then ""found"" another in the Union Square area. At this time I lived in W. Harlem so (sadly) I didn't get to Joe's on a daily basis. UNTIL....I moved to Chelsea 2 years ago and there are TWO yes TWO within walking distance of me.  The Joe Coffee Gods heard my prayer!  

The one on 23rd/9th is a sit down location with longish lines. Great if you want to meet a friend or just chill. The SECRET location is THIS one on 21st (between 6/7) their Pro Shop.  Lines are shorter- BIG ""WOO-HOO "" for that as we all know how much we need our coffee!   

There are only 2-3 stools to chill at at this location so if you want to enjoy your espresso there most likely you can because rarely do I see people sitting there.  The baristas are always nice and really take pride in what they do. I change it up from cappuccinos  to a regular coffee to their pour-overs and I am never disappointed. 

Only time I am disappointed is when I get there early on the weekends and they aren't open (check their hours as its different from their other locations) so I have to truck over to the 23/9th location. 

This location sells coffee, grinders and all of the great coffee gadgets so you can make coffee at home. I've been told you can set up an appointment to bring your espresso maker into the Pro Shop and they will teach you how to make a proper cup.  

BTW- If you're a Starbucks drinker and you somehow enjoy the burned / bitter taste and all of that sugary chemical junk you can put into their ""coffee"" you might not dig this place as THIS is the real thing. No frappe, caramel double whipped dip whatever here. (YUCK!)  But then again, I double dog dare you to try it!  

Can't wait for tomorrow's cup of Joe!"
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2014-03-17,5.0,"Joe's Pro is for more than just equipment. 

They also make a stellar cappuccino. 

But the cherry on top was a cup of George Howell Kenya that was simply transcendent. It tasted syrupy smooth with a hint of cherry jam. 

This is probably more of a review for someone who knows what they are looking for. 

The barista was also helpful but shy."
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2016-09-28,5.0,No attitude and never a long wait! The coffee is great and the service is cheeky! It's pricey but if you're in the mood to splurge and you feel gay then do it! Grab a bagel from Murray's and a cup from Joe and go sit on 9th Ave to take in the cars swooshing by and the colored girls saying toot to toot...

CHECK-IN TIP: This Americano is killer!"
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2013-09-15,2.0,"All I had heard about was- Joe's The Art of Coffee- is the place! Since I'm such a coffee freak I headed over. After the fact I realized I ended up at the ""Pro Shop"" instead of a regular outpost. Maybe that's why the attitude was amped up? 

Ordered an Americano and a pour over. When my pour over was finished I asked if there was any milk. WHOA! Wrong question. After the barista unrolled his eyes and unscrewed his mouth, It was explained to me that they like to instruct customers to taste the coffee black, that the favors change by the minute...but he would provide me with milk if I really thought I needed it. Thanks but I'll have my coffee the way I like it-with a splash of milk. Can you not make a cappuccino then because the milk will bastardize the espresso? As time wore on my coffee took on a sour note. Not delicious.

Maybe the other outposts are a little more relaxed?"
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2015-10-13,5.0,"When it comes to coffee, I like to pursue the best tasting coffee thats so good, it doesn't require sugar. This is the place, come to Joe's -- they make the best coffee in this neighborhood. Theres not much of a business crowd, but this area is surrounded by plenty of young artists and energetic consumers. Joe's has the fuel needed for a fast pick-me-up, their cappuccino and lattes are foamed to perfection. Stop by, you wont regret it."

696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2017-06-15,1.0,Awful coffee. Weaker than dunkin doughnuts. Ordered an iced americano. Poor customer service. Slow. Inattentive. Took two sips and threw out the entire drink.
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2016-06-25,5.0,"We took the One Day Barista Workshop and it was the best class we've ever taken. (Sorry, 5th grade science class.) The instructors were very well informed, we all got tons of practice, and we had a good time. This was obviously a well-planned class, meant to squeeze as much information as possible into a newbie's head and provide them with a solid foundation so they can continue their espresso journey. Can't wait to see what other classes there are!"
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2013-11-14,5.0,"The Pro Shop is really a no-frills coffee bar, with very little seating.  While it may look very simple, the vast amount of knowledge lurking within the walls was extremely impressive. 

One wall housed pretty much every important type of coffee equipment, from grinder, to kettle to brewer.  There isn't a ton of selection within each category - I have to assume that Joe has curated the list and sells only what they consider to be the best in class.

In the back, a class of about 10 people was occurring - definitely something I would check out in the future. 

On the left side is the menu and bags of coffee from their rotating list of coffees, in addition to some of their own. The day I was there, they were selling beans from Heart and George Howell's Terroir - both of which I was excited to try.

Friendly baristas - good product and good execution.  What else can you ask for?"
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2016-05-27,1.0,I normally love Joe Coffee but not this Pro shop iteration. No decaf?! Come on some of us can't drink caffeine in the afternoon or evening! Very disappointing
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2013-12-01,5.0,"Went here today after visiting to Container Store and glad I stopped in.  My Americano is just what I have come to expect from Joes - delicious and well balanced as usual.

And the barista who served was as charming as all the others that have served me at all the other Joes locations.

I mean is the ambiance the exact same as the other Joes outposts? No.  Do I care as long as you serve me up a delicious Americano and look as cute as the barista did who did it today? You better believe I do not!"
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2013-02-23,3.0,"I took the two-day intensive class here (Milk, Milk 2, Espresso, Espresso 2). It was a very comprehensive eye opener to what coffee, namely espresso, can be, and I was pleasantly surprised at the amazing inventory the shop has. 

However,  I would be remiss in not saying that my instructor had room for improvement. He was very knowledgeable and clearly had enthusiasm for coffee, but I didn't see that through his actions always; it was as if he was just going through the motions. Also, there was one point during the lesson at which we were to pull shots of espresso to adjust the brew ratio to the optimal 65%. The other three students got to pull the shot, yet, due to ""the interest of time"", I could not. This was very off-putting, as it seemed like an important step in the learning process. Also, it takes all of one minute to pull a shot, so I do not understand what the concern on the instructor's part was. It left me feeling bitter and not the good kind of bitterness that usually accompanies espresso. 

Bottom line? I love Joe and their product. I want to continue to. I just expected more from this class."
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2014-11-22,5.0,"For all the coffee lovers out there, be prepared to be schooled because all the coffee you tasted in the city becomes crap after tasting getting a cup here. The usual bitter taste you have after drinking coffee is definitely no more when drinking joe's. This is the best coffee I've ever tasted and made all the other coffee I've grown to love taste like water. It not only has a smooth and silky texture in your mouth but the flavors is unforgettable. You may be thinking, smooth and silky texture for coffee? Yes! You can and you will taste and feel the texture in your entire mouth and throat when you drink this heavenly joy. If only i lived closer, i would definitely buy this everyday but thankfully and yet unfortunately I don't. You haven't lived if you haven't tried Joe's cappuccino, coffee anything here!"
696,joe-coffee-company-pro-shop-new-york,2014-12-05,2.0,"Today I passed by the coffee shop, it looks nice so wanna give it a try. I ordered a hot latte and specifically asked the gentleman to make it extra hot. He said he will make it as hot as they can do. Guess what LUKE WARM! I asked them if they heat it up a bit more and then he said normally we don't do hot coffee cause it will break down the integrity of the milk. I spent $5 for a large cup which it is equivalent to a ""tall"" size of Starbucks cup. It was freeze cold out and all I want is make it hot and they failed to deliver on the simplest thing they can manage, TEMPERATURE. NEVER COME BACK AGAIN. PS if you like Luke warm coffee in cold winter please try them otherwise SKIP."
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2020-02-03,5.0,"The Boba here is Lennon, others are Yoko ONO
Others are Imagine Dragons, this Boba's BONO
Popular with college kids, so watch out for MONO
Don't drink Buffalo water, you'll get HASHIMOTO
Hope it doesn't disappear like brains and the DODO
Hope it doesn't rebrand with a poop in the LOGO
Hope it doesn't start selling hot coffee and COCOA
Hope that when I'm here, I run into Ice's COCO
Hope they let me watch him put his Marco in her POLO
Hope that Trump doesn't try to kill CUOMO

The best Milk Tea in NYC is called COCO!

WHAT!

What to get: Bubble Milk Tea Hot or Cold
What else: Katy Perry did a song called Hot n Cold
What else: Katy Perry is hot but her response to my proposition to her was Cold

A very long time ago I was very fortunate to discover the Wonder of Coco. Great Neck was the very first location I ever tried and I fell madly in love with the bubble tea drinks here. 

I actually think this place was so good, that it was one of the reasons I became obsessed with Bubble Tea in the first place. I've probably had 3,500 of the things since then. But not all from this location. Most, but not all.

This is a wonderful little Coco close to Broadway - officially on Broadway, but the entrance is on 38th. This is a great Coco indeed, and one which I come in to get boba at on a regular basis when in NYC.

It's hard not to love it, with such friendly service and the cool cute green wall, with confy seating - not much of it but I've never not found a table, as of yet - and the milk tea here was absolutely magnificent on each occasion so far, as I expect from Coco, but nevertheless it was, and it didn't taste watered down at all.

So this is one of my favourite Cocos on Manhattan Island, and deserves 5 stars all the way from me, even though there's not a whole lot of places to sit. I still found seating and it wasn't a problem. I love it, so come and see for yourself how good it is.

Now let's finish with a rap.

I know a Boba place that will drive you LOCO
Although it may give you more gas than SUNOCO
And if you buy too many drinks, it may make you a BROKE HO
But you won't mind because you'll love the milk tea at COCO

Almost as delicious as Ice T's COCO
Even more delicious than Sheldon's Kaley CUOCO
Your waistline will hate you like Lennon's fans hated YOKO
But you won't care once you taste the milk tea at COCO

Better than every single Boba place in SOHO
Makes a lot of Boba stores just vanish like a DODO
More popular in NYC than f**king POKEMON GO
Come and get a milk tea of perfection from COCO

They should use me posing with the blue dude as their LOGO
They should open up in Singapore, Taipei and KYOTO
They will make your belly fat bounce around like a YO-YO
But you will not regret the day you tried milk tea at COCO

If you're a Latino then you're want more than POCO
You'll gulp it down faster than the raging ORINOCO
And all your former crushes will say you ""used to be a SMOKESHOW""
But you won't mind your excess weight, your one true love is COCO

You'll spend all your money here and you'll end up a HOBO
You'll stick a flute inside your p**sy, or maybe an OBOE
You'll find out this milk tea is your same gender and turn HOMO
Because there's nothing in the world you wouldn't do for COCO

WHAT"
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2020-05-29,5.0,I love this place so much! It's not always that busy which is good but I usually get a Taro here and it's amazing! I can't wait to try more flavors. The service here is also really fast and the place itself has a good vibe going.
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2019-08-06,4.0,"- Got to try their new bubble tea slush. It was quite interesting!
- They have a few tables and chairs but expect to take your drink to go 
- Sometimes you can sit on the window sill and people watch 
- Good location in midtown"
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2019-08-10,3.0,"This place is okay for boba but it's definitely not my go to in NYC. Service was quick but not the friendliest. FYI there's also no bathroom here.

My sister tried the Berry Lovers drink which was pretty much milk with strawberries and other red berries. I had a sip and thought it was okay but she didn't even finish her drink so I think that says a lot. I think based on that experience I'll stick with milk tea if I go here again or just go elsewhere."
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2019-03-20,3.0,"Average boba place. 

Came in last week and got a taro milk tea. The taro was alright, but not the best taro I've ever had. Not really a place to sit, definitely a stop and go boba spot. They were really efficient but will say the staff weren't the friendliest. 

Could be better, could be worse; a spot to go for a quick run if you're in the area."
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2019-06-30,4.0,"My friend and I first came across this place because of their buy 1 get 1 promotion, which included a mango green tea (I ordered no sugar) and a regular bubble tea (my friend ordered 50% sugar). The mango green tea was AMAZING, really love the light sweetness and the mango flavor tasted fresh. I wasn't sure if they used mango syrup, but it didn't have the thick texture of syrup, so I hope they used real mango. My friend said her bubble tea was good, too. The tea seemed aromatic and not too sweet. The next time I stopped by I ordered a hojicha (again, no sugar) and it wasn't exactly stellar - I wish the hojicha was seeped a bit more - but it was decent regardless.

Their pearls, though, were always consistent. I think drink-wise CoCo might be just decent in comparison to other chains, but their pearls were really good, chewy and lightly sweetened so that even if you don't finish your drink five hours later, the sugar from the pearls won't seep into the drink and make it too sweet. And for me pearls are the most important thing in a bubble tea.

The only reason I'm not visiting this location more often is that it's really small, and doesn't have wifi. I might stop by other locations where I can sit down and get some work done."
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2019-11-03,3.0,"I got the taro tea with bubbles. The bubbles were a little mushy like they'd been sitting around for too long. FYI what they call non dairy milk is really Coffee Mate creamer powder made of corn syrup and a bunch of hydrogenated vegetable oil. I don't mind because it tastes fine, but it's not the healthiest."
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2019-09-24,4.0,"This is my go-to for boba in midtown - it's cheap/fast/convenient and they use quality ingredients. Their prices are much more affordable than Moge Tea, and it's higher quality than Vivi. Keep in mind, I vastly prefer their Cloud (Cream-Top) Teas and Smoothies over their Tea Lattes/Milk Teas (with the exception of Okinawa Black Sugar Latte). I also recommend Coco's fresh-fruit based drinks (e.g. mango green tea, mango slushie) and really like their seasonal Berry Lovers drink."
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2019-08-30,5.0,"I love CoCo bubble tea. Out of all the popular chains, CoCo is my favorite. They have pretty strong tea flavor, not bland or watered down. Their milk tea, fruit tea, slush, and the new tiger sugar tea, they are all excellent. It's really refreshing. This location doesn't have a lot of tables, maybe like 3 tables. It's more like a take out shop. I wish they would open a bit early like coffee shops but they don't open till 10am or so. Bummer!"

697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2019-06-21,4.0,Great flavor and texture of tapioca. The only issue I have is that they don't take phone orders.. I have driven to NYC that day (my mistake)... but I couldn't find legal parking. To save time I wanted to order drinks on the phone but they didn't accept that so I risked my car with hazard lights for bubble tea haha.
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2019-12-03,5.0,The three guys are really good for the winter! Must try it!! Also the shop is very cute

Not stale, not overly chewy, just right. Much better than Gong Cha, which is only a block away.

Pleased that they accommodated my drink selection.  I had asked for strawberry bubble tea which wasn't necessarily on the menu but they made it.  Very refreshing and the flavor was real.  Didn't seem like they had artificial flavors.  The bottom of the cup was full of boba and real pieces of strawberry.

Overall, good."

 I NO RECOMMEND THIS STORE."
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2018-04-16,3.0,"heard about CoCo from a friend and found it on a walk. The tea is pretty decent for NYC and does taste similar to DaYung in Tempe. However, I still like DaYung milk tea better. Customer service is not that great. These kids have monotone of voice and just stare at you without even say hello or greet you."
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2019-01-14,5.0,"Love this place! It is a chain from Japan and tastes just like how it is in Japan!

They squeeze their own grapefruit juice so def try the grapefruit green tea with lychee jelly (if you like grapefruit).

Do try it!"

Pros:
More drinks to choose from and service is friendly. They do accept card and cash. 

Cons: No wifi, no stamp card, cannot adjust sugar level on drinks.

Service is always friendly, it is a good place to sit and catch up with your friends. Prices are reasonable around their area, and they are close to times square."

When I asked if they had oolong tea, they rudely said no. After I made my payment and ordered the drink, they didn't bother to call out my drink. They just put the drink in the desk near the cashier, and I had to figure out which one is my drink based on my receipt number. The drink itself is good, however it's one of the worst customer service experience I've had."

Would not look in the eye and was not helpful with any questions I had with the menu. Not sure if he had a bad day, but if he chose to work in this industry, he could be a little kinder. 

I usually visit Goncha, which is across the street from CoCo. I wanted to give this place a try, but am in total regret. It's pretty crazy how influential service is at a restaurant. Will not be visiting this location again. If I were you, I would do the same. Don't waste your time on a shitty experience - go across the street and get Gongcha. It's better quality and service."

Ordered a hot taro tea and it was disgusting. Not only wasn't it hot, but it wasn't even fully mixed! Just the WORSE. I would suggest going to any other place if you are in the area. Whoever owns this store should have their franchise taken away for giving CoCo such a bad name."

I put in my order and paid. I waited a bit long but decided they were busy. Turned out they got my order wrong, at which the cashier sighed dramatically and I was told I had to pay the extra few cents for taro. She gave me my change without even looking at me and dropped some of it, without even acknowledging it. They need a lesson in customer service."

Try my favorite flavor: Bubble Gaga! It already includes bubbles so make sure you don't order extra (unless you want to!).

- you get a Large bubble tea / boba for 3.50

- you can adjust sweetness levels

- ask for no ice for more intense flavor 
- you can get a Large pudding boba combo for 4.50
- bonus: friendly service 
- bonus: small seating and quiet

You go to caffe bebe, a large which is really almost a small here is almost 6$!
That alone wins me over. For the price of 1 ""large"", I can almost get 2 actual large here (almost 3 small (aka medium) ones!!!)

My opinion though, but just on price alone this is the place for me. I go here more than I Starbucks because of that too (other than the occasional PSL or s'mores) and it tastes amazing."
697,coco-fresh-tea-and-juice-new-york-12,2017-03-27,4.0,"Glad to have found a CoCo in the Midtown area. This CoCo is conveniently located between Herald Square/K-Town and Bryant Park. I'm always able to stop in and catch up with friends and satisfy my bubble tea cravings. They have a small and quiet seating area with three tables. 

One huge pro is that this location takes credit card (since I almost never have cash on me)! They also allow you to adjust your sugar level (though sometimes I find it can be inconsistent, probably depends on who makes it) and the amount of ice. I tend to get my drinks cold without ice so that the tea flavors are more potent."

We found a great little coffee shop with an excellent dark roast  coffee to staart my morning and  a wonderful fruit smoothie for my daughter. I also found a dairy-free, paleo friendly banana choc chhip muffin was amazing!! We downloaded the appo, as you get a small credit if you mobile order! On our adventures in NYC, we will definitely be returning to Gregory's Coffee ship - the staff was friendly and patient as I asked questions. They were smiliing and having a good time! Way to welcome us to NYC!"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2020-02-29,1.0,"Bad muffin: dry, burnt, flavorless, gross. 
Also, rudeness abounds from the staff.  Also, mediocre coffee.  Lattes shouldn't be at room temperature. Also, no bathroom. Seriously? You sell food and beverages.  You need a bathroom.  

Also, really rude."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2020-02-11,2.0,"Rude staff the brioch breakfast sandwich was very processed and nothing more than a Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwich type. 

Dirty condiment area. Exactly set up as a Starbucks"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2020-05-17,4.0,It's great to have another option for decent coffee! They just reopened this week. Definitely need to support them!
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-11-25,3.0,"I've been to Gregorys a bunch of times. Their coffee is always good and I like trying out their more unique beverages. Today, I came in to try the spicy avo toast and I was pretty disappointed. From the description and photo, it looks so fresh and filling, but in person it was pretty lackluster. The bread was hard and tasted stale and they provided a very thin layer of avocado on top. I also got a poached egg on top, but was really disappointed because it was more of a soft boiled egg (which I don't like in general). The toasts are definitely not worth the money."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2020-01-16,4.0,"Coffee was GREAT! They burnt my New Yorker breakfast sandwich. Who cares, it was still decent food and I was starved. My first stop in the Big Apple! I was just jazzed to be in the center of the Universe!!"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-05-08,3.0,"Coffee is okay so I gave it 3 Stars. Baked goods are decent and seem wholesome. I tried a few, not bad.

Coat hanging hooks would be great.
No Stevie sweetener just Splenda.
Could use some nore seats in the front.


Clean place. Staff are professional. Open till 8pm."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-02-17,5.0,Big and spacious cafe. Very clean and yes it is expensive. The workers are friendly and they have coffees and juices. The only thing I wish is if they had restrooms cuz the place is huge and drinking coffee and juice makes you wanna go to the restroom.
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-02-17,4.0,"Probably the best coffee I've had for a chain. Usually chains get really commercial and the quality goes down, but it's good here. 

All the staff are trained to make good espresso and they froth their milk well. 

I'm a ""Gregular"" here and I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a good cup of
joe."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2018-08-03,4.0,"Ive been on an iced chai hunt all over the city and decided to stop into Gregory's! As soon as I walked in I loved the decor.. very clean and more spacious than I thought. I was greeted as soon as I walked in.

Everyone was friendly. Now as for my order I had an iced chai with caramel. I do not like my chai only because I like a more subtle taste and the chai is really strong in this drink. Also I barely taste any caramel I paid .65 extra for. 


Price wise it's a little expensive. Comparable to Starbucks but for the same price I can get a venti which is bigger than Gregorys large. 

For ambience, cleanliness and friendliness I'll give it a 4.


Might return to try something else."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2018-06-14,5.0,"Gregory does coffee right! Best coffee in NYC for sure 
Really the best coffee I've had outside of Italy 
The service is a little slow and the egg white spinach sandwich sucks a lot but the coffee is Amazing!
I really wished we had Gregory's in Florida 
White Chocolate Mocha and Latte are my go to's"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-08-09,3.0,"I stopped by for a quick to-go drink and opted for the cold brew. It was a little too bitter and sour for my preference. However, I would definitely give this cafe another try. The staff were nice and provided fast service. The cafe was well-kept and clean."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-08-04,5.0,"We are visiting New York and went to Gregory's for breakfast. The coffee was excellent and the barista surprised me by giving me a 16 oz after someone else had accidentally taken my 12 oz drink. He was so polite and subtle about it that it left me smiling. My teenage daughters had hit chocolate and a smoothie and both were happy with their drinks.

The food was the best part. The open faced toasts are amazing. I had the almond butter with strawberries and chia seeds. It was excellent. One daughter had the ricotta with olive oil and honey on toast and really liked it. The toast is sliced thick and tastes homemade. The breakfast sandwich my other daughter got had fresh bacon and was a nice size. We are going back tomorrow!!"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-05-21,4.0,"My partner's brother found this coffee shop because it was close to his place of work.  This place is a chain apparently.  We got there and ordered our drinks.  I got the matcha drink, which was matcha and almond milk mixed together.  I also bought a cookie for my partner and a chai whole wheat donut.  The donut was interesting.  It  had a very dense texture, almost like bread.  It wasn't as sweet as a donut but it was definitely different."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2018-10-12,4.0,"Once upon a time I was a regular at Gregory's Coffee near Port Authority Bus Terminal when the chain was in its youth.  Work took me away from the chain, unfortunately.   Since then the chain has grown into a robust set of stores all over Manhattan.   This is a branch I had not gone to (but I do not know how long it has been open) so I jumped on the chance to check it out.

One thing I have always loved about the decor in Gregory's is its mixture of bold colors and designs.  Black panels here and there contrast nicely with wood.  The lighting is warm and inviting but bright.  Everything is laid out in a comfortable way so you are not running into other people as you try to get your order in.

One of the best memories I have of Gregory's is how well trained the staff is.  They are always courteous and on point with customers, and this branch was no exception.  I ordered an iced dirty chai and it was made quickly and the flavor was spot on.  I also appreciate that they did not add so much ice that I wound up with mostly a cup of ice with half a cup of chai in it.

One star off for not having a rest room (unless I totally missed it) but otherwise this is totally worth a visit!"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-04-10,5.0,Love their cold brew decaf. Idk what it is but its delicious. I'm so glad I stumbled into this place. There was a slice of bread I taste here with some almond peanut butter yuck! Never again.
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2018-04-22,4.0,"Visit Date: April 7, 2018

I stopped at Gregory's Coffee while walking back to Penn Station to go home after seeing Phantom of the Opera for the 70th time. I wanted a cup of coffee and although I don't mind Starbucks I choose to support independent or different coffee shops over Starbucks if I can. 

I ordered my new standard drink that I had to play around with discovering since going on a healthy eating plan which is an Americano with almond milk or half & half. I also bought beans to take home. 

I bought a bottle of water but I was pleased to know they offered free lemon water in the store as well. I try my best to stay hydrated so even though I bought a bottle of water I filled up my personal water bottle with lemon water too and drank a cup down while I was waiting for my Americano. 

My drink was good. Unless it's made too strong it's hard to mess up an americano (unless you're dunkin donuts) or you're me preparing coffee at home on an off day. 

The reason for my four stars is just for preference purposes I wasn't super happy with the beans I bought home. They had hints of green apple which I wasn't a personal fan of and it didn't mix well with half and half at home with me. 

Overall I was happy with Gregory's Coffee and would suggest popping into one of their stores if you're in Manhattan."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-12-06,2.0,"Excellent coffee and the barista with dreadlocks is the coffee genius.  Made my cappuccino perfectly and he's very professional and nice. BUT, there is NO bathroom at this location despite seats galore and the music is SO LOUD, you can barely have a conversation when seating in the back... Forget about reading anything.  It's like being in a club when seating under the speaker.  Please lower the music!!! And guide us to an available bathroom!"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-04-23,4.0,Probably one of the third wave coffee shops that have gone commercial and still able to maintain good quality. Interior is nice and there is ample seating for studiers and workers. I got the cold brew which was refreshing and delicious. Location definitely needs a bathroom though.
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2017-10-29,4.0,"Nice coffee - very different flavor to their roasted beans. Not bitter, not sweet, but flavorful and strong. It took me 6 cold NYC blocks of walking before my drip was cool enough to sip. 

This is a localish chain and obviously very popular. I'd love to come back and try more of their coffee combos but no complaints for the regular cup I savored all morning."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2018-05-27,2.0,"I ordered an almond cappuccino.The prices here are definitely on the upper end. It came up to $5.36 for a small cup. On top of that the servers aren't the most enthusiastic and don't seem to prepare the coffee with any love , and it took about 10 minutes to make the cappuccino with only one other person there. The lady put her fingers inside the cup to pick it up, which for $5.36 I wasn't too pleased about. The coffee itself is good, quite similar to Starbucks. They also offer a decent selection of pastries and there is enough room to work at this location. However the price is not worth the service or the coffee."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-12-30,4.0,Friendly staff and delicious cappuccino! Great place to hide from the cold! Good work guys!
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2020-01-06,1.0,"The cashier overcharged me, rang up the wrong drink, but said she couldn't fix it.  She said I needed to put in a support ticket on the Gregory's website.  2 weeks and 3 emails later, no one has responded.  The support email seems to be a dead end for getting help.  Be cautious when ordering at this location.  Culture Espresso around the corner is a better option."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2018-11-11,3.0,I've heard great talks and rad reviews about this place and decided to give it a try after church and was amazed by the several options offered besides just coffee. They have flavorful smoothies and spiked lattes that I voided my favorite CBD oil! Which I was not aware was in NYC. I frequently travel to California where CBD is a huge trend! And was surprised to see it here in NYC at a coffee shoo. I will continue to visit Gregory's Coffee shop after today
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2018-03-30,4.0,Didn't want  sbux or 711 so decided to try Gregory's not realizing it is a chain. I LOVE honey in my coffee so I was thrilled with my Honey Badger ( cold brew pre-mixed with almond milk and honey) and the almond butter cranberry coconut bite I got was delicious. Neither was overly sweet. My kids got the brownie (so fudgey was the report) and the chocolate cookie (soft and chewy). $14 for a large cold brew and three treats...not too bad in Madhatties. Would def visit again.
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-05-14,4.0,"Really good latte! I got a caramel latte and it was super smooth. I got a Lemon Poppy pound cake as well, which was okay. It didn't taste too much like lemon which threw me off a little bit. Otherwise, great spot for a quick coffee fix!"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2018-09-04,1.0,"It's a coffee shop with out a bathroom. Paying customer. Need I say anything more? oh, I do? Coffee is a diuretic.  This is New York City.... so you're telling me i'm supposed to buy coffee and then go somewhere else to handle my unavoidable immediate business? pleasee go F*** yourself. First time going to the Gregory chain... what do you think the chances are i'm going to choose gregory again?

Cheers to the corporate genius who thought this up."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-12-19,2.0,I'm giving two stars because the Snickers latte was fantastic. The minus three stars is for the two girls at the front. The one who took our drink order was rude. My friend wanted to buy a t-shirt asked her how much it was. The girl looked at her weird and then my friend asked again. The only thing she did was point at the shirt. My friend told her she knows where they are but how much. She shrug her shoulders a told my friend to ask the girl at the register. She said they didn't sell shirts when she asked the register girl. We told her there are tshirts right over on the wall.  The register girl said for her to go grab one then if she wanted it. My friend had to ask again that she knew where the shirts were but how much were they. The register girl had no clue and they stood there and pondered for a second until they figured it out. The amount of attitude and rudeness was crazy. We were looking forward to trying Gregory's before we left because we saw it everywhere. We'll try a different location next time we visit.
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-09-26,1.0,"This place was not organized today. I came here mid morning and ordered a tea and a coffee. After waiting an awfully long time, I check with the cashier and barista. The barista had no idea about my order. No idea were the ball was dropped. This just makes a case for mobile ordering instead of going to the cashier."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2016-08-09,4.0,"Great almond lattes! They use nice barista almond milk and not almond breeze/ silk. The service is always good and fast (but it is never too crowded when I go around 730am). They also have a bunch of pastries, including 1 vegan option (fruit & nut bar). There is also water out for you to drink and you don't have to ask for a water cup.

There is a Gregory coffee app so I would download that! You can earn rewards and just pay on your phone. 

I love the cocoa they provide to add to coffee- it is a dark cocoa powder that is delicious with cinnamon! 

Nothing much to say but a pretty solid cafe here."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2017-05-30,4.0,"Super cute coffee shop (their logo won me over). This was probably the most expensive latte I've ever paid for....$7 for an iced vanilla soy latte. Was the price worth it? Hell yeah! Easily the best vanilla soy latte I've ever had. It was creamy but strong at the same time. Not too overly sweet either. Probably one of the best coffee shops I've ever tried in the NYC. I am honestly glad they don't have one in Boston because I cannot afford $7 lattes every day, but will be yearning to go haha. BUT YES please open one up in Boston to feed my vanilla soy latte addiction!"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-03-28,2.0,"It is far too small for the amount of people it has to accommodate, so there's never a place to sit. They have very few decaf choices. I do go there and the non decaf is often pretty good.
But I will not go there again. Now that I realize it's a chain, I'm wondering why they can't be a little more woke and use plastic straws, have recycling receptacles and, if you're getting your beverage to stay, why not serve the customer in a non-plastic container? To me, that's reason enough in itself not to patronize a place. I mean, come on. Small adjustments for a big payoff. The garbage receptacles are brimming over with plastic, and since this is a big, corporate chain, they couldn't invest a tiny bit of money in civic responsibility and the environment? I guess not."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-09-22,4.0,Had the Hall and Oates iced and it was a little overpowering straight but once I doctored it up it went down smooth
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2018-02-25,5.0,Great coffee experience if you're in the mood for a Starbucks alternative. Great selection of patties and coffees to choose from. Terrific baristas and vibe for this emerging coffee franchise.
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2017-06-21,2.0,"I love their coffee and and friendly staff but the baked goods are awful! Today and yesterday I experienced some of the worst dried baked goods in a long time: glazed donut, apple fritter and cinnamon blow out.  All three were let downs :(

In the future, I might head over to Paris Baguette - they have iced coffee as well but at least their bakery doesn't suck!"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2018-11-22,3.0,No bathroom. That is all. Oh and awesome turmeric latte and yummy other things BUT no bathroom. What in the twilight zone???
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2017-04-25,4.0,"Simple, clean floor plan with friendly staff. Very earthly vibe in my opinion. Latte had a wonderful buttery taste to it and the pastries were mouth watering. Indulged on a glazed donut, consistency of a biscuit and a cake. Yum!"
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2017-01-01,3.0,Great coffee and hot chocolate.  The service is professional and the facility is spacious.  I am so glad a shop like this popped up in my building.  It beats walking to grab a cup of joe when my mind demands one from all them late nights at the office.
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-01-20,1.0,"Only two people working here at 8:30 am. Place is packed with people waiting. Took me 20 minutes to get a Cafe Americano!  I don't care how good the coffee is. I have never seen anything like it. Workers obviously don't give a s**t. Avoid. 

Update:  After having to ask numerous times for my coffee and being brushed off (along with other disgruntled customers), I rushed out and down the street to a meeting I was late for, only to find that my Americano was black. I had asked for steamed heavy cream. No time to go back. Amazingly bad experience. And the donuts are stale. Again, avoid this place."
698,gregorys-coffee-new-york-20,2019-05-19,3.0,This coffee really isn't good. I also had banana bread which tasted like they forgot the bananas. I'm surprised to see how many locations they have in NYC.
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-12-27,5.0,"$2 for everything. 
I got a slice of banana walnut bread, walked out the door for $2 + tax.  
And it was pretty good."
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-12-16,5.0,"Everything here is $2. Great pastries and coffee/espresso options. I had a mocha with oat milk that was yummy and my boyfriend got some sort of coconut and chocolate bar that also was good. 

Not a ton of seating but there are about 5 small (2 people) tables if you can snag one. Friendly staff. Definitely recommend!"
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-10-01,4.0,"$2 coffee and $2 for the tea, middle or medium size, can't beat those kinds of prices in NY. My husband said the coffee would be about $3.50 back at home. The mint tea was decent as well. 

It's a small footprint but doesn't need to be bigger, it's mostly a carry out spot. 

The cups and prep area is by the window in the front. It's narrow and can get congested quick but orders come out quickly."
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-08-22,4.0,"Wow, how many Mattos will I find ?

It looks like every other day I bump into another one.

Their cafe has a logo sign that looks just like the zero Tarot card , the FOOL card, Matto is Crazy in Italian I guess that's what the owner was told when he came up with the $2 for everything idea. 

They got your usual list of espresso coffee and then some I rarely see, a 'Red Eye'  which is espresso mix with  an other coffee  like drip and a Cortado which should be boiled milk and espresso and not foamy.   

They have a decent number of muffins , cakes, cookies that are good for $2 and so was the coffee I had , but I do Starbucks Venti these days so I had to get another coffee after I got to the office because the coffee cups are small.

I was impressed with Matto and $2 doesn't mean you get cheap and tasteless."
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-10-23,5.0,"All drink and food items are $2 dollars. I always get their cappuccino and snacks. Their chocolate browning is good. They also have muffins, sandwiches, cake, and much much more goodies. Services and staff are fast and friendly.  All bakeries are fresh and usually, some items are sold out by the afternoon. Get a Matto card, you get 2 dollars extra every time you refill 20 dollars."
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2020-01-28,5.0,Just know... that's everything is $2.00 at this cafe... it does NOT get better than that lol. Coffee is always on point. I order breakfast from this spot every morning. They always have new pastries and little snacks.
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-11-06,3.0,"They have a certificate in the window for being 
Kosher, but they are NOT

*****This Place is Not Kosher.****+
They are 100% vegan."
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-05-29,5.0,"My company's ban on paper cups led me to drink - drink outside coffee that is. Starbucks is a religion to me but the lines can feel like the devil's work. Matto served up a delightful $2 cortado, briskly. Is everything really $2?!!"
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-05-16,3.0,"I ordered Matto for pickup through ritual as it's close to my office. It was intriguing as I never thought I would see $2 coffee drinks in NYC, much less anywhere else. I ordered a 16oz iced cappuccino with almond milk. $2 for 16oz is a wild concept; I've been ordering $6 8oz drinks for years. I made my way over once I got the notification that my drink was ready. 

My drink was ready very quickly, and I picked it up with no problem. I really thought it was too good to be true and I was right. I could immediately tell from the first lukewarm sip that it was not almond milk. While it's only a taste issue for me, this mistake would not fly with those that are lactose intolerant or with vegans. 

I will give this place a another chance however and hope that this was just a one time issue."
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-11-21,5.0,"One of the busiest Mattos I've been to, regardless of this the service is fast and efficient and the pastry display is well stocked.
The staff is polite and the coffee was exactly as good as expected.
Plus: they have seating available."
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2018-09-05,3.0,"I was planning on going to a coffee/breakfast place closer to my conference venue, but the $2 everything sign drew me in and got the best of my curiosity! 

Solid breakfast place in NYC. Nothing fancy, but for $2 everything, what do you expect? 

Service is subpar. Not friendly or warm or welcoming at all. 2 star service. 

My latte was good but they put in so much ice! 4 Star latte, 3 stars for all the ice. 

I tried the healthy focaccia and I loved the olives! 4 stars. 

I would be back, of course--what a steal!"

Always greeted by smiling friendly staff and skillful barista.  The taste buds are just satisfied by those yummy bites to complete it all."
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-07-02,4.0,"An amazing place to get coffee and snack in this neighborhood. Why? Because everything is $2! I had a latte and a bourek and both were amazing. Plus, the staff is super friendly (they definitely know their regulars), fast and efficient. The space is also quite nice with a small amount of seating and wi-fi if you have work to do!"
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2018-02-20,3.0,"4 stars for the baked goods - really buttery alfajores and a not-too-sweet (but too bread-y) dulce de leche donut.

Everything is literally $2 - so a plus on price.

1 star for the REALLY AWFUL service. Why would you ever hire someone with such bad attitude to be in a service role? If someone asks a valid question, don't try treating them like they're dumb (i.e. Showing your own ignorance).

Also, they should be better trained / educated on the baked goods they sell - some people could be allergic to certain ingredients and die from a mistake of ignorance."
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-07-18,5.0,"This place is so amazing. Love the lattes here. I've tried a few of their food items as well (to meet the $4 card minimum) and they are all surprisingly good and taste like they've been made with high-quality ingredients. 

Love the egg croissant sandwich and the truffle brownie. 

I'm so happy more of these are opening around the city."
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-05-23,5.0,"This place is great. The other day I got an oat latte that with tip cost me $7 at another cafe and I've been walking around with that shame for a few days. 

Matto let me redeem myself. $2 latte was really good and the service was quick and friendly!"
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2019-03-18,5.0,"I LOVE this place! Their soy lattes are delicious and they offer a variety of breakfast and lunch treats, all at reasonable prices. The line in the morning is long but the wait isn't bad because they're super quick at the register. 

This is baked goods heaven: croissants, muffins, cookies, brownies and lemon squares are all super yummy and well priced. GO!"
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2017-09-21,5.0,"Why 5 stars? EVERYTHING IS $2!!! EVERYTHING!! ESPRESSO $2 LATTE $2 MACCHIATO $2 AND ITS NOT BAD AT ALL. 

Here we are paying close to $6 for coffee at starbucks while this place uses a really good machine great coffee and there doing it for much less. The brownie was awesome and was also $2. The girls that work here are super nice and pretty and really try to help the customer in explaining anything if they have questions. They keep the inside very clean and modern.

Great value, great staff, great coffee! I wish this was closer to my house. If you are not into coffee they have bottled mint tea and black tea for $2!

I will be back this place is the BOMB!"
699,matto-espresso-new-york-16,2018-08-01,4.0,Making coffee great again!  Where else can you get any coffee or pastry for $2 each. This place is great. I had a large iced coffee. You can't find that at other coffee places. I'm going back every day.

This is the only place in NYC where you can get every cafe item for $2 with actual good quality. I have gotten the cappuccino and their potato boreka which is large and tastes so delicious. They even had a cinnamon shaker to flavor your coffee. I wish there were more locations around the city!

I work nearby but still two avenues away, so I never noticed this place until a friend who works closer to 2nd ave told me about it. Took a detour on my way to work this morning just to try out the ""everything $2"" wonder - Yes, this is no joking, no strings attached, great pastries and nice coffee.

I was so surprised about the variety they have on pastries. They have everything you can find in Starbucks, plus some special ones such as a pistachio muffin (I know!), also some healthy options like an egg and avocado sandwich. Again can you believe that's just $2? In midtown?

Also, bring very picky about coffee, this place definitely shows up more than up to par. I usually go to Gregory's/ blue bottle/Fika for coffee, and Matto does not fall short compared to these other brands. Although, I do want to point out Matto's coffee is more of a bold brew with very low acidity. I usually prefer fruity coffee brews, but Matto's is still balanced enough for me. 

All in all, I'm coming back soon and more! Will take pics next time when I have the"

I got the americano and the coffee cake. The coffee tasted a little burnt, but I wasn't too surprised, since you truly do get what you pay for. But, the coffee cake was really good! Looking forward to trying all the other pastries!"

I love their teas, coffees and Italian hot chocolate, It's so rich and creamy. Their menu is all vegetarian / vegan and everything I've had so far is delicious!! The muffins are amazing. The mini quiches are so tasty and I love their desserts. They have a unique array of breakfast, lunch and healthy snack foods. This is a ""must try"" place!! 
The staff is equally amazing. Every single person is greeted with a genuine""Good Morning""! The line never seems to end and the staff keeps up with the pace with ease and a smile.

You don't have to spend $6 on a cup of coffee or a tea. You don't have to spend $16 on a breakfast.

They also have yogurt cups, mini smoothies, sandwiches, and all coffee beverages for $2. You can't beat their prices. Staff is fantastic! I work on 47th St so I come here at least once a week."

The food and coffee isn't AMAZING BUT it is not terrible at all!! They also offer those ""fancier"" drinks such as cortados, lattes, etc. Selection of muffins, croissants, sandwiches, etc. that they will also toast for you. Service is super quick as there have always been at least 2-3 people behind the counter when I go and they're pretty friendly too. 

If you're looking for a coffee to wake you up and something sweet without breaking your wallet, this is the place.

Only thing is: bring cash! $4 minimum for card."

There is an identical Espresso Matto further on 46th. They offer the same options :)

I was a little hesitant because this cafe costs about half what others in Midtown East will offer. That being said, they do offer a lot. They have espresso machines, frozen hot chocolate, 3 types of iced tea, 4 organic juices, 1 smoothie, hot and iced coffee, and cold brew. 
 
In the snack department, they offer nuts, oatmeal, Belgian waffles, burekas, croissants, coffee cake and sweets. There are also a variety of small deli sandwiches. 

I ordered a frozen hot chocolate with chocolate croissant. Total was $4.36 and I paid with my credit card. There is plenty of nice seating in the A/C. They even warmed up my croissant for me!

They use Bristot coffee, and offer small and large for their hot drinks. Both are still only $2. The person in line ahead ordered a delicious iced latte (single) - only $2. On my way out, I ordered an iced tea - I couldn't help myself.

The two ladies at the counter were sweet and helpful - had no issue with me taking pictures :) ps: all their dairy products have been approved kosher. They have a refrigerated section with Pelligrino etc -also $2.

Will return, for sure!"

Also everything is $2. And please take that very literally. I spilled my coffee because of course it was filled to the very top. I asked for a cup to transfer my coffee to because my cup was sticky. I was told if I wanted another coffee cup I needed to pay ..... YOU GUESSED IT $2! 

I haven't tried all of the pastries but from experience I'd say stay clear of anything with avocado in it. It is simply not fresh. The smoked salmon mini bagel is very good so I'd recommend that."

Disclaimer: my rating has change due to how my time there ended. 

Wasn't initially my destination when my friend picked me up from work. He was in the mood for ice cream so we head to Korea Way Bear 34th Street. We were heading to a specific location but when we got there the line was very long. 

So we headed back because he had seen something he liked along the way. To my surprise it was Caffe Bene Korea Town. I was more than ecstatic when realizing it was one of my favorite café place to go to but with a twist. When we got there we were overwhelmed with choices. I knew I want this great called the snowflake, which was a monster of a dessert when I got it. It was shaved ice with fresh mango, and scoop or mango sorbet at the top. It was really delicious but so hard to finish.  He got a simple smoothie. 

We sat for a while eating and talking. I check the time to see what time they close. On yelp it said 1am. However around 11:30 one of the associate let us know they will be closing in 30mins. Which was fine I mean I didn't want to be there all night. I just was having a good time talking. 

Before leaving I went to go use the bathroom. Someone else was in the next stall. When I came out to wash my hand, one of the associates came out from using the stall. What I saw next made me feel uncomfortable. She walked right out without washing her hands. That made me very uncomfortable. Working with food is one of those things hygiene really matters. Especially when serving the public. I was kinda bothered by this. 

It's important especially right now with everything going on. That everyone is doing their due diligence to stay clean and healthy. Like they say cleanliness is next to Godliness."
700,caffe-bene-new-york-37,2020-02-27,3.0,"I wish the bacon were more crispy. I ordered their avocado toast with bacon and tomato which comes with a little side of salad. After tax it comes out to be $10 and some change which isn't too bad for the price I guess. 

I tried both their red velvet and black sesame latte which both have no caffeine. If you want something more sweeter go for their red velvet. I couldn't really taste the black sesame in the latte. 

They should upgrade their chairs because you can tell how used and old some chairs are."
700,caffe-bene-new-york-37,2020-02-17,3.0,"Came here for several times. Always very crowded during night time. They close around 00:00. And not very clean.

Good place for people to chat and drop by."

Ordered some cake from the case and got it to go. The lady wasn't that happy but still, it was a nice place to visit and check out. Tables and places to sit are available. 

They have different menu options for drinks, cakes, desserts so look around and see what you want before you get to the cashier lady."

 Upstairs and downstairs. Restrooms. Varieties of sandwiches, macaroons and ice creams"

700,caffe-bene-new-york-37,2020-01-27,2.0,"I've never had any negative or positive feelings toward Caffe Bene until a very recent incident. Probably in my lifetime, I've come to this cafe bene more times than I can count. 

I personally don't really believe in hanging out at a cafe without buying anything. It makes me feel like I am loitering, so I do my best to always buy something small. 

However, on my most recent trip to Ktown, I was looking for a quiet place to take a pretty important call. I went to cafe bene, which had all of 4 people max in the cafe at the time and walked around the cafe trying to find somewhere quiet away from the speakers (as the music was quiet loud). I brought in an unlabeled coffee from another cafe - but again, I had planned to buy something after getting situated. Not after 2 minutes of being at the cafe, the manager (I assume) rudely came up to me and pressured me to buy something. Again, I was planning on purchasing something but not even having been at the cafe for very long, I felt extremely pressured. He spoke to me in a really abrasive tone that left me feeling unwelcome, so I decided to leave. I TRULY would have bought something, but the abruptness and pressure he put on me to buy something after just coming into the cafe left me feeling so turned off by the whole situation. I understand if it was very busy there and I was taking up space for customers in this short period of time, but again, cafe bene had all of 4 people max at the time. 

Perhaps they are not doing well and the manager had no choice but to put that kind of pressure on customers, regardless I felt extremely weird about the whole situation.

Overall, I think cafe bene is a chill spot to hang with your friends since it is a big space. They have lots of bakery goods, drinks, and desserts. However, personally after this incident, I will probably not be returning. Also no one really ever wipes the tables here."
700,caffe-bene-new-york-37,2019-10-06,1.0,"WARNING: this cafe bene charges a 4% convenience fee if you pay with credit card BUT only accepts credit cards for payment. 

Also mediocre food and drinks. No wonder they went BANKRUPT in Korea and basically all of the U.S.

Try GRACE STREET instead."
700,caffe-bene-new-york-37,2019-12-04,1.0,"Their desserts remain tasting good but their service, bathroom and seating have all gone further downhill! Their seats are ripped, and their bathroom is almost always dirty and disgusting. One of the stalls is always clogged and overflowing with toilet paper. Their customer service is still the same. It's always pretty crowded but that's a given due to their location. It's not a bad place if you're just stopping in to pick up some coffee or sweet treats, but I personally have stopped sitting down to stay."
700,caffe-bene-new-york-37,2019-03-14,3.0,"Where has this Caffe Bene all my life?

In Korea apparently.

Very popular Korean chain which actually makes pretty good products. Definitely some kind of an anglicized chain in some ways, but very popular on both sides of the Pacific. I could make a Korea out of using the word Anglicized.

This location is right in the heart of Manhattan in Koreatown so it gets extremely busy and that's why they have so many pictures and reviews. I've been here twice and there will probably be a third time.

I think it's pretty good even though the service can be a little hurried and abrasive - especially when it's busy. A little overpriced but still a good chain and underrated and an integral part of any Koreatown really."

700,caffe-bene-new-york-37,2020-02-07,1.0,"This place has two things going against it
1. Insanitary food prep. We ordered two snowflake ices. One matcha and one mango. The blonde hair woman prepping the ice used the same glove to portion out and smooth the bing soo while grabbing dirty handles, dishes, sink and faucet handles and wipes the glove on her pants. She then proceeded to smooth out the second order all without changing gloves.  She repeated this process for the second snowflake ice.  When confronted about ServSafe certification and sanitary guidelines she was more than unhappy 

2. The entire team is understaffed and needs more staff. They are overworked and sloppy. There is no sense of service. Just cold attitudes. they don't care about service. they just care about your cash."
700,caffe-bene-new-york-37,2019-11-19,3.0,"Possibly the only Caffe Bene left in New York City located right in KTown. I was so excited to get the Thai Bubble Tea that I've been craving since the one in Fresh Meadows by me closed down. It did not meet my expectations. The drink was too sweet and the quality just went down. And the large size for $7+ is just not worth it. They didn't even serve it in cups with Caffe Bene logos on it. I would possibly like to come back to see if the misugaru cranberry almond drink is still good though. Other than that, the store looks pretty organized and spacious, a good place for studying."
700,caffe-bene-new-york-37,2019-08-22,3.0,"I come here a lot when I'm in Ktown since I know there is plenty of seating, wifi and bathrooms here. This is not the best cafe for working, the music and people are very loud, the wifi is slow/unreliable and the prices aren't super affordable. However, there aren't a whole lot of better options in the area, so I come here to work because I am familiar with the place and it's close to all the good restaurants.
The drinks here are so-so, nothing that will blow your mind. One thing that stands out here is the snack options, ranging from macarons to pastries to rice balls, you can even have a whole meal here if you so desire. The pastries that I've tried have been good, although once again not the best I've had.
Something that I discovered on my most resent trip here is the fact that they charge a 4% convenience fee if you use a credit card. I looked and nowhere does it say on the counter that they are doing this, you will just have to keep your eyes out to notice. And paying cash to avoid the fee wasn't an option, as the cash register stated ""card only"". This seemed like such a sneaky way to cheat money from customers, majority of whom probably wouldn't pay attention to the receipt. If they have fees, then at the very least state it clearly before customers pay, and allow the option to pay cash."

It is a spacious cafe (you can't really tell from the outside looking in) and have an assortment of coffees and desserts (pat bing soo, cakes, tarts, ice cream, etc.)

It's one of the busier Caffe Bene locations, given its location, so be prepared to wait in line with tourists. If you want a bit more space for yourself then head upstairs where there will be less tourists but more students who are at the cafe to use the WiFi to study."

Now I see why there was ample seating.  Pastry rating based on trying- Brownie, Apple Turnover, Danish.  Should've known from the sloppy and mangled packaging.  
Also, need to work on a better system for the diaorganized line to the cashier.  Don't waste your money here unless it's the very last resort for ice coffee and somewhere to sit down.. if you want to sit on worn down furniture.
A pure disappointment and embarrassing representation of Korean pastry/cafe."

The banana bread was decent. It was a little dried out since it was the end of the night. It was also a little pricey. I was in and out pretty fast. When I'm in koreatown again, I might stop by and try the other desserts."

BUT their tunisian sandwich is what surprised me. I read about it online and had to try it out for myself. The tuna mixed with the flavors of the egg and tomatoes made for a surprisingly great sandwich that had a variety of flavors. If you're in the mood for a tuna sandwich or something sweet, I'd highly recommend the tunisian and the chocolate babka at Breads bakery."

It's a small kiosk in front of Bryant park. 
I enjoyed their breads and the girls there were very nice.
When I went there they didn't have slices of chocolate babka so I decided to buy a big one. I asked the girl if she can cut one slice and warm up the slice for me and she didn't even hesitate to do that for me. We stayed at hotel so it was very helpful.

I wish I lived in nyc so I can come here often."

The place reminds me of more of a french bakery than jewish one... which was the first warning sign. I'm guessing because it is israeli it has more of a ""refined"" / fancy european flair (as opposed to eastern europe, where babka originated). The babka itself is a bit dry/not chocolately/rich enough.
Go to Oneg Bakery in Brooklyn if you're willing to make the trek instead"

Nice baristas and quick service!

I resisted this morning, but the chocolate babka is definitely one of the best in nyc. So decadent and gooey. You can grab a slice here, $5,or a whole loaf, $15. It's a great treat to bring to the office or bring back as an NY souvenir."
701,breads-bakery-new-york-13,2018-04-30,5.0,"I came here for the chocolate babka that I've heard people talk about and it did not disappoint. The bakery has a nice selection of various breads and pastries and a few places to sit and enjoy.

We got the chocolate babka, feta bureka, and pain au chocolat.
The chocolate babka was worth the trip here. The bread has a nice bouncy and yeasty texture. The babka comes at room temperature with a crisp top layer and moist inners. It's packed full of chocolate and tastes heavenly when you warm it up.
The pain au chocolat was lovely. It was buttery and flakey with a phyllo-type pastry. The chocolate was spread evenly through out the bread--so you don't end up with a glob of chocolate in the center. 
The feta bureka was also delicious and flakey. It wasn't dry (considering we actually saved this for the next day) and the sesame on top complemented it nicely. The feta itself was very good and the salt levels were just right for the pastry.

The only issue I had with this place was the cashier--and it was more of an annoyance. When the cashier asked us what we got, she seemed to have a hard time understanding what we were saying--as if she didn't know what the shop actually sells. The only thing clear to her was the babka, we had to repeat the other two items multiple times and with different translations and/or descriptions for her to understand.

Overall, this is a great bakery with amazing breads and pastries! Would definitely recommend coming here for a bite and walking over to Union Square Park to eat--a perfect way to spend a lazy Sunday!"

It was wonderful, inexpensive and I didn't feel too tooo unhealthy eating it!"

  It was a rather thin sandich, wrapped in plastic. When you open it most of the fillings of tuna and more just fall out all over the place. Tunisian sauces can be quite spicy and hot but this was toned down so low it was suitable for mid America.  Dont get it. It was close to $10 and no way worth it."

The workers are nice but a bit awkward when it comes to customer service. Made me feel like I didn't want to stay. 

I finally got to try the famous chocolate babka that's apparently the best in NYC. I picked up a slice ($5) which was prebagged and I ended up with the unlucky hard end piece. Fine anyway.. 

It was extremely heavy, rich, sticky, sweet and messy to eat. I couldn't handle the decadent chocolate swirls and it overpowered the bread part. That one slice fill me up enough to run 5 miles. A whole loaf can probably get me through 3 days of marathon. 

Get it if you enjoy the taste of rich chocolate."

Paid $10 for 2 slices of babka and they gave me two end pieces of not so fresh babka (which I only realized at home). Listen I get that those dry end pieces have to be sold to someone but giving 2 of them to the same person when I'm paying 5 freaking dollars for one slice is unacceptable.

Go to their Union Square location and get a whole fresh babka instead. It's amazing."
701,breads-bakery-new-york-13,2016-03-26,4.0,"Can I kvell about Breads Bakery anymore? Well, after finding out their Bryant Park kiosk had hamantaschen right in time for Purim...yes, I believe I can.  The folks at the kiosk were polite and helpful, explaining that they had chocolate, poppy, cheesecake (?!), and apricot varieties, while the coffee flavored ones are just available at Union Square. While slightly disappointed about the lack of coffee, I still opted to get a dozen of the available ones...3 of each. 

The cookie/dough of the hamantaschen are light and flaky.  

The apricot filing was really really fresh with chunks of apricot.  

The poppy filing was dense and traditional, a delightful staple representation.  

I've only had one of the cheesecake's so far, and while tasty, I think the consistency was a little to similar to the cookie...though I'm gladly going to conduct further research.

The chocolate. If you've had Breads babka, then you know they do chocolate right. And they didn't disappoint with the chocolate hamantasch. Very...very excited to keep haman-noshing on these guys. fantastic.

Awesome stuff...and now dangerously close to work."
701,breads-bakery-new-york-13,2016-01-30,3.0,"I pass by this Breads Bakery kiosk nearly everyday to and from work and have been meaning to try out Breads famous Chocolate Babka for some time.

After reading an article on Serious Eats about NYC best chocolate babka where Breads was considered the best in the City, it was a clincher to try out Breads version.

Mind you I've tried a couple of other Chocolate Babkas from the Serious Eats article namely Green's Chocolate Babka and Zaro's Chocolate Babka (a gift purchased for me from my sister). Of those two Zaro's was amazingly sinful tasting; rich and really chocolaty with a very buttery brioche like consistency bread. Green's was more flaky and layered with a slightly less sweet chocolate taste, but nonetheless quite yummy.


Breads' Chocolate Babka was almost croissant like in consistency. Thin buttery flaky folds of pastry laced with chocolate was the immediate trait on my first bite and also of note was a fairly mild dark chocolate flavor which was not overly sweet. While the above was a really good combination I just found this Breads babka a bit lacking in decadence compared to the weight-gaining guilt-inducing Zaro's babka.

Tamer, more refined, and quite yummy, but if you're going full Chocolate Babka mode, I suggest you try out Zaro's version."
701,breads-bakery-new-york-13,2019-02-06,3.0,"Read such good reviews for their Chocolate Babka, I just had to try it for myself. Stopped by their store on 16th Street and bought a loaf of their chocolate babka and while there decided to grab some lunch. Had one of their Tunisian sandwiches and well, it was ok. Once I got home and cut into the chocolate babka, we found it to be dry and as hard as a biscotti. Not much else to say about Breads. Guess its Greens for chocolate babka."

Someone from work brought rugelach back from a different bakery in nyc and I knew I had to find it on my trip. I was so lucky to have found this place on yelp and it just so happened to be a block away from my hotel! Woo! 
Anyway, they look like cute, bite sized marbled chocolate croissants which you could finish in a few bites. I suggest getting 5 for 9 bucks---a little pricey, but sooo worth it. These things are small, but extremely flavorful. That first bite (and all the bites) just melt in your mouth. So heavenly. It's so soft and crunchy at the same time.  The chocolate wasn't too rich and overpowering. You can just taste the buttery layers mixed with the chocolate... I'm still dreaming about these angel treats. I wish I brought more home with me. 

Definitely check this place out and try the rugelach! You won't regret it!"

Had no idea there was a kiosk in Bryant Park so I was thrilled when I passed by. Controlled myself enough to get just a slice $5. Sweet Baby Jesus, it was better than I expected. Decadent, a little crisp on top and around the edges and very sweet with lots of chocolate chunks. Would be perfect with a nice cup of coffee...but I wouldn't know yet since I ate almost half before I walked up the block."

The croissant does not taste overly buttery, but must be filled with butter for the flakiness they have, very good texture."

My Yelp chica Chloe C. talks heavenly about Breads to the point I am drooling lol. I am cautious and take my nuts allergies very serious. The employees have no clue what oil was used to create these masterpieces of delicious baked goods so I went with a safer choose...a Cheese Straw. Woah baby so flaky and I tasted a lot cheese which is very good.

701,breads-bakery-new-york-13,2016-08-06,5.0,"Waffle? Babka? Waffle? Babka? This decision swirled around in my head for several minutes as I stalked each kiosk deciding which one was producing the mouthwatering scent lofting through Bryant Park and which one would satisfy me enough that I wouldn't regret my decision. I decided on a chocolate babka and several days later, I'm still thinking about it.

It was so moist but loaded with flavor. Somehow they nailed the balance between sweet, bread, and aroma using a blend of yeast bread, chocolate, butter, and Nutella. Though they sell it by the loaf, I opted for a slice, I regret my decision. In fact, it appears they ship nationwide and I can have a 3-pack of chocolate Babka delivered to my house for $69.90. I'm trying to justify the purchase and am seriously considering it for my father's birthday present, but only if I felt certain he would share and I'm not certain he would...

Random note...Though I didn't try anything else at Breads Bakery, I did use the restroom in Bryant Park. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it may be the cleanest/prettiest public restroom I've ever used. I highly recommend Bryant Park for a walk, a treat, and a potty break."
701,breads-bakery-new-york-13,2017-06-17,4.0,"Often times when you see something on Instagram, it doesn't live up to the hype. I had been seeing pictures of Breads' pretzel croissant on social media for a while and had to go check it out myself. First of all, a pretzel croissant hybrid is a winning combination if I've ever seen one. I went with the pizza pretzel croissant and my friend got the zatar pretzel croissant and both were so good. All the goodness of a croissant, in pretzel shape, with cheese and marinara sauce... what's not to like?! I need to stop by to try out more of their offerings but so far so good!"
701,breads-bakery-new-york-13,2018-07-19,3.0,"In NY you can be selective about where you want to  eat because of the many many choices around. Would rate this Bakery a 3.5, mostly because it is convenient and clean but I was not particularly impressed by the food itself and it's still not a cheap food option for most people. I had the mozzarella and tomato on ciabatta, while my friend had their egg salad roll, a chocolate babka and some coffee. I think they could have made their sandwiches more appealing but not having them ready made in saran  cling wrap and offering to toast the sandwiches. It would have been nice if they menu had a few more options to choose from as there were mostly breakfast sandwiches and 2-3 salads and several pastries.  For a bread place, it's decent but I felt like I was just eating carbs...so I would look around elsewhere in the area for food (e.g. Le pain quotdien, oret a manger, chipotle and whole foods are all near by too.)"

I'm sure they get plenty of business due to their location, which is good.  Hubby and I enjoyed our coffees very much.  They did have other things here like pastries and sandwiches which we totally would have gotten had we not already eaten lunch.  Maybe next time we find ourselves in NYC and wandering around Bryant Park."
701,breads-bakery-new-york-13,2016-04-03,4.0,Love the chocolate babka. The almond croissant is average and you are better off getting one close by from Maison Keyser.

I ordered large and these were small. Didn't want to ask a second question about the size after getting snapped at once. $16 for 2 small coffees with 2 stale tasting pastries.

So now when i visit my daughter in NY, i need to go here for the Chocolate Croissant!!
Why is this the only place that has their chocolate croissant shaped like a regular croissant...that beautiful crescent shape instead of a fat rectangular square!
Theirs is so flaky with chocolate oozing in every bite! And then a nice serving of chocolate pieces sprinkled all over the top! Plus it was served warm!
So delicious!!! Makes you happy! 
I could eat 1 everyday!!
Wish they open up in Honolulu, Hawaii!"

I had to wait like 10 minutes because the staff couldn't communicate / or handle the morning rush - even though it wasn't much. I later heard the Manager (?) saying  to those taking the orders - ""Guys, you got to let us know what size, or else we'll just make the standard"". Probably why it took me so long to receive my order. 

I had time to click pictures so I've got most of the store covered for y'all. They have a lot of stuff ranging from cut-fruits, parfaits, juices, hot and cold food, and even granola bars.

My chai latte wasn't the best, but I could taste all the spices come through in each sip, and that was pretty good."

I downloaded their app and I realized they have a free drink. Doesn't matter which size or what kind of drink so I got myself a large hot latte. 

Pretty light traffic here around 10:45am and it was just me and my coworker taking a stroll. The interior seems like every other pret around. When you walk in there is the fridge section with your salads, sandwiches, wraps and soup. There is an island in the middle where you can can your coffee cup sleeves and also your desired milk for you coffee. 

There are plenty of seats on the right side when you walk in. There is more seating towards the back. Pretty quiet here today morning but can definitely get hectic during rush hour. Latte was alright. Not the best, in my opinion not strong enough. I'll take it because it was free."

I came in a suit and I must of looked really stressed and worn out because the barista immediately offered me a large spiced pumpkin latte for free. Considering that this is one of the most expensive items on the drink menu, I was really impressed by this gesture of hospitality. I could help but smile. 

I had just finished a series of exhausting interviews so that free drink made a huge difference. I made sure to profusely thank the kind lady before leaving the store. Excellent service and I'll be back again to study more!"

Sis liked Pret so I decided to share some joy with her. One of the larger Pret A Mangers as far as seating goes, this one stocks the usual delicious sandwiches and salads, yogurt parfaits, coffee and miscellaneous snacks. 

Tasty, fresh fast food is what Pret offers and what it delivers. I love the shrimp in chipotle sauce here, though I wish they would be more generous with the shrimp, and not cut shrimp into pieces. I had the sandwich twice at two different locations  and think I pieced 3 whole shrimp in each sandwich from the pieces. Sis concurred. But it was in a flavorful, very light, chipotle mayo sauce with enough of a little kick to make it interesting and chock full of crisp greens to make up for the scanty protein component. The shrimp was tender and sweet, and the bread was surprisingly good for a sandwich that was premade. This was the second time I've had this and the sandwich both times was excellent. Sis had her favorite, the Lebanese chicken wrap, low in calories and high in taste.

This Pret has an expansive seating area in the back, free Wifi, and clean rustic wooden tables. It's a place you can linger  for a while if you care to, or scarf down your meal if you want to make haste. The walls have pretty art, in soothing colors. I was surprised by the condition of the bathroom, with the shredded toilet paper all over the floor, as if a giant rat(or the ghost of my kitty boy) had decided to play with the toilet paper. Geesh, since I assume the employees use the same bathroom, how about someone clean up the debris? That actually detracted one star from the overall experience."

702,pret-a-manger-new-york-48,2018-05-02,1.0,ATTITUDE CENTRAL. maybe pret shoulda stayed overseas where the employees were courteous and helpful. Welcome to nyc where they all seem like they hate their jobs and socialize and even curse at each other by the counter instead of making my ice coffee that I ordered. But the best part of the place is... having been a vegetarian for over 10 years I bought a falafel wrap for lunch. Went back to my office took a bite and bit into pulled pork... REPULSIVE. so I went back they gave me another one and thank gosh i checked before leaving. Because pork again.... they never offered me a refund or free wrap. Nothing. Like seriously?! There's another pret 2 blocks away. I will walk there instead.

The salads are good you can order  to eat in or take out.  Pret offers ready made sandwiches and yogurts to grab and go in there display cases. It's basically a fast casual type of place.

As I start to walk towards the register to order my coffee , the women said in a very nasty attitude  they were still not open and that I needed to wait outside. Without saying a word I was heading outside and the women said it to me again . I told her I will wait the 2 min. And will come back in. As soon as it was 6:30 on the dot I came back in-- I simply order my coffee and the manager gave me such a hard time while I was ordering .

 I was finally able to order my cup of coffee and paid for it. Once I finished paying for the coffee she said that her coffee machine will take at least 10 to 15 min to get ready and that she  couldn't do anything about it. I ended up having to ask for my money back and finally left to go to Starbucks. 

Long story short I was able to get my cup of coffee from Starbucks in less than 3 minutes and had great customer service at Starbucks.

According to the staff, Pret-a-manger doesn't refill water bottles as nearly all other stores do. Fine. I am paying for it. Girl at the counter gives me almost $3 in change as refund from what I owed. Seriously? You don't have paper money? I'm pretty sure there were paper money in the register.

When I asked where the sugar is she pointed and just held her hand out for money. And when I asked for another cup as this cup was burning hot even with the holder she told me it cost .50 cents more. I'll never come back here again."

It's nice and spacious with crazy amounts of seating. The staff is super friendly and drama free. 
They have a good selection of always fresh food...
I usually pig out on the Italian Wedding sandwich, a mix of vegetables and cheese with olives in a flour wrap. Ooooh, and it's warm..what? So good!
I'd skip the Chicago mix popcorn, it's not that good. The reason it's Chicago mix is because it's greasy, cheesy popcorn. Pret missed all of that on this one.
The pastries are always good and always warm. The cookies are sooooo good. 
The love bar used to be larger, then they made Love bites, which was the love bar, but cut in half for the same price. Yeah, we noticed that one. 
The chips and drinks are really great. Love this place for the ""secret"" seating."

It's extremely frustrating. And because there are ""separate lines"" theres a weird mob that forms, and I frequently have to ""defend"" my position from people trying to cut me, as I wait for the cashiers to finish their conversations.

Bizarrely inattentive service."
702,pret-a-manger-new-york-48,2016-04-28,5.0,"Started working nearby recently. This has been my lunch go-to. The food is fresh and very reasonable given prices for a decent lunch in midtown. They advertise that everything is sold to you is made that day and that the excess is given to the hungry at the end of the day, which is really awesome and I wish more establishments would adopt this practice. The staff is always more than willing to help you despite dealing with a crazy busy lunch hour crowd. I've had Pret before but the staff here really stand out. You learn to appreciate these things once you've explored around the area and see what overpriced, unhealthy, bad-tasting food you get with badd attitudes to top it off. Keep up the good work guys!!!"
702,pret-a-manger-new-york-48,2016-02-25,2.0,"Let me make this clear - I love Pret. I grab lunch from there 2-3 times per week. It's a great place and I love that there are so many around the area. 

That being said, I also get that with so many places, it's hard to hold them all to the same standards. This place needed a good cleaning and their food needed turnover. My choices were sandwich with soggy bread, or another sandwich with even soggier bread. 

Will not be going to this location again."

The guy at the register didn't know what's inside the sweets (which could be fine if you don't have any food allergies). The other girl next to him with a nasty attitude followed me to let me know that the back of the store is closed ( 10 people were seated while enjoying their food) and is the second time that happen to me so I start wondering if this girl has some issues with costumer. 
Very bad, I think the manager should do something immediately, not for the rude girl, but at least the company should inform their employees before somebody will die because didn't know what's inside the food. 
2 stars just because sandwiches soups and salad are always the best at pret a manger!"

After ordering my iced latte, I forgot that I wanted a muffin.  The girl just gave it to me :) It made my day!

The lines are quick and food is always fresh. The selection makes it easy to choose healthy food. There are many food and drink options. They have a brownie square that is delicious if you want to indulge.The area is also clean."
702,pret-a-manger-new-york-48,2015-05-12,3.0,"As ya'll probably know, Pret is a NYC chain so the food is the same at every one - fresh, tasty, healthy, and a bit overpriced.

I'm reviewing this location specifically because I don't understand what is going on with the restocking situation. I get they want everything to be as fresh as possible because that's kind of their tagline, but they literally have staff restocking the coolers every 5 minutes. It's hard to even grab what you want, and half the time if I'm standing there a staff member will yell ""EXCUSE ME,"" and shove their way in. Calm down."

They don't tell you when the back seating area is going to close, so you may sit down and 5 minutes later they are making you get up and love, even if the front area is crowded.

I walked in and was immediately greeted and the guy working was soooooooo nice. I highly recommend getting the Turkish sand coffee because it's so cool to see the process and it's even more delicious. I tried both kinds of baklava and was in awe of both. Overall a wonderful experience and I will definitely be back again next time I'm in the city for work."
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2020-03-18,4.0,"Saturday afternoon, this tiny coffee shop was still open despite the work crowd not being around. Bright interior with a few stools up front (all taken) and one person working behind the counter.

Although some of the food items behind the glass looked enticing, settled on the Sand Coffee ($5.50). Took about 5 minutes to come out as the lady ran the coffee through the sand. She let me know to let the drink cool down for several minutes and to not eat the grounds at the end. Small cup backed a nice punch; needed no extra accompaniments to get a satisfying flavor.

Lady behind the counter is super helpful, despite probably making the same spiel multiple times a day. Pricey item in particular but the other options are affordable. Would come back if there isn't a crowd."
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2020-02-11,5.0,"After a super early flight to NYC, we needed the strongest coffee available in the area (there is no shortage of the cool coffee places in New York, that's for sure!). I've been to Turkey many times, and I am really fond of their coffee so this place was an obvious choice for me. It's SUPER small but still has about 4 seats, and it's definitely more ""grab and go"" kind of a place. 
We went with an obvious choice, a Turkish coffee (you can ask for no sugar, which is really good as I know in some places in Turkey it's not an option). It was really strong and flavorful, just what we needed :)
The owner was very friendly, and it was fun watching him make us coffee. Thank you for such a great experience!"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2020-01-08,5.0,"This is my first time trying Turkish sand coffee.
It's pretty cool how they use sand to heat up the coffee.
I don't know that You can't add milk in sand coffee, so I was bit worry I won't like the drink. I'm more like a latte person. And always add milk in my coffee. 
So he recommend to add sugar for my first time. 

I'm very surprise that the coffee is really smooth and not bitter at all. He also offer a small piece of Turkish delight on the side. Perfect match!
I would come back and try without sugar next time. 

Btw the barista said he got his sand from Turkey haha!! Fancy sand!"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2020-01-07,5.0,"I've been eyeing this place for a while, and finally I was able to stop by! 
I was a bit nervous to try the sand coffee so late in the day, because I had a feeling it would be strong. The owner David essentially informed us that 1 Turkish sand coffee is equivalent to 2.5 espresso shots! And that we would gradually feel the energy after consuming it.

David is an extremely nice man, he answered all our questions and explained how to drink the sand coffee (in sips ).

The coffee was surprisingly delicious. I thought it would be bitter, but it was extremely smooth and had a nice taste.

The sand coffee came with two Turkish chocolate delights, which were delicious! 

Will definitely return if I'm in the area!"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2020-01-07,5.0,"What a Turkish Delight this place was (see what I did there?)! 

We arrived earlier this evening to try the ever-popular sand coffee that Lulu offers. The owner David was very engaged, accommodating, and friendly to us. He even let me bring in my pizza from outside to eat. 

We opted for the matcha green tea latte and the sand coffee. The matcha green tea came with some pretty foam on top and tasted perfectly balanced with just the right amount of sweetness. The sand coffee was quite an act to watch. It's made by stirring a cup of coffee in hot sand. The heat and the pressure from the sand brew the coffee until it's ready to boil over. David served it on a cute wooden board with a metal handle. He even gave us two complimentary Turkish Delights. 

My friend and I were bracing ourselves for an extremely bitter first sip, but it never came. The coffee was pleasantly smooth and easy to drink. David informed to sip our coffee instead of taking it as a shot like a regular espresso. We were also told it would provide a gradual spike in energy instead of an explosive one like other coffees. 

To sum it up: our experience was awesome! I wish I worked closer so I could get my coffee here everyday!"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-12-31,5.0,"We loved our brief visit to Lulu. 
The proprietor (David) was a lovely man who happily shared with me the story of his shop (when I asked it of him). 
The coffee & muffin I had were great, but honestly, stop in there for a quick visit even if only to soak in a little of the authentic NYC atmosphere. 
Of interest to serious kaffe aficionados is the opportunity to enjoy genuine Jezve (Turkish Sand Coffee)."

It was a fun process to watch and the barista was extremely  knowledgeable and friendly. We got the coffee with no additional sweeteners and it tasted amazing. 

Happy this place is so close to penn station, will definitely be stopping by again!"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-10-14,5.0,"What a pleasant surprise, I never had Turkish Sand Coffee before and this will not be my last time after trying it at LuLu.

Turkish sand coffee uses a hot bed of sand to heat the coffee. A Cezve which is a small copper kettle is filled with water, super fine coffee grounds, and optional sugar and then is nestled a couple inches deep into the bed hot sand till it starts to boil.

Turkish coffee is always served with a glass of water; use it to first cleanse your palate. You don't get a spoon because you never stir the coffee once it's in the cup because it may disturbs the fine coffee grounds on the bottom. Sip your coffee gently and don't be fooled by the sand heating, it is boiling hot. As a treat you get a piece of Turkish delight.

The coffee was real good, like 2 smooth espresso shots, but it not a strong taste and I didn't even notice any coffee grounds.

I also had the the delicious Baklava, which is worth coming here just for that. It had dozens of paper thin pastries sheets covered in a sweet sugary glazed and crushed pistachios from Safir's Bakery in Brooklyn.

You have a few stools by the window and I recommend enjoying the coffee here and not to do take out."
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2020-03-10,4.0,"I came here during the day to try out their famous sand coffee and it did not disappoint! It was really flavorful, and was very cool to watch how it got made. It was a bit too pricey for me though ($5.50), and I probably won't come here often, but that shouldn't stop anyone from coming in and trying it themselves. I paired the coffee with their pistachio baklava, which was heavenly!"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-10-10,5.0,"Side note: This place's actual name is Lülü coffee (with said Turkish Ü/umlauts) but this would make it hard to find on yelp if you don't have accent marks so I feel this works better.

Anyway, as can be seen from the name, this is a tiny Turkish place with four seats right off the corner that specializes in coffee drinks with a few pastries and other teas. Outside of the usual assortment of goods, they also sell baklava; made from a Turkish place in Brooklyn called Safir; and a bunch of other treats. 

Their main specialty is their sand coffee; or in short Turkish coffee (Türk kahvesi) heated in hot sand. It might be tiny but it's essentially a bit over 2 espressos so it's worth it at $5.99 for the experience/good flavor. The coffee, which as per the owner's recommendation/my preference has a little bit of sugar in it. The barista instructed to wait a minute or two before drinking to help smooth it out/to wait for it to cool down a bit. 

The coffee comes in a pretty cup on a gold plate with a cup of water to drink between sips as well as a fantastic little imported pistachio turkish delight/lokum covered in chocolate. I asked and they sell these for 75 cents otherwise and I might have to go back to get a bunch. The coffee, compared to the grainy mulch you'll find in some other places, is smooth without being too bitter. The drink was very satisfying.

The owner is very nice and enthusiastic about their products and it shows in his careful process and very delicious coffee. It might take a bit longer than your usual coffee drink but it shows in the quality. Just don't drink the grains at the bottom as expected.

I'm not a coffee expert, but enjoyed the Turkish coffee served at LULU. It's fun watching the hot sand cooking the coffee (makes for a good 'gram). The baklava was also tasty. There was a Yelp check-in deal for a free coffee with a bakery item. Turkish coffee, baklava, and a regular coffee was a good morning stop for me and the wife.

The space is a bit small to sit in, but you can't have it all. The owner is very friendly and helps you to enjoy your coffee. A good space deserving of a try."

And I am definitely glad we didn't give up because the coffee is definitely worth the trip! The Turkish sand coffee is absolutely delicious and I chose the light level for sweetness since I prefer a tad of bitterness.

I took the recommendation to have a little sugar in my sand coffee, and it was delicious. I think I could have done without it because it was so smooth though!! Great little cup to sip and savor. 
And that baklava!!!!! Out of this world good. So soft and sweet without being too sweet. It was just the best."

David was extremely knowledgeable and explained the process as he made the coffee. It was served with chocolate dipped Turkish delight and a glass of water. I got the coffee without the offered sugar. The coffee tasted like a smooth, well pulled espresso shot but without the lingering sharp tastes. Definitely a coffee that deserves slow sips, since it is served piping hot. The shop itself was charming but small, with a couple seats and coat hooks by the seats."
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-12-29,4.0,Nice little coffee shop in the city that is selling Turkish coffee that is heated in sand. It's a nice experience but the Turkish coffee is standard and a bit pricy. The coffee comes with a chocolate which is a nice touch. Limited seating inside. Customer service is on point. Very friendly owner.

I am not a coffee person. But still liked it. I was given a choice of low sweet or medium sweet. I went for medium sweet. But coffee was still bitter. Coffee cup was tiny. And you shouldn't drink the grain in the bottom of the cup. The shop is very tiny. There are just 3 - 4 counter seats. They also sell some baklava and pastries. Their baklava was my favorite. It was a lot bigger than the ones that are generally available. Also tasted very good."

I've had Turkish coffee at many places, but first time I see it boiled with sand. Very impressive.

The owner working there is very friendly. 
It's a small cute place, just drink your coffee and go.

When you get the sand coffee, you get it with a cup of water and a piece of chocolate. You are asked the level of sweetness for coffee. I would recommend to get it a bit bitter, so you can eat it with the chocolate. Or get it sweet if you want lol

I would return for another shot :)"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-12-30,5.0,"This place is super cool for Turkish coffee. The owner takes his time with each customer and explain the process. He answers any questions you may have. Warning, the inside is super small, seating 4 people, but there are benches outside that ammodated myself & 2 other friends. 

Coffee was hella delicious!! Definitely a repeat place for me!"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-10-12,5.0,"Hooooray! Turkish coffee in daaa townnn :) Excuse me, ""sand coffee"" :) as it goes under the menu.

Before talking how happy I am to have Lülü Coffee Co in the city, I would love to share some information about ""the coffee"".

Having it's roots from Ottoman Empire, Turkish coffee was and has always been a helpful drink not only because of it's beneficial effects on digestive system but also thanks to it's power to foresee your fortune. You read it right. You can enjoy your coffee and flip the cup over, wait a while and your fortune is ready to serve :) Make sure to bring a friend in who can read the fortune out of Turkish coffee. 

Also another fun fact, when a guy wants to marry a girl, according to tradition, he needs to drink the Turkish coffee she cooks, with a loooot of salt in it sometimes even pepper or paprika and he should still be appreciative to persuade the father to allow them marry but no worries that is not the case at Lülü :)

I am a latte a person in the mornings, so I tried the latte first and the beans David(the owner of this nice shop) uses are delicious. He got choices of milk if you prefer soy or coco, etc. He got some pastries along with coffee choices. Cakes, croissants and yes baklava! 

You can have coffees iced or hot but Turkish coffee has only hot option cuz that's the way it is. *There is matcha for matcha lovers.

He cooks the coffee on hot sand, you should indicate if you want the coffee sweet, semi-sweet or without sugar in advance since you shouldn't stir the Turkish coffee after it is cooked. If you have time, I recommend you to have your first coffee to stay in those beautiful cups and fancy tray. 

Thank you David, I will see you soon again :)"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-10-03,5.0,"So I've always been into Turkish coffee and I'm so glad the owner David took this idea and created a warm little coffee shop out of it. 

First off, there's not much seating. This was designed to be your mid day stop and go place -but don't be fooled, it's cute and cozy. I for one, really liked it. 

So Turkish coffee is basically very fine ground coffee beans placed into a copper thing, filled with water, and boiled in hot sand (which gives it an evenly dispersed heating) and served like an espresso. 

.. as per David, it's the caffeine equivalent of about two espressos. Again, I love it.

The presentation is nice but the flavor and aroma is even nicer. At this $ price point, you won't regret stopping by for a coffee and piece of baklava. 

Verdict: if you have a few minutes to escape the office for a quick pick me up, skip the Starbucks and head to Lulu. 10/10 from me!"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-10-14,5.0,"A new entrant arrives in the flooded coffee space and boy was it an experience. Having had the assortments of americanos, lattes, etc. and feeling adventurous I fancied a ""sand coffee"" at Lülü Coffee Co.

Definitely try it. Two shots of espresso packed into a tiny amount meant for sipping led to an unexpected buzz and nice moment. Apparently heated by sand, let your drink sit for a minute or two so the grains can sift to the bottom and then sip to your hearts content. Delicious and presented beautifully with a great explanation by the owner in a tiny little store.

In addition to the fantastic coffee, the baklava here is a must. Some of the best I've had in recent memory and the pastry crumbles and reminds you of some of the best I've had abroad. I don't believe it's from in house, but fantastic it still was. Overall, a charming owner and fantastic little experience here, so thank you!"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-11-05,4.0,"I had the sand coffee there last week and it was definitely interesting. The shot was smooth and not that bitter. When you're almost done, just be careful so you don't drink sand haha.

I also liked the little chocolate that comes with it. That treat was gone way before I finished half the espresso.

While Turkish coffee was interesting, I don't see a good reason to return. Their baklava may be good but I didn't get to try them so maybe I'd wanna come back for that.

Otherwise, I'll be back for sand coffee when I miss it but I won't forget the experience for months."

Next time I'll definitely try the sand coffee.  It's Turkish coffee literally warmed up on a layer of sand.  The small touches/details are apparent and the owner was very hospitable.
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-09-18,5.0,"Slows your life way down. 

This is not your run-of-the-mill coffee shop. They make coffee Turkish style!

Our barista takes a small bit of what appeared to be super fine coffee grounds and puts it in a little metal pot with a long handle. He then pours water and puts the pot in sand. The sand is heated by a plate below. The hot sand brings the coffee to a boil. He pours it out for you. You need to wait a minute or two for the coffee to settle and also to reach drinkable temperature. And they give a little Turkish delight on the side. 

I have never had coffee made this way. And I love it when people bring new things to my life. 

Its not cheap, but it is not regular coffee."
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2019-08-31,5.0,"My trip to Turkey is probably my favorite experience thus far, and to have the flavorful, authentic coffee taste warming my soul here in New York... is everything I could ask for.

Note: I actually never got to witnessed the true and tried traditional method of warming coffee with the sand in Istanbul, so this was pretty cool. 

The actual heating technique was so unique and resulted in an ideal temperature for the liquid. Not too hot, not cold.

The barista (owner) was friendly, and advised I take a little bit of sugar this morning-- which was perfect advice. It had a great balance, creating a smooth mouth feel with a hint of sweet finish. 

Love the attention to detail in the decor and presentation of the coffee. From the saucer with the store name, to the copper covered tray with handle and the rotating, diner style dessert stand: it's a small, humble yet vibrant stop on your way to herald square.

Coming back for that fresh baklava! Highly recommend."

703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2020-01-14,5.0,"Solid coffee and espresso place in the heart of Chelsea area. I stopped in on a whim when it opened, since it's right next to one of my more favorite lunch spots, Sakura. Fast service with a smile, excellent roasts, and really good iced coffee. It's also nice to note that every time I pass by here, either to or from work, there's always people in there and always looks a little busy, but not overwhelming. Definitely recommended to my colleague at work who don't want to pay for Gregory's mediocre coffee and want good espresso."
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2020-01-14,5.0,"Everything was perfect, especially my baklava. Turkish coffee was so good as well, i definetely suggest to come here for everybody"
703,lülü-coffee-co-new-york-23,2020-02-17,4.0,Fun experience seeing the coffee being made in hot sand. The bitter coffee with sweet pistachio baklava was a perfect combo.
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2020-03-13,5.0,"Great little spot to hang out and enjoy a drink and a chat or catch up on social media.

Second time in two days here. Being a tea drinker, the iced peach tea is very good. Had a brownie yesterday that was tasty and not old or hardened...I say it, moist. I know not everyone likes that word but it is the right one here.

Seating is at a window bar on both sides of the door and some two-top tables. Power on the wall readily available.

Music is not overpowering and good tunes I have not heard before."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-10-24,4.0,"I'm feeling generous by choosing four stars.  Really this is more of a 3.5 star review.

I used to walk through this part of Midtown Manhattan on my way to work more often, and back then there were not many coffee shops to be found.  Now there appears to be several which include Corvo Coffee.  I had never heard of this chain (I'm assuming it's a chain) so I stopped in to check it out.  

Corvo is a relatively small shop, with a large counter featuring baked goods to the right and the cashiers to the left.  The staff was very attentive and took my order right away.  I ordered a Dirty Chai (my go to drink to test out how a place is).  I am happy to report the drink was great.  It wasn't the best Chai I've ever had (it did come out of a box if you're wondering), but it had flavor and they did not hold back on the shots.

I am glad there are more coffee shops in this area now and I would be happy to visit Corvo again in the future."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-10-27,5.0,"Dasha is my favorite barista of all time.

She greets everyone with genuine smile (you can't expect that in daily life in NYC anymore )and is very helpful with her great coffee skill.she is a cheerful person and working very hard!

Americano is consistent every time.creamy long lasting crema = perfection.

Nice jazzy music in the store not like chain coffee shop with unbearable blasting party music which drive me crazy.

Nice window seats for afternoon sweets or simply quick meditation before hopping on the train.

Happy customer here."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-10-30,5.0,"Absolutely love Corvo. As if $2 coffee isn't great enough, their service is fast and polite as well. There's one barista in particular (unfortunately don't know her name yet) who's always super energetic and friendly no matter what time of the day you go, and it's a pleasure being greeted by her.

Their coffee is the same price for the medium and large sizes, so it's a better deal getting the large!"
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-06,4.0,"This place is awesome. Why? EVERYTHING IS $2! Yep, from their lattes to their bagels, everything is $2. It is conveniently located right off 8th ave and I have always been served very quickly, even when there is a long line!

I like their lattes here! Not the best espresso I have ever had, but extremely good for the affordable price. I do not think you could get this quality of coffee anywhere else for this price. If you are looking for a good place to grab a quick snack or coffee in midtown, this is it! FYI, there is very limited seating. I think that it is more of a grab and go place!"
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2020-02-12,5.0,Great prices and great coffee.  You can't go wrong at Corvo.  They also open early.
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-05-25,5.0,"My hotel was right above this coffee shop. Good reviews were right on. Great, friendly and quick service; coffee and everything bagel  with cream cheese did not disappoint. Price was right too. Nice having a good coffee and bagel shop less than 5 minutes away."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-16,5.0,"$2 for a small latte. How have I never been here before? I'm literally drinking my latte and crying inside because cheap, decent coffee is so hard to find in the city! 

The shop is a little neglected-looking- every seat had crumbs on them. I would grab and go."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-07-22,4.0,"First of all, let me just say they have a sign outside saying $2 all coffee/latte using La Columbe beans but the $2 cup is extremely small which is just a bit bigger than an espresso cup. For a medium they charge $3 and then large is $4 which is a normal small/medium at other coffee shops. I don't drink a lot but even I had to get their ""large"" size for my morning coffee run. They say they use La Columbe beans but the coffee was a bit bland.. I'd rather pay $5 at La Columbe than paying $4 at Corvo. Also, when I make my coffee with oat or almond milk, it becomes around $5 which is pretty much the same as other coffee shops. But even so, I think it's still a pretty cool concept where in NYC they can charge as much as $6-7 for a cup of coffee. And staff here are very accomodating and working hard."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2017-09-24,4.0,"These guys have some chutzpah opening another coffee shop on a block full of 5-6 coffee shops already and who knows how many within a 1 block radius.  And with the 500lb gorilla, Starbucks across the street within spitting distance?  You guys even have your own original shop on 9th Ave to contend with.  The limited seating can't compete with Starbucks' couches for the coffee lounge lizards either.

Maybe they've got something going here charging just $2 for any item on the menu. The iced chocolate is a refreshing treat on a hot day as well as the other iced drinks.  The pastries look pretty good and I was a little hungry, so we tried an egg and tomato croissant.  Too bad they haven't gotten their oven/toaster working yet because the croissant would have tasted really good if it had been warm and toasty.  Luckily, we heated it up at the office, thank you/no thank you very much.  Hope these guys are around when it gets cooler so that we can try some of their hot drinks."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-05-15,5.0,"Great place to camp out and get some work done. I needed to catch a bus at Port Authority and had about an hour to spare. Corvo provides a fuss-free work environment with many outlets for all your devices. Wi-Fi is free, a little patchy at times, but good enough. The server was very friendly and the drinks were all fairly priced. Exactly what I needed for a productive hour in midtown."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-19,5.0,"Super quick service, large warm flavorful bagels.  Love the cappuccino, got a caramel shot, yum.  This coffee is better than Starbucks.  So glad this is so close to our hotel!!"
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-02,4.0,"In Manhattan you typically expect to pay a little more than usual for whatever it is you want. Corvo will say otherwise, almost everything here is $2. You can't beat a cheap breakfast when you're either in a hurry or choose to walk around like most visitors. The citrus green tea paired perfectly well with the egg and tomato croissant. This is the ideal brealfast if you're not looking to spend much."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-29,5.0,How have I not discovered this earlier? Friendly service and EVERYTHING in the menu is $2.00?!?! Yes please!
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-10-15,4.0,"Great, quick coffee stop in midtown.  Service was quick, and they have a great case of pastries to select from.  I went with an iced coffee and a chocolate, almond croissant.  The coffee was good and the croissant had great flavor and flakiness.  This place is in a great location for those walking to the office, or a tourist looking for a quick pick-me-up and snack during the day.  Probably the best spot within this block, and everything seems a bit cheaper here! Got my large coffee and croissant for approximately $4! Can't beat that in New York!"
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2017-12-12,5.0,"Walked past Dunkin, walked past a cart emanating that sweet NYC coffee smell, walked past Starb's and into Corvo for the win.  This place is s top notch Yelp find!!

A large drip coffee for $2.18 is good, and when it's a deep smooth La Colombe roast like Corvo's that's great!!

They serve pastries and espresso drinks too."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-26,1.0,"1 star bc I had to. Burnt food, bland muffins, warm bottled water, stingy on prepackaged cream cheese."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-23,4.0,"Surprised to see another coffee shop opening especially when it's right across a giant. I came in because I saw the $2 everything sign and compared to all the coffee shop nearby it sounded like a deal. However not EVERTHING is $2. The egg on a bagel is $2.50. I thought they charged me incorrectly the first time I brought it so I brought it again just to confirm. They also have seasonal drinks or specials for $3. 

Spacious place but not a lot of seating. 4 small round tables with 2 seats and couple of bar stool by the windows. I didn't try any of their drinks but a lot of people do stop by and order them. 

I have been stopping by here for sandwiches only so this review is solely based on the sandwiches. 

Egg on a bagel - egg, tomato and bagel. They bagel was hard and tasted like it's been out for a long time. 

Tuna sandwich - it was pretty good. I had it toasted and the staff did a good job at it. He was able to make the bread warm but kept the tuna cold. 

Egg on a croissant - egg, tomato and croissant. The egg was so salty...

Egg and avocado - egg, avocados and croissant. Although it is simple it is one of the better sandwiches. I like this the most for lunch."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-17,5.0,"One of my favorite parts of my trip to New York. My mother, father and I enjoyed an egg croissant with an iced latte each and my boyfriend had an avocado and egg croissant with orange juice. All of this costed us $20. The quality was amazing for the price and I am 100% visiting again when I come back!"
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-24,5.0,"I have never in my life gotten in and out of a coffee shop so quickly and so pleasantly (aside from the fact that I stayed to sit around at the seats by the window for a bit).

The service is fast, employees are friendly, the space is cute and the chairs in front of the windows are comfortable. Also can't forget to mention that every item on their menu is $2 (plus, La Colombe coffee!). Can't beat these prices and you also can't miss them - they're advertising their products and space pretty well, with their prime location directly across the street from Starbucks.

I'll definitely be back for a quick coffee and snack in the near future."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-01-12,4.0,"A good spot with an interesting business model. Everything costs two dollars. The pastries come from the bakery tisserie which is pretty good. Go earlier in the day and they are fresher. I usually get a matcha latte and a cookie as a midday snack. There's no seating but it's a nice cafe to stop by and pick up a snack from when you're hungry.
I haven't been to the other corvo location but I had a good experience at the midtown one. Overall, pretty good spot."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-24,4.0,Quick and cheap coffee. Always good for when i'm on the go and need a pick me up without a wait.
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-08-28,4.0,Very nice that everything here is for $2 against very costly neighborhood. The store is also clean and the avocado sandwich I had was good. Another good thing is that they are also open on weekend. I will come back for breakfast and coffee again.
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-09,5.0,Cheap coffee with amazing taste! Stopped by on the way to another coffee location and we saw the sign and had to go in! Coffee wasn't overwhelmed by the caramel and the flavor is great.
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-09-17,2.0,"Horrible experience with their La Colombe draft latte. The server did not tilt the cup as it was poured, therefore the entire $5 coffee was all foam. A draft latte and beer should be poured exactly the same. If you tilt the glass, there will only be foam on the top layer and the rest would be the latte. I asked the server to pour again and she replied ""draft lattes are all foam"". Well they certainly are not all foam at the real La Colombe store location in Bryant Park."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-09,5.0,"We were staying in a nearby hotel and decided to stop by here for a quick breakfast. Bagels were good, latte was good and the hot chocolate was the BEST she's ever had. (According to my daughter) Everything was $2 ea so it was also affordable which is a welcome surprise for Times Square. We would definitely recommend!"
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-02-20,4.0,"This review is specifically for cookies. 

I bought about a dozen into work. 

People loved them. 

Moist chewy and delicious. 

I endorse these cookies."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-05-29,5.0,I'm giving this place 5 stars because the iced tea and scone were delicious and were quite reasonably priced. Worth a stop for a coffee or snack.
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2017-11-21,4.0,"Long wait to order because they're understaffed, but no biggie. Got a latte with almond milk, and enjoyed the roasty flavor of the coffee. Not much room to sit, but there are a couple small tables, and stools by the window as well. It's an in-and-out place, and at the most, you could work on your laptop here. They also carry juices, teas, mochas, light pastries, and croissant sandwiches. For $2 a pop, you can't go wrong. Gio was cool."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-03-05,4.0,"Good coffee, fast friendly service. The difference between the $2 small latte here and the $5 tall latte across the street? Not much but branding. They have a few seats and some outlets here too, if you want to sit and watch the crowd stream through. 

They really have to change the sign outside, though. Everything is $2, plus tax, except for the large latte which is $3, plus tax. Still well priced, but not as advertised."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-08-22,4.0,"Come in here on multiple occasions for the price of only $2 on coffee. The small sizes and most pastries at $2, but seasonal and larger sized drinks are closer to $3 and up. Coffee is all La Colombe. No cold brew, but plenty of iced coffee. Matcha was a bit watery when I got it. Service is efficient. An average place for coffee, great for on the go. Definitely saving money on the pastries and coffee here in the city."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2017-12-12,5.0,"Woah, everything here is $2?!  Everything we ordered tastes like it's worth more, so everything was definitely a deal."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-22,5.0,"I was on my way to Culture 36 and I saw Corvo out of the corner of my eye. I walked over because of the cool design of the shop and I'm so glad I did. They serve La Colombe. And oh, everything is $2. What? Yes, you heard me EVERYTHING is $2! Lattes, egg sandwiches, cookies, all the pastries, $2. I don't know how they do it but I'm so glad they do! La freaking Colombe! My latte was up their with the greats. This place is perfect and has the best concept ever! I could live here!"
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-05,1.0,"They've said ""all items"" are $2 yet when we had ordered a croissant and orange juice, it was $6 plus tax.  When asked, the lady at the counter said the orange juice was $4. That's false advertisement.  I wish i could've seen the itemized receipt.  Everytime i had ordered before everything was $2 no matter what the sizes or items.  That sounds like ""all items""  if you are the manager or owner i was here at 9:15am on nov 5th."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-01-23,5.0,"A damn fine cup of coffee. The $2 everything definitely got me through the door, and I was surprised at just how many options you got for such a low price. The coffees smooth and rich, it's hard to find $2 coffee you can drink black. Will definitely be coming back soon!"
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-06-28,5.0,"Seduced by the sign all items $2, I walked in for a breakfast sandwich. Service was fast and cordial. I ordered an egg and avocado sandwich, within minutes I was devouring my sandwich. Sandwich was fresh and delicious. I will come back again."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-02-20,1.0,"All bagel breakfast sandwiches are pre-made and unfortunately if you have a food allergy or if you're lactose intolerant they will only try scrape off the cheese and/or tomato and grill it. Extremely unfortunate that they would do such a thing but, they're no different than Starbucks in that regard. Also keep in mind, those breakfast sandwiches are made before the store is open, and they refuse to throw them even if  there's a chance of food contamination for being kept in a open aired container all throughout the day."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2018-03-14,5.0,"I find there would be little reason to not give this place five stars. Echoing other folks, pretty much everything is $2! Small or large tea? Doesn't matter, $2 for either. I mean I get it, just adding more hot water, but this place is smack in the middle of Midtown Manhattan. They have tons of plugs and free wifi! Saw a lot of foreigners ducking in here for a quick respite, phone charge, email, etc. The tables are a bit low for the chairs if you're trying to work, but it was still comfortable and very doable. Don't miss out, I hope they last foreverrrrrr! I'll be back, I might even buy YOU a $2 beverage..."
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-03,5.0,"Ok so this place is amazing!! Everything on the menu is $2 which is insane for NYC but everything from sandwiches to pastries is so fresh and yummy, and they use La Colombe coffee so if you're a coffee addict like me you know how good it is.. so happy I finally found my favorite coffee shop in the neighborhood :) See you again tomorrow Corvo Coffee!!"
704,corvo-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-27,5.0,"First of all, how much better can a $2.18 coffee or sandwich get? Corvo really wins at delicious food at cheap prices! It's like you're in Europe (or any where else in the states where things are actually affordable). The service is super fast, and the cashiers are sweet!"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2020-01-13,5.0,"I love this place! I work down the street and visit the cafe several times a week. The coffee and matcha are strong and delicious.

What I love about coming here is the owner and wonderful baristas who always greet me with a smile. When my team organized a little holiday party the owner was super accommodating. We had several delicious bottles of wine and a spectacular cheese board. Their chef is great! 

I haven't tried it but my co-workers rave about the soup! 

Lastly, it's never too crowded or loud and they do a great job to make the place comfortable and peaceful for everyone."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2020-03-10,1.0,"Some bias going on up in here. I used to stop in this cafe to eat or grab a chai after therapy frequently. 

I go in today to meet a friend. She's running late, I take a look at the menu and decide to wait for her before ordering. I have a seat,  see the owner/manager come in and eye me up and down. She walks past me, comes back and asks what I'm doing here and if I'm waiting for someone. 

I've been in here several times. Micro aggression felt. Won't be returning."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2020-03-05,1.0,"DO NOT COME HERE !!!

If you are looking to do work or do anything remote.  I first came in I was on a business call (along with a couple of people in the place) and I was harassed by a worker to come order a coffee when I set up a whole work station for 5 minutes after getting there. Then my partner came to sit down and have a call along with our coffee we about 4 customers in the place and she kept interpreting and coming over. Worse service and I never suggest to come to this place there is not even WiFi !!!"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-10-30,3.0,"5 stars for spacious setting, plenty of seating, nice ambiance, and good for working. 

2 stars for my matcha latte with oat milk, which came out to be $6.53. It's 50 cents extra for an alternative milk, but my latte came out ridiculously atrocious. The barista simply just poured the steamed oat milk onto the matcha. No latte art. No technique. Just a mere dump. I would've been fine with the $6+ price if there was some effort and thought put into my order, but unfortunately there as none. The plus side is that they use Oatly Barista Blend Oat Milk, which is one of the better brands of oat milk.

Somewhat pricey, but overall, this place is good for working, meetings, and hangouts. I'd probably come back to try their food or coffee items the next time I'm in the area."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2020-02-25,5.0,I love this place! Excellent coffee and food options. Every item has a high quality touch to it. The avo toast is my favorite there but recently the soup has been great as well. I don't have time to hang out in coffee shops but always wish I did when I step into Cofesta. It's a huge space with tons of seating options and never crowded. Perfect for some kind of meet up.
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-05-02,1.0,"Wow. Don't talk too loudly in this empty joint. The owner will tell you to leave if you're not at a whisper level. 

Also she will tell you not to put your feet on the coffee table as if it's an ancient Asian antique. 

It's coffee in NYC. So many other options. Don't go here!!! Awful!"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-11-19,5.0,Stopped by here yesterday and enjoyed it. Located off 26th st between 5 and 6th ave. I only grabbed a coffee to go but it was amazing. Also a great place to have a meeting or catch up with friends. They also have an happy hour as well. Definitely worth checking out.
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2020-02-26,5.0,"Lovely cafe!! Terrific service, perfect space and ambiance for a quiet breakfast and more than enough space to work from as there is ample room and tables (very rare in nyc!). They also prepared a custom dish for me upon request and were happy to do it (also rare in nyc). They were very kind and congenial. I will definitely be coming back and letting all my friends know about this absolute GEM of a find!!"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2020-02-20,5.0,"Have had this place in mind since I started working in the neighborhood last year. Nice and cozy. Super sweet, excellent service. Delicious oatmeal coffee and croissant- loved everything."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2020-01-13,5.0,"I love Cofesta! I work on the same block and our team loves to frequent Cofesta several times a week. We even had our holiday party here-- the cheese plate is fantastic and so is the soup!

The best part about Cofesta is Bee and the rest of the team like Dana and David who take the time to learn your name and give you a fantastic experience. 

I highly recommend stopping by Cofesta when you're in Flatiron. The coffee's great, the food is delicious, but the people are the best part."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-01-18,5.0,"Okay this is why I like this place. It has caffeine and a yuuuuuge amount of space. Right now it's quiet with a total patron number of 3 including little ole me (Thursday morning). If I was a laptop worker bee I could see myself chillin here with a cup. The cafe is strong but I sort of made it that way.

It's in a rando location between all the bar-ing on 26th shoved between tapas place and the whiskey place. Still I think it was a good idea because any non Starbucks coffee in my area always is. I literally can walk to 3 in the 2 block radius of my home...

I hope it does well. They don't have much for snacking on so that might not be so good for someone who needs to hunker down. Typical cafe situation. They do have a pour over option. And things like hemp and oat milk..."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-12-18,1.0,"I appreciate the fact that there is always a lot of space available at Cofesta, so I quite often visit the place when I want to talk outside the office. I think I have probably spent $150.00 there in total over the last months, even though there aren't a lot of the things available I would usually order (like diet cokes, mineral water etc.). Today I was asked by the manager after an hour if we wanted to order food, followed by the info that it was a courtesy that we were able to stay longer than 45 minutes without ordering more (we had ordered a coffee and a soda in the beginning). I guess I'll have to find a new place, I didn't know they had a time limit.

Update: Dear Bee, thank you for your reply below. Please note that we have never used your coffee shop without consumption. More importantly, we've always ordered before we sat down and I have never had anyone in my group (no clients, just employees) sit there without having something purchased first. I am also quite sure that we didn't take away anyone's seat, since you don't seem to be that busy. I do understand, however, that you obviously want customers to spend more money and less time and have learned my lesson to no longer support your business. And it seems I am not the only one here..."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-08-27,1.0,"Wow! Never coming here again.
I visited twice before and I liked it because it's a large space and usually not packed like all the Starbucks around. But today I had a bad experience with a short lady who seems to be the owner.
I was on a work call and couldn't hang up so I stood around near the door on my phone before I could order. Five minutes later this woman comes to come and says ""are you here to borrow the space or are you going to order something?"" I said ""I was, but not anymore. That was rude"". Maybe she should learn a little about customer experience. Just lost a customer."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-05-28,4.0,"I happened upon this place when going to get my haircut at Marie Robinson salon a few doors down.
The iced mocha was really good, and their chocolate chip cookie was AMAZING!!    It is not cheap, but this was seriously one of the best cookies I have ever had.    The owner/barista takes her time with your coffee and I will definitely go back."

I live across the street. I have given up on trying to make it part of my schedule. Ten past 8AM; not open. Stop in to finish some work; surprise, they're closing at 5:30PM. (Versus the already-early 6.)

At the end of the day, Starbucks is on Broadway and opens at 6AM and La Pechora Bianca is on the near corner on Broadway and is consistently great."

705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-12-18,1.0,"Run!!!! do not go in there.  I was yelled at for not ordering more drinks and food.  I was told I could not seat there after I paid, because all I ordered was a banana.  The place was empty, it was snowing and freezing outside, and I was forced to leave.  I was told that they need the space in case others come in and order more things. I asked if I can stay for a few minutes and the owner said she was making an exception, and she opened the door in front of where I was seating, so that I was super cold and uncomfortable.  Overall, it was a horrible experience and I will never go back there."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-05-02,1.0,"Such a terrible experience. Stopped by with a coworker to talk business late afternoon. I enjoy supporting mom and pop shops. Bought a bottle of water. Place was empty. After 20 minutes the manager, a woman ( manager )  came up and said we were talking to loud and if we aren't ordering anything else we can leave. Note we were the only people at place.  I was totally speechless. Never been kicked out of anywhere before. I am a professional in the tech space and like to meet people at coffee places. This place treated us like 3rd class citizens, very disappointing. Probably why the place was empty. BEWARE. DO NOT GO. AVOID THIS PLACE.  We proceeded to go to another coffee shop a half a block away and they were very friendly. I obviously will never go back to this place."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-03-07,1.0,This place is nice and big on the inside however it is the middle of winter and they have limited outlets (only 2 in the front) and kept the door ajar so I was freezing. I closed the door and the told me that she HAD to keep it open even though it is literally 26 degrees outside. She told me to move if I don't like it. I moved to the back and it I feel a breeze of cold air so I just left. Seems like they don't really care if their customer are uncomfortable so I won't be coming back.
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-10-09,5.0,"So I don't ever post reviews, simply out of sheer laziness but this place deserve 5 min out of my day. If you want a really good coffee and you wanna feel like you walked into the Cheers of coffee shop COME HERE. The manager Bee (who is actively hands on behind the counter) and the staff (particularly Huishan who is the kind of girl you would wanna grab a beer with after a crap day at work!) welcome you and engage as though you are a regular. I have never felt more cared for or acknowledged when getting a coffee! And this was my first time! This is the ideal neighborhood coffee shop where everyone knows your name and is friendly and cool. The place itself is warm with large leather couches to chill and plenty of tables to sit and work if that's your thing. But it's really the vibe created by the staff that will make this my new caffeine stop in."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-02-11,5.0,"Delicious coffee, very friendly & welcoming staff, and love the space - great place to work quietly alone or catch up for coffee w a friend. Yummy pastries, too"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-08-08,5.0,"Great coffee & awesome staff!! Got a cappuccino here, and it was amazing. They have awesome pastries and lunch food and gluten free everything for those of you who can't tolerate it! 

Huge space, great music, and the staff are super friendly. Everything's hella clean. 10/10 would go again!"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-10-30,1.0,"Coffee is nothing special and very expensive, the space is CAVERNOUS and always creepily empty. The counter staff is fine, but there's a woman who's always there (who I assume is the owner?) who's constantly pushing everyone to try their food. 

I was sitting on the couch, cross legged, and the owner yelled at me saying it was a ""health code violation."" I shifted so that I had my right foot on the ground, and my left foot on my knee, and the owner came back to chastise me again! In the 8 years I've lived in NYC and sat cross legged at bars, coffee shops, and restaurants, I've never been told that's a health code violation. 

I heard from a coworker today that the same thing happened to him! Considering how empty that place always is, I don't know why the owner  would take the time to harass the few people that come in there."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-05-07,5.0,"Come in here almost 3x/week for coffee meetings. A big, quiet space is hard to find in the city, and have been pleased with the coffee and service so far."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-02-01,5.0,"This cafe is awesome! They've just opened 2 months ago and once the word gets out I can see it getting packed fast. I had an oat milk latte (was craving oat milk) which not a lot of places offer. Let me just say it was gone in 5 min and I considered going back for more :) 

Also it's very spacious and quiet, which is perfect for people who need to do work or study. I forgot to ask about the WiFi situation but regardless I would go back for the great coffee and the sweet owner and barista!"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-08-08,3.0,The Coffee is great and there's tons of seating and space. But they don't make it particularly inviting for frequent regulars or people who want to use the shop for meetings or working for a couple of hours. They have a sign saying to leave basically after one hour and the owner clearly has disdain for lingering. I understand one level but this place is never busy! There's always tons of room and no one is fighting for space. So if people want to hang out what's the big deal?
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-06-18,5.0,"This cafe offers amazing food, beverages, ​and service to say the least! my personal favorite is the cold brew which is made fresh and tastes heavenly! their food options are filling and so healthy, I come here to study and do work in the mornings. all of the food and the drinks are so fresh and clean, you will become addicted to this place."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-06-07,1.0,"I'm 31 years old and in my entire life, I never had even a similar situation like I had last Thursday. KICKED OUT FROM A COFFEE-SHOP. The ridiculous reason...Because I ordered to less! Please believe me, it's true! There is this creepy, very unsympathetic, bad energy, asian looking woman. She literally told me to leave immediately, because I just ordered an espresso and not her food, which she was rude asking me 3 times and I said no. This was during a job-interview, which I had for my business, very embarrassing by the way. 
I would understand it a little bit, if the space were tiny and there were more customers coming in and don't have a sit available, but the space is huge for a coffee-shop and it was 70% empty at this time. This is absolutely unacceptable, this is not the smart way to treat customers and to run a small business. What she don't know, a very good friend of mind, is a journalist for a powerful Barista Magazine and I will tell her my experience at cofesta. Good luck for the future.."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-01-26,5.0,"I was drawn in by the couches. Huge space, would be great to meet up for a coffee lunch date to network or catch up with old friends. 
I had a hot chocolate with almond milk - whole milk, hemp, and almond options. 
I would suggest adding a coffee table near the couches - not a lot of room for placing down your beverage. 

Nice quiet space I will frequent to escape the office during lunch. Reasonably priced as well."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-07-10,1.0,"Almost 6 bucks for a small iced coffee! I think they need to adjust that price, good luck!"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2019-01-16,5.0,"I love this place! It's a great space for meetings, or hanging out for a couple of hours. I love that it's never packed when I'm there and it's pretty quiet (if you're looking for a quiet space). Although I've never been there on the weekend. The coffee is great, and consistent - which is a big bonus. The avocado toast is generously topped with goodness. Price is NYC standard. And the owner, Bee is super nice and always around to make sure her customers are alright. The staff's also very friendly. A very homey and personable space."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-02-20,2.0,"Welcome to a new cafe because I'm a coffeeholic. I've visited twice of the time, the atmosphere of the cafe is very nice but the taste of coffee is something sad. The latte is watery. I need more flavor:(...."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-04-26,5.0,"Great place, amazing coffee! Taylor and Ana were super nice and hooked it up with great service!"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-08-07,5.0,"My go to coffee spot when I'm at work. Never busy staff is always cool, wifi is always fast. The PBJ is my favorite sandwich here too although they've got great options for anyone."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-01-24,5.0,"Three words : Golden Chai Latte. Specifically, with the Oat milk. I literally would stop drinking milk if my drinks were always made like this. Unfortunately, not every place makes their drinks like this spot. Fortunately, they are two blocks from my job! The Oat milk is creamy, the chai is an amazing blend of spices and not overly sweet, as well as the turmeric blend has a wonderful ginger flavor. I've had it iced and hot and I love both. The baristas are very friendly, and the space is beautiful, and quiet (for now). I am sure to see the location growing and busy over the next few months. The owner told me they will be hosting events in the evenings soon. Looking forward to watching the business grow."
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-07-17,5.0,"Cofesta is hands down one of my favorite coffee shops in the city. From the atmosphere (which is reminiscent of Friends Café Central Perk) to the staff, to the lovely owner, everything about this place is holistic and down to earth. Their coffee and food options are QUALITY. I haven't had espresso this good in years, and their meals have high quality ingredients that make it worth the $$. This place feels like a community and I can't wait to see how the shop grows. (Bonus: so far their playlists have always been fire.)"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-02-06,5.0,"Great cafe with super tasty lattes and a variety of different milks including oat and hemp milk, not typically seen in other cafes. Decided to try the matcha latte (my first ever) and went with oat milk as per the barista's recommendation and i have to say it was delicious. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was good! Everyone who works here is really friendly. Great ambiance as well - pretty chill and not too many people yet as it recently opened but I predict it getting busy soon!"
705,cofesta-new-york-3,2018-05-03,5.0,"I'm here again with friends, cozy environment and tasty drinks, smoked salmon with about cond sandwich is so deliciouslife is good"
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2019-09-04,4.0,"Market place not like a Whole Foods Market but there a lot of food for all tastes.
I saw executives persons and constructions workers having lunch together.
It is self service, the service is not good but the food is.
And it is very cheap."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2020-02-12,3.0,"This is a massive operation. These places always fascinate me with how they make all the food and have it ready. They must not like to sleep. We are talking about a lot of food and all of it looks decently fresh. I got a salad where I picked the ingredient in it. This was a full meal and I didn't even finish it. It was also pretty affordable which is great. When I checked out they gave me a card where if I order 4 salads I get the 5th free. Good deal. 

Anyway, if you need a quick bite and can't decide what to eat you will find something here. This isn't high end food but it does the job."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2019-08-24,5.0,"I'm not a fan of deli buffets, but this place is so impressive. The variety of properly-seasoned and prepared healthy options is outstanding, and if you're careful about weight, it's a great value, too. 

I'm partial to the maki sushi rolls (which feature quality raw tuna and salmon), the hot roasted salmon (which is NOT overcooked), the shrimp salad (plump medium sized and flavorful shrimp), and the fresh baby arugula (crisp, healthy, and weightless)."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2019-09-22,3.0,"We were on the way from penn station to Best Bus and thought of taking a quick break in cafe bistro for a quick breakfast. Place looked huge . They had breakfast, food buffet etc . Had poppy seed bagel and it wasn't well toasted. Didn't taste like a a good N.Y. bagel .. coffee was also average . I don't like vanilla flavor and they by default gave us a vanilla bean coffee . I couldn't ask them for a replacement as we were getting late for our bus . Service was average too . Overall an average experience..."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2018-07-25,2.0,"I have been here a couple times because it is located right next to the 34th Street AMC movie theatre. Besides moviegoers, it appears to get a lot of business from midtown office workers.

Pros:
This place is really large and does have a huge selection of food. They offer sushi, sandwiches, bagels, snacks, and a large variety of hot and cold food and salads in their per-pound buffet section. Fried chicken, pasta, baked chicken, fried fish, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, lo mein, fried rice, egg rolls, sauteed fish, and french fries are just some of the buffet selections.

Cons:
They are super overpriced even by deli standards. It is about $10 per pound of food! They do have a buffet special where after 3pm, it is 50% off - so only $5 per pound. However, by then the food is lukewarm and getting close to inedible. One time I ate the buffet late in the day, and the egg roll and meats were both dry, hard and rubbery. On the other hand, on another occasion, I went around lunch time, and even then I remember the rice being hard and dry. It appears that they re-use food the next day, so don't expect freshness here."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2019-07-31,3.0,"This is a popular place for lunch with standard deli buffet foods. During the day the buffet is $10 /lb which is on par with other similar restaurants in the area but pricy nonetheless. If you come after 3pm though, food is 40% off so basically $6/lb, which makes it very worth the money for the amount of food you can get. I don't recommend getting the tonkatsu because it is hard and stale."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2019-11-06,1.0,"I visited Bistro Market Place today and 20 minutes later, my food had spoiled. It's only 48 degrees in NY, so there's no excuse for the fact that my food spoiled so fast. I hope I receive a response to my email because this wasn't right."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2017-07-26,3.0,"This seems like an ideal place for lunch in the area with a variety of offerings as well as a buffet. If you stop by after work you may be a bit disappointed as they clear away much of the prepared food. They don't really cater to a dinner crowd anyway but it just so happens I was in the area and wanted to grab a quick bite. This seemed to be the healthier alternative than the Five Guys next door so I went with it. Not that I am knocking Five Guys at all just wasn't in that mood. 

I grabbed some sushi and drinks and for pre-packaged sushi it actually wasn't terrible. Not exactly restaurant quality either but good enough for my purposes at the time. What I really loved was the drink selection. They have more Pellegrino flavors than I've ever seen on sale anywhere. There was only one guy at the deli and one cashier but I was walking around trying to find him for a while before he emerged from the back."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2019-01-28,2.0,"Got some greens from the salad buffet in the back that I had to toss out because it smelled and tasted like alcohol. I went back and the employee couldn't tell me what was in it, he agreed that it smelled like alcohol then took a nibble and said it doesn't taste like it, but then why on earth does it smell like that? I'm not sure what I expected them to do for me, but at least toss it so that someone else doesn't have the same experience. The food here needs constant oversight, and I never once felt like they put any effort towards protecting their patrons. I'm done with this place, wish it well."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2019-05-03,5.0,Pretty good place for a cheap meal around the area. Will come from time to time. Nice selections with food stands. Also has a to go buffet bar at $9.99 per lb. pretty decent.
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2019-03-07,3.0,Similar concept to Essen. Employees were friendly but only way I can describe the food is - meh. Don't think I'll be coming back but I did enjoy the avocado and mushrooms.
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2018-05-28,2.0,"My first time here and it was a Sunday wait for my friend to see Infinity War for my second time. The place was open even though I didn't understand know why Yelp! said it was closed. It wasn't too busy at the time and it looked simple enough of your everyday buffet style deli. Nothing catch my eye of your standard Salad bar to cold pasta, sushi and hot food of lomein, fried rice etc.. The area was clean and quiet. I purchased a sugarfree Redbull and sat in the back quietly waiting for my friend to arrive so we can go next door to watch the movie. I may need to come back again to give this place another chance since I haven't tried any of their food. It could be a Ideal after the movie quick bite and go home of a deal but I just didn't find anything appealing at the time."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2018-07-09,2.0,"The food can be a hit or miss, in regards to taste and smell. They are very convenient, and open pretty early. They also have their hot/cold food bar, 50% off after 3pm."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2017-04-25,4.0,"On the 34th st this place is easy to access if you want to grab a lunch on the go. They have a variety of salad, grilled veggies and hot food. Salad bar is better than the hot food bar. They have 5,6 different salad choices and all of they are fresh and delicious. 

I don't recommend their crab plates. They use frozen crab cakes ... it tastes like rubber. So hard to chew!"
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2015-11-29,5.0,"Wonderful place on 34th street to come for lunch or a snack!
Anything and everything you could want and plenty of seating if you want to sit down.

Huge hot and cold Buffets of any and every kind of food with an impressively large fruit and salad selection. Also a separate coffee bar, and a juice bar, deli area, and huge selection of packaged foods including plenty of healthy pre packaged options.  

My son recommended this as a place he had come with friends / parents for lunch and I was impressed with all they had to offer ... 

Fruit salad was fabulous and even had pomegranate seeds Mmm... 
My very picky and health conscious son loves it here and had plenty to eat from a little bit of chicken and lots of veggies from the buffet.

And my post snack/ lunch latte from the green mountain coffee bar was great. 

Recommend for anything everything you could want for lunch or snacks!"
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2018-02-20,2.0,"It seems the place has gone downhill.  Just passed by here during the lunch rush and it was a sad sight to see.  I told the owners many times the guy making the burgers are rude and play favortism towards the female customers.  Owner never listened to me...only offered to take my order to be expedited as an apology.  Well, looks like there's plenty of competition in the area now to take away the business.  It's a shame really, the food is mediocre / ok but convenient."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2018-12-14,1.0,"Come here if you don't mind construction workers cutting the breakfast line with huge orders for their crew.  The staff told them to do this and the people that were ordering one or 2 sandwiches were forced to wait.

706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2019-05-28,3.0,"It's your typical midtown deli with hot food/salad bar buffet that's pay by the pound. I only order the reuben hero or the chicken parmigiana hero. Both of which are good. And during Lent on Friday they have fried fish which is also good. The price is 8.95+tax and it comes with potato chips of the day, pickle and a small container of whatever they have for various selection of soups that day"
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2017-08-24,2.0,"Slow service, mediocre food, and high prices conspire to make Cafe Bistro the ""Last Resort Deli.""  This place seems to have everything -- but nothing is very good. Salads are average, sandwiches are below average, and the service is extremely slow. For entertainment, check out this place's rating trends going back to 2013 -- a steady and consistent decline. It is well deserved."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2018-09-17,5.0,Wow not sure how the previous rating is low... Seems crazy this place is amazing !.. I eat here about twice a week (okay more like 3) times a week during lunch and they have an extremely broad offering of buffet options by the pound (9.99 / lb) I get healthy salmon and chicken and avacado ... They also have fried offerings if your in mood for tasty yet unhealthy ... Great prices clean and very organized !!!

I had chicken, roast pork and some rice. I was surprised by how good the chicken and pork were. Pretty good for food fast. The rice was actually pretty hard. 

Good for a quick bite. Surprisingly pricey for what it is."

This is a complete JACKPOT when you are like me and would rather bring in outside snacks to the movie (absolutely no shame) before splurging on the overpriced microwaved food they have available for purchase.

This place has it all, and provides both hot and cold options. They are indeed pricey (ex. $10+ salad) but like I said, Bistro Market Food is immensely greater than Loews 34th St Movie Theater Food.

There is also seating available."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2016-02-29,4.0,"Have had breakfast & lunch here for the 10 months I've worked half a block away. Today, I had 1 spoonful of each of the meat items at the lunch buffet. Delicious all, with a note that the Seasame chicken is Korean style, reflective of the operators being Korean. As always, a very clean and spacious interior (cavernous, by midtown standards), super popular, super service from very kind staff, super hustle on all the sandwich services, vast diversity for all meal services from fixed stations to the buffet line to the Ramen station in the rear. There're about 50 seats in the front area which never quite fills, even at the peak 1p lunch hour with tourists abuzz between office workers and blue collar workers. There's so much to say here that it's difficult so say it all without it becoming an excessively long review. Always a great meal here."

706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2015-08-06,3.0,"I'd say as far as food courts go this one is pretty good. It's huge. (And has an impressive cooler of large bakery cakes for some reason, but I digress.) This post is about lunch because that's what the main event is all about. There's a lot of variety. Check out is fast. The food, as with many food courts, is by the pound -- a pricey pound. (Of course, because it's New York where everyone doesn't mind spending $10 for lunch.) There's two deli counters and a build your own salad counter too. They have enough drink options to rival a midwestern grocery store. (You could start a blog by just reviewing new drinks from this place each week. Most I've never seen or heard of.) All the hot food seems eh to me.  But the veggie and fruit bar is the best thing about the place in my opinion. Roasted Brussels sprouts and cauliflower."

They also had the gall to chase after me saying that my card was declined. It wasn't."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2015-09-19,4.0,"Definitely a personal favorite of mine! Very convenient location for my NYC offices, or your trip to Penn Station, or MSG. 

The sheer selection of food here is what is most impressive. If you want sushi, pizza, fresh fruit, salad, fried chicken, Italian, Chinese, fresh smoothie, club, panini, chopped salad, chips, snacks, or candy this is your place. Not only is the food selection extensive but they have drinks here you wouldn't even know existed, any type of water, sport drink, energy drink, or tea you saw advertised will be sold here. 

The guys behind the panini/club sandwich bar are hit or  miss. I like a particular wrap without ranch (California). Sometimes they'll do it sometimes they tell me they can't. 

The salad bar next to the paninis/clubs is like ""Chop't"". You order 5 toppings and your green then they'll mix and chop it for you.

The salad bar is extensive. I always just grab pineapple and watermelon but they have sooooo much! My lunch here is easily $16 when you account for a salad, Evian, and some fruit which is weighed.

Highly recommend you check it out. 

Warning: most cash registers (there are 7) are cash only. The cash registers next to the juice bar are normally CC friendly. There is an ATM here as well."

Tony at the salad station is the man tho and ramen/udon station is legit! Hate the fact they use styrofoam containers for those soups. 

Sidenote: cafes like this need to stop using so many plastic bags. 

Management is cool and remembered me since I never wanted a bag for my lunches."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2016-11-16,2.0,They probably get sandwhich/breakfast orders right 30% of the time. There is no electronic ordering system so they just try to memorize everyone's order. Unfortunately it's the closest place to my office so I end up going more than I should.
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2012-06-28,3.0,"Dropped in here yesterday to pick up some snacks before boarding the Rocks Off Party bus to Iron Maiden concert at Jones Beach. Nice bistro deli with a ton of variety.

They layout made kit easy to find what we wanted quickly with many drinks in the fridges, lots of snacks/protein bars to choose from, seating in front and back, and is pretty clean looking.

It's basically one large cafeteria deli. They offer everything from breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, pizza, made to order sandwiches, hot and cold buffet options, salad bar, juice bar, and everything in between. Prices are in-line with what you can expect for the area. A bit pricey but not horrible.

Given it's close proximity to Penn Station and the Hammerstein Ballroom this place is probably a nicer option to grab something to eat before getting on a train or seeing  a concert, but I would also think it's a tourist magnet too."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2012-06-28,4.0,"- decent open buffet breakfast/lunch selection
- recommend: corn chowder soup, bibimbop, chicken noodle soup, breakfast sandwiches, salads, (complimentary garlic knots)
- made to order: pasta, salads, sandwiches, smoothies, sushi
- prompt service
- soups, salads, and pasta come with complimenary garlic knots
- comparable pricing for the area
- avoid the seafood bisque, it's inedibly salty"
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2017-07-26,1.0,"Horrible. The guy here is so rude. Ordered scrambled eggs with cheese and it was so dry and over cooked that I decided not to get it. Then the manager or owner or whoever the rude loser with the 90s kangol hat on is decided to yell at me and say ""you don't deserve my kindness"" like what? How are you kind? Don't go here unless you want to be screamed at. I also found a hair in my food before but wanted to give this place another shot. Avoid at all costs."
706,bistro-market-place-new-york-2,2016-01-21,3.0,"Compared to other deli/cafe/food courts in the area, Bistro is one of the better choices with lot of options for hot and cold foods. They have an extensive menu for sandwiches, sushi, salads, and noodles too. Those guys work fast, building your huge sandwiches and salads! The sandwiches are pretty big, I usually can't finish it in one sitting. They carry tons of snacks including hummus, milk, yogurts, tons of assorted drinks, chips, candy, etc! I also like that there's plenty of seating area by the windows as well. Best of all, prices seem fair and the register ladies are always quick and efficient, perfect for a rough morning when you need a quick breakfast. I would stay away from the snack and drink items though, those are a bit pricier than other locations."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2017-01-07,5.0,"As a regular coffee drinker, surprisingly I haven't tried macchiato in my life. So today I decided to shortly stop by Eataly, and give a taste in the famous Caffe Vergnano.

They indeed carried a handful of selection, so making a decision became the toughest choice. My barista was super nice and recommended the crema coffee, which carried less sweetness yet a lot more aroma. Loved it! 

They open at 9am during the weekend, FYI."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2019-07-18,4.0,This place is inside Eataly. They have a very fancy steel tall expresso maker. It looks cool. I went for a shot of expresso. Quantity was miniscule. But coffee was good. It came with a side of a cookie.
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2019-05-03,5.0,"The espressos really are perfect.  The only negative is the crush of clients who press against the bar and vie for the barista's attention.  As far as I can tell, there's no concept of standing in an orderly line to order one's drink.  I was ok with this and managed to place my order fairly quickly on two consecutive busy afternoons."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2018-11-18,5.0,"Caffe Vergnano in Eataly is one of the best in nyc. Partly it's the highest quality of roast beans, and the other ingredient is their barista, Derrick. He has the touch of someone who effortlessly understands how to create a perfect creamy foam at the right temperature. 
We used to have our cappuccinos at next shop at Caffe Lavazza. The turnover and untrained baristas produces a mediocre sometimes undrinkable espresso. One only needs to look at the Italian customers from Italy drinking espresso at Caffe Vergnano to know it's the best place in town."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2018-03-06,5.0,"Great espresso spot right in Eatily serving up some of the most delicious roasts in the city. A double of the Jamaican roast and I was good all day. The flavors were great and the precision of the pull was noted. Stop by, stand at the counter, drink an espresso by yourself or with a friend, just like they do in the old country!"
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2017-12-07,4.0,The woman at the bar had a terrible service attitude. Espressos are standard. You can also add petit fours for about $1.50-2 each.
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2016-07-09,5.0,Really enjoyed their macchiato! I've had the pleasure of drinking one in Italy and I will vouch for its authenticity.
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2018-08-20,2.0,"Though I would like to leave a positive review for the coffee, the service was seriously lacking this weekend. We stood waiting near the register for what seemed like an eternity just to have our order taken. At that time, there were two people working behind the counter filling other orders I assume, but not taking new ones. Occasionally, one of the two workers would wander away to work at another stand despite the line of customers that was quickly forming. Eventually there was a changing of the guard (single female) who did wait on us and quickly fill our order despite the fact that she was only one person."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2011-05-28,4.0,"Staying up late eating and drinking Gin Cocktails..then waking up doing the same again... Yes I am on vacation.... 

Walking around Manhattan feeling like a Zombie... since I am never a morning person.... Followed my friend inside Eataly facing more crowds and my senses got assulted by all the food.... 

Then I saw the sign... This big shiny Espresso Machine... and the smell of fresh coffee in the air!! And of course all these people staying around the espresso bar sipping their coffee..! I AM IN!! 

Mmmm Mmmm..Espresso ($2.25) really hit the spot! Strong... Bitter... with a hint of nut...I drank it straight up! 

Now I am ready go find my friends... who I lose them on purpose so I can enjoy my espresso....."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2015-09-21,2.0,"First, I am not reviewing the caffe.  My review is of their espresso pods for Nespresso machines.
In short.  I find the coffee ""crappy"".  (That's a technical term.)
The coffee is very sharp and doesn't have a lot of the traditional Italian flavor or smoothness one would find such as  Illy."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2014-04-21,5.0,"One of the best espressos in NYC.
I'm a huge coffee snob and this is the place I go to when I feel like good quality coffee.
The menu only consists of espresso and macchiato however you can ask for extra milk in your macchiato if you're originally a latte drinker like me.
This is not a sit down cafe as there are no seats.  Dont expect to come here with a nice book and spend hours drinking and chatting with friends. It's just a small espresso bar in Eataly where you stand around the bar, drink your coffee and go.
It's right across Madison Sq Park so you can take your coffee outside and sit around the park if it is a nice day."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2014-05-21,4.0,"Closest thing in NYC that I can find to espresso bars in Italy. Walk up, 2.50, have your espresso in a real cup, not paper, a little cookie, and on your way...."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2016-07-16,4.0,Excellent coffee and perfect for that quick caffeine fix you need whilst walking around Eataly. The stand up bar reminds me perfectly of espresso bars in Italy. The adjoining treatie bar has a tasty treat for every sweet tooth.
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2012-07-03,4.0,"Wonderfully nice cafe, and get here, you will be satisfied. And try their espresso and Cornetto."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2013-04-29,4.0,"Someone please correct this its incorrect;
The Coffee
i like the fact that theres 3 items on the menu.  single/double espresso shots and macchiatos.  No quadruple venti frappe monsters here just good shots at a decent price ($2.50 or 2.75).  It's not the best shot i've had in the city but its a 5 min walk from my work and I'll usually get a shot or cap after having a meal at eataly.
The Beans
I come here to buy beans if I can't make it to my usual spots.  They carry pretty good quality beans, I go for the $13-18/ LB beans to feed my espresso machine at home.  

I'll keep coming back"
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2011-08-08,4.0,"You can't get a latte here, or a extra tall mocha, thankfully. It's just espresso and macchiatto. It's lovely to have a place in NY that is like most of the coffee bars in Italy."
707,caffe-vergnano-new-york,2011-08-08,5.0,Excellent expresso and macchiatos within Eataly.  No more and no less.  Not for american coffee or cappuccinos.
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-04-27,5.0,"This place just opened up a few months ago and I'm so happy they did! They have been open during this quarantine period and it's the only thing keeping me sane!

The donuts are so delicious!! They are so soft they melt in your mouth. The people that work here are the nicest!! They are happy to help you pick out your favorite donuts and they are super friendly. 

Everyone is respectful here and only 1 customer can go in the store at a time. Everyone waits outside and 6 feet apart. It's so nice to see a good system in place. 

Thank you Krispy Kreme for being opening during this difficult time for us New Yorkers (and the world) and thank you to the staff that risks their lives everyday to come to work!! We appreciate you!!

I went to this establishment tonite around 7:50 and I must say the staff was A-1, greeting with smiles professionalism and the place was very bright and clean.  For this to be my first Krispy Kreme experience, I enjoyed it and my old coworkers were very appreciative for the two dozen of glazed dozens I brought to them. Thanks again for being kind and professional during this pandemic I'll definitely be back soon!!!!"
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-05-17,5.0,"Due to Covid it's extremely hard to even want to go anywhere. It was a nice day so a friend and I decided to take a drive and get some Krispy Kreme! The wait was great! We ordered online and a sweet worker came out socially distanced and all asking if anyone had an order! Timing was perfect, donuts of course no complaints! Mini assorted donuts! Glazed perfectly, the others had just the right amount of flavors! Soft bite! Sweet taste! All workers were so nice even saw a few go in and be treated politely! :)"
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-05-05,4.0,"My husband LOVES his Krispy Kreme. 

The store is small, but the service is fast and they seem to have a good offering of doughnuts.

With COVID, the tiny-ness of the place makes it somewhat awkward and I imagine in a non-COVID world it must me a pain in the butt with the long line to get in. 

But, the service was friendly, the doughnuts were fresh and my hubby was happy.

Can't beat that."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-03-03,5.0,"Came here for the first time today to get my birthday reward, a doughnut and small coffee. It's such a small place, crowded. But the staff were so nice and patient! Hope they will stay like this forever! 

I love Krispy Kreme doughnut.. way better than Dunkin'. But today was the first time I tried their iced hazelnut coffee and it was.. better than Dunkin'! Lol! 
The manager made great coffee! And she is very friendly and helpful with my reward too!!

Hope they keep up with their friendliness!!"
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-03-30,5.0,"I love Krispy Kreme donuts and am so excited we have a few in NYC now. But I love them more now because they are taking care of healthcare workers during this time of crisis. The staff working when I stopped by were cheerful and definitely put a smile on my face.
Thank you so much for looking out for us!"
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-25,3.0,"Came here after brunch. Had wanted to check out the new Krispy Kreme flagship store i read about. Unfortunately, this wasn't it (Doh!..). 
This KK outpost has no seating, & is quite small. 
I bought a 'pack of 3' since i'd made the trek. 
Not sure if my taste buds are evolving, as i thought that some of the donuts were sweeter then i remembered (especially the jelly filled one). 
Staff was super nice; & friendly. 

*KK flagship store will be open in May (per store employee)"
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-07,5.0,"Krispy Kreme is on the comeback trail.  First, last week they opened the revamped last remaining NYC outpost at Pen Station. Now this week they open this shop on 6th Ave and they plan two more openings, one in May for a Flagship mega size shop in the heart of Times Square. 

I came today and got the doughnut holes since I never had them before, which only comes in the original classic glazed version in cups or in a small box of 24 at less than $6 and they tastes just like the big round cousins.  Before I knew it I ate the equivalent of almost 3 doughnuts because as you know Krispy Kreme original glaze is what propelled them to national awareness and reprograms your brain to want more. 

They also have a wide assortment of coffees and chocolate drink options as while as other cold drinks. The shop is small but well staffed to handle the constant flow of customers."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-04,4.0,"Grand opening today Feb 4!
Love Krispy Kreme doughnuts. 
But New York only has one store in Penn station.
I'm so glad they open another location.  And on the flyer, it said the time square  flag store will be opening in May 2020! Can't wait!

I love their original glaze so much. It's so soft. Can't go wrong with that.
I like to microwave just few sec. it's little warm and taste even better!
And Valentine's Day is coming. They have lots of special one for that. Very cute!
 
I got here around 8:00pm today. There are 2 lines. One you can grab a box to go. ( prob all original one) no wait.
Another line is to enter the store. Which takes me about 10 mins to wait."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-14,5.0,"I was devastated when I saw that this Krispy Kreme was briefly closed for renovations. Especially because it is the only location in Manhattan.

Nothing beats a warm classic glazed donut. Even though I live relatively close, I always buy at least a dozen donuts whenever I stop by. The only times I've ever left with just one donut was when I would redeem my free birthday donut. 

I don't give a hoot about fancy artisanal donuts. I'd take a Krispy Kreme over a D**ghn*t Pl*nt any day."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-05,5.0,"I made it to the grand opening yesterday &  I think I even beat the rush.  I had images of a line around the block but it wasn't there at 11 something am.  Finally got to try the doughnut holes (they didn't have these back in the day & all you had in my hometown were the Munchkins at Dunkin Donuts).  They're definitely a treat.  I also got a warm reception when I mentioned that I'm from Winston Salem, NC (the place where this company was founded).

Some things you should know: it's tiny, you can't sit and they've got merchandise for sale (cups and trucker hats).  They do sell half dozens though I didn't see that listing on the menu.  I'm hoping I won't regret the full dozen I bought since I've only got a limited stomach capacity and some of them might get stale before I finish.  There's no ""Hot & Fresh"" sign but it IS closed off so perhaps you won't be accosted by beggars like you would be waiting in the line at Penn Station.

The staff is learning the system (I had gift cards so it took more time on my order) but everybody was nice and I think I had cred being a Winston Salem native.  For NYC, this is definitely an improvement over the Penn Station location."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-10,4.0,"Came to check out the new Krispy Kreme on a Sunday afternoon. There was a little wait outside the store to manage customer flow. The store is pretty small so there's not much room to stay and eat, it's more of a pick up and go. The staff was super friendly and gave my friend a free donut for being at a Krispy Kreme for the first time. 

Ordered:
Strawberries and Cream - super sweet but heart shaped and cute
Cake Batter - also on the sweet side but more manageable
New York Cheesecake - the cream had a lemony tang to it which was a little weird
Original Kreme - glazed donut with marshmallow cream

tldr; you can never go wrong with their original glazed donut"
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-07,5.0,So glad there's a Krispy Kreme at this location now! It just opened and is super packed at all tImes. Love the variety of flavors and the pleasant service of the super warm  staff. I got the Chocolate Kreme Heart and my friend got NewYork Cheesecake. Both amazing in their own ways.
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-03-01,5.0,"The customer service was impeccable. As soon as you walk in, they greet you with smiles and welcome-ness. Super nice staffs. They offer us some free samples of the donut holes, glazed, which were good. 

We ordered three glazed donuts to go for $4.59. Not bad for midtown location.  Would definitely return."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-20,5.0,"This is my first time ordering from Krispy Kreme and I'm glad it was an awesome first time experience! It's a tiny store with no seating (you just go in, order, pay, & leave), however, employees are very efficient. Once you enter, you line up on the left side. Then, an employee will take your order and once your order is done being taken, you're directed to the cash register area where you pay for your order. Efficient service! 

When it comes to fast food establishments, I'm accustomed to unfriendly customer service. The employees here are incredibly sweet, friendly, and courteous (especially even when I mistakenly stood in the wrong area to order, dumb me). Keep it up! Maybe this is one of the reasons why Krispy Kreme is well known? Great donuts and customer service. 

The donuts are delicious! I came to the store around 8 PM and they were fully stocked with all of their donuts. Also, the donuts looked so beautifully fresh. An assorted dozen (customizable) costs $15. So worth it! I'm definitely coming here again and again until my pancreas gives out!"
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-06-08,5.0,"Great staff and service! I was purchasing 3 dozens of assorted doughnuts and they were very patient while I picked out all the different flavors they provided. Definitely recommend Krispy Kreme's doughnuts, especially the original glaze (warmed for 8 sec in the microwave) and this location, friendly/fast customer service and clean."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-03-30,5.0,"This might be a tiny space, but the staff has big personalities and ample offerings!  Such a comical friendly bunch.  They were able to tell me all the different locations that will be arriving in the coming months, even those offering the infamous ""hot"" doughnuts.  If I want a regular Krispy Kreme I will likely visit this location instead of the one in Penn Station, it is so much brighter, cleaner and nicer.  I hope one day they will squeeze a machine to make the doughnuts."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-05-23,4.0,"Yeah they are a bit too sweet & unhealthy but I just love the texture and overall taste!  It's hard to find a donut that melts in your mouth like a Krispy Kreme donut.  On days where I have a very bad sweet tooth, it just really hits the spot."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-03-04,5.0,"Was so excited when I walked past this store! I love Krispy Kreme. The store is clean and brightly lit. No seating, lots of flavors. Yum."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-05-01,1.0,"The cashier is so mean!!! She doesn't belong in there.
I asked nicely. And she answered me with attitude!
I should be the one with attitude coz I start working with patients since 5am. Rudeness is not the right attitude at this unprecedented time.
She will ruin Krispy kreme!"
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-06,4.0,"Krispy Kreme is doing New Yorkers a solid by opening up more locations in the city. I am very happy that they are opening more stores, and also glad that they're putting them in places that won't  put small donut shops out of business. There are  however, things that needs improvements for future locations. First, this is right near the OTHER location in Penn Station--and they are the same quality donuts. Now, I don't have to go into the station to get my donut fix... okay, beggars can't be choosers. The line system inside is a little confusing. Do you order at the register, or the counter? No ones seems to know, and dealing with the confused people is cumbersome. The staff were nice but you could tell they were stressed. There's nowhere to eat your donut. And my biggest grief is that there's no conveyor belt with hot and fresh glazed donuts. I really hope that the other new locations have this, because it is the one thing that really makes Krispy Kreme stand out from other chain competitors. Manhattan prices to be expected. Sidenote: there was a sweepstakes that people could win donuts for a year and people seem to be confused about it, as if they didn't know how to clarify the details of how to win. There was also no signage about it inside the very small store front. I would call this more of a pop-up that is around full-time."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-12,5.0,"With the Penn station location under renovation, I have not been able to get any Krispy Kreme for many weeks. I'm so glad I saw this new locational the other day. Today I came back to get my dozen for the office. Everybody will be super happy."
708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-02-10,4.0,So excited for this location. Not a full store but a good variety of items (donuts and drinks) and pre-packed dozen donuts in case you need to grab on the run. Staff was fast and efficient. Join the Krispy Kreme rewards program to make sure you get your free donut or drink with the purchase of one dozen.

708,krispy-kreme-new-york-6,2020-04-27,1.0,"Extremely rude girl behind the counter. Went on a Monday after work and was told by this employee that they were already sold out of the plain glazed after having stood in line over 20 minutes. The issue was that she jumped down my throat about it, because I had inquired about when exactly they had informed ""everybody"" in line about it when I had been standing there and didn't hear a peep about it.  There's perhaps a time and a place for ghetto behaviors, but over donuts? Not necessary."

709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2020-01-19,4.0,"Came here for TEA TIME - and it's 4.5 stars!   

Excellent service: everyone was friendly, and attentive. Down to earth for a posh restaurant.

Awesome Atmosphere: the interior is modern and warm, cool and comfortable furniture. Love all the windows bringing light and cityscape in. The place setting had these super fun butterfly plates and cups. 

We got to sit in the booth, which was awesome haha - more room for our jackets and bags, and table room for tea time towers. It was very comfortable and great for conversation. 

The food: so the food overall was good, but just a few things that was ok. 

[[[The sandwiches]]]: LOVED how each person got 3 types, and two of each! Yum! Chicken salad, lobster salad, and smoked salmon cucumber. All tasted good. Salmon was classic, the other two were good and a little more creamy because of the sauce which made it even more tasty. Only sad thing was I had a shell in my lobster sandwich... but the two ppl I was with didn't have any shells. 

[[[scone]]] there's only one per person. It was ok. Think it could have been softer in the center. Bigger or serve 2. The clotted cream could have been better if fluffier. It was a bit dense. The flavor was also ok.

[[[cookie]]] one small chocolate chip cookie. It tasty very firm/crispy. But just a minute too long. It was ok

[[[macarons]]] get two different flavor ones. They were perfect texture. The coconut one was good. The other one was ok.

[[[chocolate petit four bite]]] one piece - it was a tiny tart with chocolate cream and coco nibs, good as a bite. 

[[[zucchini cake with berries]]] it was ok. I think i would have preferred a sweeter cake. This was kinda savory, and on top with the macaroon. Soft tender texture, the cream was confusing like a savory mayo or cream cheese 

[[[ tea ]]] tea options were very good. Impressive. 

So overall: the sandwiches were good, and sweets can use some work. The service and ambiance is 5/5 - one of the best spots in nyc. So with all that in mind, if you're looking for a comfortable place to catch up, and not looking for the best pastries in nyc, then this is a very good spot."

Ambiance 

I have never shopped at Neiman Markus, and therefore, never even knew there was a wonderful restaurant held within. Very happy my girlfriend T took me there! In Chicago it's called Mariposa, New York, Zodiac. 

I've only done brunch there, which starts with a huge popover, and an amazing chicken consommé.  Consommé takes skill and theirs is amazing. Clear and full of chicken.flavor. Major kudos! Tresa loves the popovers with strawberry butter. I do too but it's a reason she will go there. 

Mimosas and brunch....perfect. Last time she had the lobster Benedict and I had the burger ( not a huge breakfast person). Both were spot on. More expensive that I would usually choose, but such a perfect spot to take a significant other that it's absolutely worth it. 

In New York, at Zodiac, it was T and I and three of her closest friends. We had an amazing meal, great conversation, and our server Rhoe ( assuming I mangled the spelling) made our meal even better. Honest and attentive, a rare thing in a server. 

So, I wouldn't stop there by myself for lunch, but with a significant other or with a couple of dear friends, it's very worth it!"
709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2019-11-09,5.0,"Wish I could Brunch here every Sunday, it's one of my happy places! Sitting on the top of Neiman Marcus looking out over Hudson Street, sipping a Bellini, waiting for my Lobster Benedict, I'm content!

While the food is delicious and reasonably priced, especially for NYC, what sets the Zodiac apart is the impeccable service. From the minute we entered the restaurant we were greeted and received attentive service throughout our meal. Bellinis arrived instantly followed by their trademark popovers, fresh from the oven, warm, crisp on the outside and airy on the inside, the strawberry butter takes them over the top. 

For brunch we both had the lobster Benedict. I prefer my eggs scrambled and they accommodated without question. While the English muffin and eggs were delicious, the lobster was the star of the dish and there were huge chunks of this tender meat, enhanced by the hollandaise, not overwhelmed by it. When I come back, it will be challenging to order anything else knowing this is on the menu!

The Benedict was served with roasted potatoes that were the best I've ever had. They were most likely cooked in duck fat, twice, making them super crisp on the outside with billowy, fluffy potato inside.  I'm not even a potato person, but I'd come back just for these!

The decor is understated elegance meets clean lines - all in shades of sterling, gray-blue and wood. The bar that greets you upon entering is beautiful as are each of the rooms that follow. 

We never felt rushed and when our brunch took a little longer to arrive, another round of Bellini showed up in the house. 

Would love to try their afternoon tea next time, if I can pull myself away from the lobster!"
709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2019-10-24,5.0,"Excellent afternoon tea experience.

Tea: lots of great options for everyone's various tastes with high quality tea

Food: they were great about customizing sandwiches, which some places don't do. I hate cucumber and usually have to skip on them, but they were able to customize for my preferences. The scones were super buttery, which loved, although I didn't love the raisins inside. They also gave us free popovers with strawberry jam, and their complimentary chicken broth was hearty and amazing!

Service: superb. Very attentive; water (both hot and cold) refilled promptly, and they checked in on us often without being too annoying.

Ambience: I love the views from some of the window tables. It has a very classy feel, but not as cozy as some of the other afternoon tea that I've been to. Not a bad thing; just different.

Definitely going back! This place is now in my rotation of afternoon tea places."
709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2020-02-07,4.0,"Came here for a lunch reunion with old colleagues. We walked in and were seated right away. I will admit I didn't know this place existed inside the mall, it's a bit of a hidden gem. Everything about this place feels special (tbh, the price reflects it). Our waitress was super knowledgeable and was very good at up selling the food. Tbh, I thought the popovers were just ok. The scallops were amazing. My friends enjoyed their meal. They got the pot luck special (soup and salad combo) and I got the mandarin orange soufflé w chicken salad. The soufflé was very gelatinous- but paired well with the chicken salad. Would definitely love to come back for tea and try new things!"

Highly recommend before they get popular and increase the prices!!!"
709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2019-11-24,5.0,"We went for the afternoon tea.  We got there shortly before 3pm. The afternoon tea set-up was beautiful with a very delicate China set. Overall, we had an amazing experience. 

There were several selections of tea. I had the Citrus Rooibus and I also tried my friend's Jardin Bleu. Both were very delicate and nice. Went very well with the lemon scones, birthday macarons, nite size lemon tarts, and chocolate chip cookies. The savory part included lobster sandwich, tuna fish sandwich, and chicken olive tapenade sandwich. entually became dinner. Afternoon tea eventually became dinner.

Ambience was very nice. Decor is very modern and there is good natural lighting in the room thanks to the floor to ceiling windows. It wasn't crowded today, so the noise level wasn't to bad. Price for the afternoon tea without the champagne I thought is pretty reasonable. Definitely recommend this place for a ladies afternoon tea after some shopping at Neiman."
709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2019-04-11,5.0,"Overall a great restaurant and bar on Level 7 of the brand new Neiman Marcus flagship store at Hudson Yards.

Take the elevator either from the Plaza (next to the vessel) or from the 10th Ave entrance and head to the 7th floor. Walk to the back corner past the luxury jewelry. There is a bar and lounge area, then the restaurant seating. There is a bathroom that is technically outside the restaurant, inside the store, next to Chloé haute couture.

Wherever you sit, each guest receives a complimentary popover, an egg based pastry, served with strawberry cream. It was served warm and tears easily for a delicious starter.

We had the Frito Misto: delicately fried mushrooms, potatoes and cauliflower ($20). We got 2 drinks: A kolsch beer from Poughkeepsie ($8) and a mezcal cocktail called Urban Sophisticate ($19). Heads up they don't have beer on draft so you'll be offered your canned beer in a glass. The cocktail was very tasty as well.

Lots of great app and dinner options, a fully stocked bar, and great service. Would definitely return for a bite after some high end shopping!"
709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2019-08-28,5.0,"Childhood memory sometimes tints an otherwise ordinary experience with the filtered lens of nostalgia. In this case the recollection lens is crystal clear, as here is a new Zodiac Room that manages to be even more special than the original in Dallas.

What always sets the zodiac room apart is service. Everyone here exemplifies the highest level of service. From the wait staff, especially the dynamic and even tempered Siobhan, to the thoughtful and attentive management as represented by Chris, all is about giving the highest level of quality interaction.

And of course, there are the magical Popovers.

Enjoy a drink in the bar, if you wish, before being seated in the small but divinely Internet dining area. My personal favorite table is the one reserved for larger parties of six or more that is in the far south east corner and overlooks 10th Ave. down towards downtown. The walk across plush carpet to the table is one that reminds us of it a more graceful time, at least for wall-to-wall floor coverings.  The color palette is all cool blues and smooth wood.  Any man or woman would feel comfortable here but not crowded out as the decoration is sparse, committed to elegance and with a Scandinavian, slightly later than mid-century feel.

The food is undeniably American but in an elegant and light palette. Of course the popovers are not to be missed, but as well any of their signature salads are hearty enough for a meal.  I tend to linger over the desert here which is always complemented by my secret knowledge of the off the menu delicious macaroons.

Come here for the atmosphere but keep coming back for the treatment. It's such a delight to have fine food, and a fine setting, at a reasonable although upper end, price.

TL/dr: class all the way for both simple dining & environs"

It's the perfect retreat for a meal, glass of wine and rest from shopping at Hudson Yards! I love the broth and bread that comes with every meal, the steak salad is my favorite! Ally is a great bartender too! Really, the nicest people work here! 
Good vibes only!"

1. Beautiful and large space.  Has two sections and we set the section with large windows to outside. 

2. Simple, high priced and high quality foods(please remember it is inside the Neiman Marcus so expect high price please) 

3. Good service and simple menu."

I normally bring my lunch to work every day, but today on purpose I decided not to. The corona virus is sparking fear in everyone around the globe and understandably so. However, I don't want to live in fear family. I stayed in my home all weekend because of fear of this virus, and it's unnatural. Today I wanted to enjoy a nice meal in a nice restaurant.
The Zodiac Room, tucked away in a corner on the 7th floor of Neiman Marcus in Hudson Yards. Once you find it, you're amazed at how quaint it is inside. It opens to a very nice dining room, showing off the décor as well as the wine chiller in the corner. The bar is well lit and the counter of the bar appears to be marble and lit just right. I plan to return JUST to visit the bar area. I know the drill, so I follow the hostess to my table of choosing, drop my coat and proceed to take pictures. When I return to my table my server arrives with a nice complimentary hot cup of chicken consommé, and a complimentary popover (which was luke warm) accompanied by softened strawberry butter. She fills my water glass and leaves me to review the menu. When she returns I order a glass of rose wine, and the tagliatelle with cauliflower, shaved almonds and raisins. The tagliatelle was actually very tasty but the sauce was way too thick and I didn't care for the texture.  The plating and presentation was very nice, but that's it as far as the meal goes. The meal was ""okay"", but my server was very pleasant and attentive to my needs. I give my meal a 7 and my service a 10. Nicely done!

709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2019-10-23,4.0,"Great interior and menu design, but the food was a little disappointing. The salad was okay, decent tasting also a huge portion. But the burger wasn't good"
709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2019-08-05,5.0,"A little less crowded comparing to all the other restaurants at the Hudson Yards.  Love the decor, and service is impeccable.  

We came here for a quiet Sunday afternoon tea, with a napping baby.  The tea set itself is gorgeous, with free hot water refills in your teapot.  Between two of us, we have 12 pieces of sandwiches (one of the options is lobster sandwich) and a good selections of deserts, only thing I wish is to have another piece of the delicious scones.  For $45pp is a very good deal in the area.  I would rank this place highest among everywhere else in the city for overall afternoon tea experience.

Definitely will come back for lunch and afternoon tea, they have some amazing pastries at the door but only serve for dinner/lunch.  They also have a bar/lounge area in the front of the restaurant, which would be a nice spot to come in between shopping at NM."
709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2019-06-21,5.0,"This is Neiman Marcus' first NYC store and its signature restaurant does not disappoint. 
The restaurant is beautiful in a soft and quiet way and sports a sleek mid-century modern design. Like a Miami Beach restaurant without the unnecessary flourishes. The dining room has tables that are nicely spaced from one another (a shame for us as there was a celebrity at the next table) and seating is very comfortable.

The Zodiac Room does not have a view of The Vessel (go to nearby Queensyard Restaurant for that) and the view facing east and north bound is quite ordinary. 
No problem because the food and service compensate for any view inadequacy. 

The usual popovers are served with the great butter, although my popovers were slightly burned - a first for me in a Neiman Marcus dining room but they were still good

Our server was excellent as was the whole staff - from the friendly host to the bussers. 
The level of service was higher than other Neiman Marcus restaurants I have dined in - for example I spotted the waitress waiting near the kitchen to bring out entrees until another employee straightened out our silverware - Zodiac Room is that kind of place.

The food was excellent - not cutting edge - wow this is best food you've ever had excellent but excellent when factoring in service, dining room comfort and food.

The burrata appetizer was nicely plated and good. A pasta dish while simple was nicely flavored and cooked al dente. Parmesan chicken (NOT chicken parm, well because this is Neiman Marcus) was also simple but better than most.
Dessert was the best part of the meal and the chocolate mousse (or something akin to it) was decadent and excellent. 

The Zodiac Room is not cheap and our bill came out higher than usual because we had drinks but this is a great place to relax and even languish over lunch."
709,the-zodiac-room-new-york-2,2019-12-07,5.0,"Highly recommend this lovely restaurant in Neiman Marcus. The chicken broth to start and the amazing pop overs with strawberry butter..... the best!

710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2020-02-05,5.0,In my sleepy commuter haze this morning I knocked my coffee over at the coffee bar. The two managers standing nearby jumped into action. I walked out with a new coffee and the floor was dried up in less than 2 minutes! Thanks for the help guys.
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2019-03-20,5.0,"This place is truly amazing! Lots of healthy options and I love that it shows more than just the fat and calories but also the sodium!
I have HP and on medicine so salt intake is really important to me, however a lot of places do not have that shown.
It's usually only fat, calories, and maybe sugar.
The salad was fresh and delicious!"
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2019-10-15,1.0,"I was short changed today. At about 6:30pm at Pret store in Penn Station, I gave a 20-dollar bill over the counter for a cup of white tea which is $2.99. It is $3.24 after tax. Guess what, the casher gave me back $1.76 change and insisted I gave him a 5-dollar bill. I asked the manager to review what was recorded by the video camera above the counter. The manager refused my request and said I had no right to see what was recorded. 
 
It is not about a 20-dollar bill. It is about what is right and what is wrong, It is about how a customer was treated. I will never visit this store again. I would have given it zero star if I could."

Toasted sandwiches are decent. I some how don't like the coffee that much, even though it's organic.
Btw, they did away with their power outlets."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2019-02-07,4.0,This is located in Penn Station on the LIRR level right before the 7th ave exit on the corner. A place to find some quiet when awaiting your train back to Long Island. I'm a fan of the soups at Pret so I usually will grab a big soup on a cold day. They have a variety of coffees too. The allergy information is listed on the signs when picking out items so that is also very helpful. Also...this location has a bar! Yup. So for that after work-before commute drink it's the perfect spot. It has plenty of seating and long communal tables if you're with a group. Also a private bathroom for paying customers so you don't need to go to the public one in Penn Station.

But todaaaaaaaay, I ordered the Veggie fiesta salad and BABBBBBBY when I tell you it is DELISH!!!!  The salad was so pretty and colorful that I almost didn't want to eat it.  Fresh avocado, black beans, charred corn, grape tomatoes, pickled red onions, quinoa, brown rice and cilantro over a bed romaine.  With a side of chipotle ranch dressing.  MMMMM MMMM good.  I sure hope this is not a seasonal dish!"

This Penn Station locale is very busy but you can rely on the quick turnaround. Their daily signature sandwiches are always good. I particularly like the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and the Cheddar/Tomato sandwich. I also suggest any avocado themed items, it hits the spot ... makes me think I am eating slightly healthier, ha. 

I also noticed they sell Chia snack cups. Looks delicious. Will have to try it some time.  Seems to be the trend."

710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2019-03-17,3.0,"This is the Pret with beer and wine. The staff is nice. However, occasionally you have to wait for the bartender to show up. The location is not too busy and this place is spacious - lots of seats, and different types. Plus private bathrooms! This would be a solid five-star rating if not for one thing: TURN YOUR MUSIC DOWN....LEAN INTO THIS PLACE BEING A WORKSPACE like the Ace Hotel's Lobby.

I get keeping the music loud during happy hour and important games. However, most days and hours, people are here with laptops and books, trying to get their work done. You're working against your own darn self trying to ignite a club-like/bar-like atmosphere that just isn't there. It's Penn station for god's sake!

I would spend hours here, buying snacks and drinks, if the music was half the volume and I could focus. Instead, I find myself going to the Ace Hotel Lobby and the Nomad Library Bar, and spending my time and money. They understand how to provide a workspace and how to make money out of the people that use it. 

This place tries to be clubby and it's not working. It's more than half empty 99% of the the time, and if you'd just catered to the constant need for good workspaces in this part of the city, I guarantee you'll see your sales jump. Overall, THE MUSIC IS TOO LOUD, TOO REPETITIVE AND UNNECESSARY....turn it down."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2019-03-03,3.0,"Great spot for quick grab and go meals. Staff at this location is super friendly which is a plus. Establishment is pretty clean with an A rating from the FDA at the date of this post. Seating is ample and the shelves are well organized, labeled, and well stocked.

Breakfast selection is great and sandwiches can be on the small size, but delicious. The egg frittatas have a good weight to them and probably the best deal in which my favorite is the egg white version. Coffee is pretty good and the app only rewards on coffee. 

Lunch offers a great variety from cold to hot foods. The salads are great and the company is stingy on only giving 1 dressing(just company policy). The wraps are small and deceiving because it's covered up in the middle by the card board packaging. Most other sandwiches you can see through the clear cellophane and the boxed ones are pretty good. One of my favorite soup is the Moroccan Lentil that they offer. Mac and cheese is great but a tease!

Drink selection towards the right register and has a great selection.

Overall they have great choices for your palate. This place offers a great deal of healthy options, and quality is definitely on point. The company can improve on giving deals once in a while to us loyal guests. Writing to them is pointless like in the past as they only say thank you and nothing more. Yes, during peak times it can get hectic and lines are in disarray place due its tight conditions during these times. To make it clear they are all separate lines. Only thanks to the staff as they are helpful and courteous! Bon appetit! This review is for 1 Penn Plaza closer to the A C E Train subway station."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2018-06-25,3.0,"I've been to many Pret locations in NYC and abroad, and this one is a little less nice than the others.  Slow service, dirty, and the food perhaps doesn't taste as good as the other spots.  In all fairness to them, this is perhaps one of the busiest train stations in the world, with a less than an ideal location by an exit escalator.

That said, in a pinch if you're looking for healthier options to go, it's convenient entering from the MSG side, grab, and go.  I had time to kill before my Amtrak on 6/24, so I sat at this location for the first time and noticed it wasn't that great.  Still like the place, and will continue to frequent this and other locations."

It was a rainy late day and there's not much choices for hot food.  Girlfriend and I shared the spinach tomato mac and cheese and the  bbq  chicken baguette.  Both were delicious, no wonder  people love this place for a quick take-out service. The combine serving size of what we ordered made our tummy happy. We had lemonade iced tea and lemon-lime soda for our drinks. Both foods and drinks were organically prepared that make the pricing ridiculously expensive, but reasonably good quality food  if it is your kind of thing.  They have various selections,  they have sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups, pastries and baguettes. Their cool coffee station is very inviting but didn't get the chance to try. They offer lights snacks or chips on the sides too.

The place was packed.... people dining  were either waiting for a concert or for their train boarding time or simply hungry or passing time before going somewhere.

Pretty hearty salad which hit the spot!  Fresh ingredients.  I wouldn't say it's outstanding or anything like that, but it was basic and satisfying. Service was very professional, quick and friendly;  atmosphere was extremely clean and inviting. I would go there again if I were in the area."

He said I had to have a coffee in my hand first or I had to get up. I got up and left - rude as hell. I've been to Pret a thousand times but now I feel weird, never going back. I went to Starbucks instead."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2018-06-23,5.0,"I've been to about 5 different Pret locations in New York and this is the only one I don't mind spending time in. For starters, it's the most visually appealing Pret. The new interior screams LOOK AT ME because of the space size and amount of lights being used. There's also a lot more variety - there tends to be more stock compared to other locations. 

I'm also always impressed with the music that is played at this location. It's current top hits, which is what I can't help but listen to. Another huge plus about this location is that there are plenty of outlets to charge your phone. This is a great place to wait for a train, especially now that there's a bar located inside the facility.

Faves: Avocado toast is delicious and under $5.
Chia pudding is my favorite healthy treat.
The ginger + apple shot is acidicly tasty, it's my go-to ESPECIALLY when I feel a cold coming. Another drink that's worth trying is the strawberry limeade!! 
As for lunch, my favorite is the avocado turkey wrap, I was skeptical as to whether or not it would fill me, but after having it for lunch 7 different times, I can confidentially say it IS filling."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2019-10-21,3.0,"It gets real busy in the morning since it's located in Penn Station but the staff still find the energy and time to ask how your doing and if you found everything you need. The food is decent but would love more options. As for the location you can't beat the location if you take the LIRR or PATH often. I think the 1, 2, 3, E, and C train stops here too."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2017-01-08,3.0,"Not for late nights. I am sure it is fine for daytime when things are moving and food is fresh. I came in at around 10:30 pm and I bought a salad and a ham and cheese sandwich. The ham and cheese baguette sandwich is usually my favorite of all their sandwiches. I was so happy they still had one. I have a pret I always do my meetings at on Broad st. so I have my go to things. 

This sandwich was terrible. The bread was thick and really strangely dense and soggy at the same time. The mesclun has gone wilted and was falling apart and was the black and all melty thing that lettuce does when bad. I couldn't take more than two bites before having to take it back. I have never ever taken a sandwich back before. But I needed to tell them it was terrible. The manager was their saving grace since he switched it out immediately. One of the stars is for him. 

One other thing is that from one cashier to the other...it was 10:30 and we put the food on the counter where a dude was standing and it is literally four inches from the other dude. And he says, he can help you. And so we looked at the other guy, and he was like indicating for us to move it the three inches to where his counter was.......seriously!?  

Anyways, after the manager came in, it was different, but I think something is off there!"

My skim latte is always made perfectly, and their food is fresh, even late at night. It's clean, spacious, and organized. Outlets available to the left, too. Long live Pret."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2017-01-20,5.0,"Being unfamiliar with the chain as mostly all are just in the city this was recommended to me for a quick breakfast before my departing train back home.This location is very nice and has an organized layout. You have mostly salads and wraps located on the right hand side, and the registers up front. I will say, this location gets busy really fast around 10 am but no need to worry because the cashiers move things along very quickly. 

I tried the Egg & quinoa pot which is a nice spin for a breakfast in a cup. Beyond smoothies and shakes this is a tiny little cup but very filling and healthy alternative at Penn Station especially. No wonder why the seating area is so small !!! The junk food is taking over the world lol !!! Also this little pot kept me full until dinner with no lunch in between.

By adding salt and pepper this pot is an explosion of flavors and crazy drunk party for your taste buds. Layered perfectly topped with an egg and under arugula with grape tomatoes. Under that is a layer of avocado and beneath is the stuffing which includes white and red quinoa and black and green lentils with a hint of lemon juice which tastes like the best dressing. Literally a party for your mouth and couldn't ask for more!

Also got a cappuccino and was offered a wide variety of milk choices hit a home run. Made me feel home and appreciated as a customer. Sat down in the seating area and looked over the board which announced the boarding track. Can't beat the location. As many other choices are available soups and wraps as well as salads I'll have to come back and try everything. Very friendly staff and experience. Will definitely come back and try out the wide array of the menu choices and possibilities."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2015-05-13,3.0,"Shiny brand spanking new Pret A Manger location in the human armpit known as Penn Station.

Open late too which was great as I was in Penn waiting for a train close to 11pm and needed a bite to eat. Salads, soups, sandwiches, wraps, etc, all fresh and more on the healthier side. Self serve coffee selections and a small seating area too. very clean looking overall. Let's see if it stays that way as time goes on and humanoid foot traffic stomps through over the year.

A better option for fresh food and coffee now. It's nice to see some of these better chains such as Pret open in here as most of the food options really suck in Penn Station."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2018-05-12,1.0,"Before I got on the train today, I bought a box of spring salmon salad in the store. The lemon inside was actually mildewed. Half of the lemon was cut and white mold was found on the side of the skin. I was very disappointed. I always thought that the food in your shop was delicious and healthy. Afterwards, I had to think about not going to your shop to buy anything."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2016-12-12,3.0,"Trying to meet a traveler here for quick mtg but haven't been to PS lately-- where is this Pret? Is it across from Kmart in the LIRR hallway between the 1/2/3 and A/C/E trains? Or in the New Jersey hallway? is what I asked Mayor of Yelp Phil H. 

It's in the hallway across from the hot & crusty (idk what it's called now) and across from the current Jamba Juice. On the same side as Kmart. But there's another Pret near NJ Transit. Make sure to specify with anyone you're meeting there. Take it from one who knows...

If you can grab a seat, it's not the worst place to camp out. But as many people do, whether they're eating anything from Pret or not, makes it a difficult endeavor. 

I will say the cashier I interacted with was a sweetheart and gave me my coffee for free."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2018-11-21,5.0,Krystal Jones is the best cashier I've ever met in the world. I've been to pret in London but Krystal made my visit so much better!!
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2019-04-02,3.0,"I really love Pret's steel cut coconut power oatmeal. I look forward to grabbing one every morning when I catch the train to NJ at Penn Station. What is really disappointing is that they are so very inconsistent with the portions and the condiments. Sometimes the container is filled to the very top, other times, it looks as if someone had already taken a few spoonfuls. The condiments are hit or miss. Sometimes there is dried fruit sometimes granola, brown sugar, sometimes brown sugar with cinnamon and once, I got a container filled with pure cinnamon! Many times, there are no condiments . I have asked for granola a couple of times and have been told that there isn't any. Yet, they have yogurt with granola. It seems to me that there are some lazy people there who just don't care. Come on Pret, being forced to have my steel cut oatmeal without brown sugar or granola is like telling me I can't have cream or sugar in my coffee."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2017-11-17,3.0,"Average Pret. Very busy and crowded and on the small side compared to a regular Pret but good to grab quick bite to eat before or after catching a train. They have all the same foods as every other Pret; sandwiches, macs, grilled cheeses, quinoa, salads, soups and more. The tables were a little dirty and it was hard finding a spot to sit since it's small and was so crowded."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2017-06-01,1.0,Took a bite of a chk wrap. Tasted bitter. Let me take another bite barely anything in the wrap opened it and this is what I saw. This is horrible what am I paying for. This is unsatisfactory would never support this company again. Patrons beware....
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2016-04-10,4.0,"In that half level down from the main train station level at Penn Station, a really good alternative grab-and-go place that defies the fact that it's a chain, in an underground warren, in perhaps the least savory culinary spot in the Western Hemisphere. The California sandwich was actually...tasty! fresh! I'm two for two in having a nice experience here, so that's good enough to bookmark and revisit later.

The layout here could stand a little improvement, but I realize they have to work with the footprint they have."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2018-07-30,1.0,"So apparently they won't be making any plain croissants today. Like None AT ALL. I don't know if the young girl was being a pain or this was truly the case. Either way, I walked away with nothing. That's rare for me at this location. It gets super busy and sometimes the lines get annoying b/c the reps are busy talking amongst themselves so we just stand there until a manager gets them to pay attention."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2017-05-24,3.0,"It's good enough. They have lots of healthy and fast options. Grab a salad to go before boarding the train. While I liked their options and it was well stocked, the location of the coffee bar and utensils was a little strange. You had to fight your way to exit between all of the people putting sugar or milk in their coffee."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2018-05-14,5.0,"Located inside Penn Station we stopped in for breakfast. The food was so fresh and delicious, and the prices were fair. The line moved quickly and the staff was friendly. There were some stools for sitting. This was my first time every in the chain store and I will certainly return. The breakfasts were under $5 each and a good grab and go before catching a cab upstairs."
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2017-08-22,5.0,I have always loved this place. Never an issue with their product or service. Today I was rushing to my train and needed a coffee. I dk why the young man at the register decided to give me the coffee on the house. ( I bought some grapes and a cookie also ) but it made me smile. The service  as nice and quick. Even if they didn't give me something on the house they would have received 5 stars. I'll be back whenever I'm in penn for sure. Thanks guys you started my day off really great !
710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2017-02-19,4.0,"I went here for the first time and loved it.  Had a ham and cheese on a baguette, their blood orange drink, and a bag of chips.  Its a pretty simple order.  However what impressed me was the freshness of the food.  This was probably one of the best pre-made sandwiches ive ever had.

Whats also nice about this place is that everything is made that day.  Whatever is left at closing time is given to charity.

Will definitely be back!

Service - 4
Food - 4.25

710,pret-a-manger-new-york-69,2016-12-05,1.0,"What a shame. This used to be my favorite place to go to while waiting for my train. But after tonight's scary incident, I can't trust to go back. 

I was seriously craving a caprese sandwich today. It's a very simple sandwich: mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and basil leaves. 

I bit into it for the second time and I felt something bumpy in my mouth. I immediately spit it out...a pine nut. Okay, whatever...it must've dropped in. UM. NO. There was a huge mound of pine nuts buried underneath my cheese. 

Not cool. Pret A Manger. NOT COOL. Thank god I brought it home where I had my EpiPen. This place tried to kill me tonight. FOH."
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2020-02-17,5.0,"Stopped in here for a quick cup of coffee and hopefully a place to hang out before my bus back to Baltimore (I didn't realize hours were shorter I'm guessing bc of President's Day). Despite their closing early at 1800 (6pm) instead of 2000 (8pm) I was thoroughly impressed with the (large) brew I received for $3.75. 

Think Coffee makes their own blends. I happened to have their ""Dovoe"" blend and it was phenomenal! The baristas were great and super informative. The vibe inside was exactly what I'd expect of a modern coffee shop. 

Highly recommend stopping at this location!"
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-12-06,4.0,"I came here for the first time this past week while visiting NYC on my own. This place was definitely my safe haven while I tried to stay warm during the snow and while visiting Hudson yards overall. I came in around 12:30 and the coffee shop was empty but I was struck by the vibe it put off. First off most coffee shops don't play hip hop/ r&b music in general which I was pleasantly surprised by. Next the way the overall decor of the place is super well done and fits nicely with the surrounding area that it is in. The staff is young and super friendly! They are completely willing to give you suggestions and encourage you to take your time while you order. 

I ordered a small vanilla latte which turned out to be much better than expected. Most of the time I struggle with lattes being overly sweet or too bitter. I found this one justttt right. Although I was off put by the cost as it was $5.25 after tax. You'd think being from Seattle I would be used to coffee prices but this was a tad more than expected. If I am in the city again, I would come back if it was near by."
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2020-03-06,4.0,"Great place to stop by n get some coffee on the go. My husband and I come here and order the vanilla latte, it's delicious. It's freshly made and takes no longer than ten minutes for a nice hot cup of coffee. Definitely recommend coming here"
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2020-03-06,3.0,"Average coffee shop - I've had their cold brew and an iced red eye, an option I rarely see, and both were fine. It is a small coffee shop but with locations throughout the city, it's pretty standard and nothing to write home about. Does the job when you need a caffeine fix."
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-08-19,5.0,"I frequent this coffee shop more than I'd care to admit. Think is privately owned, socially conscious, and sources great coffee! Beans are visibly fresh and not seeping oil like you might find at Starbucks. The staff is young and friendly, and the baristas are definitely passionate about their coffee. They offer a small selection of hot food as well as pastries typical of a coffee shop. There is indeed no WiFi which I've noticed people complain about (might I suggest WeWork instead of a coffee shop to finish your ""Novel""). 

It's very clean, provides prompt service, and is better quality than any chain you might patronize."
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-01-01,3.0,"This place started off strong and the philosophy / business model is amazing. They support girls going to school overseas and supply feminine care to places they source their coffee overseas. However - the staff really lowered the experience for me. They were all cursing and not really caring who was in the cafe. One was discussing Cardi B and how ugly she is ... in much more profanity. Two other workers were chatting and laughing and she kept dropping the F bomb. Now don't get me wrong - I curse a lot but when you're working you should act a bit more professional. 

I also ordered a pour over coffee and saw her pour the water over it ... walk away and not go back. I patiently waited almost 5 minutes (again at this point no one in line) and had to ask if it was ready and she had to go back and pour more water over to fill my cup so basically she just forgot about it. 

The coffee itself was very tasty. It was fruit forward like I wanted and i would give the product a solid 4 rating but the staff and lack of attention really gives this a 3 at best."
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-09-16,5.0,"First time here and it was great! There are tons of seating options so you can sit and work. Place gets pretty packed during the week but calm atmosphere. 


I ordered a large oat milk latte iced and it tasted great! Also ordered the fig coconut pecan bar and it was soooo delicious! Tasted homemade and it was pretty filling (gotta love butter). In total, it was about $12 but it was absolutely worth it. 

I will definitely be coming back!"
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-07-31,4.0,"Just had an americano, almond milk latte and scone. All were solid. Bill was $12. Small place and not much room to sit down but very fast service.

711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-04-30,4.0,"Very hipster vibe from where the Highline is. I ended up with my friend Mark to get a breather from our all-day trip of walking around. My friend ordered us organic coffee, mine was a turmeric latte--I love its taste but it didn't quite wake me up (so that's my mistake). It's conveniently located, people are walking by and getting some breakfast too. The space is small, but everything in NYC is anyway, so its all good. There is wifi available and a perfect spot to people watch."
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-10-31,5.0,Ordered an iced latte with oat milk and it was delicious! Loved that I could use my coffee addiction to support a good cause. If I lived nearby this would be my go to coffee shop
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-10-19,5.0,"Tucked away a block off 10th Ave is Think Coffee. It's right across from the new Hudson Yards mall and from first looks, very unassuming. Every time I've been inside, the place is packed, but lines move fairly quickly. The coffee is expertly roasted to smooth perfection and these are real baristas. They know just how to make the perfect drink. In addition to great coffee drinks, they are socially and environmentally conscious so you feel really good about supporting the shop!"
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-02-05,1.0,"Pretty sure that putting dirty, full, outdoor sanitation garbage bins inside the only bathroom in the establishment is a health code violation.
I only came in here because I needed to use a public bathroom. I bought a TINY 8oz coffee for $2.75 to be a paying customer to use the bathroom. The coffee looked very watery and translucent and wasn't a good cup of coffee. They have NO VEGAN MILK choices besides soy (how archaic). Starbucks has coconut AND almond milk in addition to soy. Then after buying this overpriced crappy tiny coffee with no almond milk to add to it, I walk into the bathroom. The stench of garbage almost made me vomit. It looked like someone died in there, toilet paper was everywhere. Absolutely disgusting . There was barely any room to even walk inside to wash your hands because the two outdoor garbage bins  took up almost all of the floor space in the bathroom. THIS IS THE BATHROOM THAT THE EMPLOYEES USE. there are also no paper towels in the bathroom so I doubt the employees wash their hands every time. 
This bathroom is disgusting and I am positive  that it's not safe and a violation of health codes."

711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2018-06-14,3.0,"I came yesterday to order a latte but the machine was down.  They told me that it would be back up in about 10 min, so I wanted, but was then told it would be even longer so I left.

I tried again this morning and tried to order a pressed egg sandwich, but they were already out by 9:30 AM.  I instead ordered a Spanish latte, avocado toast, and chocolate chip banana muffin.

The avocado toast was okay and I think would be much better with less oil. I would also love the option to put an egg on top.  My Spanish latte was delicious, but tasted more like a regular latte than a Spanish latte.

My colleague enjoyed her chocolate chip banana muffin and said there were tons of chocolate chips in it."
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2018-11-16,3.0,"Think is a pretty solid coffee shop (plus a few donuts) at the edge of Hudson Yards.  Unlike a couple of Thinks I have been to, this one is pretty small and definitely tight on seating.  

This is a good shop to go to if you need a good cup of coffee on the go.  It is not somewhere to linger in my opinion as it is always busy, packed even.  Not a place to work on your novel and stare out the window in peace.  They are tidy and move you along quickly.  This is good if you are in a rush.  The flip-side is that they are a bit curt and not very friendly, but if you need a quick hit of caffeine and then run back to work, this place wil do the job."
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2018-12-03,3.0,"Solid almond croissant. Huge size with pretty tasty filling. Just wish it was heated all the way through :( It had so much potential to be an amazing croissant.

Can't speak of the coffee since it was late when I decided to drop by here with a friend for a quick bite. The stars though are for the staff who were very sweet and offered to help my friend who wasn't feeling very well. Very little seating so it's I'm guessing it's more of a grab-and-go type of place.

Bathrooms had 2 huge trash bins in there. Very off-putting."

711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-11-20,3.0,"This is a small coffee place very close to hudson yards.  Came in for several coffees with my family on a cold day.  There are stool type high chairs and long tables to sit in.  Getting a seat was a bit tricky since the place is small and there are hardly any places to sit.

I'm taking two stars off because the staff here doesn't clean tables.  When a table cleared up, I had the throw the previous people's stuff up.  They left crumbs, cups, dirty napkins all over.  As I was wiping down the table with clean napkins, the people behind the counter watched my skills in cleaning.  They were either impressed or they didn't care, I'm not sure.  Either way, they chose to watch me clean and not help.

By the way, the coffee here is pricey, maybe $3.50 for a coffee.  The flavor is identical to Starbucks Blonde Roast.  So if you like that coffee, you'll like this.

I'll likely never be back."

711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2019-09-25,1.0,"Thr coffee is no longer Fairtrade!!!! What's worse,  they are doing a corporate capture of Fair Trade. They are trashing Fair Trade on their website and implementing some Bcorp  BS ""social project coffee"" which they claim helps to fund social projects like building houses or menstrual activism. Of course by not working with Fair Trade America they are accountable to no one but themselves.   what's more,  Fair Trade America the goal is to provide farmers earn a sustainable living by ensuring farmers receive a fair price that covers their production costs.  Think does not purport to do this, and since they are no longer certified by FairTrade America it's obvious they are seeking profit over respect for workers.

I got an iced latte due to the insane weather and I was pleasantly surprised by the adventurous and not-at-all-pedestrian coffee.

The service at this location is amazingly bad. The girl at the register wasn't even appologetic.  She acted like it was my fault for ordering coffee there. 

I've really have never seen such a bad coffee shop. 
It must be the constant flow of tourist at this location that keeps it busy. I don't think any customer would come back a second time."

Everyone was polite and the drinks came out quickly but honestly, nothing that sets it apart from any other coffee shop."
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2018-09-14,5.0,"They make a delicious mocha latte!!!  It was by far the best that I had during my short trip to NYC, and I drink a lot of lattes.

I also had the cinnamon sugar donut.  It was so huge I didn't think I could eat the entire thing BUT since it was also the perfect proportion of cinnamon and sugar on a donut I couldn't stop eating it (and DID finish it, ha!)."

Make sure you try everything! But if you like sweet,  then do a Spanish latte! If you like strong, straight up red-eye (espresso shot in coffee). If you like it crazy, ask for a dash of hazelnut, a pump of chocolate, and some caramel...You made yourself a snickerdoodle latte!

Try every or any pastry--they carefully select from bakeries in the city.

But do Not miss out on the sandwiches. Prosciutto and Swiss...Or mozzarella and tomato! Just so fresh (ask them to heat it up) and delicioso!

10% of their profit they send back to the coffee bean farmers. Very admirable and inspiring stories. Ask anyone for more deets!"

The soy latte was on point - temperature and taste."
711,think-coffee-new-york-10,2018-02-20,3.0,"Think does pretty much everything well. The people are nice, the decor is pleasant, there is an ample array of baked goods, oatmeal, portable sandwiches and such, the coffee is fine, and the baristas know what they're doing. 
In sum, there is a fairly high standard for base quality. It's just not the last word when it comes to a cafe. All above the items mentioned are good, but anonymous. It's a higher quality version of Starbucks (not many would come for a single origin espresso) and that's fine. Save for the fact that it doesn't have WiFi, I would chose it above Starbucks 100% of the time. There are just so many good options today that I personally would go somewhere else. But I was constrained by location and had to meet a group, so given the circumstances I can't expect much more. We live in a fine time given that this cafe only deserves 3 stars!"

My middle schooler is loving the hibiscus iced tea, and yogurt and granola.  The chocolate croissant tastes great  too. Highly recommend this hidden gem right by the highline."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2020-01-25,5.0,"Always get my order right (I attribute this to my compulsive mobile ordering). Staff is super nice. Always make it right when I have gotten my own order wrong. Music is always on point here. 

I see some of you try the bathroom at starbucks? LOL I mean you are probably better off going somewhere else. There are always homeless people either sleeping right outside under scaffolding or try to chill on the inside. We are literally blocks away from a men's shelter and Bellevue hospital people. Want a fancier starbucks go to 34th and 1st byeeeee"
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2019-05-25,5.0,"Living near by for the past 2 years I've frequently used this location as a study spot and found it to really stand out compared to other locations in the area!

Depending on the time of day it can be busy, but usually coming on weekends or after work to study I've found I'm able to find a seat along with space for my laptop/books probably 4 out of 5 visits. 

The noise level is perfect, they do play music but nothing obnoxious and the volume level is just right to drown out conversation but not overwhelm you. 

The staff has consistently been very friendly, by the time I approach my exam date most of them know me by name (god bless those free refills for gold card)."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2019-11-18,1.0,"I hate to complain. The place feels like a homeless shelter. People come in and don't buy anything and spend hours hanging, Starbucks.. if you truly care shout the homeless there are better ways to help rather then allowing your locations to be used as shelters. No security here. No monitoring, staff absolutely does not make rounds."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2019-11-22,3.0,I usually order online and pick up Starbucks at this location. Never had a problem with that. I wouldn't recommend as a place to come do work/ sit/ eat/relax. It is frequently crowded and the tables are pretty cramped
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2020-01-23,3.0,Starting with the good. My drink was really delicious and there is ample space to do work and be productive in the location. It is hard for me to find a Starbucks  in this area like this one. The only thing is that the bathroom is DISGUSTING OMG. There was no toilet paper. Probably because most of it was on the floor. No seat cover which was not that big of a deal because I squat. 10/10 would not recommend sitting on that seat even with 10 seat covers. There was an empty needle package on the floor. And trash in the sink. And too be frank it smelled like a homeless shelter in the bathroom. While I am happy Starbucks allows for all people to use their facilities I really think a big part of this should be TO KEEP THE RESTROOM CLEAN. Especially at a coffee shop. Eww ew ew. Please do better. Otherwise a very nIce Starbucks.
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2019-07-17,5.0,"For the past year, this has been my main Starbucks and as Starbucks locations go, the staff here work so hard. Very attentive, they do an excellent job in trying to keep the café as clean as a café can be, and you can tell that the team enjoys working with each other as well as interacting with the many regulars that walk through their doors, which is typically a sign of good management. Out of most locations, they do an excellent and consistent job in maintaining inventory of products. When they're out or something, they are very good with communicating that to customers as much as possible. As an example, I typically order iced coffee, a bagel and avocado spread. Most stores forget to give me a knife, but this store never does. Also one day, they were out of avocado spread (which you know, it happens, c'est la vie) but what makes them stand out is that they anticipated my reaction and refunded me not just for the avocado spread but the entire order. Additionally, even when waiting for a long time, I have seen multiple baristas approach and check in with standing customers to ensure everyone received their orders. Now, I'm not expecting that ""legendary"" service every time I walk into a Starbucks, but I am impressed with the consistently solid service at this store. And for me it's the little things that count.

Lastly, I want to give a special thank you to Kelvin, Raul, and Reina (hopefully I remembered and spelled these names correctly!)--and of course, among many others--who have welcomed me throughout the last year. :)"
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2019-06-20,4.0,"This Starbucks location is not bad if you are looking to grab a drink or bite to eat on the run. Don't expect to eat or drink it there though. This place is always packed and it has a small seating area to begin with. I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you are claustrophobic. Drinks and food items seem to be made correctly, and the portions are appropriate. Staff are not very personable, but they are probably stressed being as busy as they are."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2018-01-06,4.0,"This location is very busy on a Saturday morning. If you are thinking about going somewhere to read and drink your coffee in peace, this may not be the best location as it is very high traffic and seating is hard to get.

I found this to be an average Starbucks. Service was acceptable, and the barista was working as fast as they could to get all of the drinks out. I ordered a caramel brulee latte, and although it wasn't the best one I've ever had, it wasn't awful.

I will be returning, as it is just around the corner from where I am staying."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2017-12-24,3.0,"Starbucks generally all are pretty uniform in their environment and space, and this particular location was not very unique in that regard. It was your average Starbucks with tables and everything. I usually don't review Starbucks locations, but during the time of my visit at this location, there was a customer who was being quite loud and disruptive. That, along with the slightly-louder-than-average music, made my experience there not as productive or pleasant as I wanted it to be. The day I visited seemed to be a more chaotic day than normal though. Someone also dropped a box of chicken nuggets on the floor and they went in all directions (moment of silence for the one who lost their nuggets).

Anyway, long story short, this is your average Starbucks."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2019-05-06,3.0,"I frequent this Starbucks pretty often when I'm in the city. My friend lives nearby and I like to come here while I'm waiting for them to get out of work because it has WiFi and of course, coffee. However, every time I'm here I ask myself the same question: why? Why have I come here? Some of the employees are really nice but more often than not they seem to mix up orders or not really listen when taking the orders.  But that is the least of this places worries. It is wild inside. I have seen the oddest things happen at this Starbucks. Such as a man drink beer for hours within plain view of the staff and then proceed to have an accident. I've seen someone get up and pretend to mimic a wrestling video. The bathroom looks like it was teepeed every time. It is a little chaotic but maybe I like the drama. Would probably recommend going to a different Starbucks."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2017-02-09,1.0,"Great staff and a clean, pristine Starbucks. Problem is that it's a haven for many mentally imbalanced individuals, many of who come from the Mens Shelter on 30th between First and Second and also Bellevue Hospital.  Hey, if you need a place to sleep and while away the day, this is your place!

The employees at this Starbucks are forced to change the bathroom lock codes up to three times a day...yet it doesn't help. 

Starbucks corporate has really let their wonderful staff down by putting them in harms way...having to deal with mentally imbalanced homeless people, which is a job that should only be tackled by the police and mental health professionals. 

Don't ever leave anything unattended. Keep an eye on your possessions. Always be aware that there are many unstable individuals around..potential for violence and altercations might be imminent. 

The cops are called constantly to fill out police reports for stolen items...many of which are notebook computers. Many EMT calls too. 

Starbucks corporate have their head in the sand. They opt for political correctness over safety and atmosphere. It's really nice to buy a $6.00 drink, a $5 food item...then have to watch a mentally unbalanced individual put his head on the table...with drool oozing out of his mouth."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2019-08-11,1.0,Probably the worst Starbucks in New York in my experience. Why does it take 20 minutes for double espresso that was sitting there for so long yet there's 4 employees and a manager?
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2016-11-07,4.0,"This is one of the cleaner, larger, brighter, and better designed Starbucks in the neighbourhood. Spacious w/ a nice blend of cozy/work-friendly spaces. Relax on a couch, meet up with a friend at one of the larger tables, or get to work with your laptop on a smaller one. There's a great mix of all happening here and it doesn't have that crowded, dim feeling that many others in the area possess."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2019-05-15,1.0,"I usually come here after work to grab a coffee and do some reading. For whatever reason, this location is completely overrun by the homeless. Harmless but distracting and hard to ignore. Large suitcases fill any space possible, long waits for the bathroom, etc. I one time looked up to see 4 different people passed out in their seats. Until this is fixed, I would go to another location, since there are many within a few blocks."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2019-01-26,5.0,"cute friendly workers, the barista literally blessed our drinks and made them so well and u don't find good baristas nowadays esp in NYC, officially my fav starbucks"
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2013-12-18,5.0,"Perhaps my new favorite Bux, this location is clean, well stocked and has a restroom.  This is a great, well-lit spot to work from ""home.""

I checked ""yes"" to outdoor seating because this location has a bench built into the building.  Great for grabbing an iced coffee on a sunny day and then text fighting with someone."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2015-06-02,2.0,"Don't have roaches in my apartment. This Starbucks however, does have roaches. Every time I'm there, I see at least one. Yea yea, it's New York. Kinda gross, but when I'm in an early am bind I figure roach poop is just roughage or, ya know, ""so New York,"" I just let it slide. We all do.

But this morning, I switched it up. No more melted feces, I went for chilled roach droppings in cold brew. I asked for no ice in my cold brew and I got this half pour! It's like sampling fine wine only its not."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2018-05-02,5.0,"I have to give a shoutout to the staff at this Starbucks location. This morning was pure insanity--I have never seen that many people there at once time, and the mobile order machine was spitting out tickets like crazy. The staff of three was handling it incredibly; they were totally overwhelmed and understaffed, but were making it work! Props to you all!"
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2018-02-05,1.0,I just ordered a Venti cold Brew but i saw the barista making a grande so i advised her that it was the wrong size. So she took the grande poured it into the Venti and just added more water and ice instead of putting more cold brew in it so i essentially got a watered down Grande cold brew. Pretty disappointed in the laziness and zero customer service at this Starbucks
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2017-11-11,5.0,"This is one of the best Starbucks locations I have been to in terms of table setups, great seating. A very comfortable SBUX to get work done at.  One of my daughters works in Murray Hill area north of this location but I will walk the extra blocks further south to be more comfortable getting my work done from here.  Good service and place looks very nice."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2016-06-02,2.0,"The coffee was less than okay in flavor, the sandwiches are in an open refridgerator area which I was supposed to get and pass it to the cashier to warm it up. I didn't go for that sandwich, I am used to the real thing where a cook prepares the sandwich right there in the kitchen. I mean who knows how many months ago those sandwiches were put wrapped there, no way Jose, for Starbuck's prices, I think they can step up their game in the sandwich area. I was only there because my brother took me."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2017-11-14,1.0,"unprofessional and rude cashier, the code maker was busy making coffee and the cashier was playing with her phone.  I asked her to give me some almond milk she told me to go to the coffee maker and continued to play with her phone."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2018-01-14,4.0,"Love this place since lines aren't too long on weekdays one of the quite spots in Manhattan. Also great place to have a seat Comfortably. They have comfortable couches , chairs and everything. If you are looking for a quite, relaxing spot where you don't have to eat and out this is the place."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2015-12-03,4.0,"This Starbucks location is my favorite in the area.  Large and spacious, there are several tables along the wall with access to outlets.  There are also plenty of tables and high-tops for the more casual coffee drinkers.  

If you're looking for a place to do some work on the weekend, be sure to get there early as this location is popular with the locals.  The staff here is super friendly and will even learn your name and order if you're a regular."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2013-03-21,3.0,"Brand new Starbucks that just recently opened at end February. Was on my way home from lunch today as I work close by and decided to grab a coffee to bring back to the office.

It's actually a nice location on the corner of 28th and 3rd where an old restaurant used to be. Standard Starbucks decor with plenty of seating, high tops, tables, counters, comfy window benches, a few pleather chairs, etc. Place is set up as kind of a big square. Almost resembles a mini-mart layout to me. Quick and pleasant barista service. Clean bathroom. No complaints as the location is shiny brand new. 

Already drawing a crowd to this spot that consisted of locals, students from the area studying, people like me who work close by, and the ever visible wifi hogs nursing that one cup of coffee for hours."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2017-06-25,2.0,"I really love Starbucks, I do think they are a step above the rest but.......This Starbucks location is NOT the best one near my house and there is 3 of them in walking distance. Since they have opened, I think they have gotten my drink order CORRECT only 3 times!! and on MOST weekday mornings it looks like management schedules new employees (less than 3 months on the job) because it get backed up FAST and drinks get made wrong (duh!)  Also Stop mobile ordering for this location until they are more efficient in the mornings..."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2016-01-19,1.0,"Probably the worst Starbucks visited. The customer service was the worst. I waited in line only for the employee to take another customer. I was then asked what I ordered four times. I tried to tell a manager who was not wearing a name tag and did not provide a name completely ignored the situation. 

Never going again."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2013-04-06,5.0,I love this starbucks location.  The ambience is nicer than other starbucks in the area and a great place to sit down to chat or work.  They have both stools (high tops) as well as sit down tables.  Service is friendly and fast.  What more could you ask for?
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2017-01-20,5.0,"The best Starbucks I've been too. Always amazing service, very fast and always correct. They treat everyone great and it's very refreshing compared to most Franchises I've been too. 5/5 Stars. Oh and shout out to my crew, Ralph and Amy."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2015-03-26,5.0,"I had to make a stop in Starbucks today and get a frappe with was yummy to my tummy. 
Starbucks is busy wherever you go. Good stuff."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2015-04-26,4.0,"Love the seating at this Starbucks! There's a long wooden bench along with windows which provide for plenty of seating. It can get pretty crowded on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, though. The store is clean, and the baristas are friendly and willing to chat about their products. The one complaint I do have is that the baristas don't seem to understand when you're in a hurry and want to get your order placed ASAP. On multiple occasions, I have had baristas amble around preparing my coffee and baked goods. That's totally okay in a small local cafe, but I thought Starbucks had the culture of respecting people's busy schedules and being snappy with the orders. Oh well, I'll deal."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2018-10-19,1.0,"My cappuccino was made by Debbie, the shift supervisor.  She never made it--she just poured coffee halfway and charged $3.76! I left and went home and realized I didn't even get a cappuccino or anything close to it. I had to go back again, and explain it to the working staff and asked me to open the lid.  They made a new one, and told them I have never experienced this at any Starbucks before.  What I have experienced is the rude and passive-aggressive behavior by Debbie before. She always seems unhappy and it reflects on her service and job.  And, in this case, she just lied to not serve me what I paid for.  Because of the convenience factor, this is the place I go to, but really, there are many good Starbucks in the city and in the world--service and quality. Not this one.  When the supervisor Debbie casts a poor tone, I am not surprised this Starbucks on 3rd Avenue has such poor ratings and reviews.  Avoid this one."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2014-06-17,5.0,"THIS STARBUCKS TAKES THE CAKE! I don't often think to review a Starbucks, they tend to remain consistently satisfying and keep my expectations happily met. 

But at this Starbucks you're often greeted by manager Jarvis as you get to the counter, or one of the other always smiling, friendly baristas, and are always quick and easy with getting your order and being efficient.

Today my iced coffee had a terrible, nasty after-taste and Jarvis happily re-made it for us 3x before it tasted just right!! It was insane. The customer service here is outstanding. 

Plus it's a pretty big space, full of sit down tables with chairs, 2 high-top communal tables with stools, small tables with shapes by the windows, a corner with comfy plush chairs, and plenty of outlets to plug your electronics into."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2014-05-09,5.0,"I rarely post reviews of Starbucks, but this one is unusually well managed, worthy of a review on its own.  It is fairly large, usually clean, with comfortable tables and furniture. Staff are upbeat and efficient and understand their coffee.  They also have a Clover machine which is wonderful.  They are not shy to suggest a single-cup Clover brew, which is great because Clover is a real treat (few Starbucks have the Clover machine). 

Kudos to the management of this particular Starbucks.  Even that I generally have good experiences at Starbucks retail stores, this one stands out as exceptionally well run in my experience."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2016-02-08,3.0,"I hate Starbucks, but this one is as good as it gets. The staff is friendly, the coffee is fine, the seating is plentiful. And there isn't a good coffee shop nearby (Gregory's is the closest exception)."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2017-10-21,2.0,Some baristas need more training - they should at least be able to recognize the differences between light Frappuccino and regular Frappuccino.
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2016-03-04,2.0,"It's usually a hit or miss at this location and other locations near this one. I've had friendly service and also not so great ones. For example today the service wasn't that great because when I first stepped in, there was a lady being helped and only one barista was at the counter. Then 2 guys stands in line behind me and the barista that was on the floor (near the cash register/food display) decided to jump in and said, ""Hey guys you can step down here, what can I get you?"" And he did not even ask if I was being helped and I thought he heard the girl say to me I'll be with you soon. So the two guys asked me if I went yet and I said no I haven't...even the customers knew to ask me if I ordered yet. Then the guy barista said hi what can I get you and etc. I ordered a black iced coffee with vanilla. After he made it, I asked how many pumps he put in 2 or 3, and he just poured out the coffee and made it again...I don't know why. They also ran out of iced coffee so he just threw in more ice into the newly made one. Nice! Totally get my money's worth. If you're customers are paying a premium price, I except you to give them what they paid for. He seemed polite, but you can tell through the way he talked and his actions that he did not look like he wanted to help me. Sorry if you wanted to help the guys behind me and not me. I know that Starbucks emphasizes on good customer service, but clearly you guys need to work harder on accomplishing that. As for their drinks, very mediocre, so I don't know if it's worth the go anymore."
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2013-11-13,4.0,Probably the best decor/layout for a Starbucks with big windows just like how every coffeeshop is back home in Seoul Korea. The staff and baristas are pleasant and most patrons are laid back and chill. No tourist overload here. Other Starbucks should learn a thing or two regarding layout from this particular store. Two thumbs up!!
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2015-06-18,1.0,"This place breaks my heart. A premium price a beautiful store, a great location, a constant flow of customers, all to be treated like crap when you get here. 2 o'clock in the afternoon and no half-and-half, one person at the counter. This place is shameful!"
712,starbucks-new-york-256,2015-07-02,4.0,Love this location!  Glad they finally got rid of the benches outside which  were attracting the  homeless and drunks.  Now it's so much nicer and cleaner!

713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-08-19,3.0,"Small, casual cafe with one sweet barista who is there to cater to you. I got the green tea latte and my friend got a black coffee. Sadly, they don't have almond milk, which is a strike for me, so I got mine with soy. The latte was huge, and tasted alright. Definitely didn't taste like it was from Italy. There's much better coffee in the area for the same price, especially because I didn't even taste the coffee in my latte, but hey, I still enjoyed it. 

Also got scrambled eggs with turkey. Again, it wasn't bad, but it was small and definitely not worth the price. Felt like a light snack. Don't come here if you're starving, because I definitely didn't feel full, but it was enough to tide me over. Still, it's a decent, extremely low-key stop for coffee, pastries, and light snacks."

Next day I go to the salon and was made to sit for 20 minutes before anyone even asked me what I wanted done, meanwhile the hair-and-cafe lady who supposedly would eventually help me zipped past me towards the (not busy) cafe several times without making eye contact. I've never felt so ignored. It was frustrating. I left and never again supported this cafe or its built-in hair salon, despite it being literally the closest of both to my house!"

The Rueben was small and drowning in dressing and the chicken sandwiches had paper thin layers of chicken and all you could taste was the bread (even with taking one layer off). Totally overpriced for what you get. Will never order again. If you are going to go here, avoid the sandwiches."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2017-07-30,2.0,"Wanted to support an independent spot for breakfast so I ran across this spot in the way to Hell's Kitchen Flea Market.  When I walked in it seemed cute and then a lady appeared to my left.  I saw that she came from the beauty salon next door.  I'm not knocking the hustle but u doing hair & making sandwiches & lattes too???  Hmmmmm....I still proceeded to order a turkey egg & cheese sandwich and a large chai latte.  It took about 10 mins, didn't see grill but it was behind the countertop.  The sandwich portion was huge, was supposed to be a panini....Hmmmm not the one I'm used to in Chicago.  It tasted like one I would make on a bad day.  The turkey was dry, the sandwich bread had nothing between it or the cheese which made the sandwich dry and tasteless.  The chai latte was decent.   The atmosphere is cute, great music, clean, very small.  I'm not sure if the lady has hired help during the week but I would question someone doing hair and cooking.   I checked for any extras on my sandwich.  The same could be said for my hubby's ham, egg & cheese sandwich w/the smallest glass of orange juice.  Those 2 sandwiches, latte & orange juice totaled $29, what a ripoff for sub par food."

Thank goodness this little tiny cafe was here. We tried one other one before this, but it wasn't really one of  those grab a cup of coffee and go places. Buongiorno was exactly that. We got our well deserved Iced Coffee for the usual iced coffee price, and was it the best coffee in the world? Not really, but it was pretty decent, and it was cold, and after walking around in hot NYC it definitely was exactly what we needed at that moment. They also have sandwiches and little pastry things in case you need a snack, and an awkward door that links up with a salon type place next door--coffee and pastries goes with  getting your hair done right? ha ha But the service was nice, there are only two tables in here though pretty much, so don't roll in with a large group, cheers to Buongirono for getting us our coffee fix we needed so badly!"
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2010-03-08,5.0,"I walked in here randomly. Their name is not on the outside of the building! 

The staff was immediately friendly and hospitable. They poured water for me! They pushed their food pretty quickly but not aggressively. The latte was done quickly, and it was quite good.

You kind of feel like you're in a hip diner, even though the food isn't diner-esque - the red leather stools make it feel like a diner. The decor is sparse.

With the windows and doors open, like they were last week, this cafe felt like it was on a beach. Very delightful."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2015-09-08,2.0,I was pretty disappointed with this place since it's right under my apartment and could've been a common haunt. I ordered an iced coffee and bagel and was pretty surprised by the high price. Ended up with a watery brew and stale-tasting bagel. Will not be back.
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2014-04-19,5.0,GREAT coffee and complementary macaroons. Sunny corner in MTW. Great alternative to Starbucks!
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2013-10-21,4.0,"The other reviewers are right. This place is tiny. It's probably a tough squeeze when they are busy.
I did not give them four stars for the location or atmosphere. I gave them four stars for the coffee. 
I was served by a nice lady named Lilliana.   She said that I had to try the espresso because it's very smooth. She was right. It is one of the smoothest I have ever tasted. Not bad for a tiny, neighborhood, hole-in-the-wall. 
Four Stars Indeed."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2014-10-12,5.0,"Every time I come to NYC I make a point to stop here., the coffee is always perfect and the employees are always polite and gracious. Sometimes they're standing in the salon attached to the cafe, but 10 seconds extra is worth the better coffee!"
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2013-03-07,4.0,"I work nearby, and almost every day, I walk into this little cafe for a cup of coffee and an apple turnover. The lattes are almost always perfectly steamed (I used to work as a barista, so I like to think I know what I'm talking about), and the espresso is smooth. Some great caprese paninis and chocolate croissants. It's teeny tiny... but the girls who work the counter, including the owner, are wonderfully friendly.
Highly recommended!"
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2017-01-18,5.0,"Visited a conference and stayed across the street from this place,went in because the doorman suggested it.  On the outside it looks a little dodgy. In fact it doesn't look much better once you go in, but the espresso and cappuccino are the best I've had (and I'm also comparing to Frisson Espresso).  The cappuccino is so creamy and has the perfect balance of espresso blended in. The roast they use comes from a partnership in Italy and is awesome. Also the chocolate croissant, the almond cookie and bread pudding are crazy amazing!  The almond cookie maybe one of the best desserts I've had in NY.  I've read some of the reviews and some people even describe this place as creepy. They are completely misreading the situation. A mother owns the coffee shop and the salon next door.  She is a great cook and fixes a mean turkey, cheddar, and egg sandwich. The son that runs the coffee shop is very shy but super friendly. My wife and I have gone other places in NYC and continue to regret that we just didn't go back there. I will certainly continue to go back."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2016-10-26,2.0,"I just found a fly inside my Capuccino. Ordered it to go and just finished it, with surprise inside. Disgusting"
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2016-04-30,5.0,This is a very good italian coffee :) I always come here for Capuccino or Iced Coffee to go and the coffee is very tasty and the price is absolute fair. The small cakes are very delicious too :)
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2012-10-01,1.0,"Nice ambiance and a friendly barista couldn't make up for the absolutely terrible latte I was served there.  $3.75 for an 8 Oz latte isn't too expensive, but when I'm compelled to throw it in the trash less than a block away, I feel robbed.

Perhaps I'm spoiled by great coffee in Boulder, CO, but I will not go back here even for drip coffee.  Too many Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks nearby to take a risk on a poorly made espresso."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2010-07-11,4.0,"This place has good coffee with a perfect bar for people watching. The staff was very friendly, the young man behind the counter was reprimanded softly for assuming I want my coffee to go. The owner re-poured my drink into a nice white cup. The croissant and the Italian version I ordered was in a very dry state. All forgiven with a glass of ice water brought to me at the end of my coffee.
I have to come back and try their lunch sandwich."

Buongiorno Espresso, please take my 6 bucks for the hands down, best iced mocha latte in the city.

God bless us. Everyone."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2015-01-07,5.0,Amazing! I had the best mocha that I've ever had in my life here! We also had a breakfast sandwich that was equally impressive. Although it is a bit pricey.
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2014-07-09,3.0,"The coffee was fine, but for an iced americano - we were charged $5 - this is more expensive than Blue Bottle (but the coffee wasn't as good.)
The woman behind the counter told me the high price was because an americano is like a latte. This is some faulty logic...
Not a great experience. Wouldn't go back."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2012-04-30,4.0,"Needed coffee like no other after we got into our hotel (the New Yorker Hotel on 34th and 8th). Walked about the neighborhood in search of the coffee and to get a feel for the area. First non-chain coffee place we found so we stopped in. 

Very tiny inside, but cute. Barista lady was friendly but abrupt. Espresso was really smooth. Friend also got a cannoli and was saying ""Cannoli! Cannoli!"" the entire trip. A good stop if you're looking for a GOOD quick cup of coffee while in the area."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2014-10-18,5.0,"5 stars for the coffee. Strong, good flavor, friendly barista. A nice change of pace from your typical big box coffee shop. Iced coffee is quite good too. No overbearing crowds here, either."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2014-10-05,4.0,"If you like rich dessert, you should try this place's tiramisu! The layers are made of out butter! Just butter, it is like eating butter chunk! After my dessert and coffee, I didn't have to eat for the rest of the day! The coffee is pretty good; it has favor so if you are not a picky coffee drinker. This would be a decent place."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2012-02-26,4.0,"My friend and I wanted to get pastries in the cities and stumbled onto this place.  We both share a great love for all that is Italian baked goods.  It's so adorable and small inside!  I love the little flowers that line the front window.   We had hot chocolate, ice chocolate, a chocolate tart and a few custard tarts.  

-Hot chocolate:  AMAZING, it was just as good as Starbucks.
-Chocolate tart:  VERY rich, but stellar nonetheless.
-Custard tarts:  We had more than one of these, they were so good.  I love custard tarts because they're not too sweet.  
-Ice chocolate:  Just as good as the hot chocolate, it didn't taste watered down even with the copious amount of ice.  

They had other things in the glass case (cannolis, cheesecake, mini eclairs)

 I didn't notice a bathroom (which explains the 4 stars).   But I'd love to go here as often as I can."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2011-06-22,3.0,"Met a friend for a quick catch-up coffee and she suggested this little corner cafe.

If not for the fact that its right on the corner and you can't miss it, you would never spot it by the signage...so just look for a little red cafe...you cant miss it.  

My first impression on this hot and muggy New York Summer morning: ""how the hell is it so hot in here!?"" There was no a/c, no breeze and the coffee machine had turned the place into a sauna.  When my friend arrived, she almost immediately wanted to go somewhere else...the only problem is she was stuck for time and there's not much nearby for breakfast. One good thing for them is that they seem to have the market cornered (pun intended)! 

So we sat and ordered what I think is the best cappuccino and croissant I've had in a very long time but sat without moving in order to enjoy the treat and hope to catch some semblance of a breeze from the barely open sliding door.  

What gets me is that moments earlier I asked the counter guy why it was so hot in there and he basically waved it off as if he didn't know what I was talking about...then he turned around to make my coffee and the entire back of his shirt was sopping wet with sweat. I'm completely bewildered!

Service...okay, friendly, fast.  They seem nice even when sweaty and sticky. Decor...modern, pretty, but nothing you wouldn't find elsewhere. Location: great for people watching.  Food: what I had was really tasty and the coffee was exceptional...and for that you get 3 stars.

But the whole a/c thing was just plain stupid."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2012-03-21,5.0,"Given the 20 minutes between changes I was allowed I had no idea where to take my espresso - without the usual review of places I found this online and headed in. 

Normally I have to say so much to get a latte - I didn't say a word here- and ended up with one of the best lattes I've had in New York. 

I've been to them all - Joe's, Doma, Something torrefaction colombe- RBC, , 9th st, blue bottle, aroma, 3rd rail, mommo,.... 

This was the best. 

And the cookie I had was not bad either."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2012-02-25,3.0,"3.5 UPDATED - Teeny - a bar and 2 tables. Connected to a hair salon called beba blue. V nice, homegrown feel. Nice cappuccinos, and they leave you alone to do your work. Free WIFI which is amazing and also nice bar seats that face the window to look out on 9th ave. A refreshing change from Starbucks. Nothing special but totally chill which I love.
UPDATE - FYI NO BATHROOMS!!!!"
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2013-04-09,2.0,"Not a great spot to get your coffee. The place is tiny, mostly for a take-out, no restroom, and the quality of coffee is below average with very high prices. I gave this place few tries, but eventually just ended up walking one more block and getting a regular deli coffee. They also have desserts and snack food like sandwiches, which are never fresh even in the morning. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time and money."
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2011-12-08,2.0,It only got 2 stars because the guy making my espresso drink was making it in a suit!
713,buongiorno-espresso-bar-new-york,2015-12-02,4.0,I randomly came in here because I was staying right across the street. Espresso here was great! It's almost like a coffee stand you see in Italy. You just quickly have a cup of espresso and go. The place is tiny so this is not a kind of place you can stay for hours.
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2020-03-12,5.0,"It was a quick visit but I felt like so much had happen that
made me extremely happy that I stopped by. 

What a win to be surrounded by so many dogs. Instant smile on my face. 

We were a big group that ordered together. I called out my order first and the rest went after. Somehow my drink was missed and it wasn't charged. The error was noticed by a staff member and was quickly fixed. Thank you for the kind gesture - the iced chai latte was superb."
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-12-30,3.0,"Very cozy little coffee shop that can be found inside of the Highline Hotel. I've been to Intelligentsia coffee shops before and thoroughly enjoy their product. This time, however, was slightly different. There are two reasons I'm giving this location three stars instead of the four stars which they would have gotten at other locations I've been to. Price... price and flavor. Let me explain... 

I had ordered two matcha lattes with oat milk. Now, I certainly understand that there's a slight premium here, but I was so completely caught off guard when the barista rang me up. Almost SEVENTEEN DOLLARS for two drinks. The only thing that rivals that outrageous price is when I was in London. The height of the pound which was $1.97 USD for every £1 - that's the time I paid almost $8 USD for a grande latte from Starbucks. 

Usually a fan, Intelligentsia, but this was highway robbery. 

On the flavor front, the taste was too milky and not matcha-y-enough."
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-12-20,5.0,"ORDER
- blk coffee (ethiopia tikur ambessa) 

NOTES
- citrus, smooth, dry wine, bread, fruit, elegant
- not bitter at all
- paper cup may have offset the initial flavor

SERVICE
- friendly, supportive, provided good portion sample before purchase.
 
FINAL THOUGHTS 
- really impressed with the quality and taste of this coffee. It's comes from a direct trade which means it is bought directly from the farmer. This provides better support and profits to the farmers. It's a win win for all parties involved."
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2020-05-16,4.0,"Great coffee shop inside the Highline Hotel in NYC. From the wonderful beans and chocolate in their mochas to the ample outdoor seating, I enjoy stopping by this place when I am in NYC!"
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-03-24,4.0,"Cute coffee shop inside the Highline Hotel in Chelsea. The shop was very classy and had an olden day feel to it. I felt like I was getting coffee in the 1960s. Leather couches and tables are all around. There's a patio area in front too if you want to enjoy the weather. Service was super friendly and patient. Got the Herbal Tea and my friend got a Latte. The presentation of the Herbal tea was super cute. Definitely taste the kick of herbs. We also got a pastry to snack on. The pastry was not bad. Had some dried tomatoes in it, but the bread was super dry. Overall, cute and relaxing little spot to chill at. 

AS ALWAYS, NOM FOR LIFE!"
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2020-02-17,5.0,Fell in love with the atmosphere at this coffee shop. It is so cozy and there are so many places to sit. The baristas here are so friendly and fun. Latte was very yummy!
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-20,3.0,"Coffee was ok.
I did not find anything special from the taste of coffee. 
I like the cozy atmosphere. But there was not many seat inside."
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2020-01-18,2.0,"The coffee is not great unless you are into bitter and sour tasting coffee. The ambiance is also meh. A lot of people, nowhere to sit and the staff are very slow. 
Not all coffee options are listed on the menu, but said they can make anything."
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-07-28,4.0,"It's hard to find intelligentsia coffee in nyc. This is the only location. It's inside a chic hotel and the vibe is great. There's sitting inside with classic feel to it and also outdoor sitting which is secluded from outside. 

Coffee isn't bad, but it's not as good as having it in Chicago. Not as strong and tasted a bit more waterly compared to what I had in Chicago."
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-05-15,4.0,It's a coffee chain originally from Chicago/Michigan area. It's a perfect coffee spot near high line during summer. Their outdoor seating is great with lots of tree in the garden. They serve coffee both inside and outside(if open). Inside it's a hotel. A little bit too crowded inside. There are not much seats inside and usually full of the tourists with luggages from the hotel. Don't recommend to come here in the winter since you're be drinking coffee with a bunch of tourists who are waiting for check in/out. I love their black cat coffee bean and cold brew is both very strong and it tastes very unique. It's definitely the top coffee shop in nyc that I would recommend to friends.
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-05-19,4.0,"Coffee was ok, on par with ""good"" nyc coffee.

I would come back for the stuffed doughnuts and the courtyard in the back. It's a great place to hang out. 

Great rest stop if you want to take a break from walking the High Line.

I look forward to going back."
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-02-19,3.0,"I'll admit I was craving Intelligentsia after watching Jerry Seinfeld's episode of Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee with Bill Burr. This location is very swanky and in the lobby of the High Line Hotel, directly in front of you as you enter. The pour-over is very smooth and high-quality, and is one of the best I've had in the city. However, it's so expensive that I wouldn't be able to make this a regular spot! A plain coffee was more than $4, double its counterparts nearby. The cappuccino is also more than $5, and the portion you get is very limited (a bit bigger than a typical espresso).  

Seating is limited here. And because of that, when others grab a seat, it'll take forever for them to leave. There are a couple couches and four or so stools by the counter, so once you grab space, snatch it up. Otherwise, you'll be waiting endlessly! 

One day, I'll splurge on one of those monstrous, perfect croissants..."
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2020-03-02,4.0,"You have to give respect to Intelligentsia - the original third wave coffee roaster. I think Intelligentsia in general is slightly bitter for my taste, but others love it. Either way, they can make a damn nice cappuccino. 

This coffee shop is in a hotel and slightly lacking in seating, but still very nice. The hotel allows dogs, so there are a number of dogs around the coffee area. Personally, I love dogs, so this was a major treat. Plus, it was incredibly adorable to watch the toddlers playing with the dogs. 

Overall, I would recommend this place."
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2018-09-28,5.0,"This place just got a revamp out front and looks amazing.  Honestly I can't think of anywhere better to go for a coffee indoors or out. 

Out front is like the botanical gardens and out back is the courtyard. In between is like being in an old station waiting room. 

I love it !!!! Coffee and atmosphere are brilliant."

Today it's our second time here. Love the environment, cozy and yet feeling very old school feel with the leather sofa and old fashioned design! Definitely a good place to catch up with friends or catch up some readings! The matcha croissant is good and latte! Nothing to complain about. Friendly staffs!

Strongly recommended this place!! Can't wait for summer should be even nicer"
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-08-16,4.0,"This is a super pretty coffee shop with an incredibly friendly staff! I would absolutely recommend Intelligentsia as a great place to bring your laptop and get some work done, or to catch up with a friend. If you're looking for specialty beverages or a wide menu range (something like Starbucks) you should look elsewhere. Their limited menu is one of quality I have to say. They offer any espresso beverage you would hope to find as well as a small selection of delicious pastries. The outdoor sitting area which is part of the high line hotel is beautiful as well."

There's wasn't a ton of seating available and the area is cozy. I wouldn't say it's ideal to hang out at due to the foot traffic in the area but the coffee was pretty solid.

It's finished with cayenne pepper which makes it really pop . It's  creamy , and peppery with  subtle hints of citrus and vanilla . It's Mmmm Mmmm Mmm soooooooo good . I payed $7.50 which includes tax and tip and would happily do so again everyday of the week until they stopped offering  this limited edition specialty item . It's literally the best thing I've tasted in months and the customer service is so wonderful . The nicest New Yorkers also seem to frequent this establishment with their dogs .

Davey, Patrick, Gabby and Bo are incredible - they know all the regulars and are always friendly, positive, and engaging.

It's such a treat to have this fantastic team and this wonderful coffee in this beautiful space in my neighborhood - thank you all for being so awesome!!! :)

This isn't really a cafe, and it reminded me a bit of a hotel lobby. It's dark though and has an interesting ambience. I got a matcha latte, and the matcha flavor was quite average. Price-wise, it was extremely expensive for a regular-sized cup."
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-08-12,1.0,"I came by today on this lovely summer day to have my morning latte. I approached the coffee truck in the front courtyard and ordered a latte with skim milk. I was told that the price was $5.44 without tip. I handed my credit card to the sullen woman working the truck and patiently waited for my order. 

While waiting, I observed that the posted menu stated that a latte was $4.30. I quickly did the math in my head, and even with tax, I was overcharged. As such, I queried the hostile barista about this, and she flatly stated that the menu was wrong. Seriously??

I pushed further and said that you have a posted menu with incorrect prices and you have not done anything about it? She just looked at me dumbly and simply said, ""Do you want your money back?""  She obviously was aware of this issue. I mean....wow, just WOW. 

So in response to her question, what I want is to be charged the prices stated on the menu. In fact, this is NY State law. These people are crooks and are knowingly running this scam on all of their customers. You do the math on how much money over the course of months that they are scamming. It is absolutely disgusting, and I will no longer support Intelligentsia Coffee. 

It may only be a dollar, but it is the principle. Illegal and immoral business conduct should not be supported. 

You Have All Been Warned!!"
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2018-06-11,4.0,"I am a HUGE Intelligentsia fan! We brew Intelligentsia coffee at home, and anytime we are in Chicago and LA we stop by the stores for delicious lattes and food, and to buy more cups. 

Every time I visit any city I double check to see if there is an Intelligentsia there. New York has never had one, so I was delighted to find this location this time. 

Intelligentsia is located inside the High Line Hotel, which is absolutely lovely from what I saw of it. While the coffee shop appears to be more of when a hotel brews Starbucks coffee vs has a Starbucks inside it, however I was assured this was not the case. They do sell some Intelligentsia items, however not the trademark state cups which was a disappointment. 

I ordered a latte with their Oatly milk. I love this milk so much! If you are looking for a dairy free alternative I highly recommend it! 

The pastries were good looking, but I opted for a bar. The bar was so good I am ordering them to have at home. Wow!  

There is an inside and outside area to order and sit both of which are beautiful. The only reason I give this place 4 stars vs 5 is because it is not your typical Intelligentsia experience.  If you can get passed that, or have never been in Chicago or LA, you will love it!"
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2019-08-16,4.0,Best damn cup of coffee I've had in a very long time. Stayed at the Highline for 3 nights and couldn't wait to get a cup every morning or two for that matter!! Would have gotten five stars but the lobby is a little hectic for relaxing. Sat out in the garden area which was quite nice.
714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2018-08-24,3.0,"The coffee is always a hit, but the baristas are sometimes amiss. For the past few years, if I'm not brewing coffee at home nearby, I'm grabbing an Intelligentsia honey latte at the Highline Hotel. A honey latte is your typical latte with honey drizzled at the bottom before the latte is prepared. It's a perfect, natural sweetener and complement to Intelligentsia's coffee, and I would grab one enough that I knew the welcoming barista's names and they knew my order a couple of years ago.

However, in my second to last recent visit, I grabbed coffee and pastries with a friend, and the small blonde barista was not friendly, flat out ignored any ""good morning"", ""thank you"", and despite being spoken to and smiled at, did not engage.

In my last visit, a different barista taking my order claimed that they do not make honey lattes and pointed to the honey on their counter, instructing that I could pour in honey myself if I wanted. I am by no means needy or so much of a diva that I can't pour my own honey, but for the past 4-5 years, other baristas had no problem pouring the honey beforehand.

Perhaps both times I arrived, I received the brunt of a post-morning rush, but the friendly faces that I once encountered while treating myself to a sweet coffee are no longer there and I now leave with a bitter taste."

714,intelligentsia-coffee-new-york-3,2018-01-20,3.0,"OVERALL MEH: The architectural designs here make it an unique experience but the coffee or hot chocolate were disappointing. Overall I don't recommend. 

ENVIRONMENT: the cafe is located on the first floor of the High Line Hotel. On the outside, this hotel looks like an ancient architecture. The brick wall interior exudes a medieval feel. The inside space is a little crowded with hotel guests and visitors. As a result, it can be difficult to find a seat on the couch. Not having many tables or individual seats - so only come if you are looking for a casual setting. 

COFFEE: We ordered a hot chocolate and a latte and waited for over 10mins. There's a long line of customers as mentioned earlier. The latte doesn't taste like coffee because they added a lot of milk, but if that's what you like then it's good. DO NOT order the hot chocolate - it's sour for some reason."

However, the customer service was snobbish at best. The baristas were not willing to interact and were cold which I only prefer for my beverage. 

We did go to the truck outside but they didn't have the Angelina and only sell the most basic of coffee items. Go inside for the more specialty items."

It has a comfortable outdoor patio where people could lounge, work and enjoy in. The indoor cafe is still around and is perfect for the winter time.

At lunch time this place can get pretty hectic. Lots of people stop by this place to get their coffee or a quick bite. The prices here a reasonable as I was able to get a small latte for $3.80. Wasn't feeling like forking our $5 today at other boutique coffee places.

They have a decent selection of sandwiches and salads and yogurts on the left when you walk in. They do a pretty good job on restocking the area. They also have plenty of seating in the back. The bathrooms is located way in the back to the left so if your a tourist and need to take a piss, this is where you can go. But I believe it is passcoded so you got to buy something small to get the code or just ask the baristas.

The cups says organic, I'm not even sure what organic coffee means, but if you're those organic enthusiast this place is for you. I found out they also sell cookies for 1.99 so I'm definitely going to try them out next time when I'm bored at work and want to get something sweet midday."

715,pret-a-manger-new-york-46,2019-12-06,4.0,Cool cozy little cafe. I got a green tea here and it had to be one of the best brewed teas I've ever tasted. There was so much flavor in it without having to add any honey or sugar! They have public bathrooms but they shut them down at a certain time of the night. We were there around 9 so they were already closed for the night so we had to go next door. That's really irritating for paying customers.

715,pret-a-manger-new-york-46,2018-09-14,2.0,"My latte tasted like milk (as if there was no espresso in it), and the wifi in the back of the cafe was so bad that I had to use my phone hotspot at some point since it kept cutting out. To make things worse, the booth chairs are uncomfortable since they force my back to arch forward, so I couldn't sit for more than 30mins-1hr.

I put two stars because the people are nice, but this is one of my least favorite cafes I've worked in in NYC. (Note my review is for its coffee and seating area - I have not tried the pastries)"

Cold :

715,pret-a-manger-new-york-46,2019-06-11,2.0,"The food's fresh and good, but it seems that every day there are new people behind the counter. Some are good, but some not so much. Also they seem to ""run out"" of some staples. I come for oatmeal three mornings per week and sometimes they have no butter. That being said the steel cut oatmeal is great even if the service isn't always up to snuff. Also there seems to be an issue with staff turnover because I don't see the same staff every week. I spoke with the manager and I didn't find his response helpful. I will try going to the Pret nearby on Park avenue."

They have good vegan food for lunch, calm athmosphere. But just like 30 min ago I was ordered hot chocolate on almond milk. I was ask girl who made it if it's on almond milk,just to confirm, and she sayd ""yes"". When I drink like 1/4 of cup it was ok, I feel almond milk, but also weird taste of dairy, so I just back to work and left it for later. Now my stomach feels horrible, and for sure she put some sort of the dairy inside, I am allergic and it's just really disappointed for me. 
She lied me in the eyes, just because she was probably lazy to remake it. 
Glad that I figured out that it contains dairy on 1/4 cup and I didn't drink more."

dark roast coffee was actually pretty good and the price wasn't bad. windows out on to Madison Avenue allow for some good people watching."

As my lack thereof work grew longer and longer, how I was going to pay my bills and eat became a matter of great concernment.  Ergo, I curated the cheapest sandwich available by carefully crafting my selection-- Parmesan, Tomato & Aioli at $3.99.  It was dry and lack any Parmesan taste and the Aioli sauce was nonexistent for the Provencal traditional sauce made of garlic, olive oil were all omitted.  MEH!!  It was not worth the try regardless of money.  Big fat MEH!! Staff is cordial and nothing more than to serve patrons like robots in a monotone rhythmic motion.

715,pret-a-manger-new-york-46,2015-01-18,4.0,"I really like this store. 
Staff was friendly and fast. 

Ordered a latte and it was pretty good. Smooth. Good espresso flavor. I also got a 5 grain oatmeal that had oats, quinoa, amaranth, flaxseed and chia seed. They offered to add toppings but I figured I would try it on its own. And it definitely didn't need anything. It was already sweetened with something to calm to quinoa taste.. likely cane sugar. I'm less a fan of the sugar taste, but is was subtle. 99% of people would probably prefer it sweetened. 

Another good point, price was reasonable. I think my latte and oatmeal was around $7. So it is comparable to starbucks. I have been going to some of the side cafes the last couple mornings and spending $8 o $9 and the latte's haven't been good. So for same price and decent food, this place is a win."
715,pret-a-manger-new-york-46,2017-10-18,3.0,Super quick and easy meal to grab and go. It's always good but nothing super special. Prices can be a little steep for what you're getting but convenience makes up for it. They have a great deal going that gives you free coffee with the app.
715,pret-a-manger-new-york-46,2017-09-22,4.0,"These employees are hopped up on happy pills. I don't know what this corporation is providing in employee incentives or if they're training them through the same machine that churns out the stepford wives but they are always so genial, happy, happy to serve. It doesn't seem forced or fake neither. Happy happy joy joy.
Food is pre-made but made fresh daily. It is commendable that the company donates any unsold foods made that day to charity for the homeless and hungry. My staples are the baguettes (the breads are so good) with tuna cucumber or the ham and cheese (sometimes too much mustard which makes the sandwich too spicy) and those fresh baked cookies are like homemade (soft melty chocolate chips). I hate you, Pret, because I can't grab lunch without getting a sinful cookie with it. Coffees (specifically my lattes) tends to be bitter though, not sure if it's the beans or just the way the grounds are packed in the filter thigamajig of the espresso machine. Nevertheless, this is an easy quick lunch to pick up for me, so I can dedicate more drudge hours in my office. Maybe I need some of those Pret happy pills."
715,pret-a-manger-new-york-46,2017-07-25,5.0,"Delicious food! Love the vibe of the whole place where you can pick your food and just sit down.

The store is spacious and cozy  with comfortable booths, chairs and clean restroom. It's usually quite empty in the evening. It fits for a book or long time chat with friends 

The banana honey yogurt is so delicious.
I like their Chai latte used real chai tea bag instead of Chai syrup like that in Starbucks. ."
715,pret-a-manger-new-york-46,2015-09-22,4.0,"I'm surprised that I haven't gone here more often, as it is close to my office.

Generally, I would give Pret 3-3 1/2 stars.  I'm going to bump this one up to 4, because it is spacious and clean, and the staff here are very nice (not that the staff at other Pret stores aren't nice).

And, yes, I enjoyed the food.  The premade sandwiches here are very good.  I really liked the mint pea soup that they sold over the summer.  Recently, they started selling burritos.  They aren't bad.

Today I tried their cucumber seltzer.  On my first sip, I thought ""HUH?""  But it grew on me, and in the end I liked it.

All-in-all, I have had enjoyable lunches here and plan to visit more often in the future."
715,pret-a-manger-new-york-46,2015-10-09,4.0,"I really enjoy Pret. I frequent the location near my office on Madison Ave and 39th St in Manhattan. The food is made daily so it is always fresh. They generally have both a vegan and vegetarian selection. All of their meals have calories listed. The food selection is a great lunch choice and it includes sandwiches and wraps - both hot and cold, soups, salad, hot meals, mini pots of food, yogurts, and juices. The coffee is pretty decent too. They also serve breakfast items. Sweets are on the menu too, including little bites - brownie or nuts - which make for a really nice crave buster. Sometimes if I go in for just coffee and its not crowded they will give me free coffee. Also - it always smells like fresh baked cookies or croissants! Oh and its largely organic. 

The best of all is that Pret donates left over food to charity. They are also a non for profit organization that supports sustainable solutions to alleviate hunger and homelessness in the US.

Minor issue is that it is on the more expensive side for this type of ""fast food""."

Food is always fresh, they definitely adhere to the ""make it today, gone today"" line they promote.

I usually like to mix and match some of their healthier sandwich options (balsamic chicken, and coronated chicken on 9 grain bread). Once in a while I'll splurge on a soup (mediterranean lentil for the win)!!

Glad they added another fresh lunch option in this area."

This time I also asked for a scone (forgot which kind, but I noticed, err, smelled that it's fresh-ly baked so I decided to give it a try). What I like about this place is it's being consistently neat. Even the bathroom is neat, which is impressive for me. The coffee's really strong & good (I always take mine black!). I can only wish they'll open until 11pm but I don't think they serve the same market as that of Starbucks, so that won't happen. Also, they're more expensive (for certain food items, really)."

715,pret-a-manger-new-york-46,2011-05-20,4.0,"Our 1st meal in NY was at Pret-a-Manger. It was too early to check into our hotel, so while my sister and I were wandering the streets to kill time, we came across this chain.

The restaurant is bright & clean.  Against the wall are refrigerated cases stocked with pre-made grab 'n go sandwiches & wraps, as well as yogurt parfaits called yogurt pots. They also have freshly baked croissants, pastries & bagels.  Service was great!  Everyone was very friendly and since we took so long browsing at all the options, they approached us to offer assistance.  When they realized the wrap my sister wanted was out of stock, they immediately made one up for her.  (On a different day we had stopped by the location inside 30 Rockefeller and they definitely were not as friendly or attentative.)
 
My sister had the Avocado Pine Nut Wrap (avocado, toasted pine nuts, Mediterranean dressing, Parmesan, basil, tomato, cucumber, spinach, Pret's seasoning, tortilla wrap) which I tried a bite even though I typically don't care for wraps.  It was delicious and of course very fresh since they just made it, and it was obvious only quality all natural ingredients were used.

I had the Blueberry & Yogurt Pot (Ronnybrook lowfat yogurt, fresh blueberries, granola) and although it wasn't something I couldn't of found elsewhere, the clean environment and friendly service made it so much tastier.  I was craving it the whole week I was in NY.

On the pricier side but to be expected for fresh, all natural food.  I definitely love all the healthy food options Pret offers and sure hope they consider expanding into California."

I got a beef baguette, which had roasted beef, arugula, Parmesan and mayo totaling to $6.52, including tax. The sandwich was really good. It was a nice size and I felt healthy eating it. The only problem I had with it was all the mayo on it, which took away from the rest of the ingredients but whatever, I wouldn't mind sampling all of Pret-a-Manger's food even if it had too much mayo. 

Also, if you decide to eat in the establishment you can look at all of the creative, fun posters on the walls, which advertise the freshness of their products. The pictures show different foods being shaped into other items, like they managed to make cabbage leaves and a string bean look like a butterfly. The pictures are so cute and pretty!"

Cons:
- Way overpriced

- Hard to find a seat at lunch

Verdict:
Things would be different if it were cheaper. But it's midtown and it's what you expect. However, it's better than the rest because the employees are consistently friendly and the coffee is consistently good. Note: the ""strong"" coffee will make your brain sizzle."

I got their latte with oat milk. It came to ~$5.80. They didn't ask me for sizes, so I assume there's only one size for their to go cups. The latte itself wasn't bad. It mostly just tasted like it had half of a shot of espresso with a full cup of oat milk. 

On the bright side, the baristas make latte art even in the to go cups. :)"

After a long day and impromptu visit to the Whitney, my boyfriend and I were desperately craving coffee. Lucky for us, our favorite coffee shop, Blue Bottle, was located just a couple blocks away! This location is smaller than most others I have been to and is very convenient for a coffee on the go. There is additional seating on the second floor but we didn't check it out. 

We both ordered our usual favorites, the New Orleans Iced Coffee and a Cappuccino with oat milk (I have a soft spot for their warm coffees because they are brewed to perfection!). We got our coffees quickly and the barista even let my boyfriend pour his own milk from behind the counter into his coffee. 

We enjoyed our coffees on a nice walk through the rustic and calm streets of the Meatpacking District. As always, I highly recommend Blue Bottle Coffee!"
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2018-10-31,4.0,"My go-to coffee shop in NYC. The service is fast for a cup of joe and the quality is superb. The prices are quite standard compared to the other specialty shops around the city. This is not the reason why I am a repeat customer here. 

I severely rely on caffeine to function throughout the day. I am not sure if it is because the bean is lightly roasted but Blue Bottle coffee is guaranteed to keep me functioning.

I usually go with the Kenya roast which has a fruity note to its aroma. On days that I feel like enjoying quality crema, I'll go with the macchiato. Come in on a slower day so that the workers aren't too rushed to make you a quality drink, and you'll see why the drinks here are quite on point."

I tried the espresso and it was well made. You can see the baristas making it the proper way, using the correct machines and utensils. Some say you can tell the quality of the espresso by the ""crema""on top, don't know if that's just coffee snob talk or if it's actually factual. Nonetheless the espresso did the job. It was served with some soda water which I always appreciate. 

Little seating area, maybe 10 or less but I'd imagine that people just pick up their coffee and go. Pretty good place and fast service."
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2018-04-19,5.0,"Coffee snob alert! I'm hugely picky when it comes to my coffee, and Blue Bottle is one of my favorite coffee bars in the world. Now it's not as life changing as an espresso in Italy, but it's pretty dang close. This is authentic coffee that's absolutely delicious and anyone serious about the beverage needs to come here. 

This is their original location (it's proven to be so popular that Blue Bottle has expanded), located right across the street from the foodie heaven that is Chelsea Market. It's in a former Meatpacking District loading dock, which means the space is cramped with very limited seating. There are a couple of stools downstairs where you order but sometimes the (also tiny) upstairs area is open and there are a few more stools up there. This isn't a place you can come and hang out and work or spend the afternoon, it's a grab and go type of place. 

 Physically, our first-ever Manhattan cafe is located in the former l. Artistically, it's located at the heart of the fashion, art, and film worlds. This may be the only place in New York where you can visit a gallery, attend a film festival, order several kilos of meat, walk on railroad tracks that have been turned into a city park, attend a world-famous museum, and have a Blue Bottle coffee--all in one afternoon.

The coffee rotates seasonally, with a different single origin coffee for both drip coffee and espresso and varying blends. Their popular Retrofit coffee is an unusual blend of coffee beans of different origins, and its super delicious. The baristas are carefully trained too, so it's fun to watch them in action. Order a classic espresso or an espresso based drink and admire how they pull the coffee at a precise 32 second extraction time. (Told you I'm a coffee snob)! 

The care they put into roasting and crafting these beverages shows. The coffee is always smooth, rich, slightly sweet and nutty. I absolutely adore the flavor of their roasts here. And the coffee art is top notch too. All of these elements takes the sting out of paying nearly $4 for a cappuccino. Guys, it's actually worth it here."

Clean facilities and additional seating upstairs, across of Chelsea market, excellent service, no crazy lines, and my coffee was perfectly made.

I would definitely come back & probably will before I leave NYC. Comparable to its West Coast shop in the SF Ferry Building!"
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2018-03-22,4.0,"Nice coffee shop by Chelsea Market. The shop is very nice ad clean inside. The staff was super pleasant and seemed excited to be there.

I got a regular latte and it was really good! Much better than chain coffee shops. There isn't too much space if you go and it's busy, but when I was there around mid morning, there was space to sit down and enjoy the coffee.

I will be coming back here when I am back in nyc!"

The staff here is so nice, the place is always clean, and they keep things moving even when a line forms. Today I had a lovely chat with a barista named Elijah who so kindly comped my coffee! I tried their fall seasonal drip coffee and am already a big fan. Speaking of the coffee, this stuff is NO JOKE. It's way more than a little afternoon pick-me-up, but the best part about it is that they offer most drinks decaf or half-caf, so if you're sensitive to caffeine there are options for everyone. I also love that Blue Bottle has a super extensive nutritional facts booklet available for all of their drinks. If you look it up online, they break out what the nutrition facts look like for everything on the menu with all of their various milk options. I love this place and am happy to be so close, can't wait to continue coming here and trying all of their seasonal blends!"

Great flavor, just the right amount of sweetness, and the oatly oat milk added the perfect creaminess. One of my favorite iced coffee drinks I've had ! They also have almond milk. They serve all the other typical espresso type drinks as well. Small selection of pastries. 

Cute little location in meatpacking/ Chelsea area very near to Chelsea market. No seating really. It's more to take and go. Friendly baristas!! I'd come back for the iced coffee. Yummm!"

While their coffee is rather good, in general, the morning staff definitely need to work on their service. They're unfriendly, almost rude, they chat amongst themselves and in no way, are mindful of time or how long they take to make a coffee, even if the place is quiet, and there's no other orders, they will take a long time."

Bf got a cold brew and I got a pour-over Rwanda which had a true depth of flavour and was brilliantly roasted. I've truly never had a bad coffee from Blue Bottle, and they continue to impress (even though they're a bit on the pricier side for a coffee shop)."

I have never had a bad drink here. This location has an upstairs area for visiting or working. Downstairs can get pretty crowded and seating is tight. We have never really had to wait long to order or get our drinks."
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2017-07-23,3.0,"Good coffee -- plenty of attitude.  

I take mine black without any condiments -- so the Columbian Cold Brew over ice was my choice for a hot day.

Not sure why so many NYC coffeehouses in sizzling neighborhoods employ folks with such poor temperament.  OK -- so I understand that after about the 1000th tourist asks the same dumb question -- you want to jump out of your skin -- but hey -- that's the job -- customer service! 

Not sure that Starbuck's cold brew available just a few blocks north (at a price a few bucks south) tastes any less rich.

If the cool factor matters to you and you're  the target demographic -- choose BBC.  Otherwise -- you will get an equivalent beverage with better service at Starbucks."
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2018-06-03,5.0,"My fiancé and I always come to this location for our iced macchiatos! The coffee is tasty & the employees are always so nice. They have a bunch of pastries and many coffee and non-coffee options.

It's a veryy small space but there is an upstairs. It's always busy so there's a little wait; but it's worth it! 

Enjoy!"

Apart from the apathetic staff (with the exception of one lady who was pleasant) the coffee was good and lives up to the quality one can expect from the Blue bottle brand. Definitely a tight space with limited seating, it is much more fit for grab and go. There are no outlets nor restrooms, so this location isn't that suited for longer stays."
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2018-06-24,5.0,"Bluebottle always gets a 5/5 in my book. From the coffee to the staff and to the design aesthetic, it is a welcomed oasis from the hustle and bustle of nyc, especially when one is  caffeine deprived. ;) . Finally got a chance to try the new orleans ice coffee (something I had been craving since my recent visit to NOLA and the historically fabulous cafe du monde, though I am usually a cold brew or cortado kind of girl) and it was delicious. The barista recommended the oatly (oat milk non dairy alternative to almond and soy that has been making waves through coffee shops) and it was suprisingly creamier than expected and paired well with the coffee. Will be back soon!"
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2016-06-20,4.0,"I have heard of Blue Bottle for years and was SO excited to find a location en route our NYC foodie tour. After leaving the nearby Black Tap burger joint, we stopped by for a coffee break so I could make it through the rest of the afternoon and night.

INTERIOR:
The storefront is small, but there is a second level where you can sit at the bar. My sister and I sat in front of the counter where there was very limited bench space. 

SERVICE:
The baristas are all super hipster, as to be expected by all baristas in Manhattan nowadays. I ordered an iced latte - it was just too hot for anything else - and waited for it patiently while he took more orders before starting on my espresso.

COFFEE:
My iced latte was smooth and creamy. Better than any other latte I've had in a while. It was easy drinking, although a little light on the espresso. Worth the slight upcharge in price from Starbucks? Most definitely yes. 

Overall, this location of Blue Bottle Coffee is pretty convenient, though slightly hidden. The coffee is worth it to go out of the way for it - I don't always have the cash for Ninth Street Espresso inside Chelsea Market. While this may not be the place you hang out all day to study or get work done on a laptop, it's a great place to grab some quick, quality coffee."
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2018-03-22,5.0,"I've been a Blue Bottle fan for a little over two years now, having most of their brews delivered to me via mail for me to make at home. I consider myself to be a pour-over pro, but these guys take it up a notch. Maybe I'll quit my job and take up Barista training at Blue Bottle?

Jokes aside, this place is the real deal. They are very friendly and well-trained, able to service the hardened coffee drinker (myself) and the skeptical, less informed coffee drinker (my mother) all with a smile. Thank you for showing patience and hospitality to my Southern parents and making their visit worthwhile. My mother still talks about the iced coffee she had at this location as if it's the only coffee she's ever had in her life! :)"
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2016-11-28,4.0,"Oh man, this is one smooth cup of coffee.  It's set just down the street from Chelsea Market so it can get pretty popular.  Truth be told, I had the pleasure of being introduced to Blue Bottle out in California and fell in love with it.  My friend got me a bag of ground coffee from them and it is seriously one of the smoothest caffeinated beverages I've had.

I came here after my exploring of Chelsea one afternoon and needed a quick pick-me-up.  I didn't want anything too high in caffeine otherwise I would have gone for a simple pour-over with their Chemex so I opted for a decaf latte instead.  One thing that I noticed: there is an upcharge for the almond milk should you choose that substitution.  That's totally fine except it's some serious top-grade almond milk.  I know this because I use it and it's ridiculously expensive at Whole Foods, but it tastes the best.  Super rich and creamy, but not overly nutty.

The coffee is somehow so ridiculously smooth going down.  I've had two more coffees/lattes at other famous places like the cafe at the Highline Hotel and the other one which hails from Brooklyn but for some reason, Blue Bottle seems to stick with me as the smoothest.

One of the things that I noticed which is more an issue of efficiency due to poor design is the counter.  On one end there is the barista and espresso bar.  In the middle there is the cashier and on the opposite end, the pour-overs for drip coffee.  I suppose what patrons are supposed to do is wait just away from the bar period.  The reason is, if you wait for your latte at the end of the bar, the barista has to walk all the way from one end to the opposite end just to deliver your drink.  That takes so much time and can potentially get in the way of the person in the middle taking the order and then interrupting the person making the pour-overs.  Not to mention, how is this the most efficient when it comes to a rush?  I guess having worked as a barista for a short period of time, I'm almost always worried about the rush.  But then again, as famous as Blue Bottle is, I suppose patrons won't really care about the wait since they are willing to wait in a very long line for ridiculously good coffee anyway haha.

I'd totally come here again if I'm ever in Chelsea.  I love its little hidden location which I'm sure is not going to be very hidden once it takes off on YELP.  Can't wait to come back and try out their seating location upstairs!"
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2019-06-17,1.0,"Currently standing outside. If your employees can't get it together to open on time, change your hours. Ridiculous to have so many people waiting outside... now they have let us in. But only one barista. So the wait for drinks will be long. How hard is it for you guys to hire enough employees for your 7 dollar lattes? Been here ten mins... still no latte. I've been coming here for so long - never again."
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2016-08-26,5.0,"One of these days, I will get to try their siphon bar upstairs. But until then, I am just glad there is yet another Blue Bottle Coffee located somewhere in the city. This little hidden location is strategically located away from the crowds near the High Line and Chelsea Piers. It is a great stop for a quick pick-me-up along the way to Chelsea Piers to get your heart pumping if you are getting ready for any sporting activity, even walking. 

Blue Bottle's coffee quality remains the undisputed best in New York City. As a coffee fanatic, I can't give them anything but five stars for that alone. Now that coffee prices have risen across the city, what used to be paying a premium for good coffee seems like a bargain discount. 

Cheers to a nice cup of New Orleans Iced Coffee!"
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2018-06-30,4.0,"I frequent this location, as it's close to the office, and...omg....they make one of the best lattes I've ever had! However at $5.80 with tax, it's a bit on the pricey side. 

Don't let the lines of my Asian brethren fool you into thinking this is a tourist fad. Blue bottle is here to stay!"

""Hi""
So I waited and stared then he said what can I get you. Then proceeded to order
$9+ for a disgusting cappuccino that didn't even taste like espresso because they probably pulled the shot horribly & good pound cake. 
These guys don't know how to make coffee. My cappuccino wasn't even dry
They are in a rush and don't care to pour art nicely or steam the milk well

I saw the guy not paying attention and the steaming milk gushed out. 

Seriously and no place to sit or bathrooms. What kind of prices are these?  Go to the ones in LA !!!!!

I threw 50% of it away"

Couldn't bring myself to spend $4.50 on a latte though (I'm a poor college student), so I went for the New Orleans style iced coffee (which was still $4), but it was so worth it. The coffee is cold-brewed with chicory and then sweetened with cane sugar and milk. The coffee wasn't overly milky or overly sweet and left no bitter aftertaste. I usually have to doctor up any kind of iced coffee I order, but this one was perfection. Also had the lemon poppyseed poundcake which was a nice snack for a beautiful day in Chelsea. The guys were really nice and helpful and I'll definitely be back!"

Blue Bottle is all over the place now, and you can imagine that there'd be every opportunity for standards to slip.  As I remarked most recently in my review of the Venice location, the Blue Bottle team does a great job of training its baristas -- the quality remains astoundingly high."
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2016-09-08,2.0,I was very disappointed at my New Orleans iced coffee. I did tired it at other locations. I did love their New Orleans iced coffee but not the one I got from this location. It's too bitter and not smooth. I was very sad when I sipped the coffee.

However, I was also surprised that it came with milk and sugar.  When I asked if I could get it without those, the gentleman said it was pre-mixed, BUT then I watched him pour in the milk ... and a lot of milk!?!  I always drink my coffee black (no milk or sugar) so to me, it tasted so milked down that I could barely taste the coffee, let alone the chicory.  So disappointed.  If there's a next time, I'll just order the regular cold brew sans milk and sugar."

Black coffee for over $5? Ridiculous! There is also very minimal seating here, which was frustrating because the coffee took a long time for them to make. There is more seating in the back / upstairs but then it's hard to hear when your drink is ready. The coffee itself was fine, but I'd honestly have a much better time at Starbucks."

It's a small shop so I couldn't just idly admire them make the coffee so I had to go up and order my cup of Joe. Honestly I had idea what I was looking to order but the New Orleans caught my eye. Not know how it tasted or whether it was sweet or bitter I went for it. 

Come to my surprise it had this smiley flavor to it which I didn't know coffee could have such a taste. And I fell in love with that cup of coffee. It was a bittersweet moment when I took the last sips. 

Location wise of this place couldn't be better. The highline and Chelsea market are literally feet away and union square isn't that far either."
716,blue-bottle-coffee-new-york-3,2015-06-22,3.0,"I had a friend who wanted to go into adult movies, so in order to practice, she Blue Bottles. It actually worked pretty well. I was always worried she'd cut her lips, but whatever. I prefer the parts where the girl gets the attention anyway.

I was at Blue Bottle in 2014 with my food tour friend, who adores coffee. It's one of the few things we have the same taste in, and neither one of us was impressed by the bitter, extremely Starbucksy coffee.

So this coffee is basically like a stronger version of Starbucks. I'm sure it's very good if that's what you like (intense caffeine shots), but that's the opposite of what I like. I prefer milky, creamy, silky, very gentle teas and coffees, such as Tim Hortons 4 & 4, or maybe a Dunkin Donuts 4 & 4. So Starbucks to me is the ultimate nightmare. And anyone that is similar to Starbucks in any way is not going to get it done for me. I will say that the servers were extremely nice and made my gf feel extremely welcome.

Cool little location next to Chelsea Market, too. Be careful not to get a ticket if you park outside. Manhattan cops suck, especially around this market.

While I appreciate that this is, to many people, the best coffee in town... I found it to be something I'd never drink again. It scores 3 just because it's local, not corporate."

Perhaps it was because I came in on a weekday afternoon around 6PM. Snacks are 50% off after 5PM, so I decided to try a lemon loaf cake. 

Unfortunately, I was able to see why the lemon loaf cake was half-priced. It was so hard and bland! It just felt like I was eating some soft cardboard with poppy seeds in it. I ended up having to toss the majority of it. At least I only had to spend two dollars in order to get a good seat with an outlet here. 

Overall not sure I would come here again, but I'll keep this place in mind in case I am in the area and really need a spot with an outlet."

The cashier said they can't put them in a mug but a paper cup...ok... Don't know why they couldn't put it in a mug. There were a bunch of them on top of the espresso machine. Oat latte was WEAK. I've had way better. Either their espresso wasn't strong enough or the barista was heavy handed with the milk. On top of that, I couldn't even get some latte art. Don't charge me $6.10 for a medium oat latte and not make my latte look pretty. That's the least they could do for making a weak latte. They also charge $.95 for oat milk. A lot of other places I've been to usually charge $.50 or $.75. If you're gonna charge that much for lattes, your lattes better be the BEST in the city. 

Overpriced subpar oat latte. Not worth it. Go to La Colombe, Idea Coffee, Birch, or Stumptown if you want some BOMB oat lattes. 

Gave two stars because they have free WiFi."

Coldcoctions (trademark pending).

Said creations? The honey badger (almond milk + honey) and the Hall & Oats (oat milk + cinnamon + vanilla) sang their siren tune to me, but I held off - saving the Kcals for a pair of Cuban minis.

Pretzel smaller-than-slider rolls stuffed with Swiss, pork, ham, mustard and pickles served warm. A pair of ping pong balls for $5 - tasty, but three orders would have sated the late breakfast belly, and at that volume, not worth the $15.

717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-07-20,5.0,"I'm very picky with coffee and there were several coffee shops in NYC but I tried out Gregory's coffee and I liked it. It was pretty good! I got the extra caramel iced latte with whole milk. The coffee was pretty expensive though or maybe that's because it's in NYC. I would love to try more places like Gregory's coffee in NYC, hopefully next time."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-07-16,3.0,"I feel like I would enjoy Greg a little bit more if he were in a different location. It was a hot and steamy day. I had a long day. It was also the middle of the day - around 2:30-2:40pm-ish and there was no reason why he should have been that busy. Seriously, Greg, wtf. But I come in and stare longingly at what he had to offer while trying not to get knocked over by all of his um customers. A little overwhelmed because in addition to your basic caffeine I notice you can get a plethora of cold beverages and teas with fancy things mixed in. What is this cbd oil? I'm intrigued, Greg. Are you boasting that you can get me to feel super relaxed and caffeinated at the same time?! I've honestly never tried a cbd infused beverage before and I was feeling bold and dangerous. Timidly I scampered up to the counter to place my order and low and behold I find out that Greg has been giving me a false sense of hope for what he has to offer. That scalliwag! They no longer do cbd infused beverages. Long sigh. ""I'll just have a small iced latte with skim milk"". While the latte was okay. . . . the cup was pretty small (smaller than Starbucks even but about the same price). I wasn't feeling the atmosphere as I said before, Greg has too many friends in Herald Square. He also had the audacity to ask for a tip on his electronic pad and got my name wrong. So typical, Greg! I'm not sure where I'm going with this but I might be willing to give it another go maybe like near my job someday but I wasn't impressed. You have been Nexted."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-10-29,1.0,"If I could give 0 stars i would. The worst customer experience ever. No one greeted us, it was morning time and both employees acted as if everyone in the cafe was an inconvenience to their life. The boy I took a picture of was very rude and unwelcoming. I will never ever come back"
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-05-28,5.0,"Updated: Paul contacted me promptly and was very apologetic. They are busy putting protocols in place to avoid this type of mistake. Will definitely go back again. 

Ordered a VEGAN scramble and got something with bacon, which is extremely disrespectful to a customer who doesn't consume any animal products. The shop wasn't even busy to explain a mix up."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-06-12,5.0,"This is the best location of Gregory's that I visited. Everything was fresh and the (long) line moves very quickly. I love the variety of items they offer, including coconut water and turmeric drinks. The cold brew options are diverse and all delicious, and at the end of the day the espresso itself is what matters the most. It's great!"
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-07-02,1.0,"I've complained about the cups and lids causing spills, nobody has still done anything about it. This happens every 2-3 days (I go there every day) and the cups/lids are poorly made so they spill out of the sides. I do not recommend this for anyone wearing corporate attire. I spoke directly to a manager and still nothing was done about it. Unfortunately, I don't expect Gregory's Coffee chain to improve their packaging quality so I am no longer a fan. Regardless of how great their coffee is, the amount of time I spend trying to remove coffee stains is ridiculous. This happens with almost every cup! This has been happening for months. 

Stop using the cheaper/poor quality coffee cups that don't fully close, causing spills- and be more like starbucks/dunkin!"

717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2018-07-05,4.0,"Decent coffee. Very cute aesthetic! I love the wood details inside the shop. Came here to use the restroom, and to try coffee. Saw the place was packed and came on in. 
Got a cold brew - honey badger (?) I can't remember the name but it was cold brew and some sweetener. One of their popular options according to the barista. Service was quick and friendly. Cold brew was how I envisioned it to taste, but nothing special. Prices were pretty high but nothing too crazy for New York."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-06-26,4.0,"Coffee is good, I love that they have oat milk as an option! Customer service was great especially having patience with a large order. Downfall, you can't customize their specialty lattes. I would come back to try more coffees."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-06-20,5.0,Awesome coffee spot! We stopped in at another location as well the next morning. First time I had their nitro which I had been wanting all weekend. Second time through I tried their Nutella nitro drink that was sweet but not too sweet. Delicious.
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2018-11-08,2.0,"I don't know about this, I decided to ditch Starbucks and come to this place just to get out of my comfort zone. The place was packed. The workers weren't very polite and also recommended me one the worst tasting coffee, but I mean it is what it is. 
They do have a nice clean bathroom just without a mirror"
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-05-07,5.0,One of the best Americano's I've tried in NYC . Very welcoming people who work there. great atmosphere as well. very refreshing all around. until next time!
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2018-03-25,5.0,"I always make it a goal to try a new coffee shop (or chain) when I visit NYC.   This place just happened to be where I was.  I was pleasantly surprised by the decor of a place whose primary product is coffee and coffee products.  I was pleased  by the very wood decor and the abundance of Edison bulbs and the use of mini spotlights.  They also had some art on the walls as well.  The coffee itself was great and well-priced.  What was most valuable to me was the availability of seating, a clean individual bathroom, and free Wi-FI.   It was nice to have an alternative to Starbucks that did not have a need to use blenders to make certain drinks.  The lack of that buzzing noise and the smaller location made the place feel both roomy and intimate and very inviting.  

This place really hit the spot in a busy city.  Sometimes you just need a place to wind down and relax.  This is that type of spot."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-12-26,5.0,I haven't been to this coffee  shop for at least 4 years since I moved out of the city but me and my wife wore talking about coffee and the best coffee shop's we been to and Gregorys coffee was the first on my mind it's not just the coffee it's the memory's  me and my friends have in it I can't wait to go visit my friends in NYC and go get my favorite coffee and brownies at Gregorys coffee
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2018-01-23,4.0,"Wandered in for a drink post call shift. The store itself is pretty chill set in a gray, off white and black decor. The plethora of baked goods reminds me more of a counter at Panera than Starbucks but I'll have to write another review for I didn't grab an accompanying pastry this time. 

I got a hot cocoa with soy milk and wasn't disappointed. Much more flavorful than my normal Starbucks hot cocoa, less overly sweet than dunkin. The only problem? It was almost twice the cost."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2018-07-14,5.0,"Gregory's Coffee is a great alternative to Starbucks - they offer more ""health conscious"" treats and serve up a great cup of joe. I love their drip, but I've also had their lemonades, and smoothies all have been delicious!

The decor in each of their locations are extremely modern and not cookie cutter. With green displays and industrial light bulbs hung - it's a cool place to hang out and enjoy yourself."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-01-14,4.0,Good options but overpriced. Well I mean coffee in general is overpriced (Warren Buffet). But the coffee is actually pretty good and tasty.
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-11-07,5.0,"Decent matcha latte, plenty of seats tables so it'd be a good place to meet up with someone for coffee. Good customer service and they made my drink quickly despite it being very crowded. Overall a good experience!"
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-04-03,2.0,"Pretty terrible service from the staff behind the counter. Walked in on a Saturday around 8:45am and we were one of only two other people in the  shop.  In addition, there was no one in line before or after us.  

I know it's NY, but the staff was unpleasant, unwelcoming, and took forever to fill our order of coffees, oatmeal, a smoothie, and ricotta toast.  About 10 mins after we ordered, other customers came in.  The staff filled several other orders before ours.  What kind of coffee shop doesn't fill orders in the order in which they came in? 

Food was fine but the customer service really needs help."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2017-07-17,5.0,"Love this Gregory's location. Located near busy K-town, Gregory's has two floors with lots of seating and tables. However, it does get busy and full at times but somehow the lines are really fast.

Like all of the Gregory's in the city, the best way to pay is through their app so get it in the app store to save and get free drinks. They usually don't sell their matcha balls here if you're searching for them but they are always stocked with various delicious baked goods. Drinks are always on point and customer service is great. No complaints. 

I do have to comment that this place has a familiar basement smell if you don't mind. This Gregory's is my favorite location as it's near Herald Square and the subway stations. 

Accepts card. Get the app.
Bathrooms available upstairs.
Lots of seating."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-12-01,5.0,"Carrot raisin pound cake: YUM. This was the perfect place to come and read on a Sunday morning. The prices are super reasonable. I got the carrot raisin pound cake and the nu brew at the recommendation of the baristas and am totally thrilled with both. The people who work here are SUPER friendly and were helpful and enthusiastic in offering me recommendations. The space is clean and there is a lot of seating which is nice. Beautiful space, wonderful people, awesome product."

Not gonna lie shit was bomb. Had that spicy avocado toast, and while it was pricey, I've never had bread comparable. I also had a chai latte with almond milk and got to charge my phone while I enjoyed breakfast. Clean restrooms. Go here :)"
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2018-07-23,2.0,"Just had a iced matcha latte.....tastes like water and milk.  Only hint of matcha was the color but even that, the color was light faint minty green.
Had to trash it, was not pleasant.
Also, the last time I came I had the hall and oats because I've been obsessed with oat milk lately and I really don't think they put oat milk in it, it didn't have a creamy taste and didn't even look creamy....looked like water mixed with coffee."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2019-10-02,3.0,"This Gregory's location is a mixed bag. They have a stupid ordering process where one person takes your order, who then shouts the order to another to make the order, while another rings you up, and who then may/may not be the one who gives you your coffee. 

Sorry but this is not an efficient system. I like their coffee but can't tell you how many times I've had to unnecessarily wait 5 mins for them to hand me just a regular drip coffee simply because it was sitting on the back counter and the cashier was too oblivious to realize."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2018-08-21,3.0,"I always feel the blocks between 23th to 34th street along 7th avenue are one of unflattering street blocks in mid/down-town Manhattan, but then I realized there are actually quite a few of coffee shops that grace with good reviews. 

Gregorys coffee is one of them. Normally I either order drip coffee or  americano and take it black to taste the essence of coffee beans when I step into a new coffee house. This time is no exception. 

I had an americano at Gregorys; the coffee is on the sour side, not my cup of Joe and I didn't have any of the pasties as they don't look appearing to. Yes, I judge a book by its cover. When it comes to desserts/pastries, appearance/presentation is a big part. Though, I do love their styles, atmosphere and wood details of the decor."
717,gregorys-coffee-new-york-5,2018-04-19,4.0,Nice corner spot for people watching. Nice vibe and good drinks. Decent seating as well.
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2020-01-27,5.0,"You might think this is a weird location for bubble tea, and to be honest, I'd agree with you. But the pharmacy keeps the place quiet and calm so it's a great spot to catch up with someone over fruit tea!

Moge Tee is a chain that seems to specialize in cheese foam and fruit tea. Most of their fruit teas under the section that includes cheese foam involve blending fresh fruit with ice and tea (usually green or four seasons/black). Other fruit teas are just tea with fresh sliced fruits inside.  You can ask for your drink without cheese foam, and can customize your sugar down to 30%. Students do get a student discount, which is great because their drinks are a little pricey ($6+).

One thing I really liked from the start was the fact that you can see the fridge with cups inside filled with fresh fruit, ready for blending. I've had the tea with lots of citrus/tropical fruits and I've also had their black grape tea. To be honest, you don't need boba at all with how fresh the drinks themselves are! Because they use fresh fruit, if you get low sugar (30%) you can really taste the tea AND the fruit, which is really rare among bubble tea shops in my experience. Another small plus is how the cups are matte/frosted in texture, making it easy to hold while you traipse around Manhattan.

Only downside is that restrooms are customers only. Go to the Ace Hotel down the block to use the bathroom instead!

Excited to check our their other locations and drink more black grape tea."
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2020-04-02,2.0,"We passed by this place a few times and decided to give it a try. I remember coming here a few years ago, but I don't remember it being good; so I decided to give it another try to see if there was any improvements. I was told they don't use artificial syrups and flavors; so I was really excited to order a fruit tea.

The CHEESE FOAM FRESH WATERMELON TEA was a disappointment. It's true that they don't use any artificial flavors and the flavor of the tea was just plain bland. I didn't taste the tea nor the watermelon. The cheese foam wasn't too flavorful either. It was creamy, but it wasn't sweet or salty. This drink was lacking flavor. 

I don't know if I'll be back. Not much has changed after my visit years ago. Maybe I'll come back and try something else or maybe I'll just take another bet on another tapioca shop."
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2020-02-28,4.0,"I really enjoyed my drinks here.  I was very surprised since I am usually very hesitant when it comes to new bubble tea places.  It's like a new one opens up every week. This place has been around for about a year or so and I've been here a handful of times.  It does seem like a weird location for this place.  I do wonder how they survive and make money, but hey, if it works, it works right?

Taro Bubble Milk - wow this was amazing. I was so surprised it had actual taro bits in there.  I was not expecting that.  It's nice to know I wasn't drinking something from powder and artificial. 

Purple Sweet Potato Bubble Milk - this was another winner.  I was not expecting the bits of the actual sweet potato in there either!  I loved how it tasted and not like powder.

The drinks here are a bit expensive, but understandably, the area we are in has high rent.  Give this place a try if you are looking for something new."
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2019-12-21,5.0,"I know there are tons of bubble tea places around, but this one really made me happy.

The staff here is so welcoming and approachable.  I ordered the Super Fruit Green Tea & added bubbles.  I was pleasantly surprised that they not only added a TON of fresh fruit (watermelon slices, even!) but that the lid wasn't a plastic sheet that you have to stab.  The lid has two slots that could accommodate the straw perfectly.  I personally don't have the best ""straw stabbing"" skills, so this little detail was like an ""aww, yay!"" moment for me.

There are also SO many different products available, from lotions to (of course) tea sets.  I look forward to coming back here and checking it all out!"
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2020-03-06,3.0,"Ordered my drink through the app Ritual and my Cheese Foam Milk Tea was done by the time I got there. The drink itself was alright, nothing too memorable. They use golden boba for their bubbles and it was chewy. Honestly, it felt like an odd location for a bubble tea shop... it was located inside a Chinese medicine shop? Quite cramped trying to walk in and out without knocking anything over and the seating wasn't ideal for you to sit and chat either. Overall, alright for the price but drinks would have to be better for me to come back."
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2019-09-15,5.0,"Heard about this grand opening location. Got the purple yam dirty milk tea. It comes with bubbles. It was delicious. Real chunks of yam in it. They have a buy one get one 50% off rest of September.

Möge is at the back of this herbal type store. It has a counter in the back of the store where you can order your drink. Outside it is a bit blocked by construction from the building next to it 277."
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2020-01-15,4.0,"I've been aiming to visit Moge since they've been opening more locations around NYC and finally made it here the other weekend. I decided to try the Fresh Watermelon Tea because I love watermelon, and I'm very glad I did! The drink was very refreshing and it will be especially great once it gets a little warmer out. I would definitely get the watermelon tea again and would like to try some of their other drinks in the future!"
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2020-01-10,5.0,"Searched out an avocado bubble tea spot that uses real avocado fruit while in the Koreantown area and found this great place which opened a few months ago. Besides it not being a packed scene here on a Friday evening like it is on the main strip of Ktown, the calmer vibe and home-like setting (in the back of shop) were a nice backdrop to enjoy my fresh avocado tea without cheese foam option.  The background music was a bit on the loud side (may be because there were no loud voices to drown out ); otherwise, I really enjoyed this bubble tea spot!!!

The staff were so helpful and courteous, even checking in with me a little after to see what I thought about my tea.

There's one long communal table to sit at & enjoy your tea if you decide to stay. It includes a calligraphy/doodling canvas (where the artwork disappears once the water dries out; see photo) for customers' enjoyment. 

Highly recommend this place.  And will definitely be returning again!!!"
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2019-11-24,4.0,"Super pleased that a Moge Tee opened so close to me, but also very, very dangerous as I constantly crave the bubble tea from here. The taro milk tea here (and at all Moge locations) is the stuff of dreams -- real, smooth chunks of taro in milk tea and delicious chewy boba. I also love the brown sugar variation. 

The fruit teas here are made with real fruit -- I personally ask for less sugar since I like to taste the tea, and it is perfect.

The only gripe I have is that everything is expensive; understandably, they have to charge the prices for the location + the quality of the ingredients but it definitely prevents me from going more frequently. Luckily, they do random promotions with some frequency, so I'm not always dropping $6+ every visit."
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2020-01-11,4.0,"This place has a great selection of drinks and it's a really small and clean spot that's connected to a Chinese medicinal herb store. 

I ordered the purple yam bubble milk tea and wasn't sure what to expect, but the chunks of purple yam in the drink definitely caught me off guard and I wasn't really a fan. 
I also said I wanted ice in my drink but I received a lukewarm drink. 

Next time I'll be sure to get something I'm familiar with just to be safe. Overall they're a cool place."
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2019-10-19,3.0,The bubble tea was very expensive for what it was and I didn't really enjoy it. I got the grapefruit one with white pearls. The one thing going for this place is that it is not super crowded and because the drinks are made with real fruit it feels healthier for you. The one time use containers for the drinks also seem a little wasteful because they are made of a thick plastic in an effort to make you feel like you are getting a good deal.
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2019-10-01,4.0,"So I work around this area and I've been eyeing this new spot since seeing the sign for the beautiful dragonfruit drink! 

FINALLY. 

I actually got the grapefruit green tea because well, you know, diet before the holidays (my friend got it though). I'm not a big fan of grapefruit or tea but I really enjoyed this drink. It is slightly sweet but so refreshing. I will say it does have a little bitter aftertaste but it's nothing too bad. I think the best part about this place is that they have fresh fruit in these (re-usable) cups. It is sort of like a slush. 

Price: Mine came to a total of approx $6.50 which isn't too bad. They do have add ons though such as cheese foam, jelly, etc. 

Service: Staff was kind and patient. 

All in all...if you want to try a tea with a texture like slush and a variety of different fruits/teas, I recommend."
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2020-01-29,4.0,"Four stars because pretty settling presentation without trying to be trendy. Not too sweet and tasty with substance, not cheaply prepared like some places.
Friendly, the person greeted me when I went up to the register. I have visited their other location a couple of time down near NYU/Cooper and the staff is just as friendly. This location is in the back of a pharmacy/herb store, very common in K-Town area to have this type of set-up. There are seats at a communal table and two seats by the window upfront. Fact is if you are looking to chill, this is not your spot, consider their downtown location, which is a true tea shop set-up. This is more for reading a chapter or two, resting your feet."

Nothing on the menu mentioned anything differently. Well, this was not the purple powder. The mixture was light brown (think coffee) colored and there were soft pieces of taro which were not smoothie and silky, they were gritty and clumpy and extremely unappetizing. Hazard/warning to any others expecting purple taro root powder to be used. 

They graciously changed out my order for another menu item at no charge."
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2020-01-11,5.0,"Super cute boba cafe!! Really clean inside and the interior design makes for nice photos too. There's plenty of room to sit inside with tables, booths, and window seats, and they have really pretty peony murals and neon signs. The tea itself is on the pricier end but it is better quality than you would get at a chain boba shop. Pictured is the matcha that my friend got! Also recommend the DaHongPao milk tea if you like less sweet black tea."
718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2019-09-17,4.0,"Excellent yummy taro and purple yam milk tea!! I love the actual soft pieces of taro instead of the powder garbage other brands use. Their cheese foam is also one of the best I've ever had.
I knocked off one star because their tea is very weak. Especially if they also blend it with fruits, it makes the green tea taste even more bland (if you taste it at all).  I am not a fan of a smoothie tea . I thought I was getting fruits in my tea.  If I wanted a smoothie, I can blend it at home.  I also tried the brown sugar milk tea during the grand opening and it was the worse brown sugar milk tea I've tried. I'm not sure they use brown sugar. It just taste like a milk tea with a lot of grains...
Otherwise the 4 stars go to the purple yam, taro, cheese foam, and clear bubbles!"

718,möge-tee-fifth-ave-new-york-2,2019-11-17,5.0,"My favorite boba chain! So glad they opened a branch in Ktown. I love this place because their fruit tea uses actual fruit and not the cheap powder that most boba places use. Yes the prices are $1 higher than traditional boba shops, but it's real fruit so I feel good about paying for better quality, healthier ingredients. My favorites are the melon fruit tea w/ white boba. For more decadent treat-yourself options, I like mango milk swirl or brown sugar milk swirl."

719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2018-09-16,3.0,"I like this Pret. It's got less of a cozy vibe than the others, maybe because of its location, but it's not the type of Pret I'd want to meet someone in or lounge around reading a book in. They also always seem to be understaffed, given how busy they are and that they're right across from the mall. However, every once in a while, they have samples of drinks and baked goods, which I'm such a sucker for, and they make a mean almond milk latte. 

I wouldn't say their staff is on the friendliness level of surrounding Prets, but they're efficient and always bringing out fresh soups and salads, which is what the people want! 

I'm not sure if they have a bathroom. I've never seen one!"

The coffee was so hot we had to wait 20 mins before it wouldn't burn the mouth. My mocha was so bad it went straight in the trash after one sip. It took three people to try and get me a receipt but after 5 mins I gave up on trying to get one. I'm used to Pret in Europe so not sure if this is the American standard or an off location.
719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2018-08-22,2.0,"Don't get me wrong, I really love the food and coffee at Pret. It's great for quality fresh food that you can just grab and go. 

Unfortunately, this location is always understaffed. When it is busy in the morning with commuters coming from or to Penn station - there is always only one register open. At other Pret locations when they see it is crowded, they will open other registers. It is too stressful for me to have to wait so long pay or for my iced coffee."

My husband and I stop here to get ice coffees in the morning on our way to work and Leilei (I know I'm spelling that wrong!) started remembering our order. She and the rest of the staff always have big friendly smiles and truly make us feel special so early in the morning. It really makes a difference. Yes, the food and coffee is reliable and delicious at all prets, but it's the human connection that makes the difference for us!"

719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2018-10-14,5.0,Great customer service! This was my first time here and Michael one of the managers helped me make a selection by picking some of the top sellers.

This particular Pret is quick in and out for me, I guess I come in just before the big rush usually around 11-1130 range. I have had a few of the sandwiches and they have all been fine. Not totally outstanding but a decent quick,fresh sandwich. A thai wrap I had was way oversauced and was leaking in the bag one time but thats about the only issue. The egg salad is very good and the baguettes in the sandwiches are always crispy. 
   The staff here are all very friendly as well. Never had a counter person not greet me with a smile and a friendly word."

719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2016-06-17,4.0,"Pret A Manger has really expanded in the last few years. If you are familiar with this chain you know what to expect. Fresh cold sandwiches and salads with juices or organic coffee. They also have a small hot food section with soups and sandwiches and wraps. Items are typically in the $5 to $9 range. 

I am putting this review more as a critique of this location. This one is located next door to the Jack's 99 Cents near Penn Station. There is a moderate amount of seating and it is very clean. However, it can get very crowded at lunchtime because of it's location."

Yikes!!!"

The store doesn't have the fancy environment of a restaurant, but i enjoy the playful vegetable pictures on the walls. I am so glad there is a chain of them. I'd like to have one in  my neighborhood, Kings Hwy, Brooklyn."
719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2014-12-19,4.0,"Pret A Manger is a chain of posh little delis that caters to New York's health conscious.  I say health conscious moreso for the quality  ingredients used in their food versus it's diet friendliness. 

What does that mean? Well basically, a sandwich with gluten free bread filled with organic/ non gmo/ humanely butchered/  fillings can still be a fatty treat.  Nonetheless, I imagine better ingredients will still draw in crowds unwilling to join the likes of the fast food fiends. 

Anyway, the selection is impressively abundant. They had wraps, yogurt cups, sandwiches, salads plus a large assortment of cold and hot drinks. I took my time in selecting my second breakfast for the day - a bacon egg and cheese on brioche - cute mini sandwich which cost me nearly 5 bucks. I didn't get coffee this time cause I had literally just eaten from a food truck 10 minutes prior. 

I sat myself in a corner which was caved in brick walls, took photos of my sandwich and a few selfies. Shut up, you all do it too so don't judge. The sandwich was nicely wrapped and that bread oh so soft. Granted the bacon wasn't thick or hearty, but all the components made for a decent sammy.  I gobbled that thing up in 2 minutes, maybe less. 

I was pretty impressed by my 10 minutes spent at Pret A Manger and am not surprised this is such a popular spot to grab a bite on the go."
719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2018-12-08,1.0,"Their cups STINK. I got a peppermint tea and just by walking, NOT overflowing to the top of the cup, tea was spilling on my hands and I got a serious burn after leaving their shop. Will never be stopping here for a cup of tea again until they improve their cups."
719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2015-05-14,5.0,"So great - a fast food place that I can trust. I love their sandwiches and wraps but super underrated are their pots - i.e. the banana honey yogurt pot. I felt like pooh bear. 

Any of their sandwiches are great, but I like the chicken bacon the best. The bread is sooo tasty and baked fresh! The sweet potato wrap is also impressively good. 

I'd probably skip their coffee and pastries, esp in Manhattan - there are just a lot of better options. But if you're in a jam near penn station, their croissants hit the spot."

With that said, this is the second time I have gone there where I didn't get what I thought I was choosing.  The fist was an egg dish that was supposed to have sausage in it.  No sausage was had.  Today I go for the Chicken Morrocan Hot Pot. I open it, stir it up  looking for the chicken. No chicken was had.  Go to the website and after an exhaustive Google search, because it's either not on the website or it's hard to find, find that I picked up the Sweet Potato Curry Hot Pot (it was labeled Moroccan chicken).  Thank God I don't have food allergies.  I will say that it did taste good in spite if the 1 piece of sweet potato it had, but I was peeved I didn't get what I wanted and the location was too far for me to walk back.
By the way, if you want real Matcha tea, this is not the place."

What's worse is that I found it at the bottom of my salad, after I'd munched through a lot of it. :( Ick! Who knows what I put in my mouth and didn't notice. Their food is too expensive to justify having unwashed greens in their salads (and probably sandwiches). Yuck. 

UPDATE: Although a person from Pret made a point to post a public reply to my review (and my comment on IG) asking me to send them my email so they could make it right, 3 months later I'm still waiting for an email or an apology..."

My favorite is the chicken & avacado sandwich. Ugh, so good. Definitely a good place to grab some healthy food when you're in a hurry. 

There is a great number of seating and outlets. However, the music is a little too loud for my liking. I was wearing headphones and I could still hear the music very loudly, not the best place to study. 

I have heard that their coffee is spot on, so I will be returning to try that for sure!

They didn't have the toppings for the oatmeal out, & when asked they responded, ""I don't know, it's not out yet.""  The southwestern burrito I had was stale/stiff like it's been sitting under a heat lamp at a highway rest stop.   Coffee bitter. Busy is no excuse. The union square pret is just as busy but food always fresh and coffee at least decent."

I rather give away my money there any day. In addition, every location I visited, employee is willing help you decide what to purchase. They will not try to push you away, because they care about their customers. My favorite location are this location and 47 & 3rd ave. 

Thanks for my quick lunch!

Cheers,

719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2017-03-12,4.0,"Everybody knows about their sandwiches and salad. Their sandwiches and salad are in the okay-good range. It's nothing to rave about as it's straightforward as it can be with their ingredients and sauces. However the best thing that they got on their menu is their mac and cheese. Their mac & cheese game is strong here. I tried their spinach one - I tried to be healthy but who was I kidding when I am getting mac and cheese. It was the right of amount of creamy. To my doctor, I did eat the spinach. Overall, it was nicely seasoned. Not too heavy or light, but just right of creaminess. If you are around a Pre A manger which there are many and you are craving some mac and cheese, this might be the job."
719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2015-01-04,3.0,"This is our local Prete and we definitely pick up lots of sandwiches here throughout the week. 
It's consistently good food, but the staff is one of the most forlorn, morose and unfriendly I have ever seen. Every time I'm there I want to ask them if their puppy died."
719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2015-12-06,5.0,"I don't usually eat here, but took a chance because I was hungry ahead of an evening meeting next door. I further took a chance on the veggie Mac-N-Cheese. Delicious! Great stuff. 

I'm rating this place five stars because of the staff's attentiveness. I'm not from the city and sometimes feel a bit overwhelmed and out of my element. Upon finishing my food I looked around for a restroom. Not finding one, I began to walk out. Then a staff member called out to me. She'd obviously been paying attention to her customers, knew what I needed, gave me the key code, and pointed me in the right direction. Finding a bathroom seems a small thing, but at my age it makes a big difference and that little act of attentiveness and thoughtfulness set the tone for the rest of my evening."
719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2015-09-16,4.0,"I've always been quite disappointed by Pret in the US. There are some classics from the UK like Rocket and Cray that simply are not available in this market. I'm not sure why. That said over time they have improved. I grab lunch here regularly as I work just across the street. There are tons of great vegetarian options now: wraps, sandwiches, baguettes that I never have to order the same thing more than once in a week. Kinda pricey, but worth it.

UPDATE. I went in yesterday and now they have a rocket and cray fish baguette with sweet chili sauce!! Brand new. It was incredible, I will be getting this every day :-)"
719,pret-a-manger-new-york-62,2017-07-24,3.0,"I started coming here almost daily during the week for their overnight oats and a banana for breakfast. Bananas are always ripe and I haven't had an issue with any of their foods until recently. Last week Friday, the coconut yogurt in the overnight oats was stale. Needless to say, I was bummed because I'd be hungry until lunch but also, isn't this stuff supposed to be made fresh daily? Now it's extremely possible that everything else was fresh and they do make these fresh daily, but why the crappy stale radar on the coyo? I couldn't bring it back because I took it straight to work, so I called and explained to someone the issue. She said I could come back for a refund or exchange and I told her I would the same day after work. Asked her to take down my name so whomever I speak to in the store can confirm that I spoke to someone. When I went in later on, there was no manager on the floor. I believe he was about to be but for some reason, wasn't, currently. And no one knew what I was talking about so the gentleman that I spoke to suggested that I come back on Monday with proof of purchase. Fair. Come Monday (today), I go in, tell a manager about it and no one notified her about it. But she let me get something else in place of that and apologized afterwards. Problem solved right? Wrong. the yogurt was stale AGAIN. I don't understand how 3 days can go by and the same rotten yogurt is being used. I have no idea if they're receiving other complaints but I've been going here getting the same thing for almost a month consecutively and I know what fresh yogurt tastes like and that's not it. The employees here are very attentive and polite. I always get a hello and I'm always wished well on my way out. Good customer service is always very appreciated and recognized. But stale yogurt, twice, days apart worries me for obvious reasons. I'm sure it's not a common thing here but come on. Bad dairy can end very badly."

Everything was very fresh and beautifully presented. We had the Tuna avocado poached egg salad, the Mediterranean chicken sandwich, and the fattoush salad. I will definitely be ordering from here again! Thank you so much for your generous donation from the bottom of our hearts!"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2020-02-25,4.0,"Came here around 9:30am on a Saturday with a friend and it was decently quiet. It got a lot busier by the time we left, with each table being taken.

I ordered a shakshuka and a chai latte while my friend ordered from the fixed price menu, which came with a coffee and tiny cup of orange juice. We were both super full from our meals, so I would say that it was worth it.

As for the ordering process, you order at the counter, take a number and find a seat. When the food is ready they'll bring it out to you.

If I'm ever in the area again I'd be willing to try it again!"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2020-02-13,4.0,"I've had my eye on Gotan for mealpal for a while. 
Finally got the squash ricotta sandwich from here.
I don't get why mealpal lists this as $14 when it's actually $12 

It's approx 2"" wide and maybe 6"" long baguette (I didn't measure on the spot, just recalling from memory). It's a bit smaller than I'd like. I'm used to using two hands for a sandwich but I'm fine with one for this. 
The outside is a bit too rough for my liking but still aight. Inside was fresh. 

Inside was squash, riccotta, chimichurri, watercress, thyme, cilantro, honey. The squash was roasted nicely in a way that wasn't stiff nor mushy. 
The ricotta wasn't too apparent within the sandwich but it added a nice subtle creaminess which also balanced the other textured and flavors here. 
Watercress gave the sandwich a good crunch. 
The mix of herbs added a kick and savoriness which brought a lot of flavor to this sandwich. It helps cut through the seemingly heavy squash. 
I didn't know there was honey when I first ate it so I was wondering if honey was drizzled on or added to the squash. Either way I appreciate the subtle sweetness. It's a thin honey so nothing sticky or overpowering. 

The way other Yelpers give suchhh high comments on this. I get what they mean but I wouldn't say it's thaaat amazing. Nice but not amazing. 

The interior is a bit rustic looking with plain wooden furniture. I was expecting it to look something like Fournos Theophilos. 

Packaging 
I appreciate how the sandwich was wrapped in parchment, aluminum foil, paper, then bagged in a paper bag. It's the effort of all these neat layers. I liked how the paper wrapping and sticker and paper bag said Gotan. 

I would like to get this again for mealpal but hesistant about getting it myself. It's well made but the type/amount of ingredients don't feel satisfying enough for the price"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2020-02-13,4.0,"Amazing food.
Loved that Gotan breakfast. Their homemade hot sauce is great.

We tried the Shakshuka. A very filling breakfast so make sure you have a big appetite."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2020-01-28,4.0,"Came here for brunch a couple of days ago. Interior has a nice rustic feel to it with pots of pothos scattered throughout. This is one of those order at the front, take your number and they bring you the food kind of place. They have a set brunch menu in which you can order any of their breakfast entrees or bowls for $14.50 along with a cup of drip coffee and orange juice. 

I ordered the Shakshuka and the Acai Pudding Bowl. My friends and I were a bit peeved as they ran out of glass cups for the OJ and gave us these DINKY paper cup substitutes instead which were much smaller. We didn't realize until later otherwise we would've said something. 

The shakshuka was DELICIOUS...probably the best I've ever had. Loved how they added chimichurri and a generous sprinkle of pine nuts for more flavor and texture. The pita bread was wonderfully thick and soft as well. MMMMM :) Would get again. 

Acai pudding bowl tasted fresh and healthy with a lot of toppings, but I would advise getting the brunch set to go as the to-go bowl size is not that big and you can get the bowl itself for $9 (oj & coffee not worth the extra 5.50)."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-12-15,4.0,"We stopped in to Gotan-Midtown for brunch/lunch on our way to a Rockefeller center tour. It's about a 7-10 minute walk from that area. You order at the counter, and your food is brought out when it's ready. If you'd like, you can find a table, decide what you want, and return to the counter to order. You will receive a number for your order, but will need to pick up your drinks at the counter.

Overall I really loved the food, but it was a bit pricey, especially if you are in a hurry and don't have the chance to take your time and really enjoy everything. We paid around $60 for 3 people for everything.

To drink, I had the Cortado which I enjoyed. It was very smooth and not bitter at all. My husband, not a coffee fan, had the chai latte which was just ok. It was very sweet.

To eat, I had the avocado feta toast which was very good, but there was a lot of bread. I would recommend this dish, but don't feel pressure to eat all the bread!

I'd recommend Gotan but leave enough time to fully enjoy all your food if you can!"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-11-10,4.0,"Good brunch food and interior. We came for early brunch on a Sunday and there was some seating left. 

I got the brunch special -- root vegetable pancake with fried egg ($16). It was a pleasant surprise, kind of like a potato pancake but mixed with vegetables and topped with a small salad and a fried egg. The egg yolk was runny and very good when mixed with the pancake and sriracha. The salad dressing was a little sour and added a kick to the dish as well. 

The place is cashless (except for tips), so be prepare for come with a card. Most staff members were nice, but the cashier seemed to be in a rush and not in a good mood."

It served as a spot to spend some time. The front of the restaurant had some tall chairs and some ""laptop ledges"" near the window for people working. There were a few outlets. The individual bathroom was clean and spacious enough for me to hang my big work/travel bag and change clothes for my interview and touch up my makeup. 

While the food and beverage were VERY expensive (hence the loss of a star), I did love both. I realize it's NYC but it still seemed a bit unreasonable. Nevertheless, portion size was good and the food had great flavor. It was exactly what I was looking for. Would return!"

The entire menu sounds good, but I ordered a chicken sandwich on one occasion and the hummus roasted veggie salad on another. There aren't many meat options but the chicken sandwich was good and decently sized, though the star is definitely the hummus salad. It is surprisingly very filling and tastes delicious. The roasted vegetables pair really well with the hummus and the pita pieces help bring everything together. And the best part is I didn't feel guilty eating this big lunch at all!"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-09-19,3.0,"I have ordered from Gotan twice with delivery - first time was the Eggplant & Egg Salad, second time was the Tuna Avocado & Egg Salad.   The Eggplant & Egg Salad I would never order again - when it says 'salad' I expect there to be leafy greens - not spreads dripping in a pool of oil.  I really only ate 1/4 of it before I felt gross!  The Tuna Avocado & Egg Salad was a bit better - but again when I order a salad, the greens should outweigh the toppings.  Portions are small for the price, but the quality is good.  If there was less tuna and more greens I would have liked the 'salad' better.  The pesto crostini was good though, I wish they put in two!"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-10-11,3.0,"Place is probably over-hyped a bit.  Food is above average, but that is offset by a slight arrogant/rude staff (the cashier who sported an attitude), the people that clean up dishes that sorta walk through people in their zeal to clean tables, and the small size of the joint.  Maybe that is routine at New York, perhaps. But all the distracts from the sammies and the salads, which are tasty, albeit with price tag that is higher than it should be.

I would return during off peak hours, I had lunch on a Friday at 1:30 and it was still crowded and the staff were crank likely because of the lunch hour rush.  But guess what - you are in the service business and if you provide cranky service and a negative/ambilavent vibe, then guess what? You will slowly lose business.

I make a lot of money, so I'm not that price sensitive, but I do get sensitive when you combine higher prices with poor attitude.  I can be seduced by positive energy and high prices, because I want to hang with those types."

I come here a lot for a quick sit down lunch (they seriously bring out food in minutes), but also on the weekends if I'm in the area for brunch. 
I have truly loved everything I've ever gotten here. I've tried about half of their sandwiches and salads and have loved every one of them. I've recently been loving the hummus and roasted veggies ""salad"" (more of just a veggie platter) for a lighter lunch. The breakfast items and health bowls are also so delicious, quickly made, and well plated. The coffee is also very solid independently of the food. 

I will continue to be a regular customer and recommend to anyone in the area."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-07-11,4.0,"Nice lunch spot in midtown that I have been coming to for a few years now. I usually go for their salads, specifically the tuna avocado salad. I have noticed the portion sizes seem to have gotten smaller over the last year or so. You can tell they make their food with fresh ingredients. They have a decent size menu with a variety of items, as well as daily specials. 

Today I tried their lunch special, which was a kale Caesar salad with roasted chicken & avocado for $16. The salad was okay, I would not get it again if it was a regular menu item. It was pretty small and disappointing considering it was $16. For the price I would have MUCH rather gotten something else or my usual tuna salad ($14 I believe). The tuna salad is consistently good. 

Overall, it is a good lunch spot if you're looking for something healthy or fresh. However, I will say that it is over priced for the portion size."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-08-18,4.0,"Not at all kind to my wallet but I still keep coming back. Their cold brew is excellent, as well as their black iced tea when available. The yogurt bowl and oatmeal are my favorites for the health bowls, as is the tuna avocado for the salads. 

It gets busy around lunchtime here but the service is still fairly quick!"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-01-24,3.0,"The food surprisingly did not meet my expectations. Contrary to the entire vibe and interior space, the menu disappointed me. The food wasn't especially memorable, and lacked a strong tang. 

The avocado toast looked gorgeous, but it was sort of bland. So were the oatmeal and acai bowls we ordered. Everything just seemed to be missing a special something. The flavors weren't as strong as I hoped, but it does have a decent space inside with wifi and a bathroom."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-12-27,3.0,"Go to Gotan for what I'd call ""a Soho experience"" in Midtown. Gotan has a few other locations, mostly in fun & trendy areas, so I was a little surprised they opened this location, smack in the middle of corporate buildings and overpriced, underwhelming lunch spots.

They have quite a few tables in the back and some bar seats in the front, but everything is squished together in the tiny space. Good for a 1 on 1 brunch or lunch catch-up, but not for longer hangouts with parties of 3 or more. It gets very crowded during lunchtime so expect a very noisy atmosphere and slow service. If you just want food, you can order to-go at the front counter.

Gotan has typical brunch and lunch fixings - coffee, toasts, breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches, salads, small platters, smoothie bowls, etc. The prices are a bit high even for the area at $10-20 for pretty small portions, but I guess you're paying for a sit-down cafe in Midtown. I got the PB&J for $6, which you can't go wrong with. I appreciated that they tried to bring it up a level with better quality mutigrain, peanut butter, and jam, plus some coconut flakes and chopped peanuts on top. My coworkers also enjoyed their food.

So, overall, very decent food for a little premium, but try to avoid eating in and just get it to-go instead."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2018-12-21,4.0,"Great local coffeeshop and breakfast stop in Midtown. Hipster with modern touches. There are plenty tables in the back. Quiet atmosphere which makes it great for studying and meeting up with people (they don't blast music which is great). It was busy at 8:30am but still plenty of tables open and service was fast. There is free wifi and self-serve water. 

Great coffee selection - none of the  crazy sweet syrups or fancy drinks. They stick to the basics. Their tea comes in a pot on a tray - adorable and you can get multiple cups. Also ordered a flat white, avocado toast and acai bowl. There was a generous amount of avocado and it was seasoned well. The flat white was smooth and still had that bitter taste of the espresso. The acai bowl was very beautifully decorated but it was a bit too sweet for me. The natural acai flavor was not very apparent. Great presentation and good taste. Food was not cheap but you pay for the presentation.

Glad I discovered this place!"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-07-16,3.0,"Small Mediterranean cafe near midtown. Small cramped tables inside but conveniently located to the hotels near Radio City Music Hall. 

I had the Roasted Chicken & Bacon sandwich which is not what I expected.  The chicken and bacon were cut up into very small pieces, almost like a hash. The salad felt tired. Like it was sitting on the counter waiting for an order. I tried the BLAT which was very good. 

I would go there again but would not order the chicken sandwich."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-06-26,4.0,"This review is only for the coffee! I definitely want to head back here and try the delicious looking food options. I came here to meet a client for a quick coffee. 

I decided to get one of my usuals: an almond milk cap, and it was great. Definitely prefer the ones from other nearby coffee shops, but it was still good! The service was fantastic, and the shop was pretty filled!

They have quite a large interior actually, and everyone was chowing down on their meals, making me hungry even though I'd just had lunch!

Can't wait to come back and try this place out."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2018-12-05,5.0,"Went there on a weekday afternoon nearly at 4 pm and they've told they close at 5 and I've placed my order anyway.

The place is a bit loud to focus if you're working but their latte is so rich and strong. I wish that they extend their hours until 7 at least."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-07-07,4.0,"Gotan is a satisfying sandwich shop close to a lot of midtown attractions (and offices). It's a little pricey for the portion size, but Gotan makes for a solid meal overall. 

The first time I came here was during lunch on a weekday. The line was somewhat long, but the staff do a good job of taking order and getting peoples' food out efficiently. I ordered a roast chicken sandwich, which several of my coworkers recommended to me from the pretty short menu. 

The first thing I noticed about the sandwich was that it looked very aesthetic, but it wasn't packed with a whole lot of ingredients. The sandwich was delicious for sure, but I felt like most of the input to my fullness at the end was the bread. For a $12 sandwich, I would expect the condiments to be used a little more liberally. Nevertheless, the bread tasted great, and I was moderately full at the end of my meal. 

Give Gotan a try if you're in midtown; I'm confident you'll enjoy it!"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-05-13,4.0,"I've had some of the breakfast items at the Tribeca location and while I have yet to try them here, the salad I had recently was great. Chai tea latte could have been stronger (it was very milky) but the mint lemonade was tasty. Definitely will be back, as this is one of the only decent spots in the area."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2018-09-04,3.0,"Great place for working with free WiFi located 3 blocks from Bryant Park, but it is a splurge for a coffee shop and breakfast options. 

I got the açaí bowl which was yummy but was much smaller than most açaí bowls I've had in NYC or the Bay Area that cost a similar price. 

On a similar note, the iced latte was one of the best lattes I've had but again, just not worth the price because the portion size was so small and there was quite a bit of ice. 

Service is good. There's a clean one-stall bathroom. I like the plants and relaxing atmosphere. There's lots of good breakfast options but I'm just not sure I can justify the price."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-04-03,5.0,"Not too far from my hotel, we found a great place to have an Açaí bowl. Little did I know this was such a great spot. The menu selection, friendly service, and great vibe is all here!

If you're looking for a coffee, breakfast, or lunch hangout- put this one on your list.

My Açaí bowl was delicious! The avocado toast is my next choice to try. Don't miss the walnut croissant!"

Great coffee! The food is fresh and different. You can find here things that you wont see any where else. 

Gotan is classic nyc place. Crowded, fast, creative. Amd great smell of coffee. 

I love nyc, I love gotan!"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-11-30,3.0,"(3.5/5) This is such a cute little find near the Centre of the city! Not super busy on a Saturday brunch which was really pleasantly surprising. The brunch menu items all look super delicious and it comes with coffee and fresh oj. Their OJ is so. good. You can tell it's freshly squeezed. The food comes super quick so no need to wait that long at all. The shakshuka was good and the pita bread is extremely soft; but it was a lot more oily than my liking. I had better but this one's not bad. The avocado feta toast was also pretty good and they give you a lotttt. Overall, the food is good, not great~ but still worth it for a nice brunch with friends!"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-07-17,5.0,"This place is very good. Had my açaí and peppermint tea. Açaí was good as expected as I read good reviews. But the tea was amazing. Made of loose leaf but not a tea bag. Loved everything. 
The place itself is very nice too. Want to explore different places for breakfast but this one will be a favorite."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-10-11,4.0,I got the açaí bowl and my friend got the Gotan breakfast. There wasn't a lot of smoothie in the açaí bowl and it was very runny. Sort of like having juice. But the Gotan breakfast made up for that. It's a pretty filling breakfast and quite tasty too.

My friend had the avocado toast and she didn't like it as much said the avocado tasted like the avocado spread you could buy at Costco. Service was very nice. May have to wait for a table and they don't take reservations.
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-11-16,4.0,"Really enjoyed everything about breakfast!
We arrived Saturday morning around 9am, just in time to beat the rush.  Staff was attentive but not annoying, and the food was good: avocado toast, egg and cheese biscuit, and special root vegetable pancakes (not pancake consistency, but good flavor!).
Look forward to coming again to try a breakfast bowl.

Update: we came back Sunday morning and were disappointed with the service.  We went to the counter to order and while we were standing there another person walked into line behind us.  The woman at the register gave us menues and told us to go site down until we had made up our minds.  Not a bad suggestion I'd they're busy and we were holding things up, but that was not the case at all.  

Our food was prepared quickly and we really enjoyed it.  There were a few other tables but it wasn't nearly as busy as it had been on Saturday.  The woman from the register must be a manager because she went from the kitchen to the wait staff telling them to pick up the pace and giving instructions.  I would suggest they have these conversations away from the customers, we didn't want to hear it."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-03-27,3.0,"I really did enjoy how cute and big this spot was. They have a lot of seating and it does get pretty crowded. 
I ordered their chai latte with oat milk but wasn't really a fan. I prefer more sweet tasting chai than more spice. Next time I'd order a regular latte because I saw some customers orders and they look tasty."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-02-03,4.0,"Gotan is a very cool spot for breakfast! You walk in and feel right at home. They've done a great job of making a small space feel very roomy and spacious. We stopped in for breakfast and were not disappointed!

I got the acai bowl, which was great! It definitely could've been bigger, but the small portion was forgiven by the sheer variety of fruits that were actually in the dish! There were several different types, not even counting the acai and blueberries that were used to make the base. Being from Florida and spending time around maaaaany different iterations of the iconic ""smoothie bowl,"" this one was a stout contender. 

I also got a coffee--a seasonal maple-cardamom spiced latte. Sadly, it wasn't my favorite experience. I must not like cardamom, because I really wanted to enjoy it, but I don't feel those flavors meshed very well together. At least not in my mouth. 

My friends and I were all super satisfied with our meals though and didn't even get to try the copious selection of pastries they had available, so whenever I get back to NYC, I'll be stopping in again for sure"
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2019-11-01,5.0,"I ordered the Beet Quinoa and Poached egg Salad with chicken. It exceeded my expectation as a lunch take out.  The chicken was very juicy.  Even though the bowl looked small, I felt full by the end the meal.  The poached egg was cooked perfectly and cheese paired well with the cooked beets.  Will re-order from them again."
720,gotan-midtown-new-york-2,2018-09-03,4.0,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in this area. I work close by and when clients ask me where they should eat, this is always my suggestion.

The coffee is always delicious, and the sandwiches hit the spot. ( Try the Halloumi or the Squash and Ricotta )

The interior is nice and spacious and has very pretty elements that make you feel like you can relax. It's rustic and simple.

It's moderately priced. With most food items around the $10-$15 mark.


I will continue to dine here.

I love coming here for the ""Gotan Breakfast"" which comes with eggs, Mediterranean salad, labne cheese, potatoes and pita. If you get the brunch special it's only $15 and includes coffee and orange juice. Sure it's no soho brunch spot but it is a great brunch before going to see an afternoon broadway show."

So far, they are pretty efficient. Been coming here for about 2 months now... happy they make my drinks: ""On-time"" via mobile order; quickly while in-person and makes it just right with the amount of espresso shots (not watery like some other branch!) 

Right now, I'm loving their holiday drinks!!!

721,starbucks-new-york-263,2020-01-18,2.0,"Came here for a drink and a small snack and was greeted by a roach on the wall that I was facing while sitting. Not a good look. 

This spot is very packed. There's a huge line not only to order but also to receive your order. I recommend mobile order always. Beware of line cutters when placing your order. Someone cut the lady behind me and the workers kinda shrugged it off. 

The workers here are hustling, so I  appreciate their hard work. I did watch one worker who was warming up the pastries drop one and have to re-do it. That could add to your wait time. Also, they only have two ovens for warming pastries, so that will likely slow you down if you order hot food. 

My matcha latte tasted great, so that's a plus."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2019-08-07,2.0,"Operationally, this Starbucks location is weak. They take about fifteen minutes to prepare mobile orders, and I witnessed them messing up a bunch of basic drinks for others around me. The staff just seemed super flustered, confused, and delayed. 

The layout is cool, but it's crowded, even during off-peak hours in the afternoon. You may have to wait for seating for a while. There weren't that many outlets though."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2019-04-25,3.0,"Not a big Starbucks person myself. The coffee is alright not the best quality but it's alright, most are pour with water that's the wrong temperature and ruins it. The tea is good so is the chai latte. some pastries or snacks are good and cute mugs or other products sometimes. Way over priced for its quality and everything. The space is clean and some seats. Convenient spot with some bus stops, 1 train, the orange line, and the PATH that's all at walking distance. Good service and pretty fast. I did like the green tea drinks but wish there was less ice so it's not as watered down later."

That's my 2cents!!"

I brought my own cup, yes the refillable Starbucks cup (clean and dry). I watched 10 customers who ordered after me leave with far more complex drinks, simultaneously moving my cup back and forth between them.  I asked the nice cold drink barista and she brought it to their attention the drink was delinquent. Begrudgingly it was put back in queue to be made 5 minutes later. Rudeness and preferential treatment should be a part of barista culture, especially when this customer tips in cash."

They are all just super awesome--they're friendly, they are speedy, and they are attentive. What more could you ask for!

The interior of this location is pretty spacious (it was remodeled a year ago). There's even a nice, long communal table in the back if you want to host a small meeting or just set up your laptop and work for a while.

As for food and drinks, well, it's Starbucks. You know what they got, and it's all solid."

All three people working there (two young guys plus a young woman) were friendly.  This location has a decent amount of seating and the interior is attractive.  Also; it was very clean, including the restroom.  There were two negatives points, however:
#1:  They were blasting music (when I asked if they could lower the volume, they readily complied - but truthfully, it still sounded just as loud).
#2:  There was no soap in the restroom and hardly any toilet paper (I told them - but that's something they should be monitoring)."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2018-06-22,1.0,"Consistently slow with poorly trained unmotivated workers. At least 6-7 employees often, but takes over 15 minutes to order and receive a drink. 

I just left 5 minutes ago without ordering. I was next on line to order and watched as a cashier walked toward the door for a break, and had is manager explain he doesn't have a break. The worst part however was that, while the manager corrected her employee, it was clear that the social or personal dynamic between those working was paramount to customer satisfaction. For the next ten minutes the two went back and forth between each other making excuses and explanations and correcting behavior... all the while no drink orders were taken and the order line grew, and another 7-8 customers waited for drinks to be made.

This is poorly managed and I recommend spending less money at a better coffee shop. Proper management would involve correcting the cashier and then focusing on the customers as quickly as possible, not on explaining or establishing superiority. 

This happens consistently at this Starbucks and there are several others in the area. Suggest heading elsewhere.

I should add that the cashier made eye contact with me repeatedly and couldn't miss my growing impatience... but the point is he wasn't interested in working... just earning... so he was probably glad when I walked out..."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2019-10-09,3.0,They are nice. But then again they also blast their own music when visually impaired customers are working on a project together at a table in the lobby where they clearly need to be able to hear each other. So you take the good with the bad

They are not uptight at all on if you just need to use the bathroom. If you also would like the music down they don't mind turning it down. The staff here especially at mid day on Sundays are really nice and they remember you if you come back frequently. If you need to use this Starbucks as a meeting place or  to meet up with someone they will not ask you to leave but try to have a conversation with you.

Condiment area was clean enough.  Layout is okay....half the seating is good, the other constant traffic behind you.

A-okay location!"
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2018-06-12,2.0,"** I USED TO LOVE THIS PLACE **

What is sad is this was this was one of my favorite places in the city. I used to come here almost every day, and I looked forward to it. I miss the way it was, but it's pretty horrible now. There are a lot of new employees who have no idea what they are doing. One of the last times I was in here I had to repeat my drink to the girl at the counter 7 times. It wasn't that I had anything that complicated, either. She wasn't paying attention and also they keep the music so blasting loud in there you really can't hear what anyone is saying. It's very anti-social and aggressive to have music that loud, in a coffee place of all settings. 

The extra star is for Rudy, Luis, Linda and Ayala (I think that is her name) who have always been extra nice to me. But it's not enough.  There is another new girl there now who wears false eyelashes all the time - always yelling at the employees, barking at the customers. She's so unpleasant, it makes it miserable to just be in there and anywhere near her. Can she not control her temper? And this is a company that wants everyone to feel welcome. Yeah, right. I've seen this girl practically throw drinks at people, myself included. She just seems like such a sour human being and I feel sorry for anyone who has to work with her. And the one who calls himself Medley obviously hates his job and wishes he was anywhere else. And it shows. He should go somewhere else and he shouldn't work with the public either because he is consistently rude and unprofessional. Amazing that folks get paid to behave this way and treat customers badly. 

I know no one cares, but I'm sorry to have lost one of my fave places. The location on Greenwich Ave. is much nicer - friendly, polite staff and they don't snarl and throw drinks at you! Really not a lot to ask, is it..."

Splash sticks are readily available to prevent spillage from the cup when en route to one's final destination.  I love brown sugar as it's healthy and pure.  This Starbucks #7285 is currently hidden under scaffolding."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2018-01-22,1.0,"So today I left work a tad bit early to get to my favorite Starbucks and of course see the mid day workers who usually are very polite. Today I witnessed one of the workers who usually is very smiley and bubbly get told by her co worker who I believe was either the manager or general manager I'm not to sure as I am familiar with the staff there told the young lady that just walked in to leave and go home !! I wasn't sure if I heard correctly as I sipped my latte I couldn't help but notice ""Gen"" or ""Jen"" rude and outrageous attitude. As a person who worked in fast food and hospitality service that is not the way u treat ur team or employee especially after all the hard work they do. I had to write this as I couldn't believe my eyes and ears smh. Safe to say I will avoid going when Jen or gen is there as her attitude and Demeanor is unappealing."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2017-02-05,5.0,Great Starbucks the snacks and desserts are really good. The cake pops were soft and fresh and the seating area is very comfy :)
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2016-08-29,5.0,I come to this Starbucks almost everyday before work. The staff is very friendly and I always receive my drink quickly. The drinks are always made excellently. I prefer this Starbucks over the other two in the area.
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2017-12-14,1.0,This location consistently sucks at mobile order. Don't be surprised if you have to wait more than 15 minutes after the time you placed your order. Starbucks = consistently making people late for work.
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2018-08-29,1.0,"I was waiting 10 minutes for my hot caramel latte, and they made me a cold caramel macchiato!!!‍ I left without my coffee as I was already late to work. They said they will issue the refund, but they didn't."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2017-06-11,5.0,"XENA I believe the Barista from this location was sooo amazing . I cannot thank her enough for lighting up my day , being patient with me , offering exceptional customer service and providing an overall amazing experience with Starbucks. I love Starbucks and often come for their broad selection of teas this particular day I was very indecisive and placed my order incorrectly . Nevertheless Xena continued to be patient and understanding with me and prepared my order with lots of love . Thank you so much for your professionalism and positive attitude it is people like you that make a difference when it comes the food and retail industry . You were awesome and will continue coming back just because of you. THANK YOU XENA lots of love you will go very far with your attitude and approach ."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2016-06-08,1.0,"I walk in. Ordered a Decaf Cafe Mocha. Clear. I went to pick up my order and I receive a Latte. yuck! I head back to the barista and he changes my order to a Decaf Cafe Mocha. So why still Yuck?! He didn't change the cup! He burnt something in the Mocha which made it have a burnt taste! Overall yuck! Hate this location! 
The end!"
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2015-03-08,5.0,Standard Starbucks.For this to be such a high traffic Starbucks the employees are very personable and kind.  The wait is never too long to order or receive your drink.  The seat fill up pretty fast and stay occupied for long periods of time.  As far as accuracy and consistency on my drinks they are always on Park  and even have recommended new drinks for me to try and they have always been a hit .
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2017-04-05,5.0,"I 've only been here twice, but both times have been a great experience! The staff is incredibly friendly and sweet. The drinks have been perfect. Overall: my new favorite starbucks to stop"
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2017-01-28,1.0,"I've been coming to this Starbucks for 7 years and I've decided I will not be returning. 

Since the renovation, the store looks better than ever. But also since the renovation, the new staff is slower than ever. They ignore customers or treat them like they are a bother. I watched one women (the only person waiting) wait for 15 minutes while the employees joked around. She finally had to ask them what was happening with her order. They hadn't even started it. 

Before they remodeled, they we're speedy or at least pretended to care. It's amazing that there appears to be no manager on site guiding the staff to better service. 

Really a shame, as this was a regular spot for me."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2012-09-27,3.0,"Not bad at all, pretty cool starbucks.  I waited a long time so they upgraded my drink size, that was great and it made me proud to be a Gold card member.

Pretty small in here I'd say.

All in all it's a typical starbucks, better service than mcdonalds n dunkin and much better ambience sooo... yea"
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2015-04-11,3.0,"Small area with limited seats , nice music, average service .... My boyfriend and I had the cinnamon chi tea... I had the ice, he had the hot one...."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2015-04-09,5.0,"The best starbucks ever!! It's always busy, but the wait isn't long. The associates get to know you by name and order, and i have never ONCE been dissatisfied with my coffee. 
    They will also make you specialty drinks that aren't on the menu. I had them make me a strawberry mocha frap. It was FANTASTIC!! Also, i had a strawberry peach lemonade.

Definitely deserving of 5 stars."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2013-09-01,3.0,"Came in to cool down while walking the streets of the city. Ordered an iced green tea,  staff was friendly, service a bit slow, and place a bit crowded. They only have one bathroom, so men and women (and there are a lot of them) are lined up right next to where you pick up your order. There's also an island in the middle of the store, which is a nice idea, but I find it interferes with people trying to sit, stand, and walk by.

Overall, not a bad place to grab your drink and go."
721,starbucks-new-york-263,2014-03-25,1.0,"I used to come here everyday until I got kicked out. The employee asked me to leave the seat for someone else right after I threw my empty cup away. I was speechless but ""thank you"". Thank you for saving my money in your store from that moment on -- March 20th."
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2020-01-28,5.0,"So creamy and good!  

Very small place. But clean.  The barista was very polite and attentive. Glad this is in my way to work. I found a new place."
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2019-10-08,5.0,"This is my go to coffee shop because it is near my office, and is the only coffee shop that I like in the area. It's a tiny and cozy Australian coffee shop and during the rush hour you may need to line up outside. It's located on the 9th and 34th, between Penn station and subway 7.

I always order their latte and they have my favourite Oatley oat milk as well. The latte flavour is smooth and not too strong and it always comes with pretty latte arts. It feels nice to see it on your drink every time. The shop also offers a made to order breakfast sandwiches. I need to try them next time! They also have stamp cards for you to collect!"
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2019-11-01,5.0,First impressions are critical !!! My almond Cappuccino was absolutely delicious can't wait to go back !!
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2020-02-08,5.0,"Best muffins ever. Perfect texture!! 
Also best banana bread. Love the coffee and the people there are sooo nice"
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"This place was directly across from my bus stop on a DC to NYC trip so I popped in for a visit. So good! They're a cute little mom 'n pop Australian coffee shop with delicious gluten free banana bread (hard to do!) And they were ready with the oat milk for picky latte drinkers like me. Only downside is there isn't really any seating in their shop.

The barista told me they've just launched recently and are trying to get ""on the map."" Go give them a try!"
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2019-12-27,5.0,Flew in from Seattle to visit family for Christmas and stumbled on this place. Amazing coffee and friendly baristas. We filled up a whole punchcard in a few days. Highly recommend the flat white - perfectly done with incorporated foam and proper milk temp. On par with the best I had in Australia. Not much seating (just a bench) but if there's space and you want to take a few minutes with a proper glass mug you can.
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2019-11-14,5.0,"The owner Eliot is wonderful. He is very nice and makes each customer feel important. The inside is very clean and is bright and warm feeling. The coffee is amazing, it is nice and strong... not weak and watered down. I got the hot mocha 8oz. They have many different options to add to your coffee and I was very exited to see oat milk!! Very excited to go back and try more things."
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2020-01-21,5.0,Very excellent coffee in a very simple straight forward little store.  Affordable too!  I'm delighted.
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2020-02-10,5.0,"In and out, solid coffee and service. Popped in for a cold brew, it's a small place but they work it right. One and out in less than a minute. Cold brew great and only $4, I'll be back!"
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2019-11-04,5.0,"Excellent coffee here, very happy this place exists! Can be a challenge to find, a small place but is worth it! Great tasting drip coffee, and staff is very nice! Glad to have a place that isn't sbux or Dunkin around!"
722,clovelly-coffee-new-york,2019-09-10,5.0,"Lovely coffee place! Friendly staff, eco-conscious, delicious coffee and lovely to find an independent place, especially in this area."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2019-04-06,5.0,"Being from the Midwest, we don't have Pret, but what a cool and super clean lunch (but small) spot. Upon entering, you're met with a wall of food selections, both refrigerated (like salads and sandwiches) to hot (soups and chili). Once you've chosen your food, take it to the register to pay (or in our case, have your chilled grilled ham and cheese re-grilled to perfection). 

They also offer a selection of sweet treats, coffee and tea (like any other neighborhood coffee shop). Don't leave without the double chocolate chip cookie - warm and fabulous! Hubby and I also shared the prosciutto baguette and a cup of broccoli cheddar soup which he didn't care for (thought too watery), but I enjoyed. Only mystery was why one cashier in particular kept yelling 'we have a winner' and everyone clapping....? Happened at least 10 times while we sat and ate. Left with a cup of Chai Tea -also a favorite and perfect ending to our meal."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2020-03-12,1.0,"Just picked up lunch from this place. Customer service is chaotic and rude.  You don't know which register to go to.  One person at one register is banging on the table like he's having convulsions yelling out in Spanish about utter nonsense to another colleague (yes I speak Spanish - there was no need to speak in Spanish for what was being discussed).

There were only three people in line, and yet everyone that worked here seemed to be running around. No organization. Would not return, even though I work close by."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2019-12-09,2.0,"The coffee is always lovely here. The woman working alone at the check out was gracefully managing a long line and irritated customers. There was no cream and there was no coffee. Of any type. 

Some guy with a beard waltzes out of the back, she tells him what they are out of and he rolls his eyes and walks into the back. He comes back with cream, walking like he was soooo inconvenienced. Took his time. Again to back, to eventually emerge with 1 carafe of light roast coffee. That's it. Didn't bother to bring anything else out. Didn't bother to wipe the serving station which was pretty dirty (and he had to have seen) just gave attitude to the gal at the register and acted like none of this was his job. Really?
Management: is this how you train your staff to handle themselves? Like, actually?
That guy obviously doesn't want a job. And it makes me look for another Pret to get my coffee. Think about that."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2019-09-20,4.0,"Nice quick bite spot.  Great for organic and healthy eaters.  I have a Cobb sandwich (think Cobb salad on a sandwich) and a fresh peach juice.  Grain bowls, coffee, pastries, salads and fresh juices for on the go."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2019-01-01,4.0,"Good choice for a quick meal as long as you go when it's not busy. I like their healthy options and antibiotic-free meat. Ya think Subway has that? I'm not a fan of their dangerous chemicals (shudders). My California club here - roasted turkey breast and avocado sandwich - was fresh and satisfying. The lime & cilantro dressing was a tasty alternative to mustard or mayo.  My friend didn't like her sandwich but we agreed their soft chocolate chip cookie was great.

Prices are reasonable and their hot options -mac and cheese, pizza - looked good although small-portioned. I love that nutritional info for the food. The service was friendly and the interior was pretty relaxing as I took refuge from constant rain. 

If I want a cheap, healthy meal and a break from indulging on a trip to NY, I would return."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2019-05-15,3.0,"Good coffee. Customer service was lack luster. As a tourist, I wanted to try this spot.  I found the self serve coffee a little confusing. When asking up front, it was made very clear to me that self serve ""just coffee"" was up front. When asking to flavor shot for my coffee, it was poured in a small   shot cup and wasn't even 2 tbsp. The premade food looked good and my husband enjoyed his strawberrylemonade. If back in NYC not sure I would pick this over Dunkin. Overall 3.5. Coffee more of 4, service a 3."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2020-01-20,1.0,"Very disappointing, hit and miss service. Can only conclude that this branch is run by incompetents. Absolutely no consistency in when food is prepared and ready for purchase. Some days my favourite breakfast sandwich or salad is ready at opening at 6:30am, other times it's not ready till much later and customers are either waiting or leave empty-handed. Hard to rely on this  place as the go to place for my before work lunch purchase if I  can't  be sure  that food will be ready. And, when you  ask staff when food will be ready they're sullen, uninterested and unapologetic.
A shame because the sandwiches are good but service  is too hit and miss."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2018-01-22,4.0,"Came by for a breakfast pastry the other day and it was tasty! The ham, cheese, and tomato croissant was light and fresh.

Service was prompt and there were plenty of seats available too!"
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2019-11-15,3.0,"Look, the people are nice and the food is good. But they consistently underestimate the number of breakfast foods to stock. This would be a four or a five all the way if i didn't have to walk 3 blocks to the Pret that always seems to have what i need."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2019-02-20,5.0,"Been coming this particular one for a while, which started when I had to fix my iPhone nearby (that shop was awful and closed, by the way), then I started getting my lunch to one of the carts close by.  

The place is clean and the staff is wonderful, plus wifi is pretty strong so I can work while I eat and drink here.  A couple of outlets to charge and clean bathrooms.  But what really got me and compelled me to update this review, was when it started snowing heavily today, a homeless person came in to seek shelter.  But instead of kicking them out, one of the staff gave her a Pret gift card!  Wow... never seen that before, and you will never see that at a Starbucks or any other Prets.    All cafes and other service oriented businesses should follow this example of kindness and compassion."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2018-11-14,4.0,"I love this little cafe/restaurant. You come in and pick what you want. They have sandwiches, soups, salads, wraps, and drinks. They also have small snacks like cookies and chips. 

If you're vegan or vegetarian do not despair! They have several options available. I got the beet hummus wrap which was AMAZING. I had it with some pink grapefruit juice.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the seating. It was insane when my friends and I went in. Super, super busy at all times so brace yourselves when you walk in!"
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2017-12-04,5.0,Outstanding no matter the location! If you value quality ingredients at a mind boggling low price... you'll be happy you came into Prets!
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2019-11-19,2.0,"I only go to this location because it's right around the corner from my work. The grilled cheese is never actually grilled. Basically is melted cheese between two pieces of warm white bread. The place also smells like B.O. which I know is because of the food, but that is also disturbing. There are much better locations. Save yourself the disappointment The only thing good about this location is the music."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2018-10-05,5.0,"This location rocks! We utilised them for catering for a global conference and their sincerity and customer service was amazing. Clear consistent communication and follow up to make sure the order is clear, to make sure we got what we need, to see if there is anything else.  Our conference ran long and we needed more coffee. They immediately jumped in providing more and following up. Thanks to the store manager ""J"" and his team for stellar service!!!

Oh and the food is top notch! Flaky delicious croissants and the yogurt parfaits were so appreciated as an option and tasty!"
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2016-12-29,3.0,"Coffee is average. When you're down to your last sips of a mocha, there's a bit of cakes on hard sludge at the bottom of the cup. I stirred my coffee but the sludge was too hard I guess. I haven't had any of the food here so I can't rate that. 

This location is generally packed since it's prime real estate. The workers are nice and the wait time is generally short. Good luck getting a seat here! People like to sprawl out and take up as many chairs as possible with accessories for their computer or bike. Bleh."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2016-12-21,4.0,"Fast, healthier than the competition, and affordable. The organic yogurt and sandwiches are fresh and are tasty. The coffee is fresh and is also very good."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2018-10-03,5.0,"Was super exhausted and down, went into this Pret and Shawn (not sure on spelling, but she's a small blond lady) just made my day. She was so sweet and there was a promo for a free coffee which I got! She was so happy and bubbly I would literally come back to this Pret just for her."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2017-05-06,4.0,"Had a good experience at this Pret A Manger. I wasn't expecting much, but the cashier was very courteous. When I asked for ketchup she brought about 6 packets of it and also brought me a complimentary croissant. Forgot exactly what was the reason she offered me the croissant, but I'm a BOB (baller on a budget) so I obliged and ate the heck out of it. 
It is a little more expensive than Au Bon Pain, but Pret's food options seem to be of good quality. Never been disappointed by their sandwiches. 

Good service would definitely return."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2019-01-09,5.0,Favorite place to go in the city!!! The food is simple and not expensive. Always have everything what I'm craving for in the store and lots of space to seat. Also WiFi is very fast !!
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2017-11-22,5.0,"This Pret is right next door to my usual hotel and across the street from my office when I'm in NYC for work. 

I am always impressed by the food offerings. Fresh, clean, well-prepared breakfast is always just next door. The coffee is also always fresh and not burned, which is a definite win in Midtown. It's also a fabulous place to have a quick breakfast or coffee meeting with colleagues while I'm in town. 

They deliver breakfast to my room if desired."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2015-02-16,3.0,"I shall only review one Pret ever.  While there are differences across the chain, given that Pret is primarily a take-out place with a fairly standard menu, the experience is fairly similar across the large and growing family of Pret outlets in the city.

The Pret salads are healthy but one has to be short of restaurant options or time to get one.  The falafel mezze salad is a good option.    So also their falafel wrap.  The Moroccan lentil soup is always available, but as they have raised the contribution of carrots, turnips and onions in what appears to be their modified recipe, I tend to avoid this soup.  The tomato and feta soup is a great addition to the menu, but is not available on all days or in every location.

Pret's assortment has expanded over the years to include fresh fruit, yogurt pots, pastry and juices.  Their registers are run efficiently, often with coordination and intervention from their store managers.  Pret will continue to keep their market share of lunch dollars.  But they will need to keep up with the competition in coming up with new options to keep the menu interesting and the customers coming back."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2018-04-25,5.0,"If you need a place to do work on your laptop and you don't mind music playing in the background, then this is the place for you. Place is very clean, staff is friendly, sandwiches are overpriced but tasty."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2018-03-10,4.0,"Had a cappuccino and almond croissant, both were delicious. Cashiers were all too sweet."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2016-04-29,5.0,OMG!! I've been here a couple times (forgot to check in) and keep getting the same thing. Egg salad on multigrain bread with arugula. It is the best. I love love love it!!! The service is super fast too so if you see a crowd don't worry the lines move fast.
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2015-03-12,3.0,"Good place.
I tried a salted caramel latte but not that good.

Oh yelp .. Do i have to talk too much to accept the review?"
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2017-09-21,3.0,I've been coming to this place for around a year. There often problems with their wifi and I cant believe that after one year they don't fix their internet issues.
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2014-07-11,4.0,"I don't know how I came across this place, but I needed coffee before my meeting.

So I took a peek and saw they had breakfast goodies: cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, pre-smeared bagels, salads and all these organic/healthy options! I was pleased to see this! OH, for the juicers, they got some of that, too: beets, greens and some OJ for all.

I got the egg & mushroom mini sandwich, I think it's called broche? I forgot, but it was only 3.99 with my large coffee, I spent about 7-something without tax, yay! 

The only thing about the egg and mushroom broche - it's bland. No pepper, no salt. Coffee was okay, I was hoping it was tasty even if it's black. But they offer creamer, organic soy milk and raw sugar at the ""help yourself"" section I like to call it.

The dining experience was chill, too. Spacious area and lots of comfortable seating. Winner Winner.

OH, the staff are super helpful and hella quick with service (:"
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2016-08-07,5.0,"Ate here allot duRing our hotel stay in New York. It's similar to restaurant food@half the price.DELICIOUS Greek honey yogurt with coffee for breakfast. Wraps for lunch. Everything was fresh and flavorful.
I also Love that they only keep food for one day and donate the leftovers to the hungry! Very generous~"
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2017-07-22,5.0,The food is always really fresh and delicious. I've been frequenting this location for a while now and don't expect much as far as customer service goes... but today a nice staff member named Miguel went above and beyond by asking me how my day was going and even giving me his name if I needed anything while I ate my salad. Then (here's the wow factor...) he actually came out behind the register to check to make sure i was enjoying my meal. That was so sweet. He's a standout employee for sure... especially coming from a jaded New Yorker :)
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2017-04-18,2.0,"4 stars??? The place is OK if you are in a hurry, but it's nothing special.

Had a sandwich with egg, sausage and cheese. The taste was OK, but there were hard pieces on the otherwise soft roll."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2017-04-27,1.0,"The product is by and large fine, but the wrap packaging is downright fraudulent, and so I will no longer patronize Pret (any).  Wraps are cut in half and packaged in such a way that it appears to be rather longer (thus bigger) than it is, as you discover when you open it and find a gap previously hidden.  The attached photos tell the story, pre and post opening."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2015-01-15,5.0,"My friend took me here. 
We each got a soup and split a sandwich but then had to go back and buy more because it was so good. 
I like the idea that they throw away everything in the end of the day. 
It's too bad there is to places like this in SF."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2017-01-01,5.0,"Usually there 2 to 3 times a week. In and out in under 5 minutes. Five stars if you're looking for something that's super quick and consistent. My usuals are fennel meatball soup, pumpkin bisque, southwestern chicken BBQ hot baguette, turkey ham and cheddar hot baguette, and the chicken and avocado salad when I'm feeling fat."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2016-04-13,4.0,Good spot for lunch. Selection is good and fresh. I have tried the sandwiches and salads. Some of the items are a little pricey. Great place to eat or take back to the office for lunch with  lots of healthy choices.
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2014-07-19,2.0,"not sure why this location scoops the soup ahead of time and puts it on a shelf for people to grab. Kinda weird in my book since I would want my soup hot. This location seems to emphasize a lot of self service, eg, pouring your own coffee. Other than, this place offers the typical pret fare."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2016-10-11,2.0,"Update: hi Stephanie, I am not sure if there's a way for me to privately message you my email address.. because I don't want to share my email address here in public. Please advise, thanks! 

--------

I am a regular here, usually all the staff are very friendly and courteous, but there is one cashier girl (short, glasses, brown hair) who just isn't very accommodating. This morning I got an oatmeal for myself and the free granola and brown sugar that are always placed under the oatmeal section was empty. I asked her for granola while paying, and she said ""I dont know"" with a very annoyed look. After i paid, I asked a young man who was stacking up bfast wraps about granola and he was extremely friendly and helpful. It took him literally 5 seconds to go get them."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2014-01-09,5.0,"I hate breakfast food. I don't know why.  I just never liked it. 

Next to my new office, Pret is one of those great places that offers ""lunch food"" starting early morning and all the way through the night. 
One of my favorites is the club sandwich. It is basically a sandwich version of a cobb salad. As of recently, I also started getting into their sodas. Who would have thought that ""yoga bunny detox"" would be the one?

Overall, just like all the other Pret's it's always fresh and on the go. The service is fast and it is not ridiculously crowded for the area."
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2016-09-29,5.0,Wow we need these in LA. Nice people good food and affordable. I walked in feeling blah and perked right up. Pit of awesome apples granola parfait (that's not the real name) and a pretty amazing blueberry muffin. So easy to screw those up. I'll be back!
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2017-11-14,4.0,Breakfast sandwich on brioche was everything better than than mcdonalds. Stuffed croissant just as great.
723,pret-a-manger-new-york-39,2012-01-19,3.0,"This is the newest location to open and I'm a big fan of vegetarian soups in nyc, i was hoping for more options than lentil soup and a miso soup. 

The toastie was a good sandwich at 4pm when I hadn't had breakfast or lunch, but the chai latte was too spicy and the soup wasn't hot (but it was 4pm). 

Not so much a fan and they are just opening another one in my office building in Chicago too.. hmm.."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-01-10,5.0,"This Pret is always incredibly well organized, very clean, and a great quick in and out. 

I go here for lunch frequently, and it's always a quick in and out. Lunch in midtown can be crazy busy, but this Pret always has 6-7 people working the register during lunch, and I've never waited for than a few minutes in line each time. 

The food is always incredible, and very well stocked. I can't even picture what an empty shelf here would look like! Also it's DELICIOUS, I love their Thanksgiving sandwich with turkey and stuffing, and all of their soups!

Finally, the staff here is one of the best I've experienced at an NYC lunch hot spot. There frequently someone greeting you as you come in, asking if you need any help. Also, all of the cashiers are wonderful and very pleasing people. They even took the time to have quick conversations with me while checking out. Some of the best customer service out there!

I highly recommend this Pret, I've always been pleased and had a wonderful experience!"
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-08-22,4.0,"Of course my 1st love when it comes to Pret A Manger is the flagship store on 4th Street- near Union Square. This Pret A Manger across the street from Bryant Park is my second favorite. Here are my reasons why?

It is convenient across the street from Bryant Park. Sometimes the lines are so long at the eateries in Bryant Park and when you are scrapped for time. It's across the street to Whole Foods or Pret A Manger.

Although this store is small and with limited amount of seating compared to the bigger Pret A Manger, the tables are always clean. Not like some of the other Pret on the Westside.

The food are freshly made and healthy. 

Mac and cheese was a tad salty

The wraps are really good- Got the Hummus Falafel Wrap

Hot foods- Chicken Parm

Always an Almond Croissant to get that sugar rush with light roasted coffee.

They have lobster sandwiches too. Will get that the next time.

Will be back again that's for sure.

They will not provide receipt unless you ask for it. Great way to save paper and trees.

Bathroom code on receipt if you need to use the restroom.

Ask for bag if getting lots of items."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-08-18,5.0,"Usually I prefer a mom and pop kind of cafe but I like this Pret because the staff is so nice. 

They always have the coffee area well stocked with hot coffee and all the creamer containers are full and the sugars are full too. The staff is always helpful and so kindhearted. 

I like the edamame/beet salads and Choco chip cookies and hot hot coffee. 
Tasty and fresh? Yes, thank you. 

If I had a guitar I would write a song about my experience here. 
One of the fellas looks like a famous actor ."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-09-10,4.0,"I am a big fan of Pret, and this is one of my favorite locations, reasons being that it's very big, has bathrooms, is across from the park, is on the corner and is naturally lit up and pretty, has strong WiFi, and staff is so nice. Their tomato feta soup is always a knockout - you just can't go wrong with it. Their food is so consistent! 

Their dark roast is great, and I love that they leave the almond milk out, versus other cafes (cough cough), where you have to go up to the counter and beg for some. No frugality here! Their sparkling water is not bad, but on the pricey side. They also keep filling up the self-serve til late at night, determined to caffeinate us til the minute they close! 

Pret is known for wonderfully friendly staff, and I need to mention again how lovely the people who work at this location are. Whether it's nutritional questions or helping me decide on what to get, they got me."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-01-17,4.0,"We definitely need this joint in Toronto. I came across this chain in Singapore, Malaysia, HK, and Taiwan..they serve extremely delicious wholesome coffee, treats, sandwiches, and soups made from natural ingredients. Taste is exactly as good as in the Orient and here in NYC. You know the eatery is legit when you can count on the same taste no matter which continent you are on.
Thumbs up....Waaaaaay up!"
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-02-04,1.0,"I came here on a Monday night at 9:30, having seen the posted times in the window stating they close at midnight.

I proceeded to try to order some type of coffee - any type. I tried for decaf iced coffee but they didn't have any. So I settled for iced tea, but they didn't have any of that either. So I finally asked if they could make decaf espresso, but they were not making any espresso drinks - all they had was hot chocolate.

It is beyond ridiculous for such a centrally-located café not to have any real coffee. And it is doubly frustrating that their hours posted in the window don't match up with what I see online, where their listed closing time is 10pm."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-07-07,3.0,"I have decided that chains all get three stars or below as they are proven to work. Pret A Manger is a chain. It's Starbucks good in its own way and if you know it, you won't be let down. There is nothing different in this one from the others. 

Still, the food and coffee are good and reasonably healthy. A good stop when starting out your day."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-11-25,1.0,"Service here has not been great of late.  Second time I've come here now and have had a cashier carry on a long conversation while completely ignoring me. This morning really tried my patience. I'm next in the line. Middle aged white female was waiting on the side I presume for a drink. Next thing I know she cuts the line to get a muffin.  Black female cashier allows her while I'm standing there with my items.  This was around 10:19 am.  When the cashier finally gets to me, she is carrying on a long conversation with her colleagues. No greeting, nothing.  Really unacceptable."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2020-01-21,2.0,"There has been a recent managerial change, several as a matter of fact. Since then the service has gone down hill quickly.  At 8AM in the morning there's almost nothing for breakfast on the shelves. Pay lines are very long all day  because there are only 2 or 3, at most cashiers at most at any point in time.  I like the food and this is the closest to my office, but unfortunately I have to find another Pret to go to."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-07-08,3.0,"Pros and cons. The sparkling water is darn refreshing on a July day. Yum! Front of the restaurant is clean and the woman at the counter was friendly. However, you need a code to use the restroom, which was a mess. It smelled terrible, the floor was filthy, toilet paper strewn in the corners, sink basin was dirty, and there were about 8 people waiting in line. If you're stopping in here for its convenient restroom location to Bryant Park, manage your expectations accordingly."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-05-25,4.0,"I like to hope that Pret is the rare company that treats its employees fairly and pays a competitive wage--not just for the social justice implications, but because otherwise, Pret is clearly a cult that is abducting youths and brainwashing them.  How else to explain the seemingly sincere and remarkably joyous, ebullient service with which the staff here almost uniformly greets you?  Come at the right time and you might even get treated to a free iced tea or coffee with your purchase. 

As to those purchases... Pret offers a pretty solid assortment of lunch options.  In an era of specialization and competition, where I visit salad places to find they are now offering grain bowls to compete with the grain bowl places that are now offering salads, I rather appreciate how I can come here and get a soup OR a sandwich AND/OR a salad.  Food is generally quite fresh and, speaking of competitive, their prices are quite reasonable for NY lunch standards.  I find their Moroccan lentil soup and Egg & Quinoa pot particularly tasty for a quick, seemingly healthy lunch."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-10-12,1.0,Don't eat here on a Saturday: the bread is so stale you can break a tooth eating it. Old sandwiches are not very appetizing
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-04-16,4.0,"Not gonna lie, I only came in here because I needed to pee. I bought a cucumber seltzer water since I didn't want to just roam in without buying anything. I took a sip while charging my phone and it was actually pretty tasty. Seriously, try that s***.

This place always seemed very ""meh"" to me because I only tried their coffee and croissants. But after tasting the Chef's salad with balsamic vinaigrette, I have the heart emoji eyes. This is a cool spot for lunch/ brunch."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-07-14,1.0,This is a review strictly on how I was treated by the staff. Every other Pret has very sweet workers. But I had such a bad experience at this one last week. I will NOT be going back to this location ever again. I felt humiliated by how I was treated.
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2020-03-08,2.0,"I've started a new job in the neighborhood so I decided to come here for coffee drinks etc after eating my lunch in the park.  I've come to the conclusion this place is very unhygenic. There's always a large spray bottle and of some chemical cleaner and a dirty rag on the counter behind the cashiers. At first, I only saw it sitting there...concerning enough since they're handling open food and beverages *right there*, but I ignored it. But now I'm actually seeing them all randomly and indiscriminately spraying it on the counter right there by food and beverages as they're being prepared...all the spray particles contaminating the food, cups, kitchen tools, etc.  Are you kidding me? I also see the baristas recklessly dropping cups, putting their dirty fingers in cups, and accidentally dropping things that were on the chemical laden or dirty counter, into the milk steamer cup, reach their dirty hands into the cup to remove the dirty item, then just fill up that cup without washing it first. It's pretty disgusting. They're not very intelligent or diligent there. I won't be returning.  Please PAM, stop poisoning us with your unhygenic employees and practices."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2016-07-30,5.0,"While in New York, my go to place was Pret A Manger.  I was only in New York for three nights and I went to Pret A Manger (various locations) at least half a dozen times. 

Pret A Manger sells yummy, HEALTHY food. The prices are reasonable too.  (I'm ignoring the fact that the Canadian dollar sucks and that I had to pay an exchange rate on top of it.)  While the prices can't be considered cheap (cheap food no longer exists), the prices weren't over-inflated.  Here in Vancouver, ""healthy"" food is way overpriced ($10 for a salad?!  Fuck off!) but Pret A Manger's prices were on par with unhealthy garbage food.  

There was a variety of food choices, as well as price points. I liked that if I just needed a little snack to keep my blood sugar up, I could buy something for under $5. That's rare. Usually I have to decide between unhealthy and cheap, or healthy and expensive.  But not at Pret A Manger. I really liked the berry cups, veggie sticks with sweet pea hummus, and chicken and edamame cups. Perfect for a small snack to keep my blood sugar up. 

Everything also had the calories listed (I think it's some law in the States), so you could make wise decisions. Most things were fairly low cal, and even the odd item that had a high number of calories was still healthy. 

I really wish that Vancouver had something like Pret A Manger."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2017-08-16,4.0,"Friendly staff, convenient location, quite a bit of seating, and so many food options in one spot. Just like other locations of Pret, the food is really fresh, and one of my favorite things about Pret is that you can just get half sandwiches (slims) if you don't want a full meal. Glad there is a Pret location so close to the park!"
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-01-29,4.0,Very friendly staff- good food. Like the view from the tables to the park. They seem to keep an efficient flow going.
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-04-10,5.0,I love this location! Everyone here is always so so sweet and they always have a smile on their face. I love that it's not extra for almond milk unlike most places. Five stars!!
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-04-01,5.0,"Yes, this is a chain.  But I'm not sure how you can beat a quick salad or wrap from Pret when it's a sunny day in Bryant Park.  Service is quick, selection is varied, and I would give anything to have one of these in my town.  Options are healthy and good every time."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-08-13,1.0,"This location is disorganized, always have to wait a long time for drinks. They need to improve on management. Seems like they're always unprepared, many time they run out of things"
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-06-06,1.0,I went to the one on 42nd bet 5 and 6th last night for a quick bite. I got the mozzarella and chicken sandwich w a bit of dressing.  It was more like a slosh. Like the sandwich was bathed in guck. Yuck!
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-04-04,5.0,"Awesome service to the 2 females working today! The one girl has a hat that says ""I'm new""!! Aweosme drinks and awesome service!! We ordered the TUMERIC Lattee & Chai Latte! Both were amazing!! But the customer service made it even better! Will return and I am a local!!!! So many Prets in the city, this is by far the best one!"
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-01-15,1.0,"Ghastly experience at this location this morning. Last day in NYC for a weekend vaycay and stopped here for a coffee before heading to the airport. Front doors were blocked, sign said to use side door.  Inside, the vibe was off, and my guess it had to do with the horrid service person who helped me and was rude to her coworkers.  Snide, sarcastic, and unfriendly are just some of the words I would use to describe her treatment of us and her colleagues.  My mocha was flavorless, I threw it away after drinking less than a quarter.  We saw these places everywhere while we were in town, and this experience is enough to keep me away from these anytime I'll run into them in the future."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-08-25,1.0,"My wife shared her unfortunate experience she had in this location Friday morning. She told me: I purchased two items a large coffee plus eggs and spinach. I gave the cashier 10 dollar bill and she only gave me $2.25. When I asked why she was flustered and couldn't figure out the change she called the Manager. His name is RANDY. He came in and instead of resolving the issue then went on counting all the money in the register !!!! What is this?? Does RANDY need more training on how to give a customer a correct change? I was so frustrated with the incompetence I left all the money, food and beverage and left. This is unacceptable !!!! Teach your staff how to count money!!!!!
I am so disappointed and DISGUSTED!!
I have been a loyal customer but I will not be able to step in this location any longer. My advise to anyone who steps in to this location:
DO NOT PAY CASH! ONLY PAY CREDIT OR DEBIT. THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND NOT GIVE IT BACK!"
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2017-03-20,5.0,"Nice taste everything fresh. 
Soups are perfect to start a day.
Also every night they give fresh food to the hungry rather than selling it next day."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-02-21,5.0,"Not a huge fan of Pret as much of their food is laden with salt and fat and you can get much better espresso drinks elsewhere. Their drip coffee is on point and priced great. 

The kids here that manage the place are good people. Justin is the greatest, service is unmatched. I remember Randy from the Pret on 42nd st as well. 

Not too sure what direction Pret is heading, hope they simplify things again."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2019-03-23,1.0,I just left this location after the manager who is extremely rude said they were closing early and then proceeded to argue. This is the second time this incident has happened - the first time - when I asked how come they were out of Diet Coke - to which she responded - you shouldn't be drinking it because it's not good for you. In that case why is the product being sold at this location. I would however like to update that this was just one manager the blonde female individual on both times. The other gentleman and lady have always been extremely kind.
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2015-12-01,4.0,"This Pret a Manger is quite spacious. There's another section of seating in the back behind the cash registers and you can basically lounge out. It's great.

I ate a fruit cup here (specifically pineapple with lime) and the pineapples were rather sweet to my surprise. Fruit cups can be hit or miss, and given that it was like $4 I was hoping it would be doubly good.

The front has the coffee where you can serve yourself. But I think as it gets later in the night, they start to run out pretty fast, but it looks like they will brew more anyway."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-05-02,1.0,"Breaks my heart to write a negative review. I love this location and visit 2-3 times a day. The people working there are f'n amazing. So kind, friendly, fun  and welcoming. The staff is why I have not been to Starbucks for 6 months. To put it simply I love them. Today I was getting a second cup of coffee and was blocked by whom I thought was an unhappy customer talking very rudely to a very nice employee. Manager was standing by them. Turns out this guy is upper management. He was berating and being condescending to her very loudly while blocking the self serve coffee. The employee was being kind and calm and seemed to be sincerely trying to fix what appeared to be a simple miscommunication.  Very unprofessional on his part to do in front of customers when it's busy. Smh Really douchey dick describes him best. Super tall, skinny, dark skinned guy dressed in cheap clothes with a horrible haircut trying way too hard to look and sound like a hipster baller. Just bad. 

This is my favorite store, not because of the coffee but because of the wonderful employees.  This upper management guy absolutely does not understand what a great team he has.  I hope this reaches Pret and he takes a minute to realize how blessed he is to have such an amazing team. It's really a family vibe there, well until he got there. Keep up the good work guys. Don't let dicks like him take away the family atmosphere you guys have created. You guys make my day better every day and for that I thank you."

724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-06-08,5.0,Had to write a review because my family and I received the friendliest customer service ever today!!! Every employee we encountered was so kind and welcoming. Coffee & food was great as well.
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2016-02-07,5.0,"This Pret A manger is clean, and spacious. There are lots of sitting space at the back of the cash registers. In addition you can see what is going on in the streets by looking at the windows if you are in need of motivation or to be curious on what people do nowadays. 

The customer service is good as they are polite and helpful. I mistakenly dropped my coffee's cup lid and they replaced it immediately. 

The plain croissant in here is crispy, fresh, warm, and very tasty."

724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2016-11-30,1.0,"This is not directed at the service I have received here. The staff is nice and friendly, it is directed at the food,  and the diminishing portion sizes. 

I come here twice per day about 6 days a week. I spend about $100 per week here.  I have had it. I am done. No more.
 
In the past, I have had issues with getting food that was sneakily packed to give the illusion of a full portion, only to be surprised when I get back to my office and see a giant 2""gap spaced between two tiny ends of a wrap. Despite that happening now and then I would still come back.

Now my issue is with the soup. Tasty soup, but I have had my fill (poor choice of words here) of opening up my large soup to see the container is only 2/3rds full. It has happened now and then in the past, but it has happened now 4 times in the last week. And I am forced to fill the inch plus of room with water so I don't feel as cheated, and hungry. And hangry.

At $6 this soup is not cheap compared to other options in the neighborhood.

What is most sinister is that they now use two of the cups doubled up to make the container feel heavier, like you're getting the full portion. So, prêt, not only are you cheating everyone, but you are hurting the environment too.

For this reason I can't go back here. I can't give a company $100 per week that is leaving me unsatisfied and using extra packaging to dupe me and hurt the planet.

I have a photo to upload, but I'm too hungry and now impatient to search for the dang upload button on my phone."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2016-11-13,4.0,"First time visitor. Was hungry for breakfast and this was the first spot we saw. It's across the street from Bryant park. We wanted to do some shopping so this place worked out perfectly.


Restaurant is clean. Small. Limited seating. They sell sandwiches, wraps, juices and pastries. We bought a few hot items such as an egg, mushroom on brioche. Serving sizes in NY are so much smaller than Texas. Made us seem like piggies when we ordered two of each.

The food is healthier than McDonald's. I'd come back here again."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2018-05-03,1.0,Terrible service and/or management.  Not sure why considering the other nearby Prets are so much better run.  I stopped going to this location for awhile after two coworkers were flat out saying I was at fault for using my card incorrectly to pay and not their incorrect instructions on how to do so.  I went back again today and the staff still seems more interested in talking to one another than helping ring up customers.  Too bad because I'm at a Pret almost daily and this is closest to my office. I'll walk the extra blocks to go to the others.
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2017-05-01,4.0,"How much do I love Pret?  I love Pret.

I can't really give them five stars, because they aren't a gourmet joint.  Just solid, freshly prepared, always consistent food.

But this is why one goes to Pret.  They are consistent as anything.  Always great food, always great service, clean.  I love Pret."
724,pret-a-manger-new-york-70,2017-10-25,2.0,"I love pret but this location is not the cream of the crop. The employees are rude. The manager is rude. They consistently take 4times as long as other prets to make your drink no matter how simple it is.  The past several times I've left this location only to realize my drink is wrong or they sweetened the tea with a coffee flavoring, etc. the inconsistency makes it worth it to walk a few blocks to the nearest pret that has employees with manners, efficient baristas, and managers that know how to say thank you."

The vegan options I'm aware of are the Moroccan Lentil soup, which is good, and the there's a curry thing with quinoa which is super tasty but not always available.

The cashiers are super fast, so a long line should not intimidate you at all. I generally come here for lunch if I just need something quick. 

I can't say the food is the most amazing thing I've ever had, but it does the job - standard American fast casual cafe with health in mind. 

I lost my credit card here once and was able to claim it the next day. The people here are really nice, and really went and looked for it for me. 

I've never sat down to eat here yet, but the place looks pretty clean. While there are always people in and out and sitting down, I feel you can always find seating here. Plus it's right next to a subway station!"

725,pret-a-manger-new-york-73,2019-09-06,1.0,These workers are so unenthused.  Today the cashier( sitting on a stool) barely looked up to even hand me my change.  They are always griping and gossiping when you are trying to pay.  A real turn off.  Poor customer service! never give a free meal or anything.  Tacky....

There are so many tables and seats here!!! It's spacious and they play good music. I'm hoping they'll turn it down a bit though for those who want to listen to their own music or lectures.

 There are outlets here for those who want to charge their laptops. They have all the typical Pret stuff - coffee, sandwiches, baked goods. But the space won me over. 

They have communal tables as well as individual seats. Huge windows for people watching."
725,pret-a-manger-new-york-73,2017-04-11,5.0,"Pret is my go-to favorite for ""fast food."" They allow me to get a quick breakfast, snack, lunch, coffee, or juice without compromising taste or quality. Their food is very fresh and there are always new options available. My first experience with this company was in London and I've been hooked ever since. If the choice is between here and another fast food joint, I will always choose here. Even if it means walking a few extra blocks. It is a little pricier than other options, but you get what you pay for. 

The staff at this location were very polite, they had a ton of seating, and their bathroom was clean. I'll be back!"
725,pret-a-manger-new-york-73,2016-12-16,3.0,"Standard cafe and sandwich shop chain. It works, but don't expect anything special. 

I got coffee from the counter, which was for some reason of a weird layout. You line up towards the counter, and then once you place your order, you're swiped to the side, except next to you is another line. But you have to get away since the person behind the counter now wants to speak to the person behind you. Except your coffee is not there yet.

Make a separate pick-up area, and things would run more smoothly.

I liked the communal tables. It encourages chats with random strangers. At least that made my day."

725,pret-a-manger-new-york-73,2017-10-04,4.0,"For the price, this chain serves small  portion sizes. But besides that, I really do love the grab and go concept of Pret. I am a person who is usually pressed for time in the mornings and thanks to pret I have time to actually grab myself some breakfast. They have oatmeal, yogurt, and egg sandwiches- which are really my go to.the staff do move about slow for my liking, but they are nice. Though it doesn't have a morning rush crowd per-say, If people are coming during the morning rush, they expect to be served within speed. I do like this location and will continue to comeback"
725,pret-a-manger-new-york-73,2019-05-07,4.0,"Pret has many locations in the city, this one is a good one in a newer building. It is very spacious with great seating, the food is always well stocked and they move quick. Good choice for a quick breakfast or lunch."
725,pret-a-manger-new-york-73,2016-09-08,3.0,"Why we need two Prets in the span of 5 blocks is beyond me. Maybe I just don't get it.

But this one is much better than the 23rd street location. And not just because the 23rd street one perpetually has homeless people and construction outside of it... okay, mostly because of that.

This one has high ceilings, tons of a seating, and the same Pret food you'd get at any other location. Lines move reasonably quickly."
725,pret-a-manger-new-york-73,2018-08-23,2.0,"I went here for lunch. I had the gazpacho soup and a sandwich. The sandwich was Ok. The soup was so spicy that it ruined my day.

725,pret-a-manger-new-york-73,2016-11-01,5.0,"What made me change from 4 stars to 5 stars is the quality of service they provide. I've been a frequent customer of pret and I keep coming back because- apart from the conviniece- employees there really make a wonderful difference. They're always smiling and have the best attitude, which is kind of rare in New York. 
Amazing working enviroment that spreads to its customers."

The service is always quick, and the customer service is great!  Everyone is very friendly.  I dropped my yogurt once during morning rush (which was totally my clumsy fault) and the manager replaced it at no charge."
725,pret-a-manger-new-york-73,2016-04-26,2.0,"This just got to the area. It's nice inside. A lot of seating, and the vibe is good. However the bathrooms are always dirty and don't seemed to be clean. It's the same with Starbucks, I get that these places get high amounts of foot traffic, but when you look in the corners of the bathrooms it's just disgusting. Taking a mop to the bathroom every other hour, and some 409 to the sink/toilet would do this place some good. 

Also- I've been making this my go-to morning place. However there is this girl that works here, Sarah, who need a SERIOUS attitude adjustment. Looks at you like an idiot when you come to the counter, energy is non-existent. I hope I don't have to switch coffee places again due to GRUMPY morning employees. 

UPDATE: this place is ALWAYS a mess. They just don't take the time to do walk throughs for the day. Right now I'm currently sitting in the corner by window and there is a huge spill or coffee on the floor, napkins and trash everywhere, crumbs... 

I don't know why I keep coming here. It's convenient. But damn, maybe if you put as much pride in the actually store as you do the food display (which there are always like 5 employees standing and moving things around), then it would be a great place to eat and relax."

725,pret-a-manger-new-york-73,2018-01-10,3.0,This is a general review. The sand which we are bland but I like that they offer half sandwiches only. The soups are great especially the chicken soup BUT they honestly only fill the soup 3/4 full. I always have them. So it off when I'm paying. Salads could be improved. Always very busy. Not sure why/how.

My go to place to panda bubble tea, service has always been friendly and fast every time I've been here. Service.


If you need ice level and sugar level adjusted. Just let them know what percentage you want and they'll accommodate. 

I recommend the taro, panda or get one of their juice blends."

This is a great place for on the go bubble tea-- its a tiny place with no seating and quick service. They have a huge variety of really fresh fruit teas, smoothies, and milk teas and you know the fruit is fresh as you can see them cutting them up. A+ for quality of the ingredients

I got the bubble milk black tea normal sweetness no ice etc and found it had a very strong tea flavor-- you can tell they used real tea. Personally, I prefer my milk tea more milky and sweet however there is no denying you are getting some quality drink. I found the boba to be more on the firmer side and not as chewy. 

Would recommend if you like tea!"
726,tbaar-new-york-12,2019-05-26,4.0,"Note this place is just to pick up drinks. I thought there might be some sitting room, but alas there was not. My friend ordered a head of time on ritual so it was all ready for pick up when she arrived. Indecisive me waited until I was onsite to order, figuring I'd call an audible anyway. 

I made the right decision with the mango lemonade, just a good combo of flavors! I loved that they add fresh fruit to their drinks, so my drink had slices of  lemon and little bites of mango which was a nice touch."
726,tbaar-new-york-12,2019-09-23,5.0,"Visited this place as were in a hurry and wanted to catch the train, so ordered via app. The order was ready when we arrived and this was a cute little place hidden between buildings.

726,tbaar-new-york-12,2019-09-24,5.0,"It's a hole in the wall but they do have very good selection of milk tea, milk shake and fruit tea. The fruit tea are made from fresh fruit and they cut the fruit in front of you. The price is very decent. The counter is very clean and so does the kitchen."
726,tbaar-new-york-12,2019-04-18,4.0,Green tea milk tea is excellent with a nice strong tea flavor. The herbal jelly was good but I preferred their jellies. Good tea place with a lot of interesting fruit tea selections. 4.1

A nice addition to the midtown area with some bubble tea!! I got the fresh passion fruit tea which was very refreshing! It's green tea and had bites of mango, strawberry, kiwi and mixed jelly. The bubble milk black tea is your standard one and was really good too. The baba tapioca pearls were chewy.

Staff was super nice!! Service was quick."
726,tbaar-new-york-12,2019-03-01,4.0,"Would have given my experience five stars except I had a really strange experience there last night. I arrived at the shop and the girl working behind the counter was facetiming with her boyfriend. She was cleaning some things and talking to him, so I stood there for a moment thinking that she was just giving me some time to look through the menu. However, some time passed and I had already long decided on what I'd wanted so I asked if I could order. She nodded her head and quickly came over to take my order.

The ordering process was fine but then she started to make the drinks. She was still talking to him during this time and telling him that she should probably go, etc. However, I suppose that since I was the only person there, they had decided it didn't really matter. She finished with one of my two drinks and handed it to me. She then started cleaning things again. When I realized that she wasn't going to be moving on to the second drink, I quickly called out for her again and asked her if she was going to make my second drink. She apologized and quickly got started on it. 

The drink was quick to make but when she handed it to me, I realized that it didn't have the lychee jelly in it that I had ordered. She apologized once again for forgetting. She was very nice about it, thankfully, but the whole thing just seemed somewhat silly. Thankfully, the drinks still turned out good (I was a little worried considering how little attention she seemed to be paying to what was happening). I ordered one of my favorites: the Herbal Jelly and Aloe in Green Milk Tea - I got it with no ice and 50% sugar which was really good!"
726,tbaar-new-york-12,2019-05-10,4.0,Very good bubble tea. I ordered the coconut milk tea and it has a strong taste but it tastes as if it contained real coconut inside it. It's very sweet so maybe I should lower it more. I also tried the Vanilla Milke Tea but for some reason it tasted a bit more like French vanilla coffee more than tea but was still pretty good.
726,tbaar-new-york-12,2018-12-07,5.0,"Fantastic hot green milk tea for a cold night. I love my drink. Very fragrant tea, right amount of sweetness. Bobas are chewy and soft. Highly recommended."

726,tbaar-new-york-12,2019-03-21,1.0,"I ordered two juices via GrubHub and the driver was absolutely incompetent. He called to say that I had to go downstairs for my food in a demanding tone, as I go downstairs to the lobby I had to walk outside to the street to find it. Didn't even bother to apologize for how long it took to be delivered nor for the unnecessary aggravation. I will never order anything from them again."
726,tbaar-new-york-12,2019-05-31,5.0,"Note: The first half of this review focuses on an issue I had with GrubHub, but if you continue reading, you'll find it is totally relevant to my review of TBaar.

Earlier today, I ordered delivery from TBaar to my husband's nearby office to surprise him on a rough day.  I had ordered it through Grubhub via Yelp.  I received three phone calls in a row from the Grubhub driver.  Each time, I could barely hear him, and he hung up.  Then he texted me to call the Grubhub line, as he was ""attempting to deliver my order but couldn't reach me by phone"".  I immediately called Grubhub, was put on hold for several minutes, only to be told by the Grubhub representative that ""the driver said you didn't pick up the phone so he threw the food out"".  For a second, I thought he was joking, but he wasn't... (wth?!  He didn't even attempt to go into the building- and all you need to do there is walk in!). I called TBaar to let them know what happened and see if they had any other delivery service.  The Grubhub drivers are not hired by them, but by Grubhub, so it wasn't even TBaar's fault at all...Well, TBaar STILL offered to remake the order and deliver it for me at no extra charge.  They made it and delivered it right away.  My husband said the smoothies were delicious too!  :)"
726,tbaar-new-york-12,2018-08-11,5.0,This place is a wonderful new option for smoothies and bubble tea. They use fresh cut fruit and make their ice with filtered water. I ordered the TBaar Fruit Tea with bubbles and they cut open 5 different fruits just to put in my drink. The tea was so fragrant and flavorful and the bubbles were perfectly cooked and chewy. My friend got a mango orange smoothie and it was also delicious and full of real fruit. The drinks here are far superior to the other bubble tea chains in the area that use powders and syrups for flavoring.
726,tbaar-new-york-12,2018-12-09,5.0,"I once ordered their regular milk tea and it was a bit on the oaty side, so it wasn't my cup of tea. The next time I ordered my usual at any tea place, honey green tea. It is perfect- just the right amount of honey sweetness and green tea bitterness! My new go to drink at this place. They also have stamp cards which makes it easy to get free toppings and free drinks!"
726,tbaar-new-york-12,2018-10-20,4.0,"when a nail salon opened near my job on 36th st off 5th ave it was no big deal but when a juice bar took over the front of the nail salon that's something that grabbed my attention . it's divided by  plexiglass fixtures so you don't have to worry about a finger or toe nail flying inside your smoothie , bubble tea, coffee or fruit drink . they seem to be doing some decent business as i notice a small crowd whenever i pass by and now it's my turn , a mango pineapple smoothie and a traditional lemonade . the quality of fruits and juices used are grade a and not the cheap syrup type like dunkin donuts and mcdonald's , real fresh fruits are being used . the smoothie i ordered was delicious and the lemonade was given to my coworker who really enjoyed it . it's only order and go as there is  no room to sit but folks don't mind at all during the breakfast and lunch break . as the weather starts to get colder i am really not  sure if they will stay open or shut down for a few months but as for now this is my smoothie and juice spot and maybe i will try a bubble tea or some other sweet treat on my next visit ."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2020-05-31,5.0,"Stopped by this location to quench my thirst. I usually make my own smoothie at home post yoga workout but didn't have time due to meeting my friend early at Bryant Park.
So many great options to choose from.. i was really craving a nonfat smoothie with vanilla yogurt and apples.
But....I make that every day at home and decided to explore other options.
I chose Jie's AMG: a lovely tonic of mint, ginger and apple. It is delicious and refreshing. It tasted very similar to the Joint Helper I order at Cocoa Grinder in Bay Ridge.
I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the establishment and the decor.
The customer service was on point. Love the straws.
Only impediment: patrons should be allowed to use restrooms. I understand the lockdown, but this location had its two front doors wide open, germs indeed."

The juices taste so fresh and delicious. 
So far our favourite Cafe. 
They also serve coconut yogurt. It has been hard to find somewhere lactose intolerant friendly in the food space. 
Great little place."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-10-14,2.0,"Quite a below average ""juice place"". They are charging $8 for a 12 oz. juice/smoothie/shake. That's kinda ridiculous. The ingredients in the Power Shake are literally so simple: strawberry, banana, and vanilla milk. But it's $8. And the wait was like 15 minutes. They only have one or two people making everything and taking orders.

Taste was great actually, but the ingredients are so simple. You can go to a nearby starbucks and get something cheaper and better probably."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2020-01-01,4.0,Overpriced but very good. The smoothies are $8 for a small and that's across the board whether you order a basic banana strawberry or the delicious vegan smoothie with figs in it.  The people were not overly friendly at this location either.  They also sell a great cup of Joe.  There's many locations in the city and some have a different vibe than others but if you're on the go and happen upon Joe and the Juice it's always a safe bet and enjoyable.
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2020-02-14,3.0,"If your blood sugar is running low, come here and get the banana and peanut butter shake to get some energy for running around the park. It's a little on the pricy side but they whip the drinks out quickly and have some comfy couches in the front to relax on and people watch."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-11-25,4.0,We are visiting New York and were looking for a good fresh smoothie type place. We found Joe and the Juice on Yelp and decided to try it out. I am very happy with our decision to come here. I got the Pick Me Up juice which was very fresh and tasty. My colleague got the Joe's Identity veggie juice which he enjoyed. The one issue is that the prices are a bit high. The ambience is very nice inside as well which is a plus. I would come back here if the opportunity arises.
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-09-18,4.0,I just dropped by for lunch. I liked my chicken club. I thought the sandwich tasted very fresh and I loved the texture of the bread. The place was clean and had some cozy seating options. The only thing I would have liked was a water station so I didn't have to keep going back to the cashier for more water.
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2020-02-11,1.0,"Absolutely embarrassing that this place charges $4.57 for three sips of watered-down ""cold brew."" It's commonplace to see cold brew priced at over $4 in New York, so I didn't think much of it at first. But how the barista handed over this tiny cup of watery coffee with a straight face is beyond me. Instant buyer's remorse before it even reached my hands, which only increased after the first sip. Just, wow."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-06-17,3.0,"Good for what it is...Starbucks, but instead of coffee, it's juice and smoothies. They're pretty decent and tasty, but pricy.  The strawberry banana vanilla smoothie I had was suspiciously sweet, and probably not really healthy at all. 

People with laptops taking up tables without buying anything or buying one small item, then claiming the table for the next hour or so is always annoying, especially at busy times.  A third of the tables were inhabited by these creatures when I went, meaning you're forced to stand there or take away."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-10-04,4.0,"Not sure why Joe & the Juice doesn't have at least four stars all around. I ordered The Choco shake two days in a row and would order it every day if I lived close. The only draw back was the price and the semi-unfriendly bunch of dudes working behind the counter but in my opinion, the flavor and creaminess of the  shake and location alone made my experience a good one!"
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-07-21,4.0,"Having recently returned to the New York City area, I recognized Joe and the Juice which is one of my favorite juice spots in New York City. I grabbed a juice from there and realized I had never before Yelped about them. I work the same event every year right across the street from this location on 6th ave. I went there twice while I was there, one day I got the herb tonic which is one of my favorites and the second day I went and ordered the Joe's club. I think their sandwiches are so good, very heavy on the bread but a delicious and quick option. They give it to you in foil so that you can eat it on your way back to work if you're in a rush. I remember the Herb Tonic being a little bit more spicy and flavorful the last time I ordered it. This time it was a little bit more sweet and less spicy. It felt like there wasn't enough herbs, if you will. Overall, I love the attitude of the employees. They are so chipper and welcoming and kind to you. It's really nice to receive that kind of a service in such a hustle and bustle city. Overall, I would definitely check out Joe and the Juice. They have locations worldwide"
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2020-02-27,1.0,"This place is the biggest rip off I've ever seen, and I've lived in nyc for 30 years! I ordered a large Go Away Doc and asked for lemon. They gave me a half full cup and charged me $12!!! Not to mention they filled half of it with ICE!!!! ICE!!! It's 30 degrees out and it's a health juice. I hope this place closes. I work in the area and I will do my part to steer people elsewhere. Shame on them."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2018-07-16,3.0,"The wait here is insane. At 7pm in midtown things are normally quick and empty, but not here. To no fault of the staff working, they were busting out stuff left and right, but they need one more person to make this run efficiently. They don't have time to rinse out the blenders because the wait gets so long, they still have pulp from the juices prior- not good for allergies.

Honestly too expensive for the service. 

Hire more staff/ have more staff per shift so that they have a chance to succeed."

727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2018-02-04,4.0,"Went to my first Joe & The Juice a year ago in Iceland of all places.  Probably not so crazy since they started in Sweden or Denmark or somewhere.  Since there was one next to my hotel in Reykjavik, I went EVERY day for breakfast.

Fresh juices are hard to beat but I go for the ginger latte...a good quality, smooth latte with a shot of fresh juiced ginger added.  The ginger adds a spicy bit of heat that is oddly compatible with a latte.  Who knew?

""Handmeals""...sandwiches to you and me...have fresh ingredients on this cool bread that is a cross between a Ry-Krisp cracker and bread.  I like the Joe's Club which combines chicken breast, avocado, pesto, and tomatoes.  I add jalapenos for an extra taste kick.  Other sammies include fresh mozzarella so there's that.

I was so happy to see they were in NYC and, like in Iceland, were just a block from my hotel.  Having recently opened in Chicago, I'll be sure to share the Joe's love here and introduce others to this cool, hip, slightly offbeat chain of deliciousness."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2018-02-14,4.0,"Went to my first Joe & The Juice last week, as I have seen it all over New York and had to try it. I ordered the ""Stress Down"" which was really good, but had too much ginger towards the end. I think thats natural in any juice though. In addition, I ordered the Joe's Club sandwich and found it DELICIOUS. I loved the bread it was on too! 

The cool thing about Joe's is they give you a macros breakdown of the food you are ordering on their website. It is a pretty health conscious place, which I also like. I watched them make my juice and it was all natural fruits used, so that was reassuring. 

The only thing I didn't like about Joe & The Juice is the price. It is way too overpriced for the food/juice they offer. For two people, our 2 stress downs and 2 Joe's Clubs were around $40, which is approx $20/person. That is crazy to me."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-07-14,4.0,"Joe & The Juice seldom disappoints and that applies to the Bryant park location just as well as any other. The decor is exactly what you would come to expect from this brand: modern, grungy and chill. Caught between the crowds of time square and grand central, this is a fine escape on 42nd street. And an added bonus is that seats are usually available, with a few exceptions. Now onto the drinks!

Being a chain, the menu is standardized but that doesn't make it any less awesome! Some favorites include Go Away Doc and the Avo Shake. 

Pro-tip: add some ginger to your next order and experience how it can energize and lift your day!"
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-02-28,1.0,"I came here to meet a friend and grab some tea around noon on a Wednesday. I walked in and snuggled into one of the bigger chairs in the corner.

I asked the guy at the front if he knew the WiFi password and had a fork -- no fork but WiFi password was given. I had just sat down and was setting up my iPad and lunch when one of the cashiers came over and rather loudly and rudely said that he thought it was rude of me to come in and take a spot in their cafe without ordering anything. 

First of all, I had just sat down. He didn't know if I was intending on ordering something, at all. I explained that I did intend on ordering tea, but wanted to warm up and set up my space first. He said ""okay yeah, because it's during the lunch hour and it's already busy so if you're taking the spot of a paying customer, I would have to ask you to leave"". I reassured him I would in fact be purchasing tea and wouldn't have sat down if I wasn't. It was incredibly rude and disrespectful for him to even assume that. The cafe that was ""busy"" had several empty nooks and crannies available and the fact that I left to find a fork and came back to the still pretty empty area, attests to that it wasn't yet busy. Even if it was busy, a Starbucks or other cafe would not hound it's customers like that. Additionally, there was an interview taking place where cycles of people would come through and speak to the interviewer. Neither the interviewees nor the interviewer had purchased something and was sitting right in front of the register. From what I saw, there was no scolding or yelling.

Just because I'm a black woman, doesn't mean I deserve to be treated this way.

I ordered my tea from him, who smugly looked over and handed it to me and I sat in the corner waiting for my friend who ordered the strawberry milkshake. As soon as we were done with our conversation I left, vowing never to return and give my business to another ""Joe and the Juice"". I had a terrible experience with the customer service here."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2018-07-10,3.0,"Refreshing and light. A bit overpriced for juice though (around $7) for a regular 12 oz. I love the decor and speedy service. Gets pretty crowded and loud during lunch time. 

I ended up ordering the Prince of Green (cucumber, lemon, and pineapple). I only wish the juice was slightly cold."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-02-18,3.0,"Tried juice there for second time. Despite the fancy or funky names, their juice was sugary, and not thick enough. May be something wrong with the formula. I prefer the smoothie/juice at Equinox shop."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-03-16,2.0,I don't know why I keep giving this place more chances. Consistently disappoints. Crappy attitude from the people that work here. Like they're doing you a favor. Boo this place. At least the music is good.
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-07-01,1.0,"I went here on June 30 for a quick smoothie before pride and I would avoid at all costs & take your business somewhere where you are appreciated! I saw the bad reviews too and thought, ""I'm desperate, I want a smoothie, this is close."" but I was so wrong!! I walked in and the ONE guy working at the counter was taking his time, checking his phone, making a smoothie without gloves and ignoring the three people in front of me. It was very unsanitary. After finishing the smoothie, he announced quietly that ""My replacement isn't here so I'm closing"" and it was 11 am!!! The amount of laziness and disregard for customer care was definitely felt and I was so upset. It was a complete waste of time and please take your business elsewhere. I too thought it was worth ignoring bad reviews, but really we deserve better than this place in midtown!!"
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2018-08-04,4.0,"Had really good coffee here, they have interesting options. The service is slow only due to the amount of customers they get but it's adequate. I've never tried the juices but I've heard they're pretty good!"
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-01-06,5.0,"I wanted to get a cappuccino and we found this place near the overly-crowded Starbucks.  So happy we stopped in!  I can't comment on anything else on the menu, but I can say that my cappuccino was was excellent!  And no long line!  Healthier options here too.  The juice selections on the menu are very unique (""herb tonic"", ""turmeric shot"", young blood"", ""sex me up"", ""hell of a nerve"", etc).  There are shakes, yogurts, healthy ""shots"", sandwiches and lots of coffees.  I will stop here again and again next time I'm in the City."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2018-06-15,5.0,"Love this place! Stopped in here while walking around the area near our hotel a couple weekends ago and loved the smell of fresh-pressed juice. Unfortunately, they were busy and the group I was with did not want to wait, so we left and I ended up going back the next morning to get my fix. I ordered a Green Guardian, and felt it was a little too sweet, but it was fresh and almost exactly what I was looking for (I tend to like the more bitter, alkaline, vegetable-tasting juices). I also ordered a regular black coffee for my hubby. I was pleased with the dairy-free options and brown sugar packets for coffee, and my hubby felt the coffee was good. Strong, but good.

Besides the actual beverages, the truly notable thing about my experience was the absolute efficiency and speed that the two guys working in the place exhibited. I have never, ever, anywhere in the US, had a fresh green juice produced, before my eyes, in a matter of minutes. Usually it takes 10 to 15 minutes, unless the juice was pre-made and served out of a refrigerated container. I was totally impressed. The coffee of course was just poured from the pot, but it was freshly made and you could smell it. The entire transaction, from ordering to walking out the door was literally 5 minutes. I still can't believe how fast it was. 

I would definitely recommend and I will look out for their locations on my next trip to the city."

Still trying to understand why the reviews aren't all that great. 
I had a tuna avocado sammy and it. Was. Amazing. The best crispiest flattest toasty bread. With a warm cup of joe and a tumeric shot! 
Everything will be priced high but this was reasonable. Honestly no complaints and the ambiance is beautiful and very NY typical. Loved it."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2020-01-17,2.0,"Delicious hot chocolate (as far as I can tell by my niece and nephew's faces).  Unfortunately I was immediately greeted with rudeness by the tall, thin guy with a goatee working the front.  Before I could say hi to him, he lifted his arm dismissively and pointed me to another person.  Upon complaining to the register attendant who told him my complaint, this guy and another employee laughed and said ""white people.""  I won't deny that perhaps these people have been through something and that I'm a white guy, but I came in ready to tip, and left disappointed.  I understand racism exists but I'm floored this was taken there, solely because I objected to rudeness.  Think twice before you come here.  Sincerely, discrimination attorney who represents marginalized people every day."

727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-12-20,1.0,"We stopped here when I went to new york city recently. I ordered an açaí bowl and the man who took my order was very rude. The açaí bowl was straight up soup and not good,very overpriced for the small amount that was the bowl. The workers seemed like they could not care less about any of the customers. When my friend asked where the spoons were, they looked offended that she interrupted their conversation. They don't accept cash which is understandable. Overall, I would not go back due to the poor customer service."

727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2016-08-02,2.0,"Decided to try this coffee spot since I work close to Bryant Park. 

A very weird coffee shop. Blasting techno music when you walk in. I got a large regular iced coffee, $3.54. The coffee was super watery and extremely bitter. Almost tasted like dirt. I will NOT be returning. 

Extremely disappointed because the place looks inviting from the outside. Lots of seating and friendly staff. Oh well."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-10-09,4.0,"I love that these exist, mostly for the food and smoothies. It'd be great if the people who worked at this location knew how to make coffee as well."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2019-05-02,1.0,"Once visited and the worker was sarcastic and rude and messed up my sandwich. Then the next time ordered a latte, waited 25 minutes- they realized they forgot to make it only once I reminded them

If you're looking for a quick fix avoid this location at all costs"
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2018-01-09,4.0,"I really love the juices here! I am a big fan of the Sports Juice (pineapple, apple and passion fruit). The staff at this location and at the Wall Street location has always been super nice. I would recommend getting their loyalty cards if you come here often enough since it would save you a few bucks on the juice. I got the$80 card for large juices and shakes. The juices themselves are around $10 + tax, so it would save a few dollars if you are a regular. 

They have coffee here, which is a bit cheaper than other places. However, depending on who makes it you can end up getting an actually latte or a lukewarm coffee with milk added. I would stay away from the coffee unless you know who's making it or you absolutely needed one."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2017-10-02,4.0,"Solid juice and coffee café conveniently located right across from Bryant Park. 

Love the design of this place. It's a little dark with the furniture and flooring, but the natural light coming in makes you feel warm and cozy.

I ordered the immunity which was really tasty. I feel like when you go to juice places, they add a lot of extra sugar which creates a weird film over your teeth (I'm looking at you Jamba Juice), but I didn't get that from here.

Staff is super friendly and make your order really quick.

While I appreciate the tunes (shoutout to playing Kanye West!), the music is a little loud. I don't think this would be the best place to go if you're trying to get work done and are sensitive to noise.

Seating is limited since most of the tables were taken when I was there, but it's not a problem if you plan on taking your drink to Bryant Park."
727,joe-and-the-juice-new-york-5,2016-04-25,4.0,"I just notice this place that had recently open a few weeks ago and have been wanting to try them since. So today I got my chance and I walk in and a notice a little lively atmosphere to the place and a younger crowd when compared to say Starbucks.

The counter guys and barristers are all young and on the good looking side and I remained of Abercrombie and Fitch if they ran a juice joint. Maybe they should just take off there t-shirts because I can see the ladies coming in here for some eye candy to go with their energy shots. The company is international and is pushing a socially conscience hipper vibe and look to themselves, is it real or just good marketing by a vampire squid venture capitalist, well you decide.

They have lots of juice and shacks options along with lunch time sandwiches that are on  grilled bread that's imported from Denmark.  I looked over the coffee section and notice the Organic Ginger Latte and that's what I got. They handed me a pinkish purple cup with a heart design made on the foam, it's was so cute.

It's a good thing I reek Machismos all over me and have no problem walking midtown with a big pink cup. Hey throw in a poker dot straw and a little daisy to put behind my ear. I'll walk with one of those 5 gallon protein jugs later just in case theirs any questioning of my manhood.

The Ginger Latte tasted real good, not that I want it every day now, but maybe if I'm feeling under the weather than this could be a good thing to have for the therapeutic properties of the ginger. I will end up passing this place a lot so I probably will be checking now and again."

Not only is it convenient, but it's great value for the price. $2 excluding tax, which is extremely a rare find around the city. They had their famous banana bread and brownie samples which were great tasting. I got their chai latte which was super tasty. Great and timely service. For those of you wondering if they have place to sit dowthey do have 4 bar stools.

Keep coming back for their chai latte and the exceptionally courteous - Anna! Thank you for great service always!"

I grabbed an almondy and checked in for a free iced coffee. The almondy was rich, chocolately, sweet, slightly salted and topped with crunchy almonds. 

I'm eyeing that Nutella shell. Will be back tomorrow!"
728,matto-espresso-new-york-21,2019-08-09,5.0,"Yo, the bottom line is $2 for every item. This is not a gimmick! And the food is actually good!

Today I ordered a cafe latte and an almond croissant for breakfast. The latte, tasted great, but is small in size but yeah its $2.

I really liked the almond croissant after I heated up in the office and added one of those tiny containers with jelly. The entire pastry was sweet, flaky, and buttery with deliciously sweet with my fillings on the inside. 

The place is stand up or go like many of the Mattos I been seeing.

I am not sure how they keep their prices so low but the service is amazing and I hope they put one near Lexington or 3rd Avenue near 50th Street, (hint,hint) cause I am beginning to love Matto , hey is that a guy or girl on the sign ?"
728,matto-espresso-new-york-21,2019-10-24,5.0,"How can you go wrong w $2+ tax set pricing for anything in the shop in NYC? Just saying, I love that I'm not paying extra just for having oatmilk in my latte instead of regular milk. 

Their coffee is good, their food options plenty too! Like come on....an egg croissant for $2 is a steal! They also have a variety of pastries offered like banana bread, cookies, etc. 

In the fridge there are 1L Evian bottles of water, kombucha and oatmeal that you can also buy for guess what.... $2!! 

Oh also their service is quick, nyc style you're pretty much in and out even if there is a line. The staff is nice too.

P..S Yelp check in gets you a free coffee any size and yes they have gluten free donuts for the hipster crowd ."

Chilled there for three hours drinking my coffee and never felt rushed out or like it was too loud. But why did they cover up all the outlets? If you pay for a drink, why can't you charge? Seems like a low move to keep customers moving out of there. So bring a battery pack, grab a seat upstairs at the communal table or at your own table, and enjoy that lovely Starbucks brew. 

No bathroom from what I could discern."

Free WiFi and a nice upstairs seating area. Not many outlets that I could find up here but to have them covered is lame.

Service was quick and friendly. After all, I just got an iced coffee. Can't screw that up too much.

Better spot to wait for a train than the Penn Station locations if you have some time to kill since it's close by.

Viewed a couple breaking up across from me. This gal dumped her dude and walked out on him after some deep conversation. Ah, the human drama that is NYC. Pop up entertainement! It is Spring break up season after all - gotta be single for Summer time shares and roof top partying!

I wanted to order and she kept responding say we don't have this and when I asked for the options they had and asked I didn't want the caramel drizzle she responded with say that a different drink and was very dismissive.

It's Christmas morning and they're going nuts trying to get everyone their specific coffee and food requests, and they do it promptly and with smiles! I think I was personally impressed so much because of the date as well as the friendliness. They even offered to make me a whole new drink when I asked if they could warm my coffee a bit more. Anyplace can have a microwave, but personal warmth is rare.
A few customers were having drink disasters and spilling their coffees all over the floor, and the cleanup was very prompt too. I really liked the upstairs seating area, I'd hang out there a lot more if I lived or worked closer. Overall a very nice find!"

Skip this Starbucks at all cost, definitely worth walking another block or two.  Sitting here by the one outlet I found with my ear buds in to dampen the loud music, stuck here due to battery status or I would have peaced!"
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2016-06-12,5.0,"I always have a pleasant experience at every Starbucks that I go to. The baristas are always smiling and friendly. If I can't decide on a particular drink and I give them the few that I'm deciding between, whomever is helping me will help me decide."
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2012-05-30,2.0,"It's Starbucks, I'm here ALL the time since I'm a gold member. This particular store isn't my favorite.  They were training people the few times I was here, so service was slower and the guy taking orders at the cash register looked so confused if orders were anything more than the typical ""iced caramel macchiato.""

The drinks are a sweeter than other places, and I don't like my drinks too sweet.  Even when I asked them to cut the pumps in half, the drinks were still too sweet! Eh, that's the one think that irks me about Starbucks.  Really good espresso and coffee, but stores across America are lacking in taste and consistency."
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2014-03-16,2.0,"As i write this, the stench of a homeless man makes me type faster so I can get the hell out of here.

Although the layout of this place is awesome, patronage enforcement is non-existent. Half the people here haven't bought anything, and of those, half of them smell.

Stay away. Your nose will thank you for it."
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2013-09-04,3.0,"This Starbucks was the closest to my conference area while in NYC so it was a staple each morning. Drinks were standard, staff was friendly. My issue was that the hours on the door stated that they open at 6:30am, however, there were 2 mornings (out of 5) that the staff was inside and the doors were locked, and they yelled that they were not open yet. HUH? I wasn't thrilled to go to the Dunkin Donuts for my morning coffee fix but had to anyway. 

Oh well... Starbucks, get your hours straight and/or your morning routine so that you can open on time for those of us who need you to start the day."
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2013-07-17,4.0,This is one of the larger Starbucks stores in NYC and it's conveniently located close to Penn Station and the Boltbus stop. The service early in the morning was friendly and quick and it was a good place to kill time by using their free wifi before waiting for my 7:00 AM bus.
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2015-11-11,5.0,I look forward to going here every morning  before work. The service is amazing! Always a friendly greeting!
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2016-04-05,5.0,They always have the friendliest employees!! So nice. I always go to the Starbucks over the ones in Penn Station.
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2015-12-25,4.0,It has plenty of sitting arrangement upstairs. I could not find an outlet for charging.
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2013-03-25,4.0,"Starbucks is known for...

Free Wifi

Free wall outlet assuming they aren't plugged up like the ones at Barnes & Nobles (booo...two thumbs down).

Good coffee

Artistic clientele

Musical chairs/sofas as you are trying to snag a seat while not losing your coffee order in the process

Free Clean bathrooms (I think people take advantage of this a little too much.  At least buy a mint or something).

I came here to ""rehearse"" with my scene partner.The second floor is where all the seating is, mostly chairs and tables but very private and quiet for the most part.  I think I was the loudest one of the bunch on that night.  Sorry folks. lol

Oh and they are Groupon friendly as I did purchase on the other day and used it on my mobile app. 

Cool beans, coffee beans that is. = D"
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2015-03-03,1.0,By far the most racist staffed location.  I was clearly in front of the line and this cashier skipped me to take an order for a caucasian woman.  I asked why I was skipped and was told she was waiting in line before me when that clearly wasn't the case.  How did I know this?  Because I was in front of her!  I immediately left and took my business elsewhere.
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2013-05-02,4.0,Larger than standard Starbucks. Employee working the line made for a very short waiting time. Extra bonus: there is an upstairs seating area with lots of chairs and tables.
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2012-11-15,4.0,"This Starbucks location is notable because it has a large loft area where you can park with your laptop and work while sipping java. This actually saved me recently when I was running a bit late for a conference call. I popped into this Starbucks, opened up my MacBook, and was able to work for a while. Sure, this location is near the bustling Penn Station area of NYC, which can be a bit crowded and out of control-- however, there's plenty of eye candy around. =) But, all good things come with price, right?"
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2013-03-20,3.0,"The service is solid and the drinks are the standard Starbucks drinks.  The seating here is actually decent and not overly crowded, and the store itself is clean.  It was 10 pm when we got there so it might be a different story during morning rush hour."
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2017-02-12,1.0,customer service was awful. she had an attitude about the number of drinks I was ordering and then refused to accept my method of payment. am very disappointed and likely will not be back.
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2012-12-21,2.0,"Like I mentioned when i checked in here. 2 barista's, 20 customers waiting, its not how you run a coffee shop the weekend before Christmas."
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2014-08-05,3.0,"This place is wayyyy too busy and very slow. I ordered three drinks, they handed me 1 without whipped cream even though I ordered it WITH, and then handed me two frapps. I walk out and realize they handed me someone elses cup. The hell. So I come in and hand it back. I felt sorry for the person whose cup it was, I'd hate that happening to me and felt upset at them for saying my name and handing two cups as if both were for me."
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2012-09-18,4.0,"Really quick service! I came here at around 9am. The line was incredibly long. But, they took my order while waiting in line. The line moved quickly and once I paid, they literally handed me my drink right after. LOVE IT.

I've found that starbucks in the city are a hit or miss (ex: the one on 32nd and 2nd...i hate you.) This one was clean, efficient, and spacious. And now that PSLs are here, I'll be coming here more often :D"
729,starbucks-new-york-335,2015-12-13,1.0,There is only one electrical outlet for charging phones. Isn't this half the reason for going there?
730,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-7,2020-02-16,5.0,Real Italian espresso and desserts.  Love this place.  Just like you would find in Italy.
730,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-7,2017-12-06,4.0,"Ugh this place is awesome 

The guy in the morning is amazing!

All of their treats look delectable too btw, plus biscotti and little Italian cookies galore

Sad I don't work in this building anymore bc I miss my morning Americanos from here :/"
730,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-7,2019-03-18,5.0,"Perfect spot for a pick-me-up coffee and biscotti or panini!
This coffee shop is right inside the corporate building on park and outside the subway so I always get my cappuccino fix in here before heading to work.
The barista knows how to make their coffee and the little delights in the jars are almost impossible to avoid."
730,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-7,2017-10-11,5.0,"This is my favorite coffee shop when I get my buzz at least 3 times a day. The espresso is amazing but if espresso is to much you can have a traditional Americano which is similar to drip coffee. Cappuccinos are mad with love served by well dressed and highly trained baristas.  Croissants are baked in the house and are sooooo good!! 

This location is inside the Lobby of  1 Park Ave , try it and you won't be disappointed."
730,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-7,2019-03-11,5.0,"Yep!  It is that good!  Head here for a perfectly pulled espresso served up by a friendly barista.  Zibetto is tucked back in the beautiful lobby of 1 Park Avenue.  Don't stop at the desk, just walk straight ahead and let the security guard know you are there for Zibettos.  You can get a sandwich for lunch, a biscotti to go with your espresso or a croissant for breakfast.  This place is a gem and worth a stop in for some serious caffeinated goodness!"
730,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-7,2019-01-09,5.0,"I go to Italy often and the coffee here is even better than most espresso places there. Very authentic, their blend is genius. None of those annoying ""fruity"" notes you find at other espresso bars in NYC. For me this is currently the best coffee the US. 
Also, the baristas are super professional and quality never goes down when it's busy."
730,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-7,2017-09-14,5.0,Oh wow! Zibetto just opened around the corner from where I work. Finally a REAL taste of Italy!  Truly the best Italian espresso bar in the US.
730,zibetto-espresso-bar-new-york-7,2017-09-16,5.0,"This is an Italian Espresso Bar serving premium espresso based drinks. I feel confident in the hands of the well dressed highly trained barista. Stand and relax, sip your coffee in a ceramic cup and enjoy the smooth yet powerful 25 ml espresso!!"
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2016-05-28,5.0,"Newly renovated, Pret is now twice as big and much brighter then before.  There are lots of tables and plenty of outlets.  Very clean and comfortable.  The workers are very nice and cordial.  

The ice coffee is decent and their sandwiches are delicious.  Ordered a hazelnut ice coffee for $2.71.  Plenty of milk (skim, soy, cream) off to the side.  Lots of hot coffee dispensers. 

There was a little hiccup on the charge on my cc and it was corrected fast."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2019-11-08,3.0,"I needed a place to hang out for a bit and my local friend suggested finding a Pret a Manger. There was plenty of seating, free wifi, and very clean tables. The cashier was very friendly.

I was ambivalent about the food, though. $7 for a super thin sandwich that tasted just okay and was mostly bread. 

I would definitely chill in this cafe as a nice place to sit, but if I was just looking for food I would go somewhere else."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2019-11-15,4.0,I like this place. They're all over New York but this one is right near our office so sometimes I'll grab a snack or whatever here. The mornings are a little chaotic but they keep a bunch of registers rolling and move through people quicker than youdthink.since it's so close to our office it offers a great place to grab a coffee and get out w someone if you need
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2019-02-18,5.0,I love going to Pret A Manger and my experience even got better because of Slangi and Theresa. I had an issue with my order and those 2 ladies took care of it swiftly and without hesitation. For a business its so important to have caring employees. Slangi and Theresa are awesome!! Thank you for your help!!
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2019-10-10,1.0,"Stopped by in the morning at around 9 o'clock.  I walked in this place, and couldn't see an explicit line to the registers.  I asked the customers surrounding and was told they were not on the line.  I stepped forward to the THIRD register to see if I could order.  When I tried to speak to the guy, he asked directly to the lady a few steps away to step forward if she hadn't ordered yet.  And the lady said she wasn't online.  So, I guessed I could ask the guy if I could order.  The guy kept asking the customers behind me without looking at me.  He told the customers that I was being held, so he did realize that I was there.  Remember, the guy didn't even look at me for a second and didn't even speak a word to me.  I had been standing there for a minute until he told other customers that I was being held.  EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!  I did ask the customers surrounding and was told they were not online, and PRET, you might at least let me know that I was cutting the line or where the line started.  The guy had been ignoring me for the whole time, this was absolutely ridiculous.  Definitely won't come back!  Bye :)"
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2019-03-15,4.0,"I used to love Pret so much when they still all have these vegan options. Now they have vegetarian options but not very many vegan options. I mostly come for the lentil soup which is absolutely phenomenal, and occasionally I also will have at the açai bowl which is nice and filling in the morning. I really wish they would bring back more vegan options especially salads, the one they have with the falafel balls is just not tasty, the falafel balls are always super dry."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2016-03-20,4.0,"Ready-to-eat food options.

I stopped by for a quick break from work. Never heard of Pret A Manger before so this was a complete random visit.
Usually seeing pre-made sandwich triggers thoughts of 7-11 but this is quite different. Various sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, desserts, and much much more. I grabbed a Lebanese Chicken Flatbread ( Chicken mixed with Lebanese dip, red sauce made with roasted red peppers, sunflower seeds, tamarind, and lemon juice. Topped with fresh mint). For a wrap it was delicious and satisfying.  Too bad I wasn't able to come back to try out some of their other sandwiches. 

I also ordered a coco pot and a ginger beer for good measure. Why not, right? This was a great option to bring back to an office or picnic. 

- They really stress freshness and sustainability. 
- Too bad they don't have one of these by my work in San Diego.
- Not owned by McDonalds, not that it matters but some reviewers gave it a low rating because of that. 
- Ginger Beer could be stronger.
- Will try this place again when I'm back in New York."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2019-02-09,5.0,"Upon arriving you see how spacious this coffee shop is. Ample seating, space to open a laptop and relax while drinking coffee. Bathroom is private and clean. The coffee is very good, minimal flavor options but good nonetheless."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2017-10-23,3.0,"WiFi was down when I went, but they make a mean latte, there's a ton of seating space, and it's really bright and open. Also got their tomato soup, which is always fresh, delicious, and low-calorie! Besides the music being super loud, it's a good spot to spend time on your laptop and get work done."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2018-12-14,1.0,Would you eat this?  There's a large piece of cardboard in between the sandwich and prep was the cashier who handled the sandwich with her hands and placed the sandwich on a used piece of wax paper that she wiped off with a paper towel.
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2016-11-03,5.0,"I visit Pret a manger almost everyday for lunch and I am never disappointed. I have had almost everything here from their tiny little protein pots and granola pots, to their fresh and flaky plain croissant (one of the best in new york city) to their salads, sandwiches and soups. The calorie counts on some of these are unbelievably low for the taste and quality which makes me feel less guilty about eating lunch from here without compromising on taste. I just hope it's true! Heh heh
Anyway, love the place. One can easily tell that they keep their food super fresh (as they claim to). Affordable and awesome! I will keep coming back to you Pret a Manger- keep my seat warm!"
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2017-11-17,5.0,"5 stars for Chike.  The man has poise.  There was a tricky situation that arose with some patrons.  Chike, who was working quite hard on other things, found a way to deftly deal with the issue.  Ensuring pleasant dining experiences for the guests.  
He's also just plain courteous.  The kind of guy who finds a way to not answer a question but add a dose of friendliness to the exchange, too.  Not easy in the hullabaloo of 7th ave.   Thanks."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2017-03-18,1.0,"The attitude of the man working the front counter really got to me and his aggression almost ruined 10 minutes of my day. 

They have a credit card machine with a chip reader, so I put it in. He told me to swipe my card instead, so I swiped. I swiped a few times, but it wasn't working. 

He got an attitude with me and said "" I TOLD YOU TO SWIPE, YOU HAVE TO SWIPE, TAKE YOUR CARD AND SWIPE IT IN THE MACHINE"" I say, ""I did swipe"" then he says ""TAKE YOUR CARD AND SWIPE IT IN THE MACHINE, IF IT SAYS TO SWIPE, SWIPE, MISS I ALREADY TOLD YOU, IT ISNT THAT HARD, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME"" super hostile and rude. Forget this place, the food sucks anyway!

After I left, I calmed myself down and realized his job isn't fun and he probably deals with mean people all day. He's taking it out on customers."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2017-08-30,1.0,"I rarely file complains to a store, but I surely didn't appreciate the store manager treat me as if I am a cheap customer who just didn't want to pay her salad.-`´-
No, I go not because ""I don't like the way the PRET lettuce work""
No, I go not because ""I don't like small yellow dots on the leaves""
And surely not because ""Exchange for A new salad？or what？refund？""

I had already spoken with the customer servics and I brought it over just for the store reference so other customer will not experience the same horrify lunch time like me -`´-

I am not some crazy people who spend $10 starve herself for the whole afternoon just so she can have her $10 back.... It doesn't even make sense！

Anyway, I m very disappointed at the store, so I told the customer service just gave me back My salad money and no more cause I think I will rarely go to PRET again."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2018-06-18,5.0,"Everything usually taste pretty fresh and tasty. The price point is decent. Service is usually pretty friendly and fast. And their cookies and baked goods are amazing

Great for portion control, if you don't want to eat a full sandwich.  Great vegetarian options. Great for breakfast lunch or a quick dinner (or snack). 

Love their ginger beer, cucumber soda, chips, cookies, croissants, sandwiches and wraps, soups and, when they have it, mac & cheese"
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2016-03-18,5.0,"Huge fan of Pret! 

-always fresh food
-organic
-not too small not too big sizes
-vegan/vegetarian options
-friendly staff
-AMAZING FOOD!


Just going to keep it short and sweet, love this place!"
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2018-10-31,3.0,Cashiers don't give receipts; they should ask whether you want one or not. Sometimes it is hard to look for what you want on the shelves when the staff are constantly standing in front of them stocking items. Prices can be a little high. Food is ok; fresh but a little bland.
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2014-10-15,4.0,"It's been a while since I visited a Pret and I'm happy to report that the sandwiches are still fresh. 

I tried the Vietnamese Chicken Baguette and it was just what I wanted. The baguette was pretty crunchy and not soggy, the amount of Sweet Chili mayo was great and gave the perfect kick, and the chicken was nice and fresh. 

The service at the register was prompt. Pret is definitely on the pricier side but the quality is great and it's Manhattan. Will be back for sure."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2018-05-11,3.0,"I love Pret , I love their menu, used to at least . Now it seems that most of the dishes includes bell pepper, which unfortunately I am unable to eat, but it's my own thing an d I would never judge company for it . However, the problem is , whatever you are purchasing you are not guaranteed will be what you buying. How many time did I get avocado / chicken salad , which is missing one or another ingredient. Today it was avocado .. like really ? It's in the name of the salad. I used to buy chicken burrito , but than they suddenly changed ingredients.. I also bought few times hot wraps marked as chicken burrito, but it was something else. One time I actually returned it , because it had blue cheese in it and I could not eat it.. again i love pret for quality and taste, but you have to check and double check what you are getting ... consistency is not something you can expect from Pret .."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2016-06-13,3.0,"I come here a lot to just grab a quick breakfast or lunch. What's convenient about  Pret is that quality is consistent, you know what you're getting, food is not overly greasy, and the nutrition information is very clear. 

The reason why Pret is 3 stars is mainly flavor. There are other places that can achieve both healthiness and flavor but unfortunately, many of Pret's sandwiches fall a little short. The chicken avocado sandwich tends to be a bit soggy and the burrito tortillas are strangely dry and stale. 

I do recommend the yogurt pots though. They are quite tasty and have a lot of textural contrast."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2016-11-02,3.0,"This is a great place to work at, as they have many outlets for phone and computer chargers. The food goes from delicious to horrible, depending on your selection. Some of the sweets are old and dry, when they're not past their expiration date. The sandwiches are always very fresh and pretty good. This place is quite big and it's easy for homeless people to walk in, grab something and go. The employees are always busy doing things behind the counter and won't help if someone took your things. Keep an eye on your personal stuff and be aware of the side street entrance. 
It is a very popular spot so finding a place to sit is a challenge, but if you're patient, you'll find your space. You might have to clean it yourself, but it'll be yours for a few hours."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2017-09-15,2.0,"I go here more than I care to admit, can't figure out why the Parisian style eatery insists on playing pop music to only further add to the noise pollution of the cashiers and barista yelling at each other back and forth about orders.  Today there's a cashier in a pink sleeveless tank and a hair net no uniform top no baseball hat, do I really need to see someone's underarms as I'm having my lunch packed up?  I love the Bircher muesli in the am and  I'm trying to lobster roll for lunch, food is good convenience is great but atmosphere and how the front end interacts with customers and staff is a far cry from anything you'd see in Europe."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2013-08-15,4.0,"Love this place for a fast, easy, but still delicious lunch.

Pret is technically a chain but their food is always fresh. They have a lot of healthy options including sandwiches and salads.

My favorite is the Cheddar, Avocado with Spinach & Kale sandwich.

Not super cheap, but won't break the bank. A great lunch option for the Midtown area."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2017-01-27,4.0,"Pret is a great alternative to unhealthy fast food such as Mcdonald's. They use organic and lot of products and they are freshly made each day. They have pretty good coffee and everything from salad, hot food, to pastries. I love the coconut yogurt here. They have 2 kinds the blueberry and plain. Both are amazing but if you get plain put honey on it. The best part is that it is gluten and dairy free."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2018-02-05,1.0,I ordered a matcha latte in a regular size and it didn't even get filled but halfways and it was the worst latte I've ever had. Stay away.
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2017-03-03,1.0,"There is this floor manager guy (I think he as that) and I asked him for some hot sauce since it wasn't where it usually is. Instead of telling me they are out of it, he decided to play a little game and went in the back, kept me for like 5 min waiting and then told me they are out of it.
Once he also tried to bs me that most of their food is organic. Pret is considered a junk food place just so you know!
Also the sandwhiches are getting smaller and smaller at Pret, just in case they think they are smart saving money, they are keep losing customers actually because of this.
Just saying, nobody reads this anyways..."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2018-04-10,1.0,The oatmeal is the worst oatmeal I've ever eaten in my entire life! It was soooooo bland and had no flavors! I wanted to throw in pepper or cinnamon because it was that bad so I threw out half of it. Plus the portion that I ate wasn't even filling and oatmeal is supposed to be very filling. I literally thought I was eating baby food that's how bad it was. Never again!
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2017-02-14,4.0,"Food is pristine and counter service people are nice. The speaker music is not blasting insanely loud like some other Pret locations, which is a nice change. There is a lot of space for seating with friends or by yourself. I can forgive the coffee self-service area for being messy, but I grimaced upon seeing some of the seating tables still had crumbs or discarded tissues from previous customers who already left."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2014-11-22,4.0,Better cappuccino than most places.  Baristas were engaging.  I need to try this spot again.
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2016-06-16,2.0,"I used to love Pret A Manger. The food was always fresh and I really liked supporting a company that donated end of day food to food banks and shelters to feel those less fortunate. However, lately my experiences at Pret have been lack luster. The check out process has become too hectic and unorganized and the sandwiches are made with far less meat. Whether its tunafish or chicken I always need to scrape whatever little bit they provide to one half of the sandwich in order to create a moderately satisfying eating experience. It's ridiculous. I don't want to pay $4 - $7 for a plain baguette or a all veggie sandwich. I think my love affair with Pret is over. Never again!"
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2016-11-21,1.0,"For the lunch, I came several times. Cashiers always were so rude and impolite. For the franchise, taste is okay. But staffs should need to be educated for their service. I felt racism at many time. What the fuc* off"
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2014-12-21,5.0,"Adore pret. Always have and always will.
Love everything about them but- the lattes are way too hot. Do be careful"
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2013-12-12,1.0,"Typically this place is a great fast option, friendly staff and a plethora of fresh food choices. After today I will not be returning.

I ordered a soy cappuccino and waited about 10 mins before asking if it was coming up, I was told it was. Another 10 mins later I asked again, they got me a drink but without soy (problem given that I'm allergic to dairy). 

The worst part was the manager asked every other person waiting what they needed except for me. I honestly never complain but I did find it suspicious that I was the only person not asked what I wanted and I was also the only person that wasn't noticeably white. Definitely will not be returning to this location."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2014-04-07,4.0,"Chicken Bang Bang! Such a good wrap. Plus, their salads with salmon are tasty too. 

The staff are usually very friendly and upbeat. They move quickly and get you out of there quickly which I love. 

I go to this particular restaurant 3x a week for lunch."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2013-08-26,4.0,"Fresh sandwiches, soups, toasted hot sandwiches, juices and more!

Probably the best option in this area for healthy and fresh food. Portion size is just right and you have plenty of options. I wish they had more options for toasted / hot sandwiches. Juice opinions are incredible - and is always fresh! 

Friendly service here - always appreciated, but even more in this crazy city."

731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2017-05-01,2.0,"gave it another chance on a chocolate croissant.. what I got was a mush of butter and chocolate.. I think they forgot to leave them in long enough to actually cook. morning rush in this location is a mess, people pushing all over the place, the cashier lines are unorganized, and people waiting for special coffees take up a lot of space as well. wish this was run better. they also always run out of coffee and are slow to replace."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2015-06-15,4.0,"I don't know what my issue was with this place years back. I suppose I was comparing it to deli's where you could get a giant, day crippling meat and cheese sandwich for the same price. This food is good and I feel OK about it."
731,pret-a-manger-new-york-11,2009-04-13,3.0,"hate to burst your bubble - but Pret is owned my McDonald's Corporation.  It is there attempt at high end fast food - and it's not altogether a bad idea.  Most of the sandwiches are freshly made each day and they always have sides, chips and soups - as well as cookies & brownie/bars to snack on.  It's a good quick fix alternative for people on the go.

Try to pick up a sammy early in the day - by day's end bread can get soggy."

delicious cookies
All the sandwiches eventually taste all the same, after eating for 2 years"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2020-06-05,5.0,"Picked up during COVID 19 situation: Ordered food online for pick up since Finn's bagel is very close to our apartment. Only a specific number of people were allowed inside the store, however, the bagels got ready an hour after we ordered them. 

We ordered the Clinton street bagel (which had roast turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato and Swiss and house made dressing) and it was really delicious and fresh-would highly recommend trying this one from the menu! 

The size was good for a single person and I think it was worth its price. 

Thank you for delivering in such tough times!"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2020-03-02,4.0,"We live just across the way from this place so we come pick up bagels whenever we're in the mood for a quick breakfast. Our go to-s are the Finn's classic, pastrami, and blueberry bangels.
Their bagels are pretty sizable, they have a nice chew but they're still light and bready, honestly it's probably my preferred bagel at the moment but I might need to hit up a few more iconic bagel places before I deliver my final verdict lol.
As far as construction of the bagel sandwiches, they definitely load them up! I appreciate the ample amount of cream cheese (I'm a bit of a cream cheese fiend, often ordering 2x cream cheese at other places ) they don't skimp on the lox, toppings, or pastrami either!
My one complaint is that they always seem to be out of something (everything bagel, lox, horseradish smear, ect.- it differs everytime) but I guess it shows that everything is fresh.
The place is always busy on weekend mornings but the service is quick and they do have several tables and a bar at the windows so I'm sure if we wanted to find a seat it wouldn't be too long of a wait. It will definitely continue to be our convenient take-out bagel spot of choice!"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2020-05-26,5.0,"We got a wheat bagel + scrambled eggs and lox bagel to go. They were both incredibly delicious! The bagels were some of the best we've had -- they tasted perfectly fresh and crispy. The service was quick. I just wish they added some salt/pepper to the eggs. They clearly use good quality ingredients, would highly recommend"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-11-26,4.0,"Unassuming little bagel shop in Hells Kitchen which has the best Bialys uptown. Seriously. You can't really find real Bialys anymore let alone fresh ones.

Originally I was going to try a bagel but when I saw they had Bialys with the chopped onion and poppy seed centers I had to order that. The exterior of the Bialy was just right and if you've ever tried a real jewish Bialy from Brooklyn you'd know exactly what I'm talking about.

Brand new place which is spotless and clean.

I'll definitely be back!"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-11-13,3.0,"I am not sure how to rate this place. The bagels are good but they don't have that taste that I remember from my trips to New York. That's not saying that these are bad bagels considering that in my four days there I came here twice. The first time I tried the everything bagel with the lox spread and chives. I was a little underwhelmed with the amount of salmon in it because I was seriously expecting to have lox instead of just little bits of it in the spread but that was my bad and I did not take issue with the fact that was exactly what my server told me to order even though I had described what I actually wanted. But I won't count it against anyone. 

The second time I came I got the Essex street bagel which has pastrami salmon, avocado, chive cream cheese. This was once again very one note. The bagel was untoasted like I remember I should be getting them but the filling itself was just not all that. If I'm in the area and really want a bagel I'll stop by but otherwise it's not some place I'll go to try out of my way."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-09-30,3.0,"SUCH good bagels here. Maybe I have just been deprived of NYC bagels, but I think they are genuinely quality. I got an everything bagel with eggs, and because I got there before 11am I could get a drip coffee for only 50 cents. It was a great deal for an instrammable bagel, although you could probably get better deals at a less trendy place. 

I do wish that they had a larger bagel selection. That, and the very rude customer service are the only reasons that I am giving this three stars. It is New York, so I shouldn't expect people to be nice, but I do appreciate basic manners when I am paying for something. 

Come here once for the hip atmosphere and good bagels, but then go explore the endless other bagel options New York has to offer."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-05-18,4.0,"10th avenue by the port authority is always been a weird location. It seems like nothing is over here but I find myself here sometimes and don't know where to go eat. Luckily I stumbled on Finn's and had to try. 

The place doesn't have a ton of seating but they do have a few tables and window seats. It is a pretty straightforward bagel shop. They have an assortment of cream cheeses and other items to put on a bagel. They also have specialty bagel sandwiches. I went with a toasted sesame bagel with strawberry cream cheese.  It was awesome! A perfect crunch on outside and soft interior. Really great NYC bagel. I also tried the yogurt but the star of the show was the bagels.

Doesn't matter if you are on one of those no carb diets. Have a cheat day and come get a bagel here. You won't be disappointed."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-10-10,3.0,"Stopped by while in the neighborhood to pick up a quick bagel - got a bagel with a little bit of butter untoasted.  The bagel was fine, not the best I've had, but also far from the worst, though with something so simple it is kind of hard to mess up.

The staff was nice, particularly the manager, it seemed.  He was really rallying the staff to keep them positive and moving during a busy time.  The bagel with butter took a little longer than it normally would at a place with less traffic consider, as I said it was a simple order, but it wasn't exceptionally long.

The interior of the restaurant is cute, a couple of tables, and a cute cool aesthetic.  It would be a nice place to sit and grab a bit more of a complex breakfast (compared to a bagel with butter) there."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-12-03,5.0,"Stopped at Finn's for bagels almost every morning while here for a show. The bagels, toppings, and sandwiches are delicious and you get plenty of spread. I particularly enjoyed the veggie cream cheese, which has pretty good sized chunks of veggies in it with an everything bagel. Cinnamon raisin with butter was also popular with my crew. 

The service is quick, the cashiers are pleasant, and it's a short walk from the javits center. Bookmarked."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-10-05,4.0,While on my way to the Javits Center I needed a quick bite. This was the perfect choice.  Little bagel place but very good. Bacon egg on a bagel was perfect. Bagel was soft and tasty. Eggs and bacon cooked well. Coffee was good too. Quick service and friendly staff.
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2020-02-08,5.0,Who's place is great no bagel cream cheese salad all around I put a nice little toaster cream cheese was great had a little bit too much cream cheese out. Little bit of sides that excellent excellent excellent will stop here again for sure good people good food go to it
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2020-01-04,3.0,"Usually try to avoid reviews if only been once and had only one item.  When place is bagel place and have a bagel then feel fine reviewing after having just one.  I came here before getting on bolt bus which boards a block away.  With growth of hudson yards there are more choices in area as I have previously gotten stuff in the javits center.  This is better than that which is not saying much.  Bagel
Was okay but not in sane league as Murray's or Absolute.  Space is very clean and modern.  Have standard selection of bagels and sandwiches.  Had no Snapple which I like  but did have apple juice which I thought was a bit pricey even for nyc.   Bagel with butter was 2.5 which is sadly within nyc prices.  This is okay choice if in area either for bolt bus or some other reason.  They might want to expand selection of bagels and drinks.  Since my first visit they have added tables and give out WiFi password.  Have music playing which might bother some workers."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-09-07,4.0,"We went to visit the Vessel this morning, so we decided to grab a quick breakfast here before our assigned time. This place is only a few minutes walk from the Vessel, so it was super convenient! I ordered a toasted multigrain everything bagel with lox scallion spread since they didn't have regular lox spread at the time. I am a fan of scallion cream cheese and I really really enjoyed the lox scallion spread! My boyfriend ordered the lox, egg, and onion bagel also on a toasted multigrain everything bagel. This was amazing! They really packed in the lox and when we opened up the bagel, it was still steaming! Everything tasted so good and so fresh. Their orange juice was also the icing on the cake. I would say that this place is a solid breakfast spot to check out if you're in the area!"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-06-13,2.0,"Rude disinterested staff. Tried to ask questions and kept just inputting everything for purchase I asked about instead of answering. 
""How are the eggs cooked on s sandwich here?""
Answer. ""Yes"" 
""Do you have cheddar? 
Answer ""What kind of bagel?""
Egg and cheese sandwich on par with any other deli but more expensive. 
 I'll try again but never understand how openly a new place can express lack of attention to caring and details.

Sandwich as served in photo."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-12-21,3.0,Average NYC bagels. The salt bagel was tougher then I imaged it too be so that was disappointing. They seemed to have been out of egg when I was there so that was kind of strange.
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-07-11,4.0,"If you love bagels, then this is the place for you. Their bagels are fresh, and they have a great selection. It is by far, one of the best bagel places that I have been to. 

In the morning, it may be a little bit busy with everyone coming and going for breakfast, but it is worth the wait. They have a great selection of cream cheeses, but we usually just get the regular one. Nothing special on my order."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-07-05,4.0,"Really happy they have dairy-free cream cheese alternatives!! Even though it's kinda pricey, I like having the option out there. It's also super convenient for anyone living in the Hudson Yards area.

Overall, Finn's is solid option for a morning coffee and bagel run."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2020-03-14,1.0,Counter staff is the rudest and could care less. So sorry to bother you by coming in. I wonder what this space will be next.
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-11-04,4.0,"The reason why I hadn't tried this place before was because there weren't many great reviews. I still have yet to find the best bagel place in Nyc but this adorable bagel shop is right in my neighborhood so I thought I would give it a shot. 

The service is truly a bit slow but it's because they really make everything fresh! I ordered the egg, cheese, and avocado on an everything bagel with added lettuce and tomato. You can see them preparing all the bagels in front of you and they are extremely generous with the fillings! All the ingredients are fresh and the bagels aren't bad at all. 

The only thing is they don't have an incredible amount of cream cheese flavors but if you want a classic bagel or sandwich and you have the time, this is a great option."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-04-21,4.0,"Expensive compared to other bagel spots in the city but it was good. I order a bacon, egg and cheese and was satisfied with the taste and cook. The person I was with tried to order turkey bacon and they made a breakfast sandwich with regular bacon and deli turkey meat which was odd. They said it tasted good but for individuals who do not eat pork, make sure you're very clear about your request and check your food before exiting."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-11-30,5.0,Great little bagel spot. Went in for a quick bite before a big event and it was very satisfactory all across the board. Not too pricey and very tasty. You can tell it's a popular spot with house busy it was. Limited seating but works if you're in and out. Would return to try other items!
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-03-22,4.0,"So excited that there's a new bagel shop in the building where I work! 

Today was the soft opening and I ordered a plain bagel with plain cream cheese and it was delicious! 
A bit more cream cheese than I normally prefer but the bagel itself was fresh and toasted. The outside, nice and crunchy with a soft inside. They have the signature bubble texture on the bagel that adds to the crunch. However, one star off for the amount of cream cheese that oozed out every time I took a bite. 

I'll definitely be back to try out more items on their menu!"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-11-27,3.0,Really yummy bagels! Cute and clean inside! The menu on yelp is outdated and some of the items in their printed menu were also outdated. I think the lady today was having a rough morning but everyone else was very nice and food was quick and delicious
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2020-02-18,3.0,"Stopped in Finn's on our way to the Bolt bus so my boyfriend could get a bagel. I was very excited to see they had gluten free and got a gf everything bagel for myself. It was honestly inedible, and I'm not typically too hard to please with gf food. I saw that the bagel came from a bag and was not made by them, which I was fine with...but then the bagel was simultaneously hard and chewy and very bland. My boyfriend enjoyed his poppyseed bagel and would give it four stars, but do not waste your time if you need gf."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-12-28,1.0,"Not sure how you are in business. I had to bag my own coffees, in bags that are far too large and not secure. I asked for bags or something to make them more secure and the lady stared at me and then moved on to whatever else she was doing. Bagels took forever to get. And the staff behind the counter is unfriendly and unhelpful. Will not be returning. I live right here so it's a real shame, was hopeful for a decent bagel spot nearby."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2020-01-19,4.0,"Fresh bagels and really good ham egg and cheese sandwiches but if you want to save money, go elsewhere. This place is pretty pricey ... about $7 bucks for a breakfast sandwich.  Can get packed on a weekend, but service is fairly quick.

732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-11-23,2.0,"I will never come back here. I live right next to this place and have been coming here since they opened. The food is usually OK, way over priced though. The service is seriously lacking they are to busy talking to one another to ever get an order right. There had been numerous times I have ordered a coffee with oat milk and given regular milk which is not great since I'm lactose intolerant...went in today to get two breakfast sandwiches total came to 17 dollars which whatever i can get over that but the sandwiches were completely wrong. I have gotten sick here and now given the wrong food enough times that it is not worth it anymore."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-05-03,4.0,"Olive cream cheese has too few olives.
Good selection and variety.
Price is a tad bit on the high side.
Service was fast.
Bonus is mezze bowl for lunch.

Suggestions: add more olive to the olive cream cheese"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-04-14,4.0,Tasty little bagel shop me and my buddy walked go in manhattan so we can get the experience of a real NYC bagel. Bagels were really cheap especially for the manhattan area and mine was very tasty. I'm not a cream cheese fan so I got mine plain. My buddy ordered his with cream cheese and buyer beware they loaded his bagel with an insane amount of cream cheese.
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-03-27,5.0,Glad to finally have a cute bagel place around this area. They have a solid selection-not expansive- but the classics. I got an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and it was delicious. Excited to go back and try other combinations.
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-12-15,1.0,"I really want to like this place because of convenience, but they NEVER get the order correct. I've waited forever on things they forget to make. Now I use Ritual and they STILL can't get it right.

I would rather go to a less convenient place than deal with this place anymore. Gave them plenty of opportunities but I'm over it; thankfully New York is loaded with far better bagel options than this."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-12-06,4.0,"Great gluten free bagels, fresh food, delivery is consistently on time.  My only complaint is that they always forget ketchup and napkins even when I ask for it."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-08-20,1.0,"on a very hot day, just order some ice coffee - started to drink it in front of the cashier and was done within  2 sec as I realized my glass was full of ice and had no ice coffee at all. I mentioned it to her and instead of being kind, she had the worst attitude so did her co worker and told me next time order it without ice??? She was nasty beyond measure and laughing at me as if it was my fault!!! wont ever come back again as courtesy and respect towards customers should be the principle number 1 at any company/cafe/restaurant"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-10-06,3.0,"Best bagels in the neighborhood, hands down.  However, the women behind the registers are rude, unprofessional and completely self-absorbed.  Thank God for the manager who actually understands how to deal with his customers."
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-10-12,5.0,"Ordered on the Yelp app and it was ready in minutes. Solid black coffee and egg and cheese bagel. Really close to the bus stop and convenient if in a rush, would recommend even if you aren't. the customer service was also phenomenal!"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-10-11,5.0,Avocado on everything bagels were bomb and could easily be shared between two hungry people because they were huge portions. A bit pricey but portions make up for it. Service was friendly and we didn't have to wait much although we came on a Saturday morning.
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-11-19,5.0,"I go here pretty frequently. Their bagels with cream cheese, bagel sandwiches, and pastries are top notch, along with various coffee drinks. I'm getting hungry right now just thinking about that babka. Be sure to stop by if you're in the area!"
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2019-04-06,4.0,New bagel shop that replaced a coffee shop. There isn't much of selection but the bagels are fresh. The sandwiches are pricey but delicious.
732,finn-s-bagels-new-york,2020-02-01,1.0,The worst run bagel shop in New York. Cashier just  stops for 5 minutes to get coffee-leaving a line. And then shoots daggers when she doesn't get a tip. Bagel nothing special either.

I also enjoyed taking a break in nice clean environment in the heart of Manhattan"
733,gregorys-coffee-new-york-36,2020-01-02,4.0,"At this point Gregory's has become a franchise of NYC. Their coffee has supported many a sleep deprived day and first date for me.

I also am obsessed with their version of Rice Krispies which are made with Chex. Yes gluten free but packed with sugar.

Glad to see this space utilized for good and healthy competition with the big green mermaid."
733,gregorys-coffee-new-york-36,2020-01-09,5.0,"Bathrooms, outlets, cute seating, OH MY! This is such a cute spot and I'm glad they added a Gregory's 2 blocks closer to my practice because one can never have too many cold brew options! The staff is super chill, and the tunes are lovely.

733,gregorys-coffee-new-york-36,2020-01-07,5.0,"I am so happy that this cafe is a block away from work! I used to have to walk many blocks to their other locations. I suggest the Spicy Avocado Toast or the Honey Bee Toast. I love their Iced Oat Matcha Latte. The coffee is good too. I love that this place is not as busy as it could be because I can still get a seat. There are outlets underneath some of the chairs. Also!!!! Let's not forget the holy grail, excellent customer service. The nicest and most accommodating people work here. Please be nice to them and tip them generously. Thank you!"

I got their ginger lemongrass tea that, at $3.25, is not inexpensive and was very, very mild in taste. I like that they offer single origin tea options though, it's rare to find. (Though at $3.75, I opted out.)

My biggest issue is that their pastries are not covered and just placed out in the open air. How is that clean? What if someone sneezes? I did get a Swedish chocolate ball that was delicious.

Kaffe 1668, please cover your food and I would love ya!"

My group of 3 ordered a latte, cappuccino, and a drip coffee. I was surprised by the amount of foam I had in my latte and my friend was surprised by the lack of foam in her cappuccino. We even confirmed with the barista for good measure. 

Like many before me have mentioned, this was located in a office space. I would try one of the other Kaffe 1668s, but most likely would not return to this one."
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2018-10-18,4.0,Decent latte with good foam. They have cute cups with sheep. The shop is inside of the office building. It's just a pick up place but there are tables and couches in the lobby of the building. They have milk out if you need extra.
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2015-10-09,4.0,"Who knew 530 5th Avenue hides Kaffe 1668! If it wasn't for the 'Good Coffee' signage outside, I would not be able to guess there's a coffee shop in there. You are to go through the revolving doors, past through the spacious lobby, and the tiny left corner is where you will be greeted by the barista. Daily fresh selection of pastries like cookies and scones are available. Also, you can also buy yesterday's pasties for a discounted price which they do label (we appreciate the honesty!). 

Blueberry-Lemon Glazed Scone was deliciously sweet. To me, the texture is quite different since it is soft even on the outside. It is not dry like it is supposed to be but very tasty. Hints of blueberry are evenly spaced out with a lemony, tarty finish. Interesting!

Cold Brew has a very upfront, in your face dark taste than what I am used to. A terrific wake-me-up choice! 

Alright, I dig it!"
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2017-12-08,3.0,"I wanted to love this place! It's one of those tiny office lobby coffee ships and they have a nice selection of drinks and bites. The barista was really friendly and they have a loyalty program, but unfortunately I just found the drip to be super average, even mediocre.

The Abbreviated Midtown Version


This location is the minime version of the original downtown spot. 
Great strong well crafted coffee, excellent cold brew, without the lounge or additional food. 

Kaffe's first location in Tribeca was a favorite many years ago, consistent, great coffee and over time juices and food. The second location just north of the first had great juices, and delicious healthy things to eat (love this spot). 

Hopefully this location will offer more than just coffee and scones...

734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2018-06-26,4.0,I came here with a friend in order to get some studying and work done. I really like how the crowd here range from business employees to students. Probably because it is in Tribeca + Financial as well as relative distance to Stuyvesant High School. There is a pretty good offer here where coffee is 50% off with the purchase of a sandwich or salad. One of the downsides was the pastry I ordered in this coffee shop. I ordered a biscuit but it was on the bitter side. Coffee and Lattes were fine though!

Everything was good and consistent with its FiDi sister; except that they don't carry many sheep inside the shop due to the limited space, so sad. Besides the regular choices of coffee, they also provide ice tea with variety of flavors and pastries that look delicious. 

One thing: when I ordered americano, they poured the milk for you instead of leaving yourself doing it - so considerate."
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2015-08-10,4.0,"Excellent coffee, but the real star of the show here is the Pour-Over Coffee with three or four fabulous options that change regularly.  

They usually have South American and African coffee bean options, which is pretty amazing considering how small the location is.  I really enjoyed a Burundi one, which is unusual as I normally prefer South American over African coffees and chocolates.  Probably speaks to the quality of the beans they source.

My favorite pour-over coffee spot is still Cafe Grumpy in Chelsea, but to be able to have this option in Midtown, is truly unique.  Plus, as the owners are Swedish, they offer tasty and real (meaning, not processed) pastry options.  My personal favorites are the Swedish Raspberry Biscuit and the Swedish Chocolate Ball (which amazingly does not have any sugar added, but tastes great).

And, on top of all that, the lobby of the office building that the coffee stand is in, is beautiful and has several couch benches and tables that you can sit at and enjoy your coffee.

Really unique space, location and coffee, and beats going to a run-of-the-mill Starbucks."
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2017-03-22,5.0,Great place to grab a tea and snack for a meeting or a lunch date. It gets a bit crowded but great place to study early morning. Love their variety of tea and muffins! The strawberry one is out of this world

Barista seemed annoyed to be alive, though I might feel that way too if I was tucked in a lonely corner with no one to talk to... 

Seating is in lobby so it's not so relaxing, mostly cause the lighting feels sterile. 

Half of the people coming into the building had coffee and there was no one that seemed interested in this cafe.

I got a cappuccino and a Swedish biscuit with jam. 

Coffee was decent - didn't seem burnt, Espresso was a bit sweet for my taste, but good.  

Biscuit was pretty sad, the jam had soaked into the biscuit, would be much better served fresh on the side. Also, biscuit tasted boring and dry... but maybe I just don't like biscuits?"
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2014-12-12,5.0,"I've walked past this teeny café many times and finally decided to stop inside.

This location is in a office building but walk to the back and it's not too hard to spot. There is seating, but it's in a lobby so you can decide if you want to stay or go.

The coffee here is strong and crafted with care. Not to mention, the barista makes a cute heart with the milk! Similar prices to Starbucks but they actually get your order correct! Also, the biscuits with raspberry jam are delicious.

Wednesday's are my favorite because the barista is chipper and accommodating. Going to work on 3 hours of sleep is hard - but the barista had the perfect remedy.  I feel bad I don't remember her name!

Friday's are ok...the guy here is pretty adorable but lacks in the personality range.  I'll still throw a dollar in the tip jar but he really needs to learn that his looks only got him so far with me.

I'll stick to Wednesdays."
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2014-10-07,5.0,"With this sleek little place along with Hole in the Wall Coffee suddenly on the scene, midtown is no longer such an abysmal place for espresso. What these two new awesome coffee shops have in common in that they are both hidden away in the lobbies of 5th avenue office buildings. 

This means they are hard to find, have a small space, and you get a somewhat cold and unwelcome feeling when you first enter. There is also often a bit of a wait since both have like 1 or 2 baristas. However, with all this stacked up against Kaffe 1668 and Hole in the Wall, they still manage to rock just on sheer quality and the absurd awesomeness of their products.

Both have baked goods that are top notch. Kaffe 1668 actually makes all their own pastry and while I was there people were going HAM over the blueberry scones. Kaffe 1668 also has outstanding espresso served in cool dishware and, gasp, actually has a good amount of seating! (It's lobby seating but it's pretty much full of people drinking coffee.)

But of all the things I love about this nutty little spot helmed by a single hard-working barrista, was that they have perhaps NYC's best cold brewed iced tea. I will simply say that this is the best cold brewed tea I have ever had in my life hands down and some of the best tea I have had generally and leave it at that. Please try this if you go here.

And if you do go here, just enter 520 5th Ave and walk straight ahead. You will see a line and, at the end of it, one brave barrista."
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2015-04-11,4.0,"Love the location. Little corner closet of an office lobby on 5th Ave near 42nd St. Don't fret! Yes it's just a corner counter but they have to stay cups and lots of lobby tables and chairs to use. 

I still prefer the two TriBeCa locations. But always nice to have an extra choice midtown here. Of course beautiful silver Synesso espresso machine like the other locations. Plus now they roast their own beans in Red Hook so no more Intelligentsia. 

Love the colorful cups! That hasn't changed in so many years. But my espresso was mediocre this day. Burnt. Hmm. Tasted more like over roasting if anything. But I've had plenty of good shots at the other locations so I would still come back."
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2016-04-07,4.0,Why are all great coffee places tiny and hidden in a building somewhere?! Thank goodness for Google Maps. This place must be the smallest coffee location I've been to but it didn't disappoint. They have great coffee and pastries selections. I was having a rough day so I opted for the espresso shot. It was very dark and bitter but I loved it. I spilled some on my jacket and I smelled like greatness all day. Coffee should be a perfume scent. I want to go back and try the pastries and cold brew. Can't wait!
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2015-09-28,3.0,It was fine. Nothing spectacular. Decent cappuccino.
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2017-06-08,5.0,Great cup of coffee! I like that it isn't too busy. It's located inside an office building (so don't look for a storefront). You could sit in the lobby of you wanted to... Couches look comfortable to work on but maybe awkward to park at for w whole afternoon

As a break from shopping on fifth Ave, my friend and I enjoyed sipping coffee while sitting in the lobby area."
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2014-10-06,3.0,"Can't believe my favorite Tribeca coffee spot has a small location midtown! This popped up on my Yelp app and I was so excited because I love the Greenwich St. locations. This is a scaled down version of the actual coffee shops located in an office building, so don't expect to sit down with you laptop and get comfortable. The downside is that the people working here move slow. I've literally stood at the counter as the barista prepared another customer's coffee for several minutes. All I wanted was a small drip, which takes 2 seconds to grab. If I see a tiny line and just turn around because let's be real, during the day nobody has time for that. The coffee is still great!"
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2015-11-25,2.0,"Very ordinary over priced coffee, that is neither smooth nor clean.  The pour over provided contained substantial sedimentation; which obviously should not be present. Furthermore, the service is slow and disorganized."
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2014-06-04,3.0,"This place has the best espresso in Midtown.  I would like it to be a daily pilgrimage, however they apparently close whenever the employees feel like with no regard for schedule. Today I showed up at 3:45 and they barista said they close between 4 - 5, but had closed early for the day. If you guys stick to a schedule I will be a regular, otherwise I will settle for less."
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2015-08-14,4.0,"Finally tried this Swedish kaffe this morning.  I like it... The coffee reminds me of Stumptown coffee, which isn't a bad thing, as it makes for a good and complex espresso or macchiato, but it wasn't overpowering either.  I had an espresso here, along with a raspberry biscuit and chatted with the barista for a bit.  I could see myself coming here regularly, but the only deterrent is that it's SO tiny.  You can sit in the lobby area of the building and relax, but I like to stand while I'm having my espresso or macchiato and read the NYTimes on my phone, so this is more of a grab-and-go place, especially if it's in the morning.  Nice to have options in this area though for meeting up with clients or other folks that I work with globally when they visit NYC."
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2014-05-12,4.0,Found this via a NY Times review. You'll walk through a corporate lobby and tucked at the back is a little espresso bar.  A grab n' go option this place does terrific coffee with a tasty (& healthy) snack/ mini meal offer too.

734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2014-07-23,5.0,"Nice hidden outpost of the downtown powerhouse. Ben makes a great cortado and certainly lives his coffee. This is little more than an alcove inside of an office building lobby. The guards freak out if you move the chairs more than a millimeter in the lobby, so you can have fun with that. A great addition to espresso-less mid-40s Manhattan. See if you can find it!"
734,kaffe-1668-new-york-4,2014-03-06,5.0,Has some of the best coffee in midtown. And its hidden in the back of a super sleek new lobby.
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2018-04-13,5.0,"This Starbucks beats up my stereotype left and right! I learned a coffee giant like Starbucks can still create personal and delightful personal experience for each one of his customer who walks in, after I been to this particular one.

Plenty of leather sofa, and wall bench, with good space between each neighbor, and if you want to sit on the stairs like you do on MMoA, you can. 
Lots of seating places, so I can keep my glam and not hustle to look for a spot.
Food and drinks are the same.
However it costs a bit more here, after I read my receipt.

When Summer comes, I will visit this Starbucks more often, after walking on High line.

I recommend this Starbucks for every coffee lovers."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2020-01-10,1.0,"This is my first time actually writing a review, but I just had to complain about this experience. Firstly, I had to wait (no line) for a barista to even pay attention to me to take my order. The place was very quiet and empty at this time of day. The two girls who were ""working"" were more interested in their own conversation than anything else. Once she finally took my order, I sat and waited for my drink, a simple peppermint hot chocolate, for about 10 minutes. They hadn't even made the drink for the customer before me yet! They were literally just walking around the back and talking to each other. I wasn't in a rush so I waited for that long, but finally I went back to the register and told them to cancel my order. The girl at the register told the other barista not to make it, and she replied ""I don't even care"". 

I feel like people don't even read yelp reviews for a place like Starbucks but I just had to complain about this experience."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2019-07-23,5.0,Whilst Starbucks is a global entity these days the store on 26th street and the west side in New York is still very homely with a number of staff who are wearing the coffee master apron.  Everything flows nicely with the real bugbear being the complete lack of street parking to drop by and grab a quick coffee en route to the office...
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2019-10-14,5.0,Finally found a great Starbucks near my office as the one on 33rd and 10th is so bad I happily walk another 6 or 7 blocks for this one.  Beautiful looking Starbucks with super friendly staff that always get your mobile order correct and on time.  Plenty of room to sit and work inside.  I cannot day enough good things about this location as it just might be the nicest Starbucks I've ever found!
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2019-01-17,4.0,"I love that most of the Starbucks are consistent and on point with their drinks. I ordered a matcha latte (almond milk, pumps of SF Vanilla) and it comes out well every time. No qualms here!"
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2020-01-06,1.0,"Had the most awful experience at this Starbucks today. First off, I'm not used to writing any reviews but absolutely had to. Starbucks in NYC has been going down hill for a long time in my opinion. Many of the barristers could care less and take their time with orders, not looking at you and some with major attitude. Not all, some are fantastic, but my experience is those good folks are in the minority. Today, at Starbucks on 26th between 10/11th I waited 12 minutes for a regular coffee and only after I asked twice did I get it. On top of that the music was extremely LOUD like a club, and I could not hear them even if my order has been ready. Extremely disappointed and STRESSED OUT from this experience..."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2018-10-01,2.0,Decent coffee if you can put up with the long lines sometimes this is the closest Starbucks we have near the west side
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2019-11-25,2.0,"I mean it's a Starbucks and I'm usually not that guy to Yelp chain places, but I felt compelled to after waiting 20 min for a black ice coffee. I mean cmon! The staff is super friendly though which made it less painful. These damn millennials ordering on their phones screws everything up! Go back to the old ways!"
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2016-05-07,4.0,"I like Starbucks beverages but not a fan of their crowded space. At this location in not-so-crowded neighborhood, the space is really large, and have the art gallery feel to it with many paintings and such on the wall. Even thought it is located below street level, they still have nice large windows, allowing natural lights to come in and light up the large space. It also has lots of lighting fixtures throughout, so it feels very cozy and comfortable.

The middle of the floor is more like a nice living room setting, with comfy chairs and couch, and additional modern designed seating from wall to wall. With this space being more like a hidden gem (right now), there are more than enough seating at all time. I am secretly hoping this place will not be too popular so that it will stay this way.

So, what can you get here that is special to this location? Of course the ""reserve"" line of coffee. They have other, regular drinks here as well, but since we came to the Reserve, we decided to try some of their reserve coffee. 

To tell you the truth, I actually love the space more than their coffee, but again, if I was a serious coffee lover, I probably will love their coffee too. So, the next time I visit this nice little quiet, relaxing oasis in NYC, I would most likely order their regular beverage, but I still will totally enjoy the space!"
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2017-06-22,4.0,Just had a caramel frappaccino. It was yummy in my tummy. Really good service & speedy employees. 4 stars today. I am satisfied.
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2019-09-22,5.0,"This was the best experience I've ever had at a Starbucks in Manhattan. The employees were kind and focused on their jobs, which is honestly unusual in the city. I ordered a Carmel latte and they made a fantastic one. I'd certainly go out of my way to come back here."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2018-07-19,2.0,"The only reason I may come to this location again is either because it's close my office or because it offers nice seating area. The staff was so unfriendly and ill-trained. They couldn't even take an order right, let alone making the right drink. I ordered a Sea salt cream foam cold brew and was given a salted caramel latte. Despite their attempt to fix it, my sea salt cream foam cold brew tasted like iced coffee topped with sweet whipped cream! 

I guess I'll just stick with my favorite East Village Starbucks location on Avenue A from now on. At least the staff over there make an effort to share some eye contact with customers when they hand over the drinks."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2016-12-15,4.0,"Generally, the only time you'll see me at a Starbucks is when I'm at an airport, or it's Christmas morning and nothing else is open. Besides that, there are way too many awesome independent coffee shops to spend my money at, but I will say...this is an awesome Starbucks.

It's a sprawling space that's part of a art gallery next door, and almost has a museum cafe air about it. Lots of seating with minimalist decor, it's a lot different than most other Starbucks you'll come across. Dare I say it's chic? With the same things every Starbucks excels at (good wifi, lots of snacks, etc...), you can almost close your eyes and feel like you're not in a Starbucks at all.

It's perfect for grabbing a coffee drink while banging out some work on your laptop, so if that's something you're on the lookout for, you just found it."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2018-04-10,3.0,"It's a prettier-than-average location.  For sure.
Half of the time, you get a friendly and upbeat barista that makes your day a bit better.
The other half of the time, you get a grumpy, annoyed barista who can't believe you have the nerve to ask about your mobile order, 15 minutes after it was supposed to be ready.
100% of the time all of the baristas are wearing hats... so there's that."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2015-12-13,4.0,"Yah, I kinda reluctant to share this place with anyone since it is so hard to find a coffee shop which does not have plenty people in NYC. But, this place deserves everyone's attention since it is so upgrade and unique that I really want to share with fellow yelpers' and let yall share the excitement with me.

Location: located at West 26th street and close to 10ave, R starbucks located in a creepy area at Chelsea. When you were on highline park, you probably would stopped for a little bit due to the some art gallery posters. But if you get off highline park right now, and go downstairs, you will see the R starbucks right away. Unlike the other regular starbucks, this place is unique. It has several individual seats, with plenty private space. It also has reserved coffee for you to taste.

I had niagara coffee and I do wish that they can practice the handmade coffee pouring art a little bit. But the quality of the coffee is better than average, at least better than PIKE. They also has lots of coffee beans for sale, some bakeries to eat and some space for intimate talk. 

It is upgrade and it is comparably pricy? Maybe, but with this little amount of people here, I would love to pay a little more to have some spacious space.

I like it here and hopefully, I won't stop coming here."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2016-10-26,5.0,"It seems odd to give a Starbucks 5 stars.  I mean, isn't it just the same as the one hundred something odd other Starbucks in town?  Well, yes and no.  Their *menu* is certainly the same as any Starbucks you'll visit.  It even has the familiar chalkboards behind the counter, a glass display of baked goods and tons of machinery for making various drinks.

What differentiates this branch is everything *else*.  Step down into this Starbucks and you enter a space that is part art gallery, part lounge, part cafe and all comfortable.  The decor is gorgeous and I instantly relaxed when I entered.  Seating ranges from couches to seats with small desks and even a small bar.  It feels like there is something for everyone!

Service was great.  The staff was very cool about letting my girlfriend try out a tea flavor and the bathroom was shockingly clean.  The Chai Latte I purchased was perfectly made (not too sweet and I could taste the spices).

I'd be happy to go back to this branch any time."

735,starbucks-new-york-464,2018-01-28,5.0,"Beautiful upscale Starbucks in Chelsea -- right by the galleries.

Aside from aesthetics, though, it's a great place to get some work done! Their wifi was strong and I was able to conduct three video conference calls. No lagging or drops. The seats are also really comfortable and I had an outlet directly underneath to charge my phone and laptop.

Never thought I'd be leaving a review for a Starbucks, but it was such a -- surprisingly- pleasant experience.

Just be aware that there is a school nearby and around 3:30 pm (dismissal time), it can get a bit loud, but it was momentary. 

All in all, great decor, strong wifi, and ofc, good ol' Starbucks coffee!"
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2018-09-20,5.0,"Very beautiful, comfortable coffee house.  Way above the average Starbucks, looks like a prototype for a new design.   Best of all they have a Clover machine - a very special drip coffee process.  Soft house music. Highly recommended."

735,starbucks-new-york-464,2016-02-15,4.0,"I am obsessed with this high concept Starbucks in NYC. It is definetly not your average Starbucks. There's paintings on the wall, cool concept seating, comfier chairs in the center of the store with interesting rugs. 
Basically, so much more classy and aesthetically pleasing than the average Starbucks store we are used to visiting. 

At first I did find it odd to find the baristas at Starbucks using a Chemex to brew coffee and thought to myself ""super hipster Starbucks baristas that actually like to brew coffee?"" 

But anyways onto the review: 

Pros: 
+ Niagara Coffee
 (just had a free sample and it was 10000x better than their OG Blonde Roast or  Pike) 
+ wicked CLEAN 
+ quiet 
+ fun environment 
+ good playlist
+ perfect place to study 

Cons: 
- workers are a bit rude and will give you the evil glare and dismiss you... They seemed conceited and would definetly the group of employees that judge your Starbucks orders (aka. the stereotypical Starbucks employees that Buzzfeed writes about) 

But call me crazy - i would go back to bad Starbucks service just to sit and study in this cool space."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2017-06-02,5.0,"Great wifi, service, AND they shake their iced matcha lattes (I hate when I have to shake it myself)! This Starbucks is also huge!! Definitely the cleanest NYC one I've been in also. They also have tastings of their reserve coffee at specific times (I believe it starts at 10:30am every morning). Great place to go to do work or stop for coffee before or after walking on the high line (entrance on same street)."

735,starbucks-new-york-464,2018-12-04,1.0,"This place doesn't employ a single person to keep track of inventory of any kind. I've never been to a Starbucks like this. They are ALWAYS out of something and you only find out after you pay, or if it's a mobile order you'll sit there waiting for 15 min before you say something and then you have to wait to get a refund. In the last month and a half from my own personal experience they've been out of earl grey tea twice (at 9am), blonde roast twice, multiple food items, lids for certain cups, certain bags or holders (my egg bites have been served in an oatmeal bowl all week, when they're not out of egg bites) and mostly this is all found out after you've paid and waited. Then you need to wait and process a refund. One time I ordered the chicken chorizo egg bites and paid for it and they gave me the chicken sausage biscuit instead because they were out of the egg bites. That's not how it works! It's absolutely maddening and happens literally every other day. They need to get it together."

the decor is wonderful and vibe is relaxing.

it's also located in the meatpacking district with tons of art galleries and near the high line.

there seriously needs to be more locations that look like this.

the only other location that compares is the one inside brookfield place downtown (and that's a starbucks reserve store)."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2016-02-06,4.0,Nice ambiance. Different from your average starbucks. Really fits in with the galleries in the area.
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2016-01-25,1.0,"Ugh. Just avoid. Plenty of cheaper coffee shops nearby.

Pros: -Consistently has only a few customers. 
-Has 4 outlets within store, which is sufficient most of the time.

Cons: 
-Extremely poor/rude service. Also, closes at unexpected times (but always at least 20 minutes early). Expect employees to treat your order like a chore (e.g., slow moving/long personal conversations between themselves) and to be consistently overcharged for things you didn't order.
-Uncomfortable seating.

The only Starbucks I've ever been to with terrible service/management."

They pride themselves on ""micro"" lot coffees but roast them in giant batches and sell old and not fresh coffee? Also, their espresso is HORRIBLE!!!!!!! They spent all this money making this place ""look"" like a boutique coffee shop but pull back the first layer and you're at any other Starbucks."

A hard to find Starbucks (we only found it because we parked on the street) but if you're ever nearby, go check it out! It's paintings are cute and so are the seats and tables! There's a restroom too  (no pass code necessary)."
735,starbucks-new-york-464,2016-07-05,1.0,I'm sure this only happened because of my looks but three staff members were near the register and the ALL left when I came up to order something. I went back to where my belongings were and proceeded to GO TO ANOTHER STARBUCKS to get what I wanted. 1/5 stars. Be more welcoming staff people despite what the customer looks like
736,champion-coffee-new-york-4,2019-09-29,5.0,"I  LOVE  CHAMPION  COFFEE 
The location is tucked away and kind of easy to miss if you're not looking, but they always have funny news stories and messages on the chalkboard out front so if you look for that you know you're at the right place.
The service is extraordinary, all the baristas are so friendly and their drinks are delicious!
The inside itself is very clean and has great vibes! It makes sense that the company itself is based out of Greenpoint. I honestly don't understand what some of these other reviewers are talking about. Somebody was asking about the types of cookies they offer as if the two they have aren't right in front of them on the counter"
736,champion-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-06,4.0,"Randomly found this place after a long, delayed miserable flight. Needing coffee was an understatement. The name caught my attention and the decor was really inviting. Felt like I was sipping coffee in a comfy living room. I got a maple almond milk cold brew that was deliciously strong. My only issue is it was cold ass hell in here. The temp outside was perfect but walking in here I felt like I needed to be drapped in a North Face"
736,champion-coffee-new-york-4,2019-11-10,3.0,"Cute little coffee shop near a friend's apartment in Midtown West. Got a cappuccino, and I wouldn't say it was anything special. Small seating area, only one bench table area on the first floor and then there's a small upstairs area for additional seating. Wasn't any available seating when were there so had to take our coffees to go."
736,champion-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-01,4.0,"This is a great spot to grab a quick cup of coffee. It's in the old Madman Espresso location, but has an updated, more inviting overall ambiance. There are only a few tables (one large booth downstairs and two communal tables upstairs), but I'm usually able to find a spot. 

Champion has your basic coffee and tea options, in addition to matcha and turmeric lattes (my new favorite - so good!). They also have some food options (avocado toast, sandwiches, baked goods). 

There's usually just one person working at the counter, so sometimes the tables get a little dirty if patrons don't clear their own dishes. Still, I like this place. If you're a frequent customer, be sure to sign up for their loyalty program. After buying 10 drinks, you get one free!"

The lady working the counter looked bothered that we were asking her about the different assortment of cookies.  You would think that you had to pay for a smile.  Regardless of how the ""champion cookie"" tastes, the stoic indifference of the staff here is enough to never make me want to come back - especially with better nearby options like Culture Espresso just around the corner."
736,champion-coffee-new-york-4,2018-12-06,5.0,This is my favorite coffee spot so far in NYC. I had a medium black coffee that was a little more on the dark roast side as far as the taste was conferenced but it was good! They have alternative dairy options like almond milk which is nice.

736,champion-coffee-new-york-4,2019-09-02,2.0,"Wow.

I can tell their employees really hate working there. 

Came in today, and as the employee was mopping the table I didn't hear him say anything so one ear had a head phone. The employee didn't look up, so I assumed he hadn't said anything yet, but it turns out he just talks like a  squirrel with an attitude. Meaning, he spoke in a volume that I could barely manage to hear. He repeats his question again, glaring at me and mumbling under his breath... I was astonished... 
When he said the price I couldn't hear him, I didn't dare to ask him to repeat it cause I knew for sure that he'd reply with the biggest attitude ever. I was blown away with the lack of professional.... I asked for less ice, which my fault for using the own term because I actually wanted 90% of my ice gone. However, I don't think it's that dramatic in where he had to grumble and complain within earshot?

Like I'm really sorry for walking in? I just wanted a chai? Is that so wrong? 

I get it, people have bad days, but keep it to yourself. I'm not telling you to force a smile and serve me... Just don't bring it to my face and make my mood worse. Otherwise the drink was nothing special, although I'm sure I tasted worse because I was left with a bad impression.

I'll make sure to go somewhere else for my drink, where I won't feel shitty because I wanted one drink."

Stay here often and usually walk further, but this mix of boutique coffee, hot, cold, cold brew and all in between, in a bright, fun and airy spot with tasty food to go along, is perfect. Still new, so stop by and enjoy! Will continue to come back. Plenty of seating, including upstairs, too."

736,champion-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-23,5.0,Cutest little coffee shop tucked in between two shops. Delicious coffee and was not stale (which is a common misfortune with many). There's some seating on the first floor + more upstairs. Was fairly open at 10am on a Saturday.
736,champion-coffee-new-york-4,2018-12-10,5.0,"This is a solid neighborhood coffee joint. Super cosy for a Winter afternoon and their drip coffee was really delicious! There isn't too much seating in the cafe, just a booth on the bottom floor and two large tables upstairs."
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2019-12-23,4.0,"This Starbucks is right across the street from my work so it's the most convenient for me to get to. 

There is a downstairs where you order and can sit on the sides. My favorite spot is the upstairs where they have a large table, small tables around it and then comfy large chairs. You're not supposed to sleep there but sometimes it's impossible. 

Like many Starbucks, if you sit there long enough, you'll come out smelling like coffee. I love the atmosphere. It always feels warm and comfy. It's part of the Starbucks brand but I feel like this one is extremely comfy since it isn't too large or small in size.

The staff is great. I've seen a few workers come and go over the last 5 years. I had staff prepare me a bagel before I even got there before online ordering was a thing. I used to get a bagel everyday! The guy doesn't work there anymore but it was greatly appreciated.

It does get very hectic because it's Starbucks in a high traffic area. There are a few around the area so you have your choices. This one will always be my favorite."
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2019-11-02,4.0,"This is your usual NYC Starbucks with standard product offerings. What warrants it the extra star, in my opinion, is the job the nice staff did in hosting a pre-marathon party for our charity group. The space upstairs was reserved for us for  about 2 hours and they put out a nice spread of wraps, bagels and bakery goodies. This was a comfortable space for us to meet our teammates and I got sample some things in addition to my favorite iced lemon loaf."

Cashiers always have a smile on their faces. They're pretty quick too, but maybe it's because I get here before 8am (before the long lines start to form). WiFi works great! A good amount of places to sit."

While far from clean it does have a positive vibe. The food is excellent and the nitro coffee is excellent too albeit a bit warmer than expected.

The restroom was clean.....cleaner than dining are in fact. 

The staff is super friendly and helpful. It was not too busy after work while all the other SBs in the area are packed.

I'm absolutely returning when in the area again. 

Now if someone could PLEASE lower the LOUD music!!!!"

My sandwhich tasted off too... could that've been expired too?

Plus there are tons of flies at this location. I don't understand how they have an A rating."
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2019-08-07,1.0,This is the noisiest Starbucks on the planet. The music is BLASTING and it sounds more like a night club than a coffee shop. I had to leave. It's horrible.

DONE"
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2019-03-13,1.0,"If you are looking for a place to enjoy a cup of coffee and get some work done, don't go  here. The noise level of the music is incredulous and head ache inducing. They unnecessarily pump up the music as if it's a club."

I walked in and ordered 2 coffee travelers and a couple coffees and it was such a cushy time 9am and this team was so GREAT lots of patience. Henry the barista and Ice barista were phenomenal. They have someone that expedites who was also awesome. The guy making the hot sandwiches was great. Honestly this is an extreamly busy area and establishment and its expected but they do an amazing job at getting ur order out quick and with patience. Thank you !

737,starbucks-new-york-181,2020-01-21,2.0,"I hate to write bad reviews because I work in retail/customer service and know how much companies value this, but what I'm writing about has become a repeat issue! I come to this location often since it's right near where I work and this location is ALWAYS out of strawberry acai. I understand it may be common to run out of an item, which I'm not mad about, but what I am mad about is that I pay for a strawberry acai and am not told until after I pay that this location is out of it. I want to say this is the 5th time it's happened to me over the past 2 months which has led me to write this review! Sometimes I also order ahead on the app and am not notified until I arrive that this location does not have strawberry acai. Unfortunately I don't drink anything else from Starbucks so I'm left screwed, settling for a lemonade or something else fruity (I don't drink coffee). If I was just made aware BEFORE I paid that they were out, I would simply say ok and leave! But this has gotten extremely annoying, and will no longer be my regular Starbucks location that I stop by."
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2018-08-21,4.0,"I come here often for my morning coffee. AM staff at the registers are usually friendly, upbeat, and energetic. The line goes pretty fast. If you're getting a specialty drink, or hot sandwich in the morning expect to wait 5-10 mins. The hot sandwiches are toasted well and taste great! Drinks are consistent. The manager is friendly and considerate of the customers. They play hip hop, R&B, and top hits and the workers enjoy singing along. There's a good amount of seating, plugs, and people come and go, so it doesn't get too crowded unless it's raining and people don't have umbrellas. Two downsides are their restroom stinks like death, and usually is out of toilet paper, so bring your own TP. Big flies fly around everywhere especially the 2nd floor seating area. Overall, this Starbucks is consistent, and in a great location."
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2017-07-04,1.0,"The most disgusting Starbucks I've been. Floor was messy and the restroom smelled terrible, it was sticky and had paper all over the floor. Consequence of being a crowded place, but should increase the cleaning shifts"
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2017-08-22,5.0,"Great location. Been here over 100 times. Everybody is super nice, and your order gets ready in very little time. 
Christine, of the early morning shift, is always ""on it"" and never forgets your name, or your preferences, and gives a smile to everyone! In a city where young people misunderstand ""attitude"" as professionalism, is always great to see somebody who gets what customer service is, and deliver -more- than expected, with the precious bonus of a smile, even when the store is crowded and people are in a rush and needy."
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2018-06-07,1.0,The strangest thing just happened to me.  I went in for coffee and the place was packed.   I went to put half and half in it was almost empty.   Enough for a couple more cups.  So I used it and left.  As soon as I started to drink it I knew there was something wrong with it so I took it back.  I felt nauseous.  The place was now empty in the 30 seconds I was gone.  They gave me a new one. When I went to the milk bar there was all new cold bottles of new milk.  Good thing I'm not a paranoid person as it felt like a twilight zone episode.

737,starbucks-new-york-181,2015-05-29,1.0,"Apparently it's company policy that you must purchase a beverage and bring it into the restroom in order to use the restroom. 

Apparently it's company policy to not check the heavily guarded bathroom and allow it to reach a dire/unusable state devoid of any paper products (you can imagine how tricky a situation that could leave a customer in).

Apparently it's company policy for a supposed manager to turn around and walk away from a customer when confronted about aforementioned issues.


I frequent Starbucks more than I'd like to admit, but this experience was so terrible, I remember it vividly. If corporate knew that this location was run by such a manager, they'd be rewriting their hiring manuals. 

Never again."

Because Starbucks usually are crowded and there are so many people so when i visited other Starbucks i could not find the seats

Communication between baristas is a problem in almost every starbucks I've ever been to. My drink often has to be redone but this is more the fault of the way things are run and not the baristasDrink orders are so specific and hand writing them on cups seems like the worst way to ensure your drink is made accurately, especially when the barista on bar is expected to be making 10 at once."

737,starbucks-new-york-181,2016-10-11,1.0,"Y'all should REALLY change the hours online and on the app. I went to this Starbucks at 9pm on a Sunday night thinking they would be open because google and the Starbucks App said they close at 10 pm everyday. My friend and I arrived at 9 and there was a group of people outside and they informed us that apparently this Starbucks closed at 9PM on weekends- They were getting drinks made because they had already ordered them for pick up through the Starbucks app which said this location closed at 10PM...

The barista brought out their drinks, and the other people left with their drinks in hand. The barista was visibly annoyed, and I was informed her ""the app AND google say you close at 10 PM."" And she was like ""I don't care what the app or google says we close at 9 on weekends!!!"" Then she proceeds to slam the door on my face and she went behind the counter and LAUGHED with her coworker. 

Seconds later another guy tried opening the door and I tell him they closed at 9 ""apparently"" and all he wanted was water. The barista comes back out and yells ""were closed at 9 on weekends!"" Slams the door again, and then the two employees turn all the lights off and they are still LAUGHING at us.... I don't understand what is so comical.

I am a frequent Starbucks customer and never have I been treated with such disrespect. This employee could have been polite and said something like ""I apologize that the times on google and the Starbucks app are incorrect, but we are actually closed at 9 on weekends, so unfortunately we can't take your order"" or something instead of giving me attitude, slamming the door on my face, and laughing at me when I'm still standing at the doorway.

If they really close at 9pm on Saturdays and Sundays, Google and the Starbucks App should be updated to avoid similar situations from happening in the future. I'm never retiring to this Starbucks because of how rude that employee was to me. It's one thing to give me attitude. But to laugh at me while I'm still standing there, that's a whole new level of RUDE.

I get maybe they were trying to jet out early because it was Labor Day Weekend and they were probably trying to go to a party or something, but that is NO excuse to be rude to a customer who did nothing wrong. And LOL to them denying a patron water on a hot and humid night. Quality employee right there!!!!!!

Was I being lied to or do they really close at 9 on the weekends???? Please comment to let me know! Thanks:)"
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2012-02-24,1.0,"Little did I know that this was a ""new"" Starbucks when I stopped in.  Little did I care.  They had the sun dried Ethiopia Harrar on the clover.  Little did I know they also had the most bitchy employees I've ever met - first scolding me for taking a picture of the menu (to note the specific reserve blends they had that day,) then telling me thier wi-fi was down, and finally telling me I wasn't very nice when I said that sucked,

There are plenty of Starbucks in this city - as a matter of fact I'm sitting at one right now typing this - and while I'm generally not a fan of the company I'll give them credit for that Harrar since it is amazing.  What I won't give them credit for is the 1140 Broadway location and the attitutes of their piss-poor staff at 8:15pm on 2/24/12.  Consider this my ""filing a complaint."""
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2016-12-07,5.0,This is probably the best Starbucks Cafe ever; they knowing me by name... they even notice when I change my usual drink for something else. It's a really great atmosphere  ...Just today early in the evening before my shift at work got my Caramel Frappucino Venti it's really funny how they can deal with the high number of costumers and make people laugh in the process
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2014-09-16,1.0,"Ordered a Venti Light Ice Soy Chai. Same as I do every day. I watch as the barista pours an entire cup of ice into my drink. Cup as in the measuring cup they use to get ice out. I say to her, ""I'm sorry but I wanted light ice"". She replies "" I did put light ice"". I said, ""no I watched you put the ice in, but it's fine"". To which she replies rudely ""We usually put ice up to this line, if you wanted two ice cubes you should've told me"". 

Excuse me? I'm sorry but is this not Starbucks? And if I'm not satisfied with the drink I ordered should it not be politely edited to my liking? I wasn't rude, I wasn't mean or unreasonable, I didn't ask for my drink to be remade, I simply pointed out I did not wish to have that much ice, in hopes that the next time I come, I'll get the drink I like. Instead I had to get angry with her rudeness and tell her that's not a way to speak to a customer. 

The reason I want LIGHT ICE is because I don't appreciate my drink I paid almost $6 for melting into a disgusting watered down version of the chai I'd like to enjoy. As head of customer service for a consulting firm, I'm appalled that this is acceptable customer service behavior from an establishment and I don't appreciate being spoken to like this."

Unfortunately, the service at this Starbucks is the worst I've ever seen.  The employees are not friendly - have messed up my food order almost every time I go there - leaving me and other customers waiting endlessly for our orders.  It's really a huge workflow issue.  They only use one register and when they aren't skipping over people to take their order, they are charging you for food and then fail to put your food item in the ovens.  Most Starbucks locations I've been to work like fine oiled machines.  These people just can't seem to get it together and their crappy attitudes don't help.   They either need new management or all new employees.  Your best bet? Go a couple of blocks away to the location on 23rd street.  That's where I'll be going from now on."

The Starbucks here is extremely nice, it has a seating area on the second floor and it is big and spacey. That is much expected from Starbucks as that's why I chose to drink at Starbucks.

I am a gold card member (brag) and I used my card to grab a drink to pass some extra time I had. The cashier had a really nasty and rude attitude. He rolls his eyes, click on his teeth and won't stare at the customer. He's also very impatient and won't help out a customer (foreign). Where is the manager in this place?! 

Upstairs seating apparently close at 6:30 and they weren't letting anyone upstairs at 5:50. Then yelling at them for doing so. Wow.

737,starbucks-new-york-181,2017-06-09,1.0,"Okay I never do this kind of thing but I'm pretty irritated with this place and would like to address a reoccurring issue. I am a very frequent customer here and I always order a dirty chai (chai latte + espresso) and every time I order (and when I say every time, I mean it with no exaggeration) they don't put the espresso in it. At first I let it slide because well hey, we're all human, we make mistakes and there's no need to fuss over it. But it happens over and over again and at this point I just think you guys are trying to rip me off and that's really not cool. I've had one of your employees straight up lie to my face that there was espresso in my drink when I saw her make it and there was none. Not only do I feel ripped off, but a few of your employees have terrible attitudes. This one girl with red hair is constantly rude to me. I'm not asking for rainbows and smiles, but I would appreciate some respect. If you treat your customers poorly, they can just go to the Starbucks down the street on 5th, like myself for now on. It's not that difficult to be kind to others. Warning to others, always ask for your receipt in case you get ripped off as well. I know a shot is only $0.50 more but that all adds up when you go frequently, and who knows, maybe I'm not the only one this happens to. Just give the people what they paid for."
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2013-08-09,5.0,"The barista is awesome there. Not to be attacking on the other reviewers, but you had 1 bad experience so you give them that rating. You've been there multiple times yet you based your rating on that 1 time experience.

I've been to other starbucks and it happens ESPECIALLY in the morning when you have 2-3 making drinks for 20+ customers with all types of different drinks.

Place is nice and big. Upstairs is huge for additional seatings.
For the reviewer to mention about big and spacey that is much expected from Starbucks clearly shows you don't know business. Starbucks is a franchise. Each franchise owner have to pay for the rent, employees, ingredients, and franchise fees. So no, it shouldn't be that much expected because it is a Starbucks.

You can go on 6th ave between 24th and 25th street and there won't be a 2nd floor. 

Yelpers...this place is awesome."
737,starbucks-new-york-181,2015-07-17,3.0,Decent amount of space & seating. The baristas are friendly. The sugar and milk are restock often. I find that sometimes the ice coffee here can be a hit or miss lately- it was extremely bitter for some reason. Otherwise coffee is the same as any other starbucks.
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-30,5.0,"We had just gotten off of a flight and needed a pick-me-up, so on our way to Times Square we stopped by Gregorys Coffee. The employee that took our order was very friendly and helpful, our drinks were also prepared very quickly. The place itself is pretty spacious and has several tables for you to sit and enjoy your coffee.

I ordered their iced matcha latte w/ oat milk, my husband had their Hall & Oats cold brew and we also ordered a banana nut bread to share. My drink was delicious and the banana bread was so yummy, but the star of the show was definitely the cold brew - so good!

Definitely stop by if you're in the area! Highly recommend."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-18,4.0,"This place looked cute from the outside so we decided to stop in on our way to Central Park.
I had a hazelnut latte with almond milk and my hubs got the caramel cappuccino, along with a banana nut bread that we split. We thought the lady taking our order was kind of rude but they did have good coffee! 
He says his Capp wasn't sweet at all, so he had to add some sugar to his. Mine wasn't sweet either but I don't like sweetener in my coffee so I thought mine was good! The banana nut bread was really good and big! It tasted fresh and healthy if you know what I mean. Lol. Not too sweet"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-11,4.0,If you read my reviews you will know coffee is a critical part of my day. I Enjoy coffee from Bottegas to a brand name coffee and in between etc!!! Well I was very satisfied with my cup of Java from this establishment.  It was bold full flavor giving me that extra boost.  I happen to be in the area for a business meeting since I was earlier I need a place to chil.  So Gregory's coffee was the perfect answer.
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-03,4.0,Great spot to grab a coffee. They offer an extensive menu full of hot or iced drinks and even give you the option to add CBD oil to your drink. I like that they have a section dedicated to cold brew based drinks. The service is efficient and friendly. I make it a point to stop in to a Gregorys every time I'm in NYC and I'm never disappointed.
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-25,5.0,"Strong coffee - simple - good service 

This review is solely for the coffee. The bf and I were on a hunt for a decent cup of Joe after being super disappointed from the no name and Dunkin' Donuts we tried. UGH. I am a coffee enthusiast but never considered myself a snob. After this trip to NYC, I know that I am. We got the regular drip coffee. They have a ""Coffee is the Day"" during week days but we were there on a Saturday. 

Firstly, love the branding. Very Millennial and simple. Even the store layout was just simple and clean. You could dine in if you decide to get one of their over priced breakfast smoothies or one of their baked goods. This location was just outside of Times Square so it was quite busy. We got our coffees to go. You can have Milk or cream in your offer and what we sweetener you like. They also offer coffee cup plugs which was major key since we were walking around. Coffee was strong, full and just damn tasty!

So regretting only visiting here once. Just go, thank me later."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-28,4.0,"Very cute coffee shop in Midtown Manhattan. I was impressed by the collection of their cold brew. Besides the regular black coffee brew, the have Nutella Cold Brew, Halls and Oats Brew. They are quite amazing. I got the Halls and Oats, and it tasted really good. It is a mixture of coffee, oat milk, cinnamon and some chocolate (I think). You should check it out. I enjoyed it a lot. The price isn't too bad. Close to 5 bucks for a medium size of cold brew. Comparable to other coffee shops in the area, it is a good deal."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-20,5.0,"Gregory's Coffee is a New York staple. This location on historic 44th Ave is a great one.... and it's near my hotel, The Royalton. It's stacked to the ceiling with fresh bakery every morning. I love the brownie. It's very decadent and tastes like they use good chocolate and a lot of it. 

Their cold brew in perfect and their lattes are stellar, and they have oat and almond milk.

Staff are always having fun and they're very friendly. If I lived in NY, I'd practically live at Gregory's! So get in here!"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-03-26,4.0,"Gregory's is a great coffeeshop chain. They always have ample seating, functional WiFi, and a clean bathroom. They even had a few outlets. It's a great place to get some work done. The tables they have are pretty small though. It'd be challenging to share a table with a friend if you're both getting work done, but perfect size if you're just catching up. 

I recommend getting the chai latte or the regular latte. I've tried the drip coffee and it has more of a bitter aftertaste than the rest of their drinks. The chai and the regular latte are both very smooth and delicious.

They also had a ton of pastries available in case you get hungry. Haven't tried any yet but have been very tempted!"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-08,5.0,"I don't know if it's destination coffee but it's more convenient than other options. Starbucks and an increasing number of high-end office lobby espresso purveyors are available nearby, but at a cost of slow lines or no seats. Gregory's doesn't feel like it's in Midtown. On the culinary side of things, I'm glad to see they're mixing up the cold brew subgenre. I enjoyed the Honey Badger option."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-18,4.0,"I stopped in quick on my way to catch a train and got a medium flat white and it was exactly what I want/expect from a flat white. The staff worked fast but were friendly, and there were enough seating options for me to be able to pause for five minutes before heading back out. It's nice when a place has more than just convenience on it's side, and even nicer when you can get a great coffee drink that doesn't need a ton of sugar and flavors and frills to be good but stands up on its own."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-21,5.0,"This is a great place to have a great drink, relax and rest your tired feet after a long day of shopping in New York. I had an iced turmeric latte with ginger and honey. It was very good. It was quench my thirst. After sitting and nursing my drink for awhile, I was ready to hit the pavement again."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-03-03,4.0,"Came here on one of the coldest nights of the year. A Wednesday night, 6pm. There was still some seating available. Good enough seating to come and study for a short time. 
I got the Strawberry CBD drink. Forgive me, I forgot the name but it's the only one like it on the menu. Loved this. I can't say if it really had any ""CBD effect"" since I smoked right after, but it was comforting and the strawberry flavor wasn't overwhelming. 
My bf got the Drip coffee. It was good for those who like a more bitter flavor coffee. He added a little cinnamon and sugar on the raw. It was perfect. I love the logo and would've bought a cup and saucer if i was going straight home afterwards.
They sell pastries and other cold beverages. The bathroom could use a clean but it's public in NYC..maybee they get a pass ? 
Looking forward to going back if in the area."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-13,5.0,"You see these coffee shops all over NYC. Great coffee place with fast wifi. This location was pretty full but I managed to find a spot and rest my feet. 

The bathrooms are clean! Wifi is fast!"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-27,4.0,"Solid choice for coffee and light breakfast for us!  They are loaded with tasty treats!  Great choice of coffee. All to enjoy in a lovely atmosphere! 

They have some great soundtrack playing. It appears to be some original tracks (not 100% sure).    Creates a great vibe to get the morning rolling!

Warning: coffee is a bit acidic/sour for my tastes. But the locals love it!"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-24,5.0,"The ""honey bee toast"" was sooooo good! I also suggest the chai latte  the only suggestion I would make, is use less packaging."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-11,5.0,Great service and amazing matcha! Always come here during the work week! I also recommend the brownies because they are light and fluffy. Highly recommend
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-08,5.0,Amber took care of us today. She was sweet funny and super accommodating to my not so simple order. Great way to start the morning!
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-03,5.0,Great coffee! Great service! My fiancé and I stopped in and we couldn't decide which drink to get so we each got a different one to try. I tried the Honey Badger and she had the bu brew. You can't go wrong with either. Tasty!!
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-20,5.0,"A NYC coffee shop with ample seating, free WiFi, outlets, and a bathroom is almost always guaranteed to get a 5 star from me.

I actually have a separate collection for NYC coffee shops that have WiFi and a bathroom (since believe it or not- there aren't that many that have both). And Gregory's Coffee not only met my standards, it it exceeded them since the latte I ordered was delicious and the barista I had was friendly. Needless to say, I will be back."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-28,5.0,I visited this store last night for a latte with my daughter and we were so impressed with the patience the lady had at the register when I was being indecisive. That combined with the delicious latte I was served its safe to say I'm SOLD. GOODBYE STARBUCKS AND HELLO GREGORYS
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-15,5.0,"Great place for some pumpkin spice latte and banana bread. The banana bread isn't too sweet and just right, the pumpkin spice taste organic."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-04,2.0,Desserts and pastries are 50% past 5p and most of them are delicious.  Coffee isn't that great and if you ask them to fix it they may have an attitude.
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-01,5.0,"I just want to say this is my favorite location !!! the coffee is the best 
Thank you Gregory !!!!
The staff here wonderful!!! I love me my Max !!! When he left it just wasn't the same !! Now that he is back I LOVE IT EVEN MORE AGAIN"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-30,5.0,"One of the best too! Last week had to be in this area of the city for almost 4 days straight and guess what? This Gregory's location made my week! The service is so on-point, very neat and organized store. Baristas are very professional and well-mannered. It really shows that there's a harmony, synchronization & very positive general concept of good customer service, attention to detail in between the stores. Props to management they're doing a very good job with these locations having improved all over the city. The wifi service is over the top and extremely convenient. The store is really fast paced in and out and very busy nevertheless the staff is up to the task and very friendly not rushing orders. Taking their time to get the orders right and offering choices and suggestions to the less knowledgeable coffee drinkers I'd actually got to try the Nutella cold brew it was scrumptious, yayyy for the nutella lovers!
It is definitely a very sweet and satisfactory experience every time! They don't disappoint!"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-27,5.0,"Love this coffee, the best you can get in all New York and great service, very attentive and happy vibes."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-13,3.0,"Really love their coffee but much more a tourist stop vs. A place to work. Music is a 7/10 for loudness (1/10= library and 10/10= need ear plugs to focus). Lots of people in and out constantly with small tables. There are outlets under the long bench to the left when you walk in but that isn't enough for me to study here. 
Went into the bathroom,I'd say it is a 7/10 for cleanliness with a 1/10 being most Starbucks bathrooms in Manhattan and 10/10 being a fancy restaurant but... It is mirrored all-around which is I think is and have always thought is weird."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-22,5.0,"Coming from the west coast, I've never heard of Gregory's coffee. During our vacation in NY city, we frequented the usual famous coffee house that I will not mention, as it is a favorite of my son and daughter. However, on our last day in New York City, we stopped by Gregory's to pick up some breakfast. I opted for a simple latte with oat milk. Oh...my....!! Why did I not know this place existed?! The nice warm cup of creamy oat milk coffee just tantalized my taste buds!! The warm steam fogged up my glasses in that cold winter New York morning. After finishing my cup of coffee, I needed to test out if this cup of coffee was actually better than my usual cup of coffee from the establishment that shall remain unnamed. With one in every corner, my hubby purchased me a cup of coffee from that other unnamed coffee shop. What? No oat milk in that other location?! What?? Not as tasty and tantalizing as Gregory's? I quickly searched online for a Gregory's near my home in CA....to my dismay, it does not exist!!!! Why?!! How can this be?! Well, if I'm ever back in the east coast, I will surely stop by for a nice cup of coffee!"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-08,5.0,"I go in quite often since I live on the same block. The staff is so nice! Shawn, one of the baristas, always remembers my drink and makes it with perfection each time! I also love the brand of almond milk they use which is low in sugar but still taste pretty good ... Their latte is the best in NYC!! The medium size lasts forever and doesn't make me too jittery. Check it out!!!"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-03-22,5.0,"Cozy little coffee shop with kind workers and a good atmosphere. Their coffee and tea were good, and they were made within a reasonable amount of time. We left an item here and didn't realize it until after dinner, but luckily they were cleaning up when we went back and gave it to us when they saw us looking sad in the window."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-05,2.0,"I cut back on coffee because apparently caffeine makes you crazy, who knew? Anyways, I was really craving a black-as-night cup o' joe one unusually chilly summer morning in New York, so I popped into Gregory's. I had heard good reviews about the coffee shop. I figured there was no way it could disappoint.

I was wrong. Their coffee was more stale than Starbucks (and we all know how I feel about them...) This was a very disappointing outing after being coffee-free for two months. 

Next time I'm craving a cup, I'm going to Little Italy for an espresso. At least then I know my travels will be worth the reward!"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-06,4.0,Very much like a Starbucks. The cold brew was good but my breakfast sandwich was mediocre. The music is very loud.
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-11,5.0,Great coffee the best I've ever had . Great pastries . Short wait time . Oat milk was a great addition
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-05,4.0,"I was in New York last December and it was freezing outside so I Yelped the nearest coffee shop and stumbled upon this one.

I came in and it was quite busy. Even though there was a line behind me the sweet cashier helped me with my order as it was my first time in there. I prefer my coffee sweet and creamy so she suggested the Honey Badger and Lemon Poppy Pound Cake, which I evidently found out was a vegan option.

I am not a vegan so I thought this was not going to satisfy my taste buds, but to my surprise it was really good and Moist. The slice itself is generous so I didn't finish it. As for the coffee it was the balance of sweet and creamy that I had hoped for but I am thinking it would be better off iced.

It seems like this place has multiple locations all throughout New York City so I'll definitely try it again when the weather is warmer!"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2017-08-02,4.0,"Good coffee, even better smoothies. We get our afternoon jolt at this location and service is always quick. Only once has it been curt (by a heavy-set bearded guy). I usually opt for their Morning Boost smoothie with strawberries, blueberries, Greek yogurt and granola blended into a frothy, creamy dessert you can slurp. It's $7.50 and great for any time of day, not just breakfast. The Root & Rise smoothie is $9, and tastes as healthy as it sounds, with banana, semisweet chocolate, almond milk, cinnamon, turmeric, chia seeds - basically chockfull of goodies. 

Their pastries are meh however, having tried the carrot raisin walnut pound cake (too dry and edges taste burnt) and Boston Kreme doughnut (big, but ruined by an odd tasting cream innard). Their chicken salad sold in the prepared foods freezer is surprisingly delicious, and would probably be fantastic with one of their croissants sold in the open dessert display, so light lunch idea for next time.

We usually grab and go but on occasion have sat in store, where the seating is comfy, but a lot of meet-ups also happen here so you'll hear many varying conversations going on at once."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-03,5.0,"First time in New York first time in this coffee shop and it was a really inviting space . Service was awesome , very helpful with any questions we had and the latte was delicious and the chi tea latte was so good too!!! 
Happy happy happy with our choice to stop in."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2018-08-20,5.0,"One of the best coffee chain in New York. Very popular and convenient. I love their coffee, especially the special ones. Nice place for meeting, working and resting."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-24,5.0,If you want stellar customer service come here. When you have a bad experience with an item and the business responds to you asking you to give them another try you know they really stand beside their products. I had a macadamia matcha latte and a buckwheat ball. Both were really delicious!
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-21,4.0,"NYC's answer to NorCal's Peet's Coffee.  Local joint that services tasty pastries, etc. for bfast and drinks to satisfy virtually anyone.  The drinks are not ""fru fru"" like Starbucks which is not a knock.  I just wanted to set ones expectations.  

The staff is very efficient/organized and friendly.  They definitely seem to be able to handle the throngs of people that frequent this spot!"
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-23,1.0,"DO NOT GET the Matcha Latte, it basically tasted like steamed milk with no flavor whatsoever... sadly waste of $6+. There was barely any matcha flavor, they probably put just a small teaspoon amount to make this $6 medium cup? You can tell from the color that there isn't ANY flavor, too bad I already left the store. Would not recommend..."
738,gregorys-coffee-new-york-2,2017-04-01,3.0,"(YC2017, 50/100)
I was tempted by the clever business logo (two coffee cups as glasses) and also there are multiple locations through NYC so there was never one too far away.  I would say the decor, ambiance, and menu are comparable to a Starbucks'; no frills, just the basics.  They even have a loyalty app similar to Starbucks called Gregulars, where you can get $5 for every $50 you spend, as well as a free birthday drink.  Sounds like a good program, but not really for me, as I was just visiting.  

As I walked in, I wasn't greeted by friendly faces, but more like staff that were just trying to get through the day.  I ordered a latte but they didn't ask for my name for my order so I had to do some guesswork to figure out which latte was mine.  It tasted pretty decent - the foam was good but the drink as a whole was average - maybe slightly above. 

Overall, a solid and convenient place to stop by for quick coffee fix, but not my first choice if I'm looking to sip and savor.  Cool merch though!"
739,pret-a-manger-new-york-66,2018-10-31,5.0,"Check out this iced chocolate beauty that Ronnie created for me! He even gave me an amazingly warm and gooey oatmeal raisin cookie on the house. His supervisor was there and he didn't even mind. They were both so sweet and friendly, and lit up my night. 

This location holds down the commuter customers really well, and there's plenty of space here if you want to sit down and consume at your own pace, though I wouldn't recommend this (loud) location for doing work in. 

Anyway, food and drink are always stocked and delicious, and the service - what Pret is known for - is definitely a standout for the Penn Station area."
739,pret-a-manger-new-york-66,2019-07-04,4.0,"Great place for a quick bite to eat , quick service , great prices . Whether on the go or staying in . They have a lot of different options . Highly recommend when you are on the run have to grab a meal"
739,pret-a-manger-new-york-66,2017-10-31,4.0,"This is the third Pret I have been to and I am beginning to notice they are all the same, like most chain establishments, except for the layout. Less grand, bigger space, smaller space, different seating set up, same food like salads and sandwiches. Cool, look, Ginger Beer and Kale Chips.

I grabbed myself a Iced Latte. Besides the clone, but nice, decor and friendly staff. I was offered what milk I would like in my latte. I chose almond. The iced Latte was really good. It wasn't drowned in milk like some other places making the iced Latte nice and creamy white looking. It was actually brown with a little bit of milky white in such that I could taste the coffee while still enjoying the smooth creaminess. I also asked for whipped cream to add a touch of nice.

It was just a quick refresher pick me up.

The only thing negative is supplies and the bench I sat at was stained with crumbs. One cup holder had no cups, it was lacking in napkins and the almond milk to add a bit more to my iced Latte ran out. Even with this I like clone a Pret."
739,pret-a-manger-new-york-66,2019-09-21,4.0,"One of the best Pret a Manger's in the city. The sandwiches are plenty, staff friendly. and plenty of sandwiches options. I was here as most recently as last Wednesday and ordered a nice ice cold brew. I will be back."
739,pret-a-manger-new-york-66,2018-11-29,2.0,"I pick up lunch here quite often, and usually it's quite good. Today, however, the usual chicken/bacon sandwich had bacon that was uncooked.
   Worst:  I took out 2 of the pumpkin soup, which I love and which will be discontinued for the winter. Halfway across 7th avenue, the paper bag holding the 2 soups broke. One soup fell through, splashing my black coat, black bag, boots, and the ground with thick orange pumpkin puree. A woman said, take it back, they'll give you another one. I was too tired at the end of my day to go back and deal with the store. I was covered with soup, and wanted to go home.
   This has put an end to my relationship with Pret A Manger."
739,pret-a-manger-new-york-66,2018-02-05,5.0,"I love this chain for so many reasons. The food is fresh and they offer a wide range of healthy options. My favs are the mini protein pots with salmon or chicken. Reasonably priced for a quick snack. 

I also feel great supporting a company with a focus on sustainability and giving back.

Only suggestion for improvement-the coffee could be better."
739,pret-a-manger-new-york-66,2017-10-15,4.0,"Quick and accommodating. I love coming here. But today she charged me the hazelnut I added in my coffee even though it was a ""free treat"" which applies to milk substitutes, syrups etc. No big deal but Yano.

739,pret-a-manger-new-york-66,2014-06-01,5.0,The best Organic Coffee!!!! Ask for Mocha. Great taste and excellent price. Go and ask for the noodles and different baguettes. Great place and excellent location =)
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2020-03-08,5.0,"Since I got to work in the area, I decided to check out what's good for coffee in the neighborhood on my Ritual app. I stumbled upon Le Cafe so why not?

My lavender latte with oat milk was ready by the time I walked over (within 5 mins). Quick & speedy, my order was ready to be picked up with a breeze. The barista even taped the opening for me so I wouldn't spill it on my way out. But I stayed a little bit longer because there was a pic of a breakfast sammie that caught my eye. Well, had 5 mins left before I had to clock in so I ordered the Rise Up. Now can I tell you how delicious it was?! It looked EXACTLY like the pic in the window. The bagel was soft, chewy, yet crisp on the outside. The eggs scrambled well mixed with seasoned mayo, that made it tasted like an egg salad I could eat whenever (and hell, I'm picky with my egg salads). Plus, there was a good portion of avocado slices with drizzled olive oil. Now, I'm not a breakfast sammie kinda gal, but Le Cafe might just convert me. And the lavender oat latte had the perfect touch of smooth, creamy sweetness I needed to start my day.

The barista was also really warm. Kudos to Le Cafe for hiring an amazing staff. No joke, I'd come back any time. :)"
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2020-01-19,3.0,"The customer service wasn't very welcoming or helpful. The man, I felt was rude. I asked him if he thinks the mocha is really sweet, a pretty easy question and he goes, ""well there's chocolate in it.""
Okay. Awesome. 
I ended up ordering a hazelnut latte with almond milk and my hubs a caramel cappuccino with regular milk. They both tasted great. 
I'm giving them a 3 just because I feel like they had poor customer service."
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2019-12-03,4.0,"Ordered breakfast from here on seamless on a weekday. Tried the avocado toast and asked for an egg on it. Accidentally came with smoked salmon instead of the egg, which was fine with me. The toast was pretty thin/crunchy. There was a generous portion of smashed avocado with a lemon squeeze, chili pepper, and some other spices. Really delicious!! Not super filling since the bread wasn't thick but that's probably just me. Would definitely order again."
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2019-06-06,5.0,"Better coffee and better prices than most of the crazy new spots that have opened in nomad. They use compostable products in place of plastic which is huge for me. I have not tried the food so I can't really speak to that, but it all looked good!"
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2019-11-05,5.0,"Nice, friendly staff.  Above all, good cup of latte and nice to have Vitamin D with natural light, rather than the dark and overcrowded Starbucks across the street."
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2019-09-26,5.0,The coffee here is by far the best at a great price in comparison to the area. The food as well is uniquely different to other places. The services is extremely fast and the staff is as friendly as could be. They create a rapport with their customers. This is definitely my go-to spot before work.
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2019-03-11,5.0,"Such a gem! Part of me wishes I lived in NYC just so I could visit Le Cafe Coffee on a regular basis. The service was great, and all the staff were so nice, upbeat, and helpful. And the coffee... so good!! I ordered the Lavender Latte with an added pump of Vanilla, which was DELICIOUS! I went back for it 2 days in a row and will definitely return again next time I'm in the area. 5/5 highly recommend!"
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2020-01-11,4.0,"Been a while since I grabbed a coffee here, but if it's still serving the same type of coffee and you like La Colombe, this is a good place to grab a quick cup."
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2019-02-18,5.0,I'm so glad I found this spot around my workplace. I order latte and almond croissants and they are DELICIOUS!!!
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2019-06-21,1.0,"Waited over 25 minutes for my order to come out. When it finally came out (after reminding them 4 times) it was the wrong item. Horrible customer service, inedible food."
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2019-02-23,5.0,"I came here for a quick bite and some coffee before a work meeting. The staff was really friendly, the coffee and food were both good, and there was an outlet at the bar for me to charge my phone. I got the flat white and their almond butter toast. Highly recommend both. A great find."
740,le-cafe-coffee-new-york-10,2018-08-23,5.0,"I had an execellent almond cortado! If you are looking for good coffee, nice baristas, and a chic decor, visit Le Cafe Coffee."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2020-01-06,5.0,"On a busy Monday morning,packed to the max your employe Delilah kept the line moving greeting everyone by name & wishing them a good day- it was amazing- all your staff is on point & great when I come here - but Delilah deserves all the raises & promotions bc she set the whole stores tone for a good week back to work the first week of the year  and customer service in this area sucks -not her! 
Thanks for a great start to my day Starbucks 200 Madison - you are the best Starbucks within a 5 block radius"
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2019-09-08,3.0,Extremely friendly staff that was also quick. There's plenty of seating and the full menu is served here. The gender neutral restroom needs to be cleaned ASAP but main dining area is clean. Cafe Latte I ordered was fresh and tasty.
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2019-05-09,4.0,Comfortable seating.  Loved that they played classic American Standards over the music system.  Stuff I have not heard in a long time.  Was kind of surprised the barista did not know anything about their keto friendly drinks so I wound up with just an iced coffee.
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2020-01-09,1.0,"Horrifying music playing WAY too loudly, scrappy interior, disheveled staff. 
(The Music is literally blasting. WTF STARBUCKS?
(Also thought your guys had taste)."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2019-05-14,1.0,The barista incorrectly made my order. I asked for a fix. She gave me crazy attitude and made it a second time the exact same way. There's another Starbucks around the corner.  Save your time and go to that one
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-10-27,4.0,"If you have seen one Starbucks, you have seen them all I think, decor wise. Service is super slow here. And they often forget your orders. It seems to be a very laid back place!  
But since it is one of the few locations where I know that they do a hot chocolate in milk rather than in hot water, it is one of my preferred locations to order a hot cup of chocolate on a rainy day like this when I am trying to lay off imbibing too much coffee."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2018-07-28,3.0,"Long lines, slow staff, same old NYC Starbucks. I really need to stop going to Starbucks in the city lol. You would think I would've learned"
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2019-08-13,5.0,Every time I come to this Starbucks it's a pleasant experience. I come in the morning and all the baristas/expediters know the customers by name and wish each person who picks up a drink to have a a great day. I can see how customers can be a pain in the ass with their requests but all the baristas are very sweet!
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-12-19,3.0,"Bathroom break and coffee.

Nice decor with kind of a nautical themed art on the walls. Plenty of seating and one of the nicer layouts for a Starbucks in a smaller location.

Very nice and clean bathroom,

Staff when I was here seemed on the slow and not too friendly side, but maybe it's because they were busy when I asked them to put toilet paper in the john as it was empty. Guess they don't like to deal with explosive diarrhea while serving up strong coffee!"
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2017-01-28,3.0,"I came to this Starbucks in the early morning.

DRINKS | I ordered an Iced Caramel Macchiato (as usual, what's new?). It tasted fine as any other Starbucks I've been to. Nothing special.

SERVICE | The staff was very friendly as they thanked customers when they went to pick up their drinks/orders. The person ringing my order was also very personable as she recognized we had the same name. (They spelled my name right this time!) I cannot tell how service is once orders pick up though because no one was in line when I walked in.

AMBIANCE & SPACE | I liked that there was a decent amount of space between tables so people could actually walk around without struggling to get seated. (There were individual as well as communal tables). The space is good for doing work or having coffee chats with coworkers. The design of the walls also give off the nice, typical ""coffeehouse"" vibes.

OTHER | They are very welcome to letting dogs inside. This Starbucks also conveniently has a bathroom, which is pretty clean."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-09-10,4.0,"It's a Starbucks but as it happens I was here a few years ago also. I grabbed an iced tea to take out. There are communal and individual tables plus some at the window. 

I found staff to be friendly and dogs are welcome."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-08-22,2.0,"Pretty nice layout and small store. Stopped by for quick drink about lunch time and noticed cashier has no business skills. You dont make people wait in line as another worker has gone off to look for one bagel.

Literally you should keep taking orders as they look for items that are out of stock. The line kept getting longer as paying customers were left stranded as cashier was literally twiddling his thumbs behind the counter. Very unprofessional to say the least. Then cashier takes my order standing 5 feet away in front of baking oven with back turned. Like who trains these workers?

Otherwise drink was usual and ok but these workers need to be retrained in customer service!!"
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2018-02-13,5.0,"I love this starbucks! Everyone here is always friendly and even when they have snotty customers (which is rare from my many visits here), they always keep a smile on and keep on barista-ing. It's amazing to see such great teamwork among their staff and it's even more amazing that they can keep making their drinks like clockwork despite the constant flow of customers.

Would definitely recommend this location if you're in the area (there are a few starbucks stores in the area with less than ideal customer service). Your drinks will taste even better with the smiles!"
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-07-16,1.0,"When I asked for less ice, I got half a cup of tea. Is this really how you do business?"
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-09-26,2.0,"I ordered a toffee nut latte online order, it said ""5 min"". I showed up 10 minutes later and my order still didn't come for another 5-10 minutes; there wasn't even a rush!

In turn, I was late to class and I'm pretty dissatisfied when the response to my unsatisfied request was, ""well, it's started, so what do you want, your drink or a refund?"" with quite the unpleasant tone. 

No bueno :("
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2017-09-21,4.0,"Every time I go to Starbucks I have a great experience.  The baristas are so friendly and attentive.  I know it is easy to phone it in when u are ordering your coffee, but I find being nice and acknowledging the hard work that they do makes for a much more pleasant experience.  

These men and women work very hard to get you something you want and I appreciate it."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2013-11-14,4.0,"Starbucks in Manhattan are many and varied. My criteria for judging is: How do they handle the line/wait time.......Is it well lit........do they have adequate seating.........do they have a bathroom......are the employees happy or are they just phoning it in.
This location its on all cylinders. I will walk a couple of extra blocks  to get here."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2015-07-22,2.0,"So Ghetto after 8pm....Unprofessional at its best....
Employees talking about their Zodiac's amongst each other like the place is closed but they are still open...
Very cold...Air conditioning on High to get customers to leave....
After 8pm on Weds. the customers tell the employees when the milk containers are empty..
Today July 22 after 8pm very Ghetto in this Starbucks...

And dont bother calling me a racist - im from the ghetto and of the same race as the staff....
but I dont want my neighborHOOD experience in starbucks..."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2015-09-25,1.0,"Customers couldn't used the bathroom because ""someone made a mess and it's really dirty.."" They hadn't yet had a ""chance"" to clean up. Thirty minutes later same employee describing the dirty bathroom as having ""chunks everywhere"". 

Yet, there were four customers (including myself) and about five employees all doing nothing. Tables were messy. Garbage overflowing. 

Worst Starbucks I have ever visited."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2015-01-09,3.0,"Exhausted is an understatement....

I had 6 cups of chai lattes.... my Ritalin and I can't talk....Yeah...I may have died today....I don't know....

Starbucks is really good....Try the White Chocolate Mocha or their chai lattes....they are perfect for the cold stormy weather in New York City.... Just get a ""tall"" to see if you like it....their seasonal drinks are awesome too....The desserts are divine! Love their pumpkin bread! Starbucks is sort of pricey though...but it's a great place to chill out after a long day walking around in the  big city... Lots of seating...yes there are restrooms...enjoyyy!!!"
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-01-26,5.0,"Nicest baristas ever! i even saw two of them at Chick Fil A and they greeted me so warmly. 
I actually remembered their names too, Hawaa & Princess. 
Athena runs a great show there. 
She greets so many people by name, its amazing what a memory she has ... heck, she even remembers how to pronounce MINE and always with a smile."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2015-02-08,3.0,Just another starbucks in the city. Great place to stop by to get your coffee fix. Friendly staff.
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2015-03-27,5.0,Barista Shamica did a fantastic job preparing me me my 1st ever Americano beverage and it was really awesome.  Her personality made the Starbucks visit 5 Stars.
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-04-08,3.0,"It's clean, Toilet is open, so it is good but it is FREEZING INSIDE. I went there on a cold rainy day after visit to Morgan library to find their AC full blast. Forget about study, You hardly can stay longer than 20 m in there."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2017-11-03,5.0,Great baristas that actually remember your name. Customer service at its best. I am amazed of how enthusiastic the employees are at this location.
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-06-21,1.0,Guy making the coffee is very slow and distracted here needs training. A couple of weeks later still very slow and they did not do very well dealing with a customer who got frustrated waiting and demanded his money back. He just wanted to leave and they had trouble doing the refund eventually he got his money and stormed out.
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2015-11-24,3.0,The drinks are always accurate here but the service is extremely slow which causes a long line to form when it comes to ordering and even more so when it comes to waiting for your drink.
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2015-09-19,1.0,Always order a latte with one Splenda. Told to walk across store and get it myself. Fail. First store not to have it themselves. Manager take note.
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2012-01-08,2.0,"My heart belongs to Stumptown now ,but when it's not within arm's reach I'm usually carrying a Starbucks cup. I've been to many and this one needs to reorganize ! I noticed every customer had to come up and ask for their drink. I think they should start calling out the patron's name when their drink is done to avoid confusion. I watched about 4 people get the wrong drink in about 20 minutes. My Venti Earl Grey tea took about 20 mins to come out and I had to ask where it was.  Owells. I'm just glad this particular place isn't my local stop."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-09-21,5.0,Absolutely my favorite Starbucks in the city. The employees here are wonderful and go out of their way to make you feel at home! Any issue I've ever had has been quickly rectified - they really go above and beyond. And they make the best iced lattes. Fabulous!
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2011-07-21,4.0,"I've been in A LOT of the Starbucks in Manhattan. I know, I really should lay off the caffeine. It's not so small as to feel cramped (you can usually find a seat) but don't go with a large group.

Even though it's smaller than some, it gets four stars for how clean it always is and the workers who are always fun. The chemistry between them is great and, if you're lucky, you'll get to hear some funny banter while they whip up your mocha. They've never messed up my order, but I don't order crazy drinks so take it for what it is.

I've been using it about twice a week for a while and so far I have not been disappointed. If it had more space I would easily give it five stars."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2016-08-08,2.0,"In the morning, it is pretty good. After 5 pm the place becomes dirty and loud. The music is blasting to a point that I am unable to have a conversation. I thought the idea behind Starbucks was for people to have a conversation in an upscale setting over a good quality cup of coffee. I guess the concept remained in the idea stage. 50% of the time I went there the bathrooms were closed under a pretense that they were broken. I used the go there very regularly, so it didn't make sense. Coffee is also not wonderful. I have a feeling that they don't wash their equipment and their filters frequently enough, so after a while it impacts the taste. On top of that, more often than not, it is not hot - it's warm. But, the worst think is the loud music. After a while I stopped going to Starbucks all together, and am now going to their competitors."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2010-11-15,4.0,"Compared to other Starbs in the area this one is much faster, even during the typically busy hours. It gets far less (tourist) traffic than the one on 35th and 5th which is why I prefer it - just cuts down the line and wait time significantly. The staff is super friendly too, which definitely isn't typical...again a stark and pleasant contrast to the one on 35th and 5th where they inexplicably hold your drink hostage behind the bar and treat you like you're some kind of nuisance. 

If you're looking for a place to sit the table area here is mid-sized but again, since usually it isn't packed, you should be able to get a seat without a problem."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2009-09-17,4.0,"This place defies all logic. It's corporate and dripping in the sins of low wages, limited health care, and the economic exploitation of developing countries.

So why are the staff so effing amazing? How do they all remember my name? I only come in once a week or so. It's like they actually care about their job...

One day I forgot to say ""iced"" and ended up with a regular latte. They didn't bat an eye, didn't get mad, didn't roll their eyes. They actually SMILED and made me another one with a line of people out the door. 

I wonder if maybe they aren't a Starbucks at all, but a bunch of Scientologists measuring engrams to suck us all in. Next week:  complimentary audits all around!"
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2013-05-01,3.0,"I think they could be a little more friendly. It doesn't take much to smile. They are missing that ""thing"" to make them better. But besides that it was OK, at most."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2008-09-29,4.0,"Decent, as far as Starbucks go. . . this Madison Avenue location is a small place with personable employees who keep things moving and never let the lines get too long. 

When I was visiting I wished that it were bigger, only because there isn't enough seating for the lunch hour crowds who flock to this place.  Lots of low, mellow music being pumped in on the speakers.  Only negative: the selection of baked goods is mediocre to poor.  But I find that to be the case with most Starbucks, anyway."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2011-04-11,3.0,"This is a fine, clean and comfortable location. It had a great staff, too,  but there have been some recent changes, and I miss the old guard. (Shout out to Kenny M. and to Diamond.)"
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2015-12-14,4.0,"i was in a mood for a stomach turning smores ice frappe on a nice monday afternoon while playing hooky from work (my lunch breaks usually last about 4 hours sometimes,cause it's good to be the king) now as for size i can tell you thats it's one of the bigger sbucks around with its location of 36th st and madison ave , it hugs the corner and it's easy to notice . i really like the spacious layout with plenty of tables and seats to sit and enjoy , with ordering  area in rear or front depending where you are standing has a easy system to order your hot or cold beverages or maybe your dessert or sandwich, etc. i like this spot cause it's not that crowded or dirty like some other sbucks. the workers are friendly and do chat with the customers . i ask for a extra sweet frappe and it was , plus  a slice of lemon pound cake and i am a happy camper . i am not a regular at starbucks cause i feel it's kinda overpriced and at times the drinks do a number on my tummy but i don't mind this starbucks location and the music of the day which was some mellow folk rock music was on a decent level. overall 4 stars for drink, dessert, service, and cleanliness , one star remove cause a few hobos were inside sleeping ."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2010-09-01,4.0,"With today's heatwave, stoping at your near by Starbucks isn't a bad idea."
741,starbucks-new-york-447,2015-06-24,1.0,"The worst Starbucks around.  They're always out of milk/cream.  The bathroom is always being cleaned/out of order, but they rarely have a sign up saying what's going on or why.  You end up just standing there for 10 minutes before an employee comes over and tells you that the bathroom is closed.  I've been here like 6 times, and this has happened like 4 of he times I was there."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2017-11-29,4.0,"Staff is super friendly and line moves quick! My go to Starbucks if I get coffee before work. Sometimes the wait for your drink can be long so definitely add some extra time in but it's a really busy Starbucks so it makes sense.

My go to is a blonde roast, chai tea latte or one of their holiday drinks. Can't really go wrong with those. Price is expensive but so are all the coffee shops in nyc if you don't go to a deli :)"
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2018-10-06,2.0,"Staff is completely undertrained and overwhelmed. I walked in and ordered two very simple drinks, iced americano and an iced latte. There was no line and there were two other customers waiting for their orders. My barista somehow managed to mess up both my drinks. I accepted to take the latte how it was to help speed up my process, but when I got my americano, there was clearly not enough espresso in the drink (watered down and almost see through). 

When I asked my barista how many shots was in my beverage, he answered that there should be 3.. I don't understand how he wouldn't know how many he put in, he just made the drink. 

He went ahead and made the drink again. Management needs to retrain their employees."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2019-12-03,3.0,"I like the employees here, but I really wish they understood what ""light ice"" means. For the second time in the past week I asked for light ice and instead received a cup filled to the top with ice and only a few ounces of iced coffee. Such a waste. Why am I paying $4 for a cup of ice with barely any coffee?"
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2019-02-10,1.0,Quite possibly one of the worst Starbucks in the city. The blonde roast seems to be always broken as well as ever changing staff and horrible Baristas!!
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2018-09-21,2.0,"Needed my morning java so I stopped here.  The inside is very spacious and filled with seating. 

Ordered my normal grande iced coffee, put my cream in it and left.  Finally took a sip after walking a block and it tasted like dirty water or something.  No flavor of coffee at all.  Waste of the almost $4.  Would not stop here again."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2016-12-03,4.0,"This is a really nice Bux worthy of respect. There are a lot of things to like about this Bux.

It's the first floor to an office building so you can wait down here if you're early for a meeting or job interview. 

Lots of seating and even a secluded section if you need to have a private conversation.

Pretty clean.

Has restrooms.

I would say this Bux is ""good for groups"" because of the spacious seating. 

The staff is friendly and cool. I had Nitro Cold Brew here and a gentleman barista recommended ""the best"" way to enjoy the Nitro Cold Brew - without ice. I appreciated that! But... Ultimately, I prefer it with ice.

Love it here and I'll totes be back."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2016-08-22,3.0,"Eh. Small location. Strange seating layout. 

Located on Park Ave South and close to the subway stop on 33rd street. When I was working close by I would hit this one up on occasion. 

Iced coffee was ok. As some stated service can be kind of slow here.

Walk around to the far side and find some counter window seating in a quiet area. Overall not much seating as compared to other locations. 

Seemed clean though the times I was there. Serves it's purpose if looking for a caffeine fix."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2019-01-05,5.0,I work between a couple of Starbucks' and I prefer this one. I stop by almost every day and the staff greets me with smiles every time. In nyc that's rare so it's something I appreciate. They also know me by name now and a few of them have memorized my order
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2017-03-09,3.0,I've never had any issues coming to this Starbucks. The staff is super friendly and always willing to give you a free drink or upsize your drink for free if they make a mistake. I love Starbucks particularly because you can customize your drinks to your liking with a variety of dairy products and alternative sweeteners. Now that you can place your order in advance this saves so much time standing in line and your order is always ready by the time you reach to pick it up. The one bad about this location is The construction in the area. It's so difficult to find this location because there's a significant amount of scaffolding around it. The Starbucks is also tucked in the corner of a corporate building so it doesn't really stand out and on the street like 34th and Park Avenue.
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2019-07-31,1.0,"Deafening music greets you as you enter this location. It looks like it has been under construction for years but is still open. The staff ranges from aloof to cheerful depending on the phase of the moon. Today I wanted half and half for my coffee, but they ""ran out for the day"". Why not run out to the store and buy a few quarts? Never again. Horrible attitudes."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2017-09-19,5.0,"Once I had to go to the doctor for a check up and needed to put something in my stomach.  I was extremely thankful for this small Starbucks and the fact that they were not crowded and I was able to sit, relax and enjoy my food and coffee."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2016-05-17,4.0,"Some may think what makes a Starbucks different than the other million stores but there are really some reasons and I'm not even talking about some special interior design cuz this one is more or the less has same design with many others but has more space inside so you do not feel as if on line for free food or see. 

I should say, the registers work really fast. Waiting on line is more annoying than waiting for your order. It never took me more than a minute to order and than 3 minutes to pick my order and leave. Once the half&half was over and when i asked more, the guy brought the new ones right away. 

I usually get the multi-grain bagel, toasted with cream cheese and regular coffee so have not much to complain about but i have tried the marble cake last week, they were better before  without chocolate coating on top but it has nothing to do with this specific store. Long story short, one of my fav locations."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2018-05-27,4.0,"despite the scaffolding outside, this is a very nice, clean, quiet location. inside is quite spacious with lots of good seating available for studying or hanging out, including a large table for larger groups and many seats along windows facing 34th street. wifi available, super close to subway, and personally a very convenient place for me when I really need to go out and get work done."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2016-06-02,2.0,"I dont normally write bad reviews, but this is the worst Starbucks ive ever been too. Unfortunately, ive been coming here the past 3 weeks, but will be utilizing other nearby coffee shops or the other starbucks on park.

They have roughly 8 people working and they are Sooooo slooowwww!!!!!!! We waited 15 min for oatmeal one time and then they forgot items.

The self serve stations almost always has empty milk pourers, out of the hot beverage holsters ..you betcha.

You just order a coffee? expect to wait as well, even for black.

This location really needs more efficiency in assembly!"
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2018-09-25,1.0,There is a huge long line always and 4 registers with only one person working. Terrible management and customer service ...get it together . They need to stop socializing with each other behind the bar and work!!!
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2016-09-26,2.0,"I come here out of necessity, not loyalty. It's Starbucks, so the drinks/food are always relatively consistent, but the service here is terrible! I genuinely don't understand how I always end up waiting at least 15-20 minutes for an iced coffee, even if there are only a few people in front of me. Baristas are friendly enough, but preparing drinks at a snail's pace in a busy office building doesn't cut it.

Wifi is also spotty, so don't come here with work if you absolutely need internet."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2017-04-25,5.0,Love this Starbucks! Great service! I order a cold brew probably 3x a week via the mobile app and it's always ready when I walk in! And the guy who manages mobile orders in the morning is so nice! Good job Starbucks!
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2017-08-29,1.0,The most unfriendly Starbucks in my entire experience at this business. You must purchase before you are allowed the bathroom code :(
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2017-06-26,3.0,"Maybe it's just me. Or maybe I've become a coffee snob after drinking Gregory's and Birch coffee in New York.  Maybe it's the different locations for Starbucks. Or maybe Starbucks changed their roasts/brewing. Anyhoo, I like bold coffee.  I used to drink it daily and loved it. Then something changed.  The coffee I loved didn't taste the same anymore.  Same roast, same way I prep it. It just isn't as good, to me.  I just get a drip coffee, nothing special. If you are a specialty coffee drinker this review may not apply."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2015-03-26,3.0,"As Starbuckses go, this is a pretty good one. The staff is friendly and knows me and my ""usual"" order. Never had a serious problem with them. But here are my grievances nonetheless:

1) the way the place is laid out, it's hard for the staff to see certain corners of the store. This leads bums to occasionally hang out in such corners. They're like the ""guards"" from Legends of the Hidden Temple. You're going around the corner thinking everything's good, then BOOM all the seats are taken up by a guy with a bunch of garbage bags muttering to himself. 

2) The manager insists on making employees follow what I assume is in the corporate manual when they announce your drink is ready, and makes them act really excited about it and like they had an awesome time making it. Like ""Carolllllllllll I have your unsweetened iced coffeeeeeeeeee!"" Don't give me artificial emotions when all you really want to do is take my money and move on to the next guy. This isn't a strip club and even if it was, I'm not stupid enough to think that ""that one really liked me, no, seriously, I could tell.""

3) They need to work on their unwarmed pastry delivery procedure. I would say that 1 in 5 times I order an unwarmed cookie, they forget about it and I have to ask. Or they mistake the cashier writing ""CHCC"" for chocolate croissant instead of a cookie and I have to correct them. Or they just grab a bunch of orders all at once and bring it to the warmer thing and I have to cut them off before they make it all gross and melty which is why I don't get it warmed. 

4) they have one of those tables with a bunch of wooden chairs. Those things are ready to fall apart. The screws are loose and you can feel the parts of the chair sliding away from each other. Makes you scared to move, which leads you to stay in uncomfortable positions. Not to mention that eventually some old lady is going to break the chair, and her hips, and sue the fuck out of them and call everybody in the damn store as a witness. 

Carolllllllllll, I have your subpoenaaaaaa....."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2017-02-12,4.0,Probably one of my favorite locations because it's big. The lines are sometimes a bit slow and sometimes they miss your order when they're preparing the drinks but I come here for convenience and the large amount of seating.
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2013-01-06,2.0,"A pretty bad Starbucks - there are much better ones close by. 

The staff is friendly, but very very slow - its pointless. Espresso has never tasted right here.

I guess for the pre-teen drinks that most people come to Starbucks for its alright.

Hardly any seating and feeling that the place is dirty."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2017-01-23,2.0,"My venti cafe misto was given to me as a grande, not made correctly. I asked the barista is this a venti,? he replies ""yes"". Knowing I have a grande in my hand. Their prepping of beverages is horrendous. I tried and every time I order anything nearly fancy it is somehow a disaster."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2016-07-14,1.0,"I am addicted to espresso. Not on its own, but in mocha form - it helps to caffeinate me AND keep me full. So I get at least one a day (at least!). I usually don't have a problem. Except this Starbucks - when I have a star reward, they always botch it and charge me. And today when I tried to explain to them that I had a free drink, they gave me a cup of FLAVORED MILK (it's a hot chocolate) instead of my mocha. My mocha that I know very, very well. Super disappointed."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2014-10-27,1.0,"Awful. The wait time is like five minutes, even with no foot traffic. Plus, the cashier is rude (yes, I know where to get my drink; I was waiting for the receipt that you never gave me). I came here (a little groggy) to try the Pumpkin Spice Frappaccino. Instead, I got some iced coffee concoction with ice cubes. THIS IS NOT A FRAPPACCHINO. But, I was groggy and thirsty and I drank it anyway. Even though I was fuming inside. But damn, it was still tasty."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2018-02-11,1.0,"Worst Starbucks I've ever been to. While I was waiting for my order, I heard the cashier and barista bad mouthing customers. The cashier was also really rude and was acting as if she was doing me a favor. While she was making my tea as slow as humanly possible, she managed to give me the wrong tea bag while bad mouthing customers. Horrible customer service. I'll never be back."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2017-10-09,5.0,"This is my favorite Starbucks - I come every day, and they take the time to get to know their customers.  Colline, specifically, has gone out of her way to make sure that me and all customers are having a positive experience."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2014-04-11,3.0,"It's a standard Starbucks with a few distinguishing factors.

The servers are friendly but extremely forgetful. I ordered a pastry and in the process of preparing the  pastry to be heat up they didn't even ask me for my drink order and rang me up. That's fine except after placing my drink order and paying they forgot about my pastry."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2016-08-01,2.0,The staff here loves to either forget your order or mess it up or leave your cup half empty. I ordered an item from a bakery here and someone just completely forgot about it. Ordered a green tea frapp in a grande cup and only got a tall amount... Stay away
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2014-04-10,4.0,"This place is awesome I get my coffee fix the staff is efficient & friendly and they open super early every morning, it always looks clean, people remember you have to speak clearly if you want to get your order right the other day the guy in front of me mumble he's order than got upset when he's whatever he had was wrong, he's gonna get a ""special"" latte one day, don't mess with the people making your drink or food"
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2015-09-08,1.0,"This place is real shit show.  One positive is the space is huge.  Unfortunately, the cashiers and Baristas are for the most part indifferent or just plain rude.  Wait times are unacceptable as well.  I waited 5 minutes for an Iced Coffee and there was one person in front of me.  Not one of the better Starbucks, which is surprising considering the location."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2011-04-18,3.0,"After three additional years of going here (almost) daily, I felt like I should update my review. As before, the employees are still competent, and friendly I would say 75% of the time - pretty good for the service industry.

I would love to give them a fourth star, but after three years, even though they know the 2 or 3 drinks I rotate between, they think my name is Steven.

...I stopped correcting them a few months ago, so now I kind of have a Starbucks alter-ego."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2015-08-05,2.0,Today is August 5th. This place has been blasting Christmas music for about an hour now. Two stars because this is infuriating.
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2016-07-05,1.0,"What a nightmare. Service slow and you need a code to use the restroom. Even with code, restroom a disgrace. Board of Health needs to intervene. Tables filthy. No one cleans anything!! Garbage cans overflowing. 

Not a pleasant Starbucks to frequent on 34th St. and Park Ave, in Manhattan."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2015-09-18,4.0,"Great Starbucks, off the tourist grid, more of neighborhood and cube monkeys' vibe. Nice large roomy space so you're not fighting for a seat."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2011-07-14,4.0,"Huge space, with plenty of tables, seating, and power outlets!

The deuce bathrooms are great in case someone is droppin a deuce - you got a backup.

Sometimes the wait is a bit long, but the line moves efficiently.  

I noticed plenty of NYU Med students studying here - it's a great place to get some work done."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2016-03-31,5.0,"Roomy Starbucks which is fast becoming rare since they're down sizing a lot of locations.  It gets extremely busy  during the early morning and evening rush.  Great spot to bring your laptop or favorite book to read but it fills up with college students in the evening. Top of the line customer service, the staff are extremely organized and handle the influx of customers during the the rush hours perfectly.  Two moderately kept restrooms are available.   Kudos to the great staff at this Starbucks location."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2013-07-29,5.0,"I like this Starbucks for it's large size. More seating than an average NYC Starbucks.
Service is typically good."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2013-11-13,4.0,"Service has been fine here, and it's larger than you'd expect it to be (from the street it looks pretty small, assuming you can see it through the scaffolding that's been up around the building for a while).

Lots of outlets to charge, and plenty of seating."
742,starbucks-new-york-306,2016-09-02,1.0,"The only positive about this Starbuck's location is that it is extremely convenient since I work in the building.  The staff on the other hand is a negative - at least 7 people behind the counter one day yet it took virtually 2 full minutes before I was asked for my order, AND THEN they screwed it up by giving me caffeinated Pike instead of decaf (not brain surgery).  Two days later they screwed up my pastry order.  Stop chatting with each other, AND THE CUSTOMERS, and pay attention to your task."
743,olives-new-york-4,2017-08-18,4.0,"We walked by with a belly full of sushi but I was hankering hard for something sweet. Michelle overheard us joking that dessert was just too much at the moment and interjected
""U talking about the ring dings!?""
Um, no... but now she's got our, well definitely mine- ""what is a ring ding"". Michelle pointed to little biscuits wrapped in foil, like I would or should know them. ""They are just the perfect chocolate cakes with vanilla in the middle.""
Ok she had me at chocolate cake. And perfect. Or just at cake. But perfect chocolate cake with vanilla?! I cannot even discern- is she speaking English?
As if on cue, my companion has a light bulb moment, ""oh, it's one of the hostess desserts... u never had a ring ding? Like a ho-ho?""
Oh, that. As if sensing my hesitance, Michelle goes ""u know what? Here, I'm gonna let u try it.""
Giddy as a school girl, I love trying and being given samples. As she open and cut, Sam was completely right- it's one of the indistinguishable childhood white wrapper deli treats for about 75 cents. ""No, that's too much, just half of that!"" As Michelle insisted I take a quarter of the ring ding to try. 

Once in my mouth, it's an entirely different story.

The chocolate is like a soft crumbling shell upon contact, only comprising of the lightest, moistest, airy, devil's food cake folded around a dollop of vanilla cream. The entire bite was light and barely sweetened as if to let the chocolate be the first and last taste in your mouth. I had one bite... and that was all it took. This is no regular ring ding from PS130. This is baker's genius at play. I reminded my friend of what he said to me a long time ago about the perfect slice.

""Everyone has their local favorite pizzeria. But the best slice is the one that has the perfect proportion of good bread to sauce to cheese ratio."" - (Sam P. )

I am quoting my friend here. That is the Ring Ding, the dessert u never knew existed that will blow your mind  when proportioned perfectly. 

*i think I must have used perfect 6 times in 150 words*"
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-10-06,3.0,"Pretty good, but quite overpriced.

I got a soup and half sandwich - after tax and a 10% tip, my total came out to $16. That's absolutely absurd, considering my half sandwich was TINY and poorly put together. It was very difficult to eat as it was basically falling apart.

That being said, the ingredients they use are definitely fresh and taste good. I just don't think I can justify spending this much on such little food... I would've had to spend $20+ if I got a full sandwich and soup! Crazy!"
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-12-04,4.0,"Nice and quick for small time eating. Lunch break is so rushing, lots of people on the line and it went fast. I had noodles salad, too tasteless but I have no another choice."
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-08-10,5.0,"Neat place, very organized, lots of yum pastries. The cold brew is strong! Staff are super friendly and helpful."
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-12-27,1.0,Terrible. Rude service. Overpriced. Sourdough bread was overcharred. Caesar dressing like water. $50 in the trash.
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-11-25,1.0,"Not only are the people that work here rude, they gave me the wrong sandwich, after I confirmed with them twice. If you want a sandwich go Le district people are nice and the food is better."
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-10-28,1.0,Guilt tipping.  The fact that they even ask for a 20% off your credit card for a 2 minute visit at the countet after i grab my own salad off the shelf is reprehensible.
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-05-09,3.0,Love this place! I wish they were on Ritual/Grubhub though. There are always long lines. Also wish they didn't use tea bags with plastic satchels. Heating plastic releases carcinogens.
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-04-30,5.0,"The owner, Nick, is awesome. Very caring. Very thoughtful. For me food is about the people and if it's being served and created by people like Nick it's got my rating."
743,olives-new-york-4,2018-12-09,5.0,I really forgot the name of this sandwich but it was delicious!!!! This was my first time in New York and thanks to the food I left even more happy back to Miami!!
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-10-27,1.0,"Order a medium tea, you get one tea bag. Order a large tea and you still get just one tea bag. So you pay more for a watered down tea. And if you ask for another tea bag....nope. Customer satisfaction isn't priority. You still just get weak tea. Wish I had gone to Starbucks"
743,olives-new-york-4,2017-07-14,1.0,"Tried the $4.00 ""triple chocolate chip cookie with sea salt"" - in a word: overpriced.  Cookie was far too flat with no chew, chocolate flavors were singular, and overall, taste was - 2.5, texture a 2, value for money a 1.  Go uptown to Schmackarys or Levain for much much better cookies at half the price and triple the taste.  P.S. the server was nice and friendly though."
743,olives-new-york-4,2016-03-03,4.0,"Seems like one of the less popular vendors at Brookfield Place during lunch. They probably get more people for breakfast. For lunch they sell primarily pre-made cold sandwiches, soup, and salad. I actually quite like the Roasted Shiitake Mushroom sandwich, which contains oven dried tomatoes with cress and herb ricotta on a sourdough baguette. The sandwich has decent amounts of each ingredient. I love the creamy ricotta, tangy tomatoes, and texture from the cress and mushrooms. The combination creates a very light and tasty sandwich. It's even better if you toast it in the oven first.

I also tried their Stirato Baquette with Roasted Turkey, Gravy, Cranberry Sauce, and Romaine. They usually have this around Thanksgiving as a special. The flavors definitely remind you of Thanksgiving with the cranberry and gravy, but the texture is offputting because they use ground turkey which turns into a mushy mess. Definitely not as good as their shiitake mushroom sandwich."
743,olives-new-york-4,2015-09-25,4.0,"This is one of the few brookfield place coffee spots and is run by an independent coffee shop owner they have two locations in battery park. They have some very tasty coffee. 

In addition to the coffee overings they make fresh sandwhiches and egg sandwhiches. What also makes this place nice is that they constantly change their menu by offering new daily items on the menu to keep you guessing.
  
It is a little bit on the high cost side but that is what you get from brookfield place and from an independent owner.

This coffee cafe is part of my work week coffee rotation and I suggest you try it.

In short:
- Good coffee
- A little pricey
- Unique fresh cooked food items
- Drink coffee and eat overlooking the hudson"
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-07-28,5.0,"Great, healthy option at Hudson Eats that's pretty underrated. Also, their yellowfin tuna sandwich is one of my favorites - so fresh, simple ingredients, and the perfect amount of food."
743,olives-new-york-4,2016-11-20,2.0,"The namesake sandwich, at $10.50, didn't provide the size or flavor that I would have expected. The really good ingredients like the provolone competed for attention with the abundant lettuce. It was pre-made which is great for convenience but not so much for the food."
743,olives-new-york-4,2017-07-30,4.0,"Went here to grab a bite to eat after walking around the city on a Sunday. After checking out the menu, I decided to go with the noodles with peanut sauce and veggies. It was pretty good, though I would have loved if they did not have them prepackaged. Nevertheless, it was still pretty tasty and a good size for the price."
743,olives-new-york-4,2019-02-02,1.0,"They served me the worst grilled tuna sandwich I have ever had in my life. That's quite a distinction, although hardly a good one. How was it bad? Multigrain bread so bad that it falls apart into little chunks before you can grab and eat it. However, not toasted (which would have made it a bit firmer). A bad cut of tuna, the kind that again falls into little pieces as you're trying to wrestle with it. This typically comes from thawing and refreezing. And overcooked, so that there's no pink. The garnish? Watercress which was marinated in vinegar. Ouch, why do they have to do that? Eating something that acid is not much fun. And to boot, the sandwiches are pre-made, not made to order. Yeah, it took only 30 seconds to get my food, but that's not a good sign either."
743,olives-new-york-4,2018-09-12,1.0,"Don't bother. Not only is the food disappointing for the price, the service is awful! So so rude and condescending. I even spoke to the manager who gave me even more of an attitude. Not accommodating to my dietary restrictions whatsoever. Way better places to have lunch in Broomfield than here."
743,olives-new-york-4,2016-03-13,4.0,"I've worked in Hudson Eats for almost 2 years and pass by this place all the time, yet I've only ever gotten espresso, coffee, or their cool nitro (nitrogen coffee) drink. 

Today I actually went with the smoked turkey sandwich which was recommended by Luna.  The description doesn't describe anything ingenious, just a plain ol' turkey bacon sandwich. But it's actually a really tasty sandwich. The bacon is cooked perfectly - not too crispy and not too chewy. The turkey isn't skimped and stays true to its name with the smokiness.  There were a lot of things in this sandwich, so for it to hold together during the entire meal was impressive (for me at least :D) Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't the best sandwich I've ever eaten in my life, but you've gotta appreciate the good ingredients they put in there.

If you're around the area, come by for a tasty sandwich made with fresh ingredients, oh and great quality coffee!

Definitely coming up with an update of other things on the menu!"
743,olives-new-york-4,2017-04-12,2.0,"I once ordered a salad here.  That was a mistake.

10 minutes and $10 later, I finally received 7 huge chunks of romaine, a sprinkle of parmesan, and a plastic capsule of generic gloop.  I then spent another 10 minutes trying in vain to coat my caesar-chunks with dressing, using just the undersized container (not even bowl shaped) and the fork they forgot to give me (had to go back).

In the end, some of the luckier bites tasted fine, sort of.  But why pay money to a restaurant for that?"
743,olives-new-york-4,2016-12-22,1.0,"First and last time at Olive's. Way, way, way over priced. Ordered the Smoked Turkey sandwich with 2 bottles of water. Had I known the sandwich would have been on plain white bread, I would have saved my $18.57 and made it at home. Very disappointed. P.S. make your own sandwich at home. Not worth it."
743,olives-new-york-4,2018-10-24,5.0,"Great coffee, salads and bagels. This place always has a line but it moves quickly and the food is really tasty. As is everything else in the area, it's a little pricey but at least you know you're getting good food."
743,olives-new-york-4,2018-11-05,1.0,This place was horrible!!! Do Not Go they will scam you out of money and make treat you terribly..... I was there last week and the male cashier got flustered and charged me twice for my order! Claiming that the first one did not go through even after I showed him my bank account that proved the withdrawal.... he calls over another female who also insisted that I had to pay again. So I did.... we waited 20min for 2 sandwiches and ended up paying $67.00 for both because even a week later my bank shows 2 transactions happening! AGAIN terrible customer service
743,olives-new-york-4,2014-09-12,4.0,"I stopped here twice Thursday. 

Love the fact there is plenty of seating and the coffee isn't too shabby.

Second time round a gentleman came up and asked how my soy latte was. ..I didn't really look up and just answered truthfully that it could have beeen hotter.

Oh boy i realise its the guy that served me  . He introduces himself as the owner we engage in some chit chat about coffee and buisness.

Next thing I know a new  hot coffee appears on my table from another member of staff compliments of the house.

Now that's good customer service."
743,olives-new-york-4,2018-03-09,5.0,"I work at american express and come down to olives fairly often. Aside from the delicious food and coffee, the staff is fantastic. They are so friendly and make a point of getting to know their clientele - they'll remember your name and favorite order... One of those things that sets this place apart from the national chain coffee shops."
743,olives-new-york-4,2018-01-22,4.0,"I love Olive's!  I should preface this by saying -- this is strictly a coffee and sweets review.  When I'm in the mood for some coffee, I headed to Olive's. When everyone else is going to Starbucks, I'm headed to Olive's. I have never had a bad experience with there. Their coffee is always on point. They use Stumptown, which is amazing coffee, and Olive's knows how to brew it to perfection!  The treats are oversized so you might get more than you originally bargained for but that's not a complaint by any means. I normally get the iced coffee with almond milk and have tried both the decaf and regular -- both are great!  Definitely stop by if you are in Brookfield Place. I prefer it over any of the other coffee places in there-- Starbucks, Financier, Le District, Black Seed Bagel, Tartinery.  Enjoy!"
743,olives-new-york-4,2018-11-12,2.0,"here, they'll charge you 5 dollars for a pain au chocolate and not even warm it up for you. And then claim they have no toaster to toast the pastry. It's pretty crazy to charge top dollars for that service, not to mention the pain au chocolate was not fresh"
743,olives-new-york-4,2018-10-27,5.0,I love this little spot!! They have the best soup! I wish they had more vegetarian soup options but it's still worthy of 5 stars!
743,olives-new-york-4,2016-03-03,2.0,"So many staffers yet so little productivity. Took forever to even order, let alone get rung up for, their ginger lemon frostie, which I didn't know the price or name of due to mismatched signs near the 2 registers, one of which you can't actually pay at. The $4.36 Dessert (On receipt as 'The Cookie Monster') had a very awkward texture, basically the middle ground between a ginger snap and a soft ginger cookie, but frosting almost saved it."
743,olives-new-york-4,2017-12-02,1.0,$12 for a sandwich the size equivalent of half a baguette and made yesterday? I think a refrigerated sandwich at Hudson News in LGA is a better option. No thanks.
743,olives-new-york-4,2016-05-05,4.0,"This is located on the second floor in the mall by the Time Inc. building and stands at the entrance of the Hudson Eats suite. It's tiny and I was surprised at the number of folks who were crowded behind the counter taking orders, pouring coffee, and making breakfast.

They make big brekkie sandwiches and basic coffee with milk. The egg, ham, and cheese sandwich I got was so massive I could only eat half, which value-wise, was excellent as I ate it for lunch too.

The staff are speedy and know everyone has got to rush off to work so they're diligent. And the cute part is, even in this mall location, they know their regulars and their orders. I like Olive a lot."
743,olives-new-york-4,2016-10-13,4.0,"I really like Olives in Soho. They just moved to a bigger space, which is terrific.  Mwah!  

This Olives doesn't have the oldworld charm that the original has.  But I still get a great sandwich (Shitake is my fav) and cake whenever I'm in the area.  The coffee is pretty good too.  I think they sell CounterCulture, but I could be wrong.

I also had a Caesar salad that was good last week.

So, check out this place."
743,olives-new-york-4,2016-08-05,1.0,"I came here for the first and last time. I ordered a simple caesar salad. It came with no croutons tomatoes and the cheese was just slapped on top of the lettuce. It came with not enough dressing and I had to pay .82 for extra dressing on top of the salad already being $9.25. 

I thought it would taste fresh. It was the worst money spent. Duane Reade salads are better. 

This place was Over priced and not good. If you're going to charge that much be a decent place and at least make sure it tastes good and add some croutons you cheapos!  This place sucks!"

743,olives-new-york-4,2016-04-25,4.0,"I love Olive's coffee! I have worked in Brookfield place for nearly 2 years now and their coffee never disappoints. Occasionally there are some mishaps with my order, but when you are coming on a daily basis it's to be expected and the staff works very hard to make sure they are taking care of you. Howie is great to chat with while you wait for your order and ALL the barista's know how to make a great drink. 

Though there is usually a crowd (about 10 places serve coffee in the Brookfield Place/Hudson Eats area, most people choose to come here) it is well worth the wait and it is usually less than 5 minutes. For the regular customers, they even remember if you like to add sugar to your drink and either leave it uncapped for you when you pick it up, or if you are someone that likes to grab it and go they remember to put a cap and sleeve for you. Now that's attention to detail!"
743,olives-new-york-4,2017-02-25,5.0,The coffee is good & their home made ring ding is fantastic... worth the $5. I even missed my train to get one.

Never had a salad here but wouldn't buy one here. And seriously buying a salad instead of schlepping your own is up there with paying $10+ for avocado toast."

It's so good. So tasty. I literally have dreams about this sandwich. And the coffee is amazing too. 

BEWARE!! Olive's is a bit on the pricey side."
743,olives-new-york-4,2017-03-22,1.0,Crappy service! Completely ignored our order while we sat there waiting for our coffee. I ride the ferry regularly and will go to Starbucks or some gross corporate coffee place before I ever come here again. Wish there was a zero star rating I could give.
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2020-01-07,5.0,"The BEST neighborhood coffee spot in all of Chelsea. It's my place for a split oat latte that is sheer perfection every single time. The baked goods look amazing --- I can't eat, but others do & say they are fabulous. It is welcoming & cozy here & they recognize regulars. Wifi & small seating so come for awhile. It is a happy place."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2018-10-21,3.0,"This Joe Coffee is really unassuming at night. I can't say how it is during the day for people to find. It is a small store. Walk in a few steps to the counter, at around 7pm on a Saturday, all there is food wise is a cut up loaf slices of a fruit bread. You have to walk a bit further in to read the menu. The menu is up, small in characters and a bit far from the front of the counter. Other than that it is well stocked with bags of take home coffee beans, one small bag of instant coffee, accessories like filters, bottles and cups. There's a huge La Marzocco cappuccino machine so that's a plus.

I order a 20oz Iced Matcha Latte for $5.75 - I should have requested less ice upon ordering. The matcha iced latte had 50% ice, way too much. I was not thinking upon ordering. Basically I got 10 ounces of ice. (A tip for ordering). I could taste the matcha and it flaked on top, nice. I enjoyed the ratio of matcha and milk even though it was only a few sips due to the -mucho- ice.

I thought the $3.00 (hot) house drip coffee was strong. No milk, no sugar. Joe Coffee does not leave milk out in containers, I guess you have to ask the barista(s). They do have compostable straws, honey, napkins, utensils and sugar on two tables.

The WiFi is good. I saw three folks on their laptops. The ""Staff"" labelled door needs a key by request to use. There's only a handful of tables and it is not Starbucks atmosphere. It is not over crowded. It is a bit bright and not as cozy as I find in most coffee shops but the staff is chill."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2019-05-29,5.0,walked by this coffee shop and ordered the matcha latte. Really good! Not too sweet but have a adequate amount of matcha--which i like. The environment is cozy too
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2019-10-11,5.0,"We were on our way to the High Line when we stopped by this place and grabbed a quick cup of coffee. My mom is notoriously picky about coffee and the baristas stood there patiently answering all her questions until she was satisfied--and she loved her coffee. I got an iced dirty chai, which was also amazing."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2020-01-04,1.0,"Its January 5th, winter in New York, asked staff if I could close the door, but I guess it gets to hot in the kitchen. Also, I asked for decaf tea - apparently got caffeinated bec. I can't sleep! No fun, specially bec I have work to do tomorrow! Won't be back."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2018-12-30,3.0,"It's a no frills type of place. I order my food and drink and I leave. Service isn't particularly amazing, but it's not bad either. I do wish their seating was more spread out. I feel like I'm on top of others when I sit next to them because we're all so packed. Their iced coffee is eh and the chocolate croissant was pretty on par with other ones I've had previously. If you're in need of coffee and a quick bite, this is a great place to go to. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here though."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2019-01-14,5.0,"One of my simple joys in life. The mere aroma of this coffee house makes my heart sing, and the first sip awakens my soul with vigor and excitement to tackle my to-do list. 

But in all seriousness... this place has ruined coffee for me everywhere else in the city. I guess I'm a Joe's coffee snob and I'm 100% ok with that. Cheers!"
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2018-12-02,5.0,"I love their coffee. This is my first visit to this location and it didn't disappoint. My latte was beautiful. It had silky smooth foam and delicious taste. The location is spacious and nicely decorated. They have 5 little tables, counter by the window and sitting area by the wall. The barista was friendly and did a great job."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2019-12-30,1.0,My husband and I just got a coffee at this location and were told they were closed just as we sat down to enjoy them (no one mentioned that they were closed or closing soon as we were ordering).  So we then ordered an Uber (which I mentioned to the rude female employee) but she literally kicked us out in the rain by saying she can't count money until we leave and that they were closed.  RUDE.  We won't be back.
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2018-08-29,3.0,"The baristas don't know anything about coffee and the drip was burnt and bitter. Also, I asked for a small and was given a large and charged for it. Same with the cake, I specifically requested a slice from the center and was instead given the outer slice which was stale on that side. 
Also, here the water is served out of an pld, rusty faucet and tastes foul. And they have you use the old fashioned paper cups that are tiny and fall apart.
I feel cheated of my money--this was expensive and nothing was good. If I want bad coffee and stale cake, then I can get it for a third of the price.
I will be sticking with Joe's on 13th street, the baristas are so much better. As is the general experience."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2018-02-14,5.0,"Never disappointed by Joe. The baristas are so friendly and kind. Kind being the most important of the two.

Joe has a variety of alternative milks and is accomodating to requests within reason. 

Just quality baristas servicing quality beans in a cup :)"
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2018-08-25,5.0,One of my favorite places to get coffee. They have oat milk and the staff is great. I got an oat milk cappuccino. It was delicious. They also have a great variety of health breakfast options like a Brussel sprout and avocado pot. Yum
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2019-03-15,5.0,"My favorite coffee brand now that Intelligentsia coffee is no longer served in Manhattan.

Best served Joe's.

Not the happiest staffs where they have been here for years.  Although, I wonder what happened, because they use to be very friendly and happy working here, but started to show themselves unhappy in recent year 2018/2019.

Still five stars as they do serve the best Joe's and very satisfying.  The best coffee!  Good enough seating and cleanliness."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2016-03-04,4.0,"I love Joe (local coffee chain)! I was walking to the train from Patti Smitt's photography show at Robert Miller Gallery last night when I noticed a crushed Joe cup on the ground. Yes! That meant there had to be one nearby. I pulled out my handy dandy app. And I was about half way crossing the street and had to turn around. With only 7 minutes left until close, I rushed into the shop. There was no wait.

 I was still on my Patti Smith high! (I got to meet her) I ordered a hot chocolate to go. The clerk was blasting Bjork! I complimented his musical choice. He told me he had created a Women Folk Singers Mix and we were listening to his Women Rock Mix! I wish he would have made me some cd's. I love female vocalist and always had a strong selection in my old school mix tapes. We chatted about NY moments and volunteering.  

As I was leaving I noticed the lids were so geometrical on the inside, reminiscent of diamonds. I asked the clerk if they use them at all the shops. He said yes and that the lids are designed to give the customer the experience of ""drinking from a porcelain cup"" instead of a hole! How fascinating! I thought it was wonderful that a coffee shop would put that much effort into the customer experience. I think I normally like seeing the coffee design that I never put the lid on. But last night I had the lid and I could tell the difference.

The location is small and intimate. It has some small, leather seating against the wall and some tables and chairs. I enjoy some Art Deco detailing from the coffee bar to the mirror on the wall. A good spot to remember in Chelsea. 

Thanks for staying open guys!

Also note: No whip, I repeat, no whip for hot chocolates and also not too sweet, just in case that's what you are looking for. Joe does always have a collection of treats so not to worry your pretty little head!"
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2019-02-17,3.0,Please do something about your customers leaving their distressed dogs barking outside your shop while the run in for a cup which does not normally take just a sec. and it's non stop on sundays from 7am all day. May I add they are being tied up in front of a bus stop .. No one likes to hear dogs in distress or the possibility of them getting loose and getting hit by a bus because they are left unattended. Thanks kindly.
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2017-06-02,4.0,"A solid, dependable outlet of a budding local coffee chain. It's a compact venue, so there's really not a lot of space to lounge around forever on a laptop, so the emphasis is more on getting your cup of joe to go. 

The coffee is quite good, particularly the espresso drinks, and you can customize things yourself at a station where they have syrup and other accoutrements. They also have a fairly decent selection of pastries and baked goods. A nice, locally flavored way to get your caffeine fix on."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2019-02-18,2.0,Almost $5 for a cold brew that I saw them pour out of a plastic pitcher. It also tasted very acidic (definitely not made day of) They also left the door wide open on a cold winter day. I'm not sure what's happening here.
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2018-01-20,1.0,"Viora brand lid is making my coffee leak all over me and all over the back of this cab. You suck, Joe. Stop cheaping out and buy Solo lids. FML and f your store."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2016-06-29,5.0,"Apparently ever since they opened in 2003, Joe started to become the flagship of New York espresso, if not one of. Unlike many of its competitors, Joe focused more on improving itself locally and has gained many followers (like me). I cannot believe the fact that today was only my first visit to this renown place and am more than happy to try out their freshly brewed cappuccino. It was smooth, well-balanced and most importantly, refreshing yet not overwhelming. Barista was also friendly and attentive. 

They also serve seasonal drinks like hot cider - come and get it before it is gone! Great stuff Joe!"
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2014-10-04,3.0,"Great coffee, but limited seating and no wifi means that this is better for to-go than lingering. Almond croissant was subpar (their pastries are from Ovenly in Brooklyn which I've heard good things about, but whatever). I was expecting it to have almond paste inside like just about every almond croissant I've ever eaten, but there wasn't any - just a sprinkling of almonds and powdered sugar atop a regular croissant. Anyway, the coffee is good, but you're better off heading to Cafe Grumpy or the like for a good coffee-and-chill session.

Edit 4/2017: They now carry Underwest donuts (as do the rest of the locations). I had a raspberry yogurt one on my last visit - so amazing. Potato pic attached."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2018-05-22,4.0,"I know its coffee, but if you're not a coffee person or want something other than coffee... they have the BEST chai tea latte that I've ever had. HANDS DOWN. 

The coffee is also excellent, and the staff is kind and quick. 

My only criticism is that they don't have Wi-Fi, which is kind of a bummer for a coffee shop since I'd love to study there but can't because of lack of Wi-Fi."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2015-04-19,5.0,"Love the coffee here! The baristas are always friendly, fast and great at their jobs. They are always happy and smiling and I really appreciate that in the morning before I have had my coffee. We both can't be cranky !!
I love their brews and their lattes, the brews are especially delicious and I often will have a brew over the latte. 
The line is never crazy, and the smell when you walk in is heavenly. I have brought my parents coffee beans from here and they said it was one of the better ones they have had. 
If you are a coffee lover I would definitely check this place out."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2017-11-04,2.0,"I came in expecting to have a full productive day of doing work here so I brought my laptop and a bunch of paperwork to do. I decided to also get food from here since I'll be sitting here all day and ya girl gotta eat so I get a ham, egg, and cheese sandwich. As soon as I ordered it, the guy goes to the back and brings out a refrigerated sandwich wrapped in a plastic sheet. I am currently writing this review as I sit here trying to bite through this cold and hard sandwich that has been sitting in the fridge for who knows how long. Also, I'm not sure what this piece of meat instead the sandwich is but it sure does not look like ham to me and the sandwich has a little spicy and sweet zing to it so I'm not sure this is ham?? Maybe salami?? Idk sorry I don't really eat meat so I have little to no knowledge in this area but they only have about 5 good options and a classic ham egg and cheese seemed like a good choice but nope! Another thing is the lighting and the WiFi. The lighting here is not great if you want to get some work done. There is only a dimmish yellow light above each small table. They also don't have WiFi!! What coffee shop doesn't have WiFi nowadays?? Guess I'll be going to another coffee shop to get my work done...sigh"
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2016-04-27,4.0,"If you want coffee that will wake you up, you should drink from here. I got an espresso macchiato (3.50) and even though it may be in a small cup, it is very strong! Love it. 
The employees are super friendly and the atmosphere is very cozy."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2015-08-09,5.0,"My friends and I found this place on Yelp when we were walking around Chelsea and we all loved it! It was a cute small place and we stayed there for a little to get something to drink and rest our feet from all the walking. 
I ordered the Iced Chai Latte and it was one of the best I've ever had. It had just the right about of sweetness to it and it was very refreshing. 
Service was great! Staff was very nice. I would definitely go back to Joe's Coffee whenever I come back to NY!"
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2018-02-11,5.0,My fave. Some hate the concept of no wifi....but as a writer I find it really special.
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2017-05-11,4.0,"Good coffee! We didn't even know this place was here. We just were walking and ended up taking a break and saw this. The employees were friendly, super cool hipster coffee shop vibe. Locals were here on their laptops just wasting the day."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2015-10-26,5.0,"Joe Coffee doesn't look like much from the street, but open the door and you enter into a charming coffee shop with a comfy and cozy feel that makes you want to stay a while. Seating is limited so if you can't find a seat, you can walk down 23rd street to the Highline and sip on your coffee while taking in the fresh air and greenery.  On a cool autumn day, I recommend their seasonal hot apple cider."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2013-09-30,4.0,"Great iced coffee.

The Chelsea location has a ton of pastry options including doughnut plant doughnuts! 

Cash only though!"
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2016-04-01,3.0,"I don't know, maybe it's just me but their coffee tastes just like Starbucks with the only difference being that you get your order much quicker here and they have simple syrup readily available at the milk station. 

It's fine if you like Starbucks but I'm kind of tired of it."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2014-06-21,5.0,"Came here on a whim when I had some extra time before catching a bus out of town and was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a super hipster coffee drinker and tend to take everything with milk and sugar, but the staff was super friendly and helpful in helping me decide what to get.

Debated between the espresso machiato or the americano misto and ultimately ended up with the misto. Both were about $3.50 each so price seemed standard for a coffee house and if not even a bit lower. Misto came in a cute cup with a floral design on the cream and I was pretty stoked (my first flower design!!). Friend got an iced coffee where small has a double shot and the large has 2 double shots--BE WARNED OF CAFFEINE ADDICTION! 

The place is small and definitely could use some more seating, but it's quaint and has good vibes and good coffee. They have standard syrup and sugards and all your milk and creams laid out (including soy, which I thought was a nice touch!!) so you can adjust your coffee to your liking. All your standard needs are here along with some helpful people behind the counter and you can sit as long as you'd like with few disturbances aside from it being a fairly busy shop through the day. Everyone's gotta get their fix, yakno??"
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2017-08-12,5.0,"Love Joe coffee. I like the coffee, the staff, and the food. This location is pretty easy to miss if you don't live in the area. I usually come here in the afternoon with my dog. We usually share a date&peanut ball, she goes nuts (hehe) for it. They also have healthy snack options (smoothie cup, yogurt granola etc). The best thing is it's never super crowded."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2013-12-25,5.0,"By far, Joe is my favorite coffee shop. I cannot pass this place without getting my espresso fix. All Joe locations are equally good, and the Chelsea shop is particularly pleasant in the morning with the sun shining bright through the window. All coffee drinks I've had are potent and rich, but smooth, including the cappuccino and plain coffee, both of which are my regular choices, and the hot chocolate on a cold winter's day is a treat. 

Skip the Starbucks, and renew your faith in coffee with an espresso at Joe."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2016-02-05,3.0,Cute little cafe in Chelsea. Ordered the latte extra hot. Coffee is just ok here. But good space to meet with friends. Service is decent too.
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2015-07-14,5.0,"Tasty tasty coffee served by lesbians (if your lucky).  We like very much!!


I'll give like 30 seconds of being serious:  Super nice staff, great tasting coffee. We LOVE the gluten free pistachio cardamom pound cake.. great texture and taste.  

This is the perfect morning walk from the house to get morning coffee and a little nibble."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2015-09-01,4.0,"Good, but pricey hot coffee.  Definitely more interesting flavor profile than your typical drip coffee.  The iced coffee however, is overpriced.  Once you're hooked on cold brew, its hard to go back and Joe's is sold at a cold brew price point.  It wasn't bad, but there are better options in the area or you could stick with something cheaper like Dunks.  I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt on the espresso drinks, it looked like they knew what they were doing, but I didn't get to try any."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2015-07-20,5.0,"Strong! I got a small cappuccino and it's all I needed. I'm feeling the buzz still, 2 hours later. 

I appreciated that the barista forewarned us that they don't do iced cappuccino because the steamed milk water's down ice too much, so that it would be a latte instead. 

The topping counter is clean and accessible (I always take note of this at places since sometimes it's a mess), however, they didn't have cinnamon or chocolate powder out! 

As for pastries, we got a croissant and cinnamon roll, both were delicious. I like that the cinnamon roll isn't drenched in sweet, so you can actually taste the pastry itself. They do it right! 

I got the yogurt parfait which was hearty, natural and filling. If you don't like truly plain yogurt, I don't recommend this since it tastes so homemade. I felt healthy eating it!"
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2015-09-11,2.0,The coffee was OK but there was a dog in the kitchen... Yikes
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2012-11-16,5.0,"Superb lattes. Just the right amount of foam, a good temperature and a sweet, bold taste to the espresso. This is a finely crafted beverage my friends.

Cash only. A large latte is $4.25."
744,joe-coffee-company-new-york-4,2017-05-25,3.0,"Not as crazy about this place as I was anticipating. Their coffee was decent, but the ambience was lacking -- definitely has the ""coffee chain"" vibe. Employees were nice. It's an easy place to pop in and out of, but that's about it."
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2015-05-29,4.0,"I've been stopping in here mornings before work for at least two years (maybe more) and the staff here
1) are friendly
2) efficient
3) consistent
4) low turn-over

Somebody is managing this place well.

The only downside is that as with most Starbucks this place has the music on WAY TOO LOUD.

I assume this is a business decision to keep people from overstaying their welcome. It certainly works with me. No matter how desperate I am to get some work done, I can spend never more than 1 hour doing it at a Starbucks!

That aside, I love this location for my weekday morning pit stop."
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2019-10-07,1.0,"I'm just going to go ahead any say that whoever manages this place probably sucks so much. The baristas are doing the best they can but this place never ever works right. I literally always have to wait +15 min for my order even if I order embarrassingly early via the app.

Should probably just close her down and start fresh"
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2019-11-29,1.0,"Worst and rudest Starbucks ever. Had to repeat my VERY simple order 3 times. Had to wait for officer because they were il prepared. No thank you,  no please no hello. Fire them ask and stay over. Hell no!"
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2019-05-26,1.0,Music was so load the cashier could not hear my order.   Not the Starbucks culture or brand.
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2018-11-04,1.0,"The worst experience I've ever had at a Starbucks. The staff were extremely slow and inattentive. I asked for the employee who handed me my drink to add in an ingredient I ordered that was left out and she did not acknowledge me at all. I asked her again thinking she didn't hear me and interrupted me saying ""I heard you"" with such an attitude I wanted to just leave. The cookies/baked goods tasted stale and old (not stored properly or switched out frequently enough). 

Horrible quality service, food and drinks. Will never return to this location"
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2019-05-15,1.0,"If I can do 0 stars I would.  If you wait in or order from the app they never get the order ready before 15 min is up. What's the point of preordering when it gets you to wait the same time. Plus when you do wait in line the guy that was ringing the register didn't get the order right just because he was talking to the girl before me expecting to get a number or something. When I went to get my mobile order today I had to wait 15 min to get it now I am not as early as I wanted to be for work and this girl when I asked if it's coming up she said "" all drinks are coming up "" after she asked twice what am I waiting for. 
I know customer service is hard sometimes but when Anthony was the manager for that place it ran smoothly! 
This is the only way I could speak out or I would have just brought it to the managers attention. Too bad won't be going there any more ."

745,starbucks-new-york-362,2018-11-04,1.0,"Didn't think it was possible for a Starbucks to fail in so many ways. The service was truly tragic, took 15 mins to get my very simple drink order. The pastries we ordered were old and tasted like they had been sitting out for days. In addition, the staff was incredibly rude and seemed inconvenienced by me even ordering a drink. My drink even tasted bad (sour milk) and I ended up having to toss it...do not come to this location."
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2016-04-22,4.0,I feel like it's a hit and miss when I come here.  In the past the manger and staff were superb.  Lately I noticed here and other Starbucks by the lower west side that the customer service is like ok.  I miss the there previous staff.
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2018-03-02,1.0,Very condescending lol that's what comes to mind when I got my order taken it was just this attitude that I couldn't understand where it was coming from. It's disappointing that some people find it ok to be this way while working in the service industry. All I asked for was a quad shot with creame and I was made to feel like I was asking for a blood transfusion. In the end I just so happen to need the coffee only reason I went in here...
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2018-05-22,1.0,They need to stop forgetting to put caramel in my coffee. I am paying extra for a bitter coffee and by the time I notice I am already at work and can't go back. Its really inconvenient.
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2015-11-25,1.0,"This location, and I've been all over the city, is the worst.

Really, bluntly: bad! It looks like cell block D at a Super Max prison. 

It's cramped, stools were missing (stolen?). Gangs play music, panhandle outside. Bathroom broken. Garbage overflow. Drift garbage on floors. No sugar, no napkins. It sucked brick.

Rebel Review says: 0.5 stars."

Everyone just looked happy to work here. Omg and the food options they had were huge! Every possible baked good was on display looking lovely. The floors were cleaned the seating area seated happy beautiful people... like man... this Starbucks rocks.. I will be back!

Even in winter months I have my Grande Iced Mocha Latte and its always consistent in flavor and quite delish.

Theres not many seats here but I did snag a spot on this nite just to wait for friends coming from Brooklyn. Overall a vvv good spot for a pick me up."
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2017-10-31,3.0,"This starbucks is located close to an SVA building, so it is frequented by students and can tend to get a bit crowded. the layout of the space is very poorly  designed, and makes forming a line too difficult, resulting in massive clots of people that make ordering a coffee way too much. the staff is always friendly, but definitely short on members, so when orders start flying, they take a decent amount of time, so don't come here if you're in a rush! Seating is decent with bar stools and window seats, but again, the space has a tendency to crowd and there is little privacy, so it's not the best for studying or hanging out for too long."

It doesn't come out until tomorrow, but we came in to try our luck in getting it earlier.  The woman behind the counter told us it wasn't out until tomorrow, but she'd make it for us anyway! One of her coworkers came out with a paper full of ingredients, and they both worked on our drinks immediately with no questions asked. They really didn't have to do that. Only thing I can say I didn't like was that they assumed our drink size. Since we don't come to Starbucks often, we get the cheapest costing drink, but she gave us a large. But it's cool, we paid it and enjoyed our limited edition drink!"
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2014-10-15,5.0,"Wow! I use to not like Starbucks but it's all about the management and staff!!! So friendly and accommodating!

I was having a rough day being bag lady. They didn't mind that I had some food from Trader Joes! I was able to collect myself and not feel like I'm pressed to leave. I felt like I had my office for the day!

Anyway.... Starbucks ain't so bad after all!"
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2018-03-07,2.0,The woman that served me was amazingly friendly. She gets ten stars. The woman who made my tea was weirdly rude for no reason. I simply asked where the napkins were because she spilled everything all over my drink.
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2015-01-20,1.0,"I'm still waiting for that small hot coffee. They aren't giving receipts so I'm royally fucked today. I should hope that if I stand here long enough until they notice me and ask what I'm having and I'll say ""a tall pike"" and they'll say ""my apologies dear sir we'll get that right away"" and two cherubs will descend from heaven with a small black coffee. Not too hot not too cold and glowing with pixie dust.

The fact that I can stand here writing that this narrative would suggest that he'll will freeze over before I get a coffee today l.

Time passes. They finally ask and I tell them small pile and the guy gives me a ton of attitude saying ""that's up at the front"" which is not what the barista had said. I go to the front and nothing is there. ""Sir!"" The upset barista says ""your tall pike"" I yell back ""front? Back? Left? Right? Up down?"" They finally flag me over o the cashiers place where it should have been all along.

The only reason I'm coming back to this place is to throw a trash can through the window. I think I will take a hiatus from starbucks as well. Going to go to a smaller independent cash only place.

Thanks for ruining my morning you princes of Maine, you kings of New England. I will see you all in hell.

It's been 12 hours and this is still pissing me off. The fucking arrogance of that piece of human garbage and the tone of his voice when he told me to go back the front (which in barista speak means middle of counter) then when I go to the front he yells ""up front"" and I yell back ""front back middle side left right up down""

The manager best file the restraining order now. Looking forward to hearing from The NYPD."
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2015-05-10,4.0,I decided to try this location out a few weeks ago due to another Starbucks near by wasn't exceeding my expectations. Small enough Starbucks but at least these guys are competent enough to make my coffee correct each time. Therefore I will continue to return. Their barista's are quiet no interaction with the customer which is their draw back. I come for the coffee anyway and the time I come in it's way to early to chat anyway. So it doesn't really bother me.
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2014-04-30,2.0,"I could quite literally make a job out of trying to visit all the Starbucks in Manhattan.  Or if I was really wanting to challenge myself, maybe I should try to visit all the coffee shops in Manhattan.  Would that even be possible?  I wonder if anyone has ever counted them?

We happened to stop here as we were getting out of the subway and I was parched and requested we stop for an iced tea.  The location is convenient like most Starbucks are in Manhattan.  I ordered quickly, however the barista making drinks decided he was unable to talk and make drinks at the same time and proceeded to stop everything and talk to the other barista and not make my drink.  I was thirty seconds away from saying something and then he started making my beverage.  If this boy wants to remain a barista I suggest he learn how to multitask like the rest of us.  

My iced tea was refreshing and made to my liking.  It helped quench my thirst as we walked through Chelsea Market just down the street."
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2014-05-01,3.0,"This can actually be a very nice Starbucks, fast and efficient given the huge regular crowds from the building and across the way at Chelsea Market.

Then the summer comes. And you. Cannot. Move. Without hitting a tourist. They will take a shower in the bathroom, they will unfold maps over half the table, their kids will kick the back of your chair, and the normally chipper crew will mostly keep their heads down and just try to power through the mob of rude, non-tipping Eurotrash."
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2011-08-12,2.0,"I'm biased because I worked here when I first came to New York...but this may be one of the worst designed stores in Manhattan. A large pillar causes constant pile-ups, it's right by the A at 16th street and is busy about every 11-20 minutes, and there is never any seating. 

Make a trek a few blocks south to the brand new Starbucks at 111 8th Ave. You'll be much happier in that clean, well staffed and efficient store (with a cleaner bathroom and more seating)."

There was a woman in front of me placing her order, you could tell she wasn't from here because she had a heavy accent. When asked for her name, she took a couple seconds trying to spell it in English, and the barista was so nasty and just cut her off. It was my turn to order. I ordered a WHITE CHOCOLATE MOCHA. I had a little trouble scanning my phone to pay, and the barista was extremely rude about it. I must have tried scanning my phone a couple seconds before I should have, and she was like ""WAIT"" very nastily. I go to wait for my drink, and the barista making the drinks asks the barista at the front ""is this a white hot chocolate?"", and she responds and says yes. I get the drink and realize they gave me this white hot chocolate as opposed to a white chocolate mocha. (the cup initials were WHC, therefore the barista making the drink made the correct drink as indicated by the cup). I told him I wanted a white chocolate mocha, and he said all that was missing was a shot of espresso. He added the espresso in and asked me how it tasted. At that point I was so annoyed I told him thank you and exited the store without tasting it. The drink tasted like SHIT. I will never go back to this location, and to the barista girl working at the front taking orders on Sunday at 1:10 PM, LOSE THE ATTITUDE HUNNIE Cuz U just cost this location some business!

As a gold card member spending a ton of money on Starbucks, I expect way better service!"
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2013-08-08,2.0,"Did not have a great experience, most of the baristas lack personality and the service was really slow for no apparent reason. Also, the barista tried to tell me he never got my order, then after a minute if ignoring me, he realized he just made my order wrong and didn't apologize, though he corrected the mistake. The bathroom was closed the day I came in.

Since there's a zillion Starbucks  in the city, I'll probably avoid this one."

I don't care for the burnt coffee flavor and they really don't have much you want to actually eat there so whatever
Although if I am tired and have to go for a long drive there's nothing that can beat a double dry cappuccino to help get up and going
Two shots of espresso and a little foamy milk add a little sweetener and maybe a little chocolate powder slug it down when you're ready for blastoff"

745,starbucks-new-york-362,2013-09-03,1.0,"I've come here twice and have had bad service both times. The first time, I came after work on a Friday and ordered. There was only one person in front of me. I waited for about 10 minutes until I realized they must have skipped my order somehow. Mistakes happen, and once I told the staff they promptly made my drink. The second time, I came in on a Saturday evening. Again, there were not many people in the store. I ordered an orange spice iced coffee. I waited around 7 minutes. The bathroom was out of service, which was inconvenient. When they called my drink and handed it to me, it was a hot drink--it tasted like hot apple cider. I was in a rush and didn't want to spend more time getting them to fix it. Needless to say, I'm not coming back to this Starbucks again."
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2014-08-16,1.0,"I live and work in this neighborhood and walk past this Starbucks everyday. I suppose the coffee is like any other Starbucks but at this location they never clean up the garbage and litter in front of their establishment. It is embarrassing looking for the neighbors and reflects very poorly on their image and the community. 

What reflects even more poorly on them is the fact that calling this to their attention makes no difference.  I have spoken with the same young women three times, only to hear the dismissive ""it's not our responsibility"" over and over again. As a business owner in the neighborhood I can say that it ABSOLUTELY IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to keep the area in front of your business presentable and litter-free!"
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2012-12-18,2.0,"Probably one of the worst Starbucks in NYC. About a year or so ago, their beverage/barista quality went downhill. After a thoroughly disappointing cappuccino a couple weeks ago, I decided to give them one more chance with a mocha frap today. This is a pretty tough beverage to screw up, but after 3 sips I threw this one out. It was totally bitter and didn't taste remotely like it should. While I got my drink in short order, two guys who were waiting much longer than me were asking the barista about theirs and she had no customer service skills whatsoever, to go along with her lack of beverage-making skills. I'm done with this location for good."

The only reason it gets 4/5 stars it because when I came back the next day for the same drink the barista recommended, this other barista took forever placing my order. They didn't understand what they had to substitute for my drink & they wasted a good 5-10 minutes of my time but apologized for the delay"

745,starbucks-new-york-362,2007-11-01,3.0,"Meh, it's a Starbucks. They're all the same -- great design is their corporate schtick. But I have another reason for making this post:

This Starbucks (and yes, I know its in Chelsea, but this one in particular) is VERY cruisy! It was like a domino effect of check-out glances -- one guy looked at another, who looked at another, and another -- it was crazy. I was also there at 10:30pm on a week night. Maybe that had something to do with it?

Either this, or I was ingesting a little TOO much caffiene.

That's it."
745,starbucks-new-york-362,2010-09-08,3.0,"I currently measure Starbucks first on a level of whether or not I got what I asked for. In this case, I did. They had the Tazo iced green tea in the little cooler and they actually produced the oatmeal quickly and asked which toppings I want. As far as Starbucks go, this service was better than most and the fact that they actually had what I wanted was close to a miracle.

This is a small Starbucks and it does not take much to fill up the tables in here. I did notice that the baristas, although remarkably efficient, looked like they would rather be anywhere than at work, serving the Chelsea masses. I can't say I blame them and I don't expect a sunny disposition in Baristaville, but not looking like your girlfriend or boyfriend just broke up with you seconds before work and took all of your stuff and threw it on the street, while airing all of your differences on Ricki Lake at the same time would be decent.

This location is also excellent as it is right on the corner where you exit the A,C,E and L at the 14th St. stop (exit 16th St. and 8th Ave.)."

Very authentic- the owners are from Italy and so lovely. So excited to have this in Chelsea during the summer!!!!
746,pura-vita-super-new-york,2020-03-18,5.0,"Went here thinking it was a standard gelato shop, and that feeling persisted through tasting flavors and even until I got to the register, until I found out they were vegan! I was pleasantly surprised and the healthier alternative taste the same and is better on the waistline. I highly recommend this spot for some awesome ice cream in Chelsea!"
746,pura-vita-super-new-york,2020-02-19,5.0,"Finally, finally, finally! New York City has been WAITING for an all-vegan gelato that isn't just a handful of sorbet options. The gelato texture is smooth and ""milky"" and the flavors are fire. I ended up getting a pint of the caramel and Black Forest, but all the flavors were on point. The croissants are also perfect - soft, chewy, and can be loaded with gelato."
746,pura-vita-super-new-york,2020-02-26,4.0,"The name is a play on the Costa Rican phrase ""pura vida"", which seems to be catching on all around.  This is a vegan ice cream and gelato shop - yay!  I tried a few of their offerings, and they were all creamy and had a nice texture, but could use a little more flavor and sweetness imo.  It is a nice place to stop in to, and the prices are reasonable for the area."

She asked me for my name, and since my first name is a bit hard to pronounce, I told her my last name, and was spelling it out. I said, ""oh, its Cho, C-h-"" and then she rudely cut me off, rolling her eyes saying, ""I know how to spell Chelsea."" 

First of all, thats not my name, hence why I was spelling it out. Second of all, there was no need to cut me off while I was just trying to explain myself. Great location, just sometimes the staff can be a bit rude."
747,starbucks-new-york-451,2018-12-30,5.0,"Pros: proximity to Penn station, free WiFi, large tables to sit at
Cons: usually busy, above average noise level

If you are either going to Penn or at Penn and have more than 30 mins to kill, I highly recommend that you stop by this location. Yes, I know, there are other Starbucks inside the station. But coming here (a 3 min walk) lets to breath some fresh air, stretch your legs and you'll have a much better chance to find a seat than at the locations inside the station, always overrun with people.

I don't think I have to explain what you'll find at Starbucks, they are fairly famous. However, I will recommend that you try their peach tea lemonade. I usually get coffee but these tea lemonades they serve are so delicious and refreshing, perfect when you are feeling thirsty."

On Monday my drink was forgotten, I guess the label didn't print. I wasn't in a rush so it was no big deal. The girl at the register gave me a card for $4 off my next drink which was really nice of her. I went to use it today and a new girl at the register gave me an attitude from the beginning. She said there was nothing in the card. I explained to her I was given the card here only 2 days ago and she said again ""well there's nothing here so I don't know what to tell you"" she eventually got someone to help (with hesitation) and guess what? There was $4 in the card!! This is the closest Starbucks to my office but honestly scared to go back lol."

As the location gets more popular and busier, it gets so hard in the mornings to pick up your drink, fix it up, and  get back out. It just creates a huge jam and might be time to think about reorganizing that section's layout.

The menu here also includes Starbucks Reserve coffees and an evening menu that includes wine.

747,starbucks-new-york-451,2018-06-23,4.0,"The staff here is actually the best. This is my favorite Starbucks I have ever been to. Try to catch Kevin (he's hilarious and super helpful) at the cash register. 
My first time here was last week, and I wanted to test out if Starbucks' new policy that customers don't have to buy anything was true. It's been affirmed, and so I came here again today to get work done. 
This place is super clean, and has high tables for those who like to stand and a plethora of outlets. In other words, an amazing work place. Furthermore, when I had trash at my table, someone kindly came by to help me pick up my trash and throw it away for me. That was actually the sweetest. 
Also, I decided to try out the new Mango Dragonfruit today, and even though they had ran out, Kevin promised me they would be getting their next batch tomorrow, so you'll definitely catch me here then! In the meantime, Kevin was able to recommend a great alternative to me - the Strawberry Acai with lemon and the Mango Dragonfruit toppings. 
I've been to almost every Starbucks around the Empire State, and I can guarantee to you this is the best one. It's also not flooded with tourists, which is also another great bonus."

747,starbucks-new-york-451,2015-10-06,4.0,"I almost never go to Starbucks given a) what it is/represents and b) it's absolute chaos at any given moment, but occasionally I make an exception for the newly-opened location across the street from Penn Station. And I mean across 7th Ave, not across 31st. Because there is a Starbucks there too. Because clearly we needed yet another Starbucks to open in this one-block radius. 

When this Starbucks opened, my singular thought was: WTF. It still kind of is. Off the top of my head, there are six different Starbucks locations within the radius that I mentioned. None of them are good. All of them are hectic. All of them make me want to get the hell out of Manhattan. This Starbucks, however, is different.  

If I reviewed every Starbucks in the city, God knows how many reviews I'd have. It's kind of a cop out. But I feel the need to review this particular location, because of one quality: it is PLEASANT. How many Starbucks's (awkward plural) can you say that about? 

Because this spot just opened up, it is still CLEAN. The interior is also strikingly beautiful (this statement is ***strictly relative to other locations***). High ceilings, incredibly spacious, plenty of tables, some interesting design elements (marble, exposed brick, iron/metal accents, all that fun industrial stuff) - definitely unlike any Starbucks I've ever been to.   

What they offer here is obviously standard, but what I will mention is that this particular location has a Clover. I'm no coffee connoisseur, but what I can tell you is that the Clover machine can make some damn good coffee. It works on some sort of vacuum mechanism, the goal of which being to extract the purest of flavors...whatever that means. Typically the Clover coffees that Starbucks offer are more expensive and more rare. I'm highlighting this because in my experience, Clover coffee is definitely better than Pike Place, etc. I typically like a bit of milk in my coffee, and I will happily drink Clover coffee black, to give you an idea. 

My point: if I run out of my own coffee/forget to restock in time for the next workday, I come here. So there's something to be said for that."
747,starbucks-new-york-451,2019-07-23,3.0,"I hate having to write a bad review because this location is very convenient for me, being on my way from Penn Station to my job. Every morning I order my coffee & pick it up on my way, and they always make it to perfection. However, I've had 2 instances with the woman who reads the names of the mobile orders that have really irritated me. The first time, I placed my order at the wrong location by accident & when I realized it & showed her, she said I had to either go where I ordered it or reorder a new coffee here. I ended up just leaving without any coffee because I didn't have time to walk in the completely opposite direction to pick it up or place a new order & wait again. Yes, it was my fault but I don't understand why it was such a big deal to make me a $3 coffee when I had the receipt and I go in everyday. This has happened to me once before at a different location, & when I showed them my receipt, they immediately made me the drink I ordered. 
This morning it was raining out, I stopped in to pick up my coffee & I also ordered food. I (very nicely) asked her for a bag because she was standing right in front of them, she said ""one minute my love"" then proceeded to read the names from the mobile orders & completely ignored my request. I waited for a while until I got so frustrated, I ended up just leaving without the bag because I was going to be late for work. 
Like I mentioned before, I go to this Starbucks every morning, it's convenient and efficient; but I'm really not impressed by the customer service of this one specific employee. It's very frustrating & a terrible way to start one's day."
747,starbucks-new-york-451,2016-10-30,5.0,"I originally stumbled upon this Starbucks by accident. I really needed coffee one morning, and even though I'd walked past it several times in the street before, that day was the first time I noticed it.

I came in and ordered my coffee according to how my barista friend told me to specify it, and was pleasantly surprised at how quiet and calm this Starbucks felt. Unlike others of its kind in the city, this Starbucks seems to maintain the peaceful, soothing air that a coffeeshop should have.

The interior design is really thoughtful, and I like that even when crowded, the noise levels here tend to be kept to a minimum. Most people are here to work on their laptops so this keeps noise down and also encourages others to come and do their work here.

I would come do work here some time as well, if I ever needed to. I'm not a fan of Starbucks for doing work, especially in the city, but the vibe here is suitable to what I need when I have to focus. Also, they clearly separate the working area from the socializing one by placing all the charging slots underneath the working area tables and none at the socializing ones. 

The working area tables are pretty comfortable as they are high chairs with high tables that are the right height for working and prevent you from slouching while looking at your computer. I really appreciate this ergonomic design. The high ceiling here also helps the store to feel big and spacious.

There is also a really fascinating wall illustration here that I really enjoy, and recommend that you take a look at. It details the process of how coffee beans are grown and harvested to be made into what we drink here at Starbucks. I must also point out that this Starbucks is handicap-friendly (super important) and has two bathrooms (passcode required), one for women and one for men.

All in all, this is a great, well-designed Starbucks, and definitely a hidden gem here in the craziness of New York City."

I'll come here often on my way to work or on my way home and no matter the hour, I've always had experiences with workers here that have been positive. The other day, came in on my way to the train and they had stop brewing dark roast for the day (annoying, but standard amongst most Starbucks locations I've been to at this hour of the day) Was bummed about having to drink Pike because I didn't want that much caffeine. The guy behind the counter felt bad and so he only charged me for a refill. Good customer service just goes a long way and I'll be sure to make this location my go to coffee spot from now on. I'm a fan of their set up inside, tons of tables and chairs and a sort of high top bar table area that's conducive for doing work with your laptop or whatever. It's spacious and clean for the most part, big fan! Oh, and the coffee is good too."
747,starbucks-new-york-451,2017-04-26,5.0,"I am never disappointed when I leave this Starbucks location. It has become my favorite out of the other 1,000 that are conveniently close. The staff is always friendly and quick. I love to order in person but lately I have had to order via the mobile app (which is so great) and my mobile order is always there waiting for me by the time I walk in! I am very happy with the new vegan multigrain bagel. Its always nice to have a vegan option at one of your favorite places!"
747,starbucks-new-york-451,2017-12-04,3.0,"1star for my old review:
Has the AC blasting day and night, no matter how cold it is outside. Everyone in the back row has their cots and scarves on and complaining about the cold. I asked a staff member to turn it off and she told me they tried and they don't know how...How is this an acceptable response when your customers are freezing inside your store? 

Updated to 3 stars today:
Really fast mobile order service. So will be coming here only for mobile orders but not staying after I get my drink."

747,starbucks-new-york-451,2015-08-26,5.0,"Love this new Starbucks location despite it being directly across the newly developed pedestrian plaza, which is home to many strange characters.  The interior is nicely decorated and fairly spacious with ample seating.  There's 4 long, ""bar"" tables, several smaller tables paired with benches against the wall and cushioned seating near the back.  The counter and waiting area are also roomy enough for a crowded, hot summer day that can potentially piss off New Yorkers and tourists alike.  I can't complain.  I'm sitting here with my hot cappuccino with cinnamon on a gorgeous afternoon and listening to some cool jams."
747,starbucks-new-york-451,2018-12-08,2.0,"Food was fine but had the most disgusting public bathroom I've ever experienced. One of the stalls looked as if it had once been ductaped shut and was being blocked by a trash can to keep people from going inside. There was no toilet paper in my stall so I peeked inside the other bathroom, and there was poop-smeared toilet paper all over the floor and the toilet paper holder looked as if it had been torn from wall. I had to use the napkins that had been stacked on top of the holder as a substitute. The toilet was gross as well, but I don't even want to describe it."

Experience in this establishment gets 2 stars
Why? I received my order in 15 mins, where I observed other customers placing their orders after me, receiving it in a timely fashion. 
Outcome: Was 5 mins late to work as a result
Advice:  Show employee how deliver purchased items on time. Apologized when their is delay.  

I am a daily customer of Starbucks, but I support the smaller companies also. So my review will focus in different topics of Starbucks. I can say my Starbucks experience is near perfect (for certain stores I visit), except for the music. I would give Starbucks 5 Stars, but their music in the morning gives them only a 3 stars. 

Starbucks should stop trying to sell music and forcing music on us via app that detracts from an otherwise positive experience. I strongly recommend them to leave the music digital marketing for music for Apple Music or Google Music to handle. (Their latest attempt at this their ridiculous Spotify.) Furthermore, they should give each store a variety of choices instead of one-size fits all. No music is better than what they're trying to cross market. Whoever is in charge of the music at corporate is way overpaid. Sorry about the rant about the app, but I am getting annoyed with 38 notifications I find in my app daily. 

Let talk about new awards program. Starbucks is making a ""huge"" mistake when they introduced their new April 2016 policy change. Customers including myself are not supporting this change. Starbucks will be losing valuable customers like myself who has been a Gold Card Member for a few years. I go to Starbucks 3 to 4 times a week. Mostly for their tea drinks and earn stars (Teavana and Starbucks); 12 stars for a free drink ""now"" that is changing from 12 stars to 125 stars for a free drink. Also another bummer is to be a ""Gold Card"" member it was 30 stars now it is 300 stars. Who are they kidding! The other coffee companies are loving it... they will be getting Starbucks customers. Their marketing team have not research the app called CUPS, where soon it will become very popular after new program take place. Starbucks is not caring about their customers if they impose this outrageous plan. At least I will stop in to say Hello to the great staff at the nearest Starbucks store while holding a different brand of coffee in hand."
747,starbucks-new-york-451,2018-01-17,3.0,"I have made multiple mobile orders, and twice when getting to work, my coffee was not what I ordered. Today's order, I wanted a blonde roast with one shot. I don't even know if that's what I got because it's more milk than coffee. I might as well be drinking a pint of coffee flavored milk."
747,starbucks-new-york-451,2017-06-17,1.0,"I know that Starbucks is the blood supply of this country and has been for years.  The poor review isn't about the coffee, but about the staff.  In the several times I have found it necessary to visit, I have been treated with immense late-adolescence rudeness.  Once, I was parched and ordered a bottled juice drink, then, because it was hot, asked if I could get a cup of ice. ""Yeah,"" drawled the girl behind the counter.  ""What's your name?""  Somewhat startled, I said, ""Why do you need my name?""  With the grandest contemptuous eye-roll, she said, ""To write on the cup,"" with the unsaid ""Stupid!"" hanging in the air.  Today I passed by there, while on my way to wait for the train.  On the sound system, a fascinating Thirties blues was playing -- something I thought I had never heard, and I know this music.  I walked to the counter, simply wanting to know what CD it was coming from.  Once again, contempt: ""The line's OVER THERE,"" even though answering my question would have taken all of ten seconds.  Mind you, I am not a dazzling youth with hipster clothing: I am a gray-haired man of 64.  Horrors!  But even old dudes have money, drink coffee, buy things, and expect some vestigial politeness instead of snark.  I'll buy coffee or a drink from somewhere else in Penn Station or not at all.  This review won't shake Starbucks to its very roots, but I wonder who's training the young men and women behind the counter.  Did they bring back Evita Peron?"
747,starbucks-new-york-451,2017-08-02,4.0,"This Starbucks is just steps from the 7th Ave entrance of Penn Station which is perfect for when I take a train to/from there. It's a fairly large location so if you really wanted to, you could probably find a place to sit. Personally I've never really stayed inside to have my coffee. I love to order ahead and pick up right on my way to/from Penn Station. It's the only time I am ever in this particular area. I guess if you're also seeing a show or game at MSG, this works out too. I like that this Starbucks location doesn't feel claustrophobic as many NYC locations do because they are overall crowded or there's very little space. The layout of this one is nice and from the times I've gone, never too crowded. The first visit, I actually ordered at the counter when I got there and it was quick. But again, I suggest on the go ordering because the way they have the pick-up setup is pretty efficient compared to other locations. I haven't had an issue as long as you're picking up within a reasonable amount of time from when you placed the order. I usually leave a 4-7 min window."
747,starbucks-new-york-451,2017-05-23,3.0,"If I order something on the app, that's what I'm expecting. Don't just toss in the bag what you think will be a good substitute! If they don't have the item, we shouldn't be able to place the order. 2 days in a row I didn't get what I ordered on the app. Now I have to check inside the bag before I leave. Frustrating and inconsiderate."

747,starbucks-new-york-451,2016-04-30,1.0,"I would give this place a 0 if I could. I used to be a regular here coming here at least twice a week. I liked the atmosphere and that this place is relatively clean comparing to many other Starbuckses. I'm a starbucks gold member and had a free drink offered that I wanted to use today here. In addition I wanted to buy a bantam bagel and a cookie dough cake pop. 
From the moment I said hi the barista was very unfriendly. I showed her my reward and asked her for the two additional items. The total came out to be over $7. So I assumed that she accidentally added something to the bill. Naively, I asked her how much the bantam bagel is ( for those who don't know it's a mini bagel, basically it's a bite). I thought that asking for the price of an item is a good way to point out that something is wrong with the bill. She said it's $4.75!!!! I was very shocked and said that's expensive for only one tiny bagel. However, I really wanted to have that bagel, therefore I didn't complain much but I sensed that something is wrong. So my cookie dough cake pop was around $1.50 and the mini bagel that's about the same size was costing me 3x more! Later, I checked in an other starbucks and the individual bantam bagels are supposed to be under $2. So that girl just lied into my face!!! I think she should be fired for being malicious and unprofessional! I don't care much about those few dollars but I care about deliberate wrong doing and cheating on customers. I will make sure to warn everyone I know about this place!!"

The place is a welcome change from the other Starbucks I have been too here in Manhattan.  It is huge ceilinged and you get the vibes that the place can be exciting. Service is quick and not so personal (I mean, the staff tries to help out). It has that industrial look, which I think is great, considering that other nearby Starbucks don't really look great and spacious as this one.

I stumbled across this Starbucks location west 32 street by MAdison Square Garden and decided to cheer myself up with a cold refreshing frappaccino. Well I must say I am so happy I decided to come here! The staff was amazing and personable! The other Starbucks locations I've been to on Broadway 103 Street, 114 Broadway and Columbus Ave 100 Street have horrible people working there! No eye contact, no warm welcomes. Well I had the pleasure of being served by Chris, Kevin, Eric and Matt! They were kind enough to lend me their ears about my sad day and made me the best frappaccino I've ever tasted! Totally turned my mood around! They were genuine, warm and totally connected! I truly hope Starbucks recognizes these amazing associates and models other employees after them because they are by far the best team I've ever encountered in any Starbucks in this NYC!

748,pret-a-manger-new-york-26,2017-06-23,1.0,"BEWARE: I FOUND A FLY IN MY SALAD. It was dried up in the walnut of the salad and definitely had been there for some time. GROSS!!!! With so many chains in NYC and obvious low quality, why do people keep eating here?

This was my first time trying Pret and definitely my last time. We had the following catered to my office: 
-an assortment of wraps
-chicken avocado salad (one party-sized box)
-an assortment of cookies

I personally tried the spicy black bean and mango wrap and did not like it. I'm normally like this combination but something about the black beans was off-putting so I only ate half the wrap. The wrap size is pretty small and the full wrap would not have kept me full.

I really enjoyed the salad until I discovered my little dead friend. The salad was lettuce, cranberries, grilled chicken, avocado, walnuts, and cherry tomatoes. No dressing was included. I think Pret forgot to provide dressing. So my coworkers and I scrambled to find some leftover dressing in the fridge. I was almost done with my salad and I noticed the fly. I lost my appetite immediately, but thankfully I was pretty full anyway. I find it unacceptable to find bugs in the food. Who would want to eat here again??

I sampled some of the cookies, which were still warm when we received them. We had chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and double chocolate chip. While I really loved the cookies, they don't make up for a horrible meal.

Overall, this chain is mediocre food and I regret wasting my calories here."

I stopped in really quick to change from flats to heels and grab something to drink 

It's very much self serve where you grab what you want and take to the counter to pay with a few items available behind the counter. Their croissant is definitely a must!  You'll thank me later! Lol 

Nice seating area by the window if you are looking to get some work done, meet with someone casually or simple people watch while you sip on your coffee or enjoy one of their sandwiches."

When I stepped up to the register to order, the woman at the register sucked her teeth and gave a sigh and said they were all out of Everything Bagels. Meanwhile, there was an abundance of Everything Bagels on the rack to the left of the register. This woman obviously hates her job and didn't even bother to check to see if there were any bagels left. I settled for the basic regular bagel instead. Only reason why I come here on a regular basis is because I work around the corner. Otherwise, I would've stayed away. There's always Pax down the block."
748,pret-a-manger-new-york-26,2017-07-13,4.0,"I have a slight obsession with Pret and normally eat here 4-5 times a trip each month when I'm in NY. Even though things are premade everything I've had has been fresh and makes for a quick check out.

For breakfast I love the southwest breakfast wrap (with the addition of Franks Red Hot) and a new discovery of egg salad and bacon on baguette which was delicious and travels well as it's not hot. 

I haven't had a bad lunch and like many of the sandwiches but lately have been trying to behave and find the salmon/quinoa/edamame salad and the coconut chicken/miso sweet potato box. Both have a great combo of textures and flavors and don't make me want to nap after eating. 

My only gripe is this location has limited seating and is often packed, eating standing is no fun. It can also get expensive if you add juice or sides, luckily I can expense my $15 breakfast but I would think twice about the cost if I was at home and footing the bill."

This place has grown on me over the years since my transatlantic trips across the pond and late night ventures to the Pret at the Marble Arch.

The sandwiches are premade, which is good and bad.  The good part is that, yes, they are well made.  The bad part is that, unlike local delis, you cannot ask them to hold an ingredient that you don't like, or to add extras.

And Pret can be pricey.

While the seating isn't bad, it can get crowded during lunch hours.  On the plus side, you can walk over to Bryant Park if the weather is nice.

Imagine my glee when I saw that it was located directly across the street from my hotel in NYC...I can't even begin to tell you.

While the sandwiches have definitely been americanized, with a lot of my old favourites not being available, it was still so good that I sought out a cooler box and brought several sandwiches back to Los angeles with me (no, really, I did!).

The chicken and bacon sandwich is my favourite by far, along with the roast beef sandwich. I tried the hot falafel sandwich, too, which was great, but very salty. Carrot cake here is also just as I remember it, although a bit sweeter.

All sandwiches are made fresh, and it is a great way to get some food without wondering which part of the animal it is, like many of pret's fast food competitors."
748,pret-a-manger-new-york-26,2013-02-14,5.0,"On a normal day, salad is not an option that comes to mind when I'm figuring out what to have for lunch or dinner. Not even when I'm on a diet (which is rare in itself). It's a bunch of greens that can not possibly fill my stomach - where's the rice? the bread? the potato?

But let's face it, there are days when I'm feeling heavy, and my stomach is crying out for a rest from whatever it is I'm stuffing my face with.  And so, I think ""okay...salad."" But I cringe at the idea. Ugh.

Last night was the first night I tried a Pret a Manger salad - romaine lettuce with grilled chicken, tomato, walnuts and cranberries. It was delectable. Am I going crazy? I loved the salad so much that I went back tonight, and tried the Caesar salad - another home run. I don't know what it is. All I can say is that everything tasted really fresh, and the portion sizes were perfect.

Kudos Pret - if I ever want a salad, you are my number one choice (although true to nature, I'll also be having a side of garlic knots)."
748,pret-a-manger-new-york-26,2017-05-08,3.0,"The ubiquitous locations and the super efficient way these Prêts handle crowds, means they're pretty hard to avoid when you're in a rush and just can't deal. But every time I've had one of their sad salads with literally like 5 edamame beans, a few other little pieces of this and that, I've immediately regretted the $10 decision and had to throw the tasteless thing away uneaten. I would say it's the same with the congealed wraps and tiny little bland squares they call salads. The only success I've had is getting a huge drip coffee, their soups are acceptable and their Bircher yogurts. Oh and the staff are really nice and cheery too. That's what the 3 stars are for."
748,pret-a-manger-new-york-26,2013-08-08,5.0,"I love pret! Their croissants are always fresh and in my personal opinion they're the best you can find in the city at a reasonable price as well. Their food and sandwiches are always fresh and the cashiers are always smiling and in such good moods. Their MINT TEA is actually amazing, its all I drink. 

definitely try a harvest cookie. They're delicious and chewy and really healthy!"

Pret a Manger is one of my favorite picks when I am working in the Herald Square area. The best thing is how fresh the food truly is. 

I was feeling a little under the weather, but a nice hearty cup of the Moroccan lentil soup really lifted my spirits. I also really enjoy their sparking drinks. My favorite is the yoga bunny detox."

1. Music - way too loud. Cannot enjoy conversation with fellow tablemates.

2. I ordered a latte. It had a piece of metal or foil in it, and took it back. I didn't mind it at all, but then they tried to blame eachother on who did it and all I wanted was a new drink. A different person made the next drink, and the espresso was over drawn and tasted severly burnt. 

Just wasn't a pleasant experience; however, loved the ambiance and the menu. Just needs a little focus on customer service."

I'm not expecting spectacular customer service anywhere in NYC, but at least decent.  I didn't even get that today.  Well, just give minutes ago.  I walked in to grab some lunch and the cashier was a tall guy that I never seen before.  Probably a season employee.  The expression on his face was like someone who totally hated his job and life.  Just rude.  He threw my napkins on the counter and then proceeded to swipe my card and also threw that on the counter.  Talk about rude.  Ugh!  Get a different job if you hate it so much, don't take it out me or any of the customers.  geez."

It was full of working people near by. They have two full salad bars and on the side a sushi bar as well (I was very sad I missed this..). 

They had a salad special where you pick a bowl (with the greens you want) from the refrigerator (!) and pick one meat and 3 veggies. It was 8-9 bucks and was a hearty meal for me! Obviously I got the big bulky broccoli, black beans, and grilled chicken. I was full!"
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2019-10-28,5.0,Go get the stir fry! It's my go to daily lunch during the work week. They also have veggie options. This is literally the only thing I come here for so I'm unsure about the other foods that they serve here. The stir fry line is next to the udon line. It gets packed around lunchtime though! Be clear in which line you're standing in. I usually get the all veggies with extra eggs extra spicy with white rice (you can opt for noodles instead). This section also closes at 2pm but the rest of the place is open.

I would have given 5 stars, but i just wish they had a choice of biodegradable food containers."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2017-03-18,5.0,"What else is there to say?! I come here for lunch everyday not just because it is the only eatery on the block, but because of their high standards for food quality and dedication to customer satisfaction. 

The salad bar is fast, and most importantly the ingredients are fresh. You have the pretty standard option of 1 protein, 1 cheese, and then an additional 3 veggies. Service could not be friendlier- the people here are really good at what they do.

Bagel bar in the morning is sometimes a little crowded, especially if you happen to be in a rush.

Furthermore, the cleanliness of this place is almost unfair, but certainly is not overlooked and much appreciated. The owner is there everyday making sure everything is spick and span- he has a keen understanding of what it takes to run a successful eatery.

It is going to be tough for any establishment to match the perfectionist customer service I get at Frame on a daily basis. Hectic checkout lines are immediately alleviated by the experts behind the counter who take care of ringing up your order in record times. They are especially good about making NFC payments as well!"
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2017-05-24,3.0,"After multiple times in this place (as it is right across from my job) I can honestly say that I hope they will shut down.  The quality has quickly and severely went down (not that it was fantastic to begin with).  I am completely and utterly disgusted and disappointed in the bibimbap (I tend to half of the time get bibimbap because that particular line is short or pretty much non existent compared to other lines in the Frame).  I usually get beef for meat and aside from that beef looking like something out of a scary movie, now it tastes like shit too.  Just now I had to throw away pretty much half of the bibimbap due to the meat being unacceptable to eat.  My coworker friend was eating a soup (also from Korean section) and she said chicken was hard like rubber.  So she also had to get rid of a good portion of the soup as it was inedible.

At least if the food was worth the money then fine.  But the quality (particularly of the meat they 'prepare') is utterly atrocious.  You are wasting money on the food you can't eat, don't enjoy and end up being hungry on top of it all (because you had to throw it out).  I understand they have to pay crazy rent and it's tough maintaining a business in this neighborhood, but at least make your establishment decent enough so that the customer will continue to come back.  They are quickly turning them away!"

749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2016-03-31,3.0,"Came here after an interview nearby. Really delicious salad bar. Went with five items - avocado salad, beets, egg salad, salmon, and spinach lentil feta salad. Everything was pretty fresh and well seasoned. Coffee is self-serve Illy, tasted fine. 

As mentioned by some others, this place can get quite crowded and hectic. Queue for what you want, then queue again for the cashier. 

This was a little on the pricey side at $13. Would be 4 stars if priced better, and 5 stars if they had more seating options and maybe free wifi (would be nice to have a nice sit down casual lunch option in this area)

There's not many options in the area but as all the Hudson Yards projects come to fruition, I'm sure many more amenities and dining options will follow. Some quality competition should bring prices down."

749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2018-02-28,2.0,"My suggestion for Frame is to lose the avocado toast display. The avocado sits out all day and turns into a brown pile of mush and looks completely unappetizing. As an avocado lover who might want to order avocado toast from time to time, this display actually makes me want to do the opposite -- and I know I'm not the only one! Just a small suggestion that might make a big difference!"
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2017-12-22,2.0,"Beware. Gourmet prices only. 2 eggs & bacon on a roll ($4.35) are ice cold every day because they prepare everything in advance & let it sit out unheated. Very gross. Coffee carts  outside give you a fresh and hot sandwich made to order at half the price. I would say get it from the breakfast bar, instead because it's heated,  but the bar is $11 per pound. ."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2014-01-16,2.0,"At 11:27 AM yesterday I came in here looking for an early lunch. I had never seen this place before and it looked like an interesting place to try.

When I got there there was one person ahead of me who wasn't being helped yest by the two people behind the counter as they were busy I guess filling out delivery orders or something. When the person in front of me was being assisted I looked at my sandwich options.  I decided to get the chicken fajita sandwich on flat bread.

When I ordered my sandwich it didn't take long to get completed. The chicken was grilled.  I can't be sure about the pieces of red bell peppers- I think they were grilled.  There were no onions in the sandwich. When I think of a fajita I think of peppers and onions. There was also processed American cheese slices on the sandwich, which was not appealing at all on a fajita sandwich and they were barely melted.  The sandwich  also lacked any sort of spice or heat which I expect from a fajita. It was a good sized sandwich for the price, especially considering the area."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2017-05-09,2.0,Due to it being in close proximity to work I find myself here more than I would like to. Everything is overpriced especially the lunch buffet. You definitely do not get what you pay for. The sushi is meh but aesthetically pleasing
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2016-09-29,4.0,"Got a salad. It's my go to place for lunch because it's easy and the only thing around Hudson yards. I got the salad and the options are abundant enough. You get a choice of 1 protein , cheese, and 3 additions.

The staff is very friendly and always smiling ! It's also very clean 

Cost is 9.25 after taxes. It's good enough food for a quick easy cheap lunch (anything under $10)"
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2017-12-27,2.0,"Have tried this place a few times as it is close to my work and have given up on them. While the udon is ok, the guys manning the egg / bagel station in the morning take their time acknowledging customers and both times I ordered from them my order was incorrect and inedible. It's a shame because the ladies at the register and the gentlemen at the noodle counter are always so friendly."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2018-06-25,4.0,"This review is based solely on my Seamless orders since I've never stopped by their brick & mortar. I ordered from here easily once a week. Their create-your-own salads are so good and such a steal. Generous portions and fresh ingredients. $6 for a good-sized grilled chicken salad which usually lasted me two meals. The last few times I've ordered they've cancelled because they're ""too busy"". Now they're no longer in my delivery range. I live 4 blocks away and can practically see it from my window. So disappointing, but after reading some negative reviews about being shut down for health concerns, I'm totally grossed out. Also, don't bother with the baked goods by Cheryl Kleinman. Very overpriced for the size."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2016-03-24,4.0,No sandwiches until after 11:30. Great spot to grab a bite before getting a train and Penn Station. I got tea and a cranberry scone which was delicious. Not crowded. Also got the tomato pesto panini and it was delicious. A bit too much on the greens but still delicious especially with the sauce they give you with it. I'm definitely going to keep this place in mind for future trips.
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2014-10-04,2.0,"This place is obscenely expensive.
It's full of super entitled clientele, who will cut you in line without blinking and who are just generally obnoxious.

Their sandwiches aren't great. The balsamic chicken sandwich is both soggy and chalky.

I really like their ice coffee, although several times this summer they ""ran out of ice"" (weird, right?)

Be prepared to throw down $9 for an iced coffee and a fruit cup."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2016-08-03,1.0,"I work a block away and grab something whenever I need something quick, but honestly, not worth the $$. There is a guy standing and staring at everyone by the salad bar to make sure no one takes salad? WTF.....also, they charge $0.50 for kale? Sorry guys.....not good business strategy. If you're already charging $10 for tossed salad and your workers are rude as fcuk that they barely add protein (I constantly have to ask them to add more than just 3 little pieces of chicken)....how the heck are you okay with charging an extra $0.50 for kale? I will obviously be back because I literally work there and I need to eat but I'd rather go elsewhere."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2014-05-20,3.0,"Things I like about Frame:
- avocado salad (though it does get picked over during the lunch rush)
- their premade sushi and seaweed salad
- their iced coffee (you serve yourself so you can get that perfect ice-coffee-cream ratio)
- they carry Davidovitch bagels and a variety of cream cheeses in the morning
- all the cashier ladies are very pleasant

Things I don't like about Frame:
- they run out of everything bagels by 9:15 most mornings
- the hours posted say they close at 4pm but I sometimes see customers still in there after 5 and am generally confused about when the salad bar shuts down
- the prices of the salad bar, Korean food, salads, sandwiches, desserts, etc.
- no basic spinach/romaine/spring greens/arugula to add to the premade salads
- I paid $2.75 for a single-serve fruit Chobani yesterday. $2.75! At least they gave me a spoon and napkins but I had to vow never again.

I'll be back, but not for the yogurt."

Came in at 11:30am and salad bar wasn't ready. 

Used to work in midtown where the service is fast and friendly. It seems to me that Frame needs to improve its service if it wants to compete with what will eventually be a hot lunch market giving the influx of buildings and thus new people used to much better service."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2012-02-23,2.0,"There really aren't a lot of lunch options all the way out here, so I've gotten to know this place pretty well since I eat here at least once or twice a week. 

It's not a place I would normally choose to eat at, but it's better than a lot of other places in the area (such as the deli around the corner which we have named the Smelly Deli).

It looks nice and more upscale than a lot of the places around the area. There is also a cute sitting area upstairs.

Pluses: They carry good red velvet cupcakes, macarons and a wide selection of drinks. They also have decent sushi and udon (I like the veggie dumplings). The prepared foods section is also pretty good and what I usually hit up. They usually have some type of baked salmon which is delicious. 

Minuses: Several coworkers have found a variety of bugs and other things such as glass in their food before. Which is gross. To be honest, there was a panic about the glass but I'm actually more disturbed by the bugs. Despite these issues, I still eat here, which may or may not say something about me...  The prepared foods is charged by the lb and I've ended up walking out with a $18 lunch  more than once. Which, needless to say, is not worth it!"

There was no notice on the door, guess they create their own hours when they want."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2013-11-07,2.0,"booooooooooooooooo!

The food is good but everything at Frame is way overpriced. The hours are terrible and the people aren't very nice. Just because Frame is one of the few food option in the area shouldn't license them to rip people off. 

If you walk by this place, keep walking unless you are dying of hunger or thirst. Actually, if you are dying of hunger or thirst, go to the McDonalds up the road."

749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2013-10-21,1.0,"I work across the street from this place and although the food is really good and high quality, the service is unbelievably rude. My coworkers patron this place everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. We have meetings catered from them often. I see employees almost everyday either inside the place or on the subway or walking to work, and they never smile or say hi. They make it seem like me coming there is a pain and an inconvenience for them. 

The place is also WAY overpriced. One time they charged me $1 for pad of butter. My coworker needed an onion for a shoot, they charged him $1.50.

Although I like the idea of a local restaurant that is not owned by a chain, Id much rather have a friendly mcdonalds across the street than this rude place."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2013-10-22,4.0,"I was a little worried about lunch options in Midtown West being limited to the McDonald's on the corner and the Starbucks downstairs. Happily, I came across this place on my first day and have been going at least 2x/week. 

The food is amazingly high quality given the volume they are moving every day, everything is executed surprisingly perfectly (nothing is overcooked or undercooked, everything is well seasoned), with lots of tasty and healthy options, as good or better than what I can make at home. I used to work at Google and the hot buffet reminds me of the Google cafe (except not free, ha). 

I'm especially a fan of their fish and their avocado and hearts-of-palm prepared salad.  Yes, it's a bit on the pricey side but I will gladly pay them to avoid the trouble of grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning after a healthy, homecooked meal and I actually think the pricing is fair given the quality of the cooking and the ingredients. If you want cheap, head to the corner pizzeria for a limp, greasy slice or a get fat on a super carb-heavy sandwich.

I also read a lot of reviews complaining about the service.  I am not sure what people are expecting from a busy take-out food court.  If the people at the registers are brusque it's because they are trying to process orders from dozens of hungry professionals during a very high-volume lunch rush, give them a break!  I notice the management staff is always on hand and seem to be overseeing the operations run smoothly."

However, I don't see that justifies doubled price. There are a ton of variety here, yes. You can get western sandwiches, burritos, salad and soup but you can also find Korean bibimbop, Sushi, etc. There are also a decent selection of desserts and cookies. 

Everything looks very fresh, clean and upscale. And you pay for it."
749,frame-gourmet-eatery-new-york,2013-02-22,2.0,"I have had the opportunity to try both the breakfast and lunch here using vouchers.

Breakfast: Not sure if the eggs served are from real eggs as they appeared to be too consistent. Ended up getting sunny side up just in case w/ bacon and no cheese. These were put on a fresh bagel which by default is plain so I had to yell at them for a garlic one. Of course I also asked for Canadian bacon but I suppose they were hard of hearing and gave me regular bacon. In either case, I also requested some lettuce and tomato. They charged an extra dollar per sandwich for the real eggs (they gave me 2 on each sandwich) and for the lettuce / tomato.

Lunch: Used some vouchers (provided by local training) for various sandwiches during the week. These were OK for the most part. I was quite happy that usually they didnt charge extra for lettuce and tomato but sometimes they added an extra dollar for the grilled veggies. Ended up usually combining vouchers with someone else on training and getting a large miso soup, extra spicy. They simply add red pepper flakes which are finely ground, but the soup is quite good. Another oddity is that one time they provided free chips with the sandwich but another 3 times they did not.

They also have a salad bar, which is on the expensive side at around 10$ a pound.

The service is a bit poor. Having vouchers for 12$ each, each day I usually spent around 9$ which means they made a good amount of change. One day, I had 13$ and a few cents, but they only let me 'slide' after a few minutes of discussion. This is just poor business practice. They remembered seeing me all week (and they know they made money) and then one day they give a huge hassle over less than 2$.

I would go here again if it were free, however, there are definitely other places were I would leave my 8$ or so of lunch money."

She noticed after she got back to the office and had to bring the receipt back in to have them take care of the charge.
Then last week, I got lunch there myself and they charged my debit card $144 for my soup and salad instead of $14. I had to wait a week for the charge to be reversed. 

Lesson learned, they are more interested in quantity than quality where customer service is concerned-cash is king!"

I've had bimbimbap from KTown for less with way better ingredients. For that price he should've at least attempted to say thanks.

I tried the avocado toast with a poached egg and cherry tomatoes. This was bland all around so I'll stick with the cookie for now."
750,bluestone-lane-new-york-17,2020-01-09,5.0,"This is my go-to spot when I'm in the area and I need a place to chill and just kill some time. 

The space itself is on the small side, with a couple of tables upstairs where people either plug in their laptops to do work, read, or have a low-key conversation with a friend. I've only come here by myself or with a friend and wouldn't recommend it for a group.

The pastries and drinks are exactly what you'd expect at a coffee shop chain so no complaints here."
750,bluestone-lane-new-york-17,2019-10-03,4.0,"Cute shop with some pretty good coffee!

Recently had a flat white from here and it was done very well. Personally, considering it's a smaller shop, a little friendlier baristas would be refreshing. But I'm there for the coffee so I can't complain all that much."
750,bluestone-lane-new-york-17,2019-08-28,4.0,"Really cozy spot. Up a small flight of stairs, inside is a very clean and warm interior. There's green and living plants hanging inside. It's a welcomed sight in this concrete city. 

We ordered a Hot Brew Coffee in the small size and a small Latte. The Hot Brew was quite acidic in the way that it should be. The Latte was just right. 

There are a few tables inside and an upstairs seating area. It was quiet inside, and the staff was courteous and pleasant. The staff was patient when answering our questions about a few items on the menu. 

Would come here again for sure to enjoy some coffee or perhaps some of their pastries in their display case."
750,bluestone-lane-new-york-17,2019-08-04,4.0,"Experience 
1. Sampled blk coffee ""Flagstaff blend"":
- initial flavor sits well but ends a bit sour which I suspect from not being a fresh brew. 
2. Ordered cafe au lait (w. Almond milk):
- good enough cup, milk disguised some of the bitterness of a brew out to long. 
3. Ordered ice latte ""Maverick blend""(w. Almond milk): the highlight of today! Fresh, refreshing, toasty, hints of cacao nibs.
4. Ordered vegan energy balls, chocolate banana bread:
- energy balls were good, a little hard.
- choc. Banana bread was soft and tasted good according to my wife.

Service: Good enough. Baristas looked a bit bored. A very hot Sunday can do that to us sometimes.

Recommendations: In case Blue Stone Lane does not (I should have asked), please keep home brews consistently fresh every hour."

They do have a few seats on the main floor and upstairs but it is very tight and the upstairs area is pretty dark and dismal.

The staff first and foremost are so lovely and nice 5/5 stars here.

Options for food here are limited. Several options of toast you can choose from. Then obviously the coffee and beverage selection.

The avocado toast was good, average I would say, a little on the dryer side with the bread, but a good quick snack. The coffee was also good, i got a cappuccino and it was perfect.

The toast was too burnt, and it could've used a little more lemon on it.

750,bluestone-lane-new-york-17,2018-12-10,2.0,"This is just the cutest place and I really wanted to write a great review, but after visiting two times, their food at this location just really isn't up to par.

Love the way they've decorated the 1st floor space with the light and airy teal/blue colors. The high ceilings are great too, but too bad there isn't much seating other than a few counter seats. They have more seating upstairs, but this is where the vibe is totally lost; low ceilings are a given, but the lighting up there is terrible (easy way to fix ambiance I think), and decor-wise, it doesn't seem like they spent anytime up there on anything.

Their coffee is good, but this low rating is really for their food. The below is what I tried on my two visits:

BANANA TOAST (fresh banana sliced on toasted multigrain bread w/ almond butter, cinnamon & honey) $4.50
Really quite a simple toast, but somehow they can't deliver this to you while the bread is still hot and crispy. After I picked it up (right when it was ready, I watched them make it) and walked up the stairs to the seating area, the bread was already quite stale. The almond butter they use was also way too thick - you know when you're at the end of your almond butter jar and there's not enough oil to make it spreadable and everything sticks to your upper palate? ugh... 

BREAKFAST BOWL (baby kale, cherry tomatoes, feta, avocado, red quinoa & poached egg) $14
This sounded amazing, and to be honest, most of it WAS amazing, minus the $14 price tag (you can get a salad at sweetgreen at that point with a bunch of amazing toppings!) AND THE FIZZY AVOCADO SCOOP in my salad! They give you an ice cream scoopful of avocado on your salad, which I was excited about, but once I had a taste, it had this fizzy taste in my mouth. I thought it was just me, so I tried it again, and I confirmed it was indeed fizzy/carbonated. After some research, I found out that it means that it has been stored for way too long in the stainless steel container and is essentially really OLD GUAC. What's surprising is that it looks fresh and green too... I had to throw all of it away, wasn't worth the risk! They need to check their produce more often before serving it to their customers!

Love bluestone lane, but my recent visits were just no bueno!!!"
750,bluestone-lane-new-york-17,2018-05-08,4.0,"FYI this is on 38th between 7th and Broadway, and not on Broadway between 37th and 38th like Yelp says. 

Bluestone Lane is a cafe for the hippie-dippies in midtown: small, cute, quiet, health-minded, Aussie-themed. There's a few bar stools by a narrow counter downstairs if you're planning to sit. If you're craving flat whites and avocado toasts, come here. 

The almond milk cappuccino was delicious, but was gone in two gulps. If that's what you want, I suggest getting the large. 

Chamomile tea was refreshing and all-natural. 

The Rainbow Bowl blew me away. It's huge, so it lasted me two meals, and it's so beyond delicious and healthy, with an egg, avocado, cherry tomato, turmeric hummus, sesame seeds, kale, beets, and lentils - all my favorite things. Would love to try the Breakfast Bowl next time. 

So the only negatives are the small portion size for my cappuccino and no calorie and nutrition information for anything. If it wasn't for these two points, I'd return. If you don't care about this, then enjoy the lovely little cafe that is Bluestone Lane."
750,bluestone-lane-new-york-17,2018-04-07,4.0,"Such a cute cafe in midtown area. It is quiet and removes you from the hustle and bustle. There is an upstairs area for extra seating and also some counters downstairs. The upstairs area is nice for working ! Baristas are very friendly. I've always been a fan of Australian style coffee and they make it very well here. Love the lattes! They have soy, almond and OATLY oat milk which is honestly the best thing to happen to non dairy coffee. 

Unfortunately NONE of their menu items are vegan as their bread isn't vegan ): so all the delicious looking avo toast etc are NOT vegan. Just vegetarian. Also there's no vegan baked goods, but there are vegan snacks such as oatmeal, chia pudding and energy balls/ bars. At least they were knowledgeable about what's vegan or not. Please just change to vegan bread!!! They do have plenty of gluten free options. 

The entrance is on 37th NOT broadway!! It is opposite the church. 

I'll come back for coffee and to chill. Seems like a nice spot to catch up with someone one on one, or do some reading."

I wanted to give it a second chance and chalk that one experience up to a mistake on the baristas part. Stopped by their location on 37th street and my opinion has officially changed. Their staff is lovely and welcoming. The perfect kind of energy and kindness one needs before having their morning coffee in nyc. Would give 5 stars for the staff and the coffee (which was great this time). 4 stars because the salmon toast was decent, and a fair price considering people way over charge for smoked salmon dishes. But thought the lemon juice addition was unnecessary and took away from the salmon. Next time i will just ask for it without the lemon juice. I dont love to support chains but this is a good one. Will be back."

I decided on the salmon toast, which comes with smoked salmon and cream cheese, and added smashed avocado and a poached egg. It was so good and very filling, unlike many places that have such small avocado toast servings. I also had an iced matcha latte, which was refreshing.

Everything on the menu is to die for. Especially their Aussie Latte, Iced Milo, and Chai Lattes. But what has kept me walking through those doors every Monday-Friday at 830am is the staff. THEY CARE. I've been to multiple locations and nothing compares to the beautiful souls at this location. Elissa, Meech, & Julia truly take making even a simple latte to the heart. Please understand that every penny spent here is worth it when you have a staff who not only loves what they do but services you with affection and happiness. 

I cannot forget to mention Jessica, Sarah, Lock, Pam and Ellen who bend over backwards to make sure everything and anything I get is nothing but perfection. The entire staff never misses a beat, works with their heart and with a smile. My morning doesn't function or feel right unless I walk into BlueStone.

Such a shame said comfort food and its memories has been replaced by a more lackluster gustatory experience.

Had great memories of Dunkin' Donuts that people from the West Coast, like me, await its arrival/return(?) in 2015. Jelly and cream filled donuts and the vast number of donut holes called Munchkins litter my memories of said numiness,

The trick of great donuts is all about timing. Old/stale donuts are blah. Even older ones are blech. Came here one night as I strolled back to my hotel after watching a movie (I ran out of things to do for the day) and headed here. I ask how fresh the donuts were. I learned that Dunkin' Donuts are NOT made at said stores. They're delivered. The clerk said 3 hours for a fresh batch. It was 230 AM. Boston cream's all gone. Got a raspberry jelly filled one and some donut holes. He felt bad for me that he just gave them to me. I thanked him.

It was stale that all it took one bite, and I had to get rid of it.

I wanted to give them another chance. Went here for breakfast while I waited for my laundry to be done (I ran out of clothes) Enclosed is a picture of the breakfast burrito as compared to a ketchup packet. Wow, the picture made it look bigger. Took me about 3 bites to eat it. It was okay. The glazed donut I got, which was probably fresher, was also okay.

Staff was abrupt and mildly standoffish, except for the one who gave me the stale ones. I want my old memories of Dunkin' Donuts back. They were better than the ones I had here."

I asked them once more, they said nothing but just doing their own thing in the back. 15 mins passes, ""like what the hell is going on"", they were still cleaning up the store. I just left the store. Horrible. So terrible!!"
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2015-08-05,1.0,"Their management has changed and now everything there sucks, the employees, service and food product are all awful. Stale bread at the subway. The dunkin is ALWAYS out of items and they never make it correctly. I ask for a croissant with cheese, toasted. They toast the croissant and then put the cheese after, does this make any sense?? They're the worst, go to the Dunkin on 33rd between 5th and 6th instead, they're great."
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2015-07-07,1.0,This is perhaps the worst Dunkin Donuts in the chain.  The staff is dismissive and it usually takes them three tries for them to get an order right.  Since I work across the street I've gone more often than I'd like to admit.  Avoid if you can.
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2014-04-18,1.0,"Just wanted to try since i haven't eat dunkin for such a long time. Also I tried the Irish coffee. 
I think just average quality that I'm sure I won't be craving again soon."

751,dunkin-new-york-166,2010-10-16,4.0,"Fast orders. That's all I have to say.

Also, know what you want, have the money ready, and be prepared to step aside.

They will rush you through faster than you can even think about what just happened. And that's a good thing for New Yorkers in a rush.

There are two reasons why there's almost always a line here, because it's near the Empire State Building, and because they keep customers coming back with speedy service. And if you get the right employee, they tend to memorize your order when you're a regular, which speeds things up even more.

If you're new to this place, I can see it being a horrible, awful experience."
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2012-03-17,3.0,"It was okay. But why did I go here???

It was the closest thing to my hotel and we don't have Dunkin Donuts in San Francisco.

I really should've gone somewhere else, like Donut Planet."
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2010-09-03,5.0,"I debated on how to review this store, but to be perfectly honest, in the world of Dunkin Donuts places, this is easily the best one I've been blessed to have consistent access to since it's near my office.

I have seen some amazing feats of speed here. For example, this morning there was literally a mob of un-caffeinated midtown A-holes inside the 15 foot space between the counter and the door. I walked in with the intention of making it into my office at 7am like I'd planned in order to do some necessary work before everyone else came in, immediately swore to myself, and resigned to wait for 20 minutes. Less than 5 minutes later, I was out the door. WOW! The only thing that I would complain about is the arrangement of this store. It's really hard to fit everyone that comes in here at one time, but they shuttle you out of here like cattle that are being zapped by cattle prods.

With such speed, you'd think they would screw up the orders once in a while, right? Nope. I've never had the incorrect item handed to me. AND, they offer lower than Manhattan prices as well, so double bonus.

In the real world, this would not be a 5-star place. But in the Dunkin world? Absolutely!"
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2015-04-15,1.0,"I have been coming to this location for over 5 years and used to have the best experience in the morning.  The former manager, Hyinh, knew my order (and many, many others) by heart and my order was always made correctly and with a nice, calm smile.  About 1-2 months ago it would seem as the franchise was sold as the entire staff turned over.  The new staff is extremely loud and borderline rude.  The final straw came this morning, where for the 3rd time in a row they messed my order up.  I specifically asked the person (who I believe is the new manager) making the order if it was right today since it wasn't in the days prior and yet again it was wrong.  I've also noticed the cleanliness has dropped significantly as my coffee cup is sticky to the touch.  Certainly never going back and I hope you all do the same."
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2010-12-03,4.0,"Funny thing about NYC.  The fast food restaurants and chain stores usually mirror a single ethnic group, and sometimes the ethnic group within the store's specific neighborhood.  Well these Asian ladies at this K-Town Dunkin, were a little chatty, but they let me go for a penney, and they had my coffee in my hands in less than 25 seconds.  (I time that kind of stuff, ok, not literally)  , but it was less than 25 seconds. Amazing how that greases the wheels for the start of good day!"

I came here to grab an ice cream cake and was happy that they were able to write on it for me. The writing came out okay, but I felt like I could have achieved the same results. Cake was good, line wasn't too long, and best of all, it was only two blocks from where I was going so nothing melted."

Good donuts. Busy with commuters in the morning. Some tables - I did find though a lot of people sat at the table and left their garbage. Duh. There are garbage cans next to every exit. Clean up after yourselves!!"
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2012-07-24,4.0,"Most dunkin' donuts are all the same. But this one is a step up. I go here pretty much every morning on the way to work. They always make my coffee without even asking me what I want, they already know. The coffee is always hot and fresh!"
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2011-04-02,5.0,"So let me start off by saying, I am not really a big fan of donuts or Krispy Kreme donuts (only in the West Coast). I feel that it's a bit too sweet but I heard about the whole Dunkin Donuts so I decided to give this place a try while I was visiting in New York.

Came here twice during my visit in the morning for a quick breakfast. Ordered half a dozen donuts for around $6 (can't remember) and had a cup of mocha latte. For the donuts, it tasted super good to me both mornings when I had ordered it. Glaze would still be my favorite but all the others that I ordered tasted really good and not too sweet. And for the mocha latte, I hate to say it, but it tasted great, I can say it taste better than Starbucks. That really sucks for me cause I love Starbucks but after tasting Dunkin Donut's coffee, Starbucks has not been the same to me.

In regards to the place and employees here. It is super, super packed here in the morning but the employees are super quick but be sure to know what you want as they seem to rush you. You can also tell who the regulars are because the employees greet them by name and ask if they want their usual. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes!"
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2012-12-27,3.0,"Coffee was warm and fresh.  The red velvet donut was definitely moist and yummy.  The plain old fashioned was just that - very plain.  The lady working the cash register was trying to talk & work WAY too quickly - she was getting ahead of herself and ended up messing up our order.  Limited seating, and you get a mix of tourists and crazies passing through."
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2010-09-20,3.0,"To be fair, it's a Dunkin' Donuts, Subway and Baskin Robbins all in ONE spot and boy is it busy!!!!

I stopped in for some Baskin Robbins after my dinner and on my way back to my hotel.

One single-scoop in a cup, Chocolate Peanut Butter ice cream was yummy."
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2010-07-05,4.0,"Ok, I love DD over Starbucks, but this particular branch is something special.  

Go here in the morning and you will find it is the fastest serving DD in the world.  The people taking your order are downright rude, but you know what, if there is a growing line of a dozen people out the door at 8:45 am, I want them to rush the hell out of people.  And it works, that line shrinks faster than a **** in icy water.  You never have to worry about waiting long at this one."
751,dunkin-new-york-166,2011-06-03,3.0,I say that this place is ok because you know it is just a dunut store. But i belive that the people should have more energy and have pride fr what they work in. Well that is all i have to say it is a good place to a dounut.
752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2020-03-19,3.0,"I ordered delivery from here tonight (address on seamless is incorrect). I ordered the grilled salmon hot with pasta primavera and grilled veggies, a bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito with broccoli added, and a 20oz cafe latte with almond milk. Delivery arrived on time, everything was hot and was free of spills. All great things.
Grilled salmon dinner $16.95
Breakfast burrito $8.70
Cafe latte w/almond milk $6.10
With tax and tip totaled $39.76.
The grilled salmon was delicious. However it didn't taste grilled. Juicy and cooked nicely though. I enjoyed this. Fresh sliced lemon wedge. The ""grilled veggies"" didn't seem grilled either but were cooked nicely. In the dish there were peppers, peas, yellow squash and maybe zucchini. The pasta primavera was disappointing. Didn't have a lemon flavor, I didn't taste any fresh parsley and I didn't taste any parm. Seems like plain penne. Grilled veggies were all mixed in with the primavera. I mean portion was good though for $16.95.
The breakfast burrito was yummy! Scrambled egg, melted cheese, salty crunchy bacon, and broccoli all rolled into a flour tortilla. Very filling. I'd totally order this again. Well worth the $8.70. The broccoli was additional. Sooo good.
The cafe latte was the most disappointing. Do not get one of these. It legit was coffee (NOT ESPRESSO) with almond milk. Waaaayyyyy overpriced. Waste of my money. AND there were coffee grounds in the bottom of my drink. Come on!  (See photo). Can't believe it was $6.10 for that. Worse than Starbucks prices.
I likely will not be reordering from here. If I do, it's just for that breakfast burrito lol."

I don't know why New Yorkers put up with such bad customer service.  This business would be DOA where I live."

Long story short, I ordered for 17 people and they charged me for 40 people. When I called, days in advance, asking for the receipt, the rude manager said he would email it and never did. The day of the event, the food arrives and the bill came to $1,042. Never have we ever spent that much money as our bill is usually $779. 

The manager refused to refund the difference and LIEDDDD about the headcount I gave him. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2019-10-28,1.0,"We had food delivered for lunch. One of the items was tasty, the other not so much.  The portions were skimpy and it took 2 hours for the food to arrive. We were led to believe that it was a 45 minute wait when we ordered.

752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2018-05-03,3.0,"The staff here is extremely friendly & chill.
But my question is this: Why at 12:30pm did they run out of romaine lettuce? I ended up getting the spring greens, but they were way too soft with no crunch at all. A salad should be crunchy, not soft. Ew.

The topping choices were plentiful and tasty, thank goodness.

Improvement of their lettuce consistency and availability will make this location a more desirable choice for salads."
752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2019-11-30,1.0,The food is disgusting. Soups taste like canned soups. Sandwiches were awful. The portion sizes are small for that price that they offer.

I did not ever receive my food, and the restaurant knows that i don't have it. Yet they refused to refund me because they claim the deliveryman tried to call me. However i did not receive any calls, and i even offered to prove it. And if he couldn't reach me via phone why didnt he just come to my floor, or leave the food with the doorman? Instead he took it away with him. 
After almost 2 hours of waiting i told them i no longer wanted my order, and not to remake it for me. And STILL they refused to give me a refund.
Please explain why i am paying for something that all parties know i did not receive.
Plus the woman on the phone was extremely rude. What BS."

752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2019-01-11,1.0,Ordered after a co-worker recommended this place. Super disappointed. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and the meat was pink- see photos. Can't say I'll go back.

You just said that. Out loud. In front if your boss. Okay!
Also, this rude/nasty gentlemen gives you barely anything in a large salad. Prepare to pay for the price of a large salad and get a small.

The prices can be kind of high for a simple lunch but I mean it's NYC. The servers are all really nice & work extremely fast. They have the tendency to get packed during lunch hours but the wait is never long. I usually get a salad, which I find to be really fresh & filling, or a panini - I've had them all & they're delicious! The burgers & fries are also so good. I usually pick my food up only because I've noticed whenever I place an order for delivery I get my food cold & it doesn't taste well."

752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2018-03-15,4.0,"With a plethora of seating options and big, open windows, Guy & Gallard is a lovely place to go for a hearty panini lunch. When I think of this place, deli meets city chic comes to mind: you have the usual selection of affordable sandwiches and paninis, offered up in a casual, modern setting. The space is airy and clean, ideal for decompressing, as long as you don't go during the lunch rush! If you find it too crowded, you can take your food to go as there is some public seating across the street.

For the city, the prices are great at about $11 a panini. I'll say the food tastes about average but the prices, casual ambience, and convenience of being able to seat yourself more than makes up for it."
752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2016-09-27,4.0,"There are a lot of G&G locations throughout the city, but this is my favorite one to get a salad.

I also have a favorite one for coffee, a favorite one that I sometimes think about going to but rarely do, a favorite one that I always accidentally walk past, and a favorite one to never go to because they refuse to honor my 15% discount card.

The food is largely the same from location to location, but what makes or breaks it for me is the staff. My favorite coffee location has a coffee guy that looks like he hates you when you come in, but is pretty generous with his pours - not too much ice, all the way to the top. Plus, the cashiers there know me so I never have to show them my discount card.

My favorite person at this location is one of the guys that makes salads in the evenings. If I work late, I like to come here and grab a gigantic salad, catch the ferry bus, head home, eat, and relax - all without having to worry about cooking, ordering seamless, or doing dishes. 

""Mr. Good Salad"" makes a MEAN salad, thanks in part to the salad ingredient policy: pick your lettuce, pick a protein, and pack as many toppings as humanly possible in there until the container basically implodes on itself. 

Your experience with Mr. Good Salad will go something like this:

TR: Hello, how are you?
GS: Ahh man, salad?!
TR: Yes, large romaine please.

(he grabs a bowl and tongs, dumps in the romaine, and stands at the ready)

TR: Cajun chicken...

(tongs go in, grab chicken, chicken goes in the bowl, tongs get knocked on the side of the bowl two times and two times only, producing a very distinct metal on metal clinking noise)

GS: Oh, good salad, good salad, what else?
TR: Tomatoes...

(tongs go in, grab tomatoes, tomatoes in the bowl, tongs get knocked on the side of the bowl two times and two times only)

GS: Oh, good salad, good salad.

And this goes on and on. I put 17 things in my last salad, so I heard ""good salad good salad"" so many times that by the time I left I really felt proud of myself - I really did make an absolutely amazing salad. Significant accomplishment. 

Even without Mr. Good Salad, it's as much salad as you want it to be for $9. They don't skimp on the available toppings, so go nuts and add one of everything, but good luck getting it to fit in the bowl. 

Good salad, good salad."

I ordered an egg salad sandwich. From the get-go, I asked for mayonnaise, oil, tomatoes, and on a pumpernickel bread. The short order cook was deaf tone. He repeated my order by mentioning that I wanted lettuce. I told him I never mentioned lettuce and repeated my entire ingredients verbatim.

When I got to the cashier, the vibe got even worse. The woman charged me .50¢ more for my 24 oz. chai latte. There is no consistency with the prices on the giant menu off the wall and what is charged at the cash register. I also asked for a handle bag and the cashier appeared to be busy finishing up a calculation for one of the delivery men. My presence was unacknowledged.

752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2016-07-12,2.0,"I might have made a wrong choice by getting a meatless panini but at least you have it not toasted if you can handle the cold bread because it became to oily once toasted. I didn't like the green leaf inside either, heat just killed it and couldn't even taste to understand if it was kale or something else.

Ordering process is also confusing, not every section has an employee behind. You take the food, then go to register to pay. It was like $8+ for a panini which I found expensive for breakfast considering the size and taste."

I've been to Guy & Gallard a few times and always thought the food was pretty good, but my most recent experience was excellent. G&G has a number of made-to-order stations, including omelets, salads, sandwiches, pasta, and smoothies. Of course, I went straight for the pasta station and ended up with penne in spicy arrabiata sauce with portobello mushrooms, roasted red peppers, zucchini, and parmesan cheese. All the veggies tasted fresh and the sauce was all heat and deliciousness. For the portion (huge), it wasn't all that expensive. 

They also have coffee and an extensive selection of quality to-go drinks. I got a diet cream soda, which is a bit of a rarity.

Unlike others, I didn't have an issue with the service. The guy making my pasta was neither friendly nor rude. He was just...there. And the woman at the checkout was actually pretty pleasant, greeting everyone with a smile."

The meat was hard, tasteless and had a weird smell. It was supposed to come with BBQ sauce but mine had no sauce at all. $1 extra for 4 tiny pieces of mushrooms that were the size of a dime. Even the bacon was nothing but salty. I had two bites and threw the whole thing away.

I've been to this location on multiple occasions and the staff has only been kind and accommodating, of not only me, but my companions as well. My food has always been impeccably prepared and presented. 5 s! They've earned a loyal customer."
752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2014-09-01,1.0,"Probably the worst G&G I've ever been to. Despite the food at most of these places being good, this particular location is so awful I had to review it.

The service is absolutely terrible, people working here just need to realize that they aren't the only employable folks in NYC. Quite honestly not one person I dealt with simply trying to order a sandwich, and purchase it, deserved their job.

I stood at the counter alone for 10-15 minutes as countless employees just passed me by without asking if I needed something. As I stared them down, they just walked around talking to each other as if I were invisible. 

Eventually one guy approached me with ""What can I get you?"" I told him what I wanted, and he picked up the wrong thing (at that point I just didn't care anymore and wanted to leave so I took whatever crappy panini he heated up).

After many more minutes, because he forgot about my order sitting in the press, it was handed to me dry and overheated.

End of my story, and I'm not going back. NY has too many better choices."
752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2016-12-09,1.0,"Boring and lackluster. Apart from a proper location with nice bar stools and proper counter space (with outlets), this place offers noting too exciting food-wise. The sandwiches are a little too fatty with generous shmears of  butter, but the rest disappoints. At least to me the variety and flavors are not on par with other NYC spots. I'm not even going to get into the coffees - the cappuccino was lukewarm, foamless and did not deserve its label. The shot of coffee in it was an insult to coffee beans. I think you get my sentiments, I can only recommend the place if you plan on sitting the day out at the bar without consuming much."
752,guy-and-gallard-new-york-7,2017-02-10,3.0,"We've been here so many times. 

RUDE AND DISINTERESTED STAFF: It's true that the attitude of the staff is shockingly rude. Everyone seems like they are doing you a favor and the cashier is consistently rude as well. 

FOOD: As for the food, the weekends are very limited in selection, and the omelets are very skimpy. Example, a western omlet has very very very very litte ham, peppers, etc in it. When I go to a totally different place on the UES, they pack the omlet with more, give more potatoes on the side, and even include coffee for just 50c ---- NOT THIS PLACE. Basic, self-serve coffee is $2+.  The weekday lunches are a bit better because they offer more selections.

PRICES: Prices are medium and you don't have to pay a tip. 

SERVICE: Most of the time when you get an entree, they don't bother to even put it on a tray for you. 

SUMMARY: We have gone consistently here due to the location being convenient for us, and it's okay. Even the owner doesn't ask what can be done differently or better. A clean place, but it's got room for improvement."

I always get the same thing...a yummy salad from the salad bar, and sometimes I pick up a sandwich or another treat for my husband. The guys behind the counter that make my salad always do a terrific job. They are very kind and make be feel welcome.

When I go to check out Ripon is always there with a smile and a warm welcome. She knows who I am and has taken interest in me as a customer. In this day and age I have seen customer service gone right out the window, with Ripon it is the exact opposite. She really does help make the entire experience / purchase a lot better and brings joy to my crazy work day. There are a bunch of local shops I can get my salad at, but I choose this location for the guys behind the counter and Ripon in the front."

My friend ordered a chai latte that she enjoyed. She also ordered a yogurt parfait and paid to add extra granola which they did not add; I understand it may be a subjective judgment, but there was definitely not enough granola, so there certainly was no ""extra.""

Appears to be staffed by family of the owner.  They do not understand how a sandwich is supposed to be made.  Among other issues, they toasted my chicken cutlet sandwich with the lettuce and honey mustard already on it.  I opened the sandwich container, and the chicken and cheese were still ice cold.  I asked them to re-toast it (even with everything still on it).

This is a small location with a couple of tables and counter seats.  

But it's the drinks and experience at this location that have turned me off.  One of my regular drink orders is a venti iced tea, so I know how it's made from getting it at various locations.  Starbucks is very procedural in how their drinks are made, so it surprises me that this location isn't able to get my drink right.  Once, I asked for light ice.  The pickup counter is right next to the ""barista"" so you can hear everything they say. The so-called barista read outloud that I asked for light ice to one of her coworkers and proceeded to say ""you know what that means"".  She proceeded to load up a heaping measured cup of ice.  Suffice it to say, my venti drink was half ice and more than usual if I had gotten it regular ice and at any other location.  

Another time, I ordered the same exact venti iced tea but it tasted bland and watered down already.  A different barista made my drink but didn't put enough pumps of the flavor I asked for. 

Why is there no consistency when it's a chain that is highly standardized?"

The drink came out quick and no issues there. However, I waited over 10 min for my bagel bites. I even asked one of the baristas to follow up, but she didn't say it loud enough for anyone to hear. As I looked behind the counter, I saw the employee taking his time with the food prep and he put my bag beside him but never gave it to the runner. When the runner finally gave it to me I rushed out only having a minute to get to my building and clock in. When I finally got to work, I realized the cashier put in the wrong food order and gave my egg white bites instead. 

Normally I only order drinks here and there isn't an issue. But this time I was pretty frustrated with the service especially with staff joking around while customers are patiently waiting during the morning rush."

It a tiny but efficient Starbucks with friendly baristas who serve up your caffeine pretty quickly. Not much seating save for a few tables and counter space along the wall. Small display with coffee retail products to purchase. I guess they get a mix of tourists and local workers from the surrounding area coming here.

Now that I know this one is here I might use it rather than the more crowded location on Park Ave around the block."

We ordered a Grande Caramel Macchiato and a Green Tea Latte. We ordered it through mobile order like always. When we got our drinks, they don't taste right. So we went to the counter to let the Barista know. My Macchiato had no caramel taste, it was like drinking regular coffee and the latte just tasted like a latte no green tea. So the Barista Mariela was like you need to order with extra caramel drizzle and extra green tea. We were so puzzled. Why would I do that if you made the drink right in the first place? I have never had to go to the Barista to correct my drink if I didn't have to. It really didn't taste right. Instead of just correcting it, she gave us attitude that we should be more clear on our drink orders?! She even told the Barista that made it that it's not her fault because we didn't order correctly in front of us. So we told her we always order it like this. She gave us a face so we left.

I'd maybeeeeeeee understand if I was out of line or one of those picky drink ordering people, but I'm very run of the mill. 

For example, when I was there today, after I got ordered my large coffee, I asked Rachel at the pick up section for 3 mini packs of honey. She snickers at me and throws my an attitude when reply, ""The honey packs are w/ the cashier..."" After she said that, rolling her eyes, she instructs Anthony to give me some honey packs. He hands me ONE pack of honey, also with a look of disgust, like I called him a name or something. Unbelievable...

It's a tiny cramped space that attracts a combination of Empire State building tourists and local Madison Square park worker bees. The line moves quickly enough - though the backwards Starbucks rules reign: if it's really busy, you'll get your drink in 5 minutes. If it's really slow, you'll get your drink in 10 minutes. Another qualm I have applies to the location of the sugar & milk station. Placed strategically in front of the call counter, you have to squeeze through everyone stirring sugar and milk to reach your drink. They don't have as many food options at this location either, so go elsewhere for an eggwich.

I came in on a Sunday at 4 and asked for the mild coffee. I was told that they didn't have Pike Place (you know, the signature Starbucks blend), but had the bold blend, Caffe Verona. And that's ALL they had. I found a Starbucks with exactly the same amount of choice that a Dunkin' Donuts has (and one with fewer choices than 7-Eleven.)

The barista, meanwhile, was distracted and sarcastic. And he got my order wrong.""Here you go."" ""Um, and the doughnut?"" ""I didn't hear you order a doughnut."" ""Just forget about it.""

How was the bathroom? Don't know- there wasn't one.

And how about the Starbucks atmosphere? It doesn't even play ""Starbucks music."" The cheerfully tasteful and generally bland mix I have come to associate with Starbucks.

I found the hip hop Starbucks! The LOUD hip hop Starbucks!

754,starbucks-new-york-554,2017-05-12,5.0,Deandra was very helpful. She and her coworker were the only two workers there and they did a great job! my drink tasted great. thanks ladies!
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2017-05-06,1.0,"Ordered a cold brew, the cup was so packed with ice I could barely get the straw in. And the coffee was so bitter it was undrinkable, I think they didn't have any cold brew and gave me the regular coffee. Terrible experience, will never go back"
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2015-07-07,5.0,"Staff is very friendly, location is never really to crowded, u can grab a seat most of time and its location is good if you work in the area."
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2015-08-04,4.0,"One of the cutest Starbucks I've been to. Has a nice small cozy feeling. 
Had a cold brew was on point. If only this place had a clover machine it would be perfect. 
Only thing I didn't like, and this is not a big deal at all, is that I had to ask for my treat receipt. But like I said that's not a big deal."
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2014-01-17,5.0,"The workers over there are very friendly 
And polite if you looking for starbucks around that area you'll know where to go :)"
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2016-10-17,5.0,This is by far one of the nicest Starbucks in the city. This is also the Starbucks with the friendliest staff that takes away all the awkward repetitious robotic customer service that is standard to so many of the other locations. Elyssa is a gem.
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2014-03-16,5.0,"Went in this morning to treat myself to a Sunday vanilla latte.  After ordering, the nice baristas forgot about me (I was waiting in the wrong location plus I am short so I was hidden by the coffee machines).  I would have been happy if they had just said whoops and made my latte but they went above and beyond!!! They bumped the size and after it was made, they asked me to taste it and said they would be happy to remake it for me if I wanted.  It was the BEST vanilla latte I have ever had!!!

Thank you nice baristas for making my day!"
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2010-01-26,2.0,"Lighting is good.  Seats/tables relatively clean, as were the floors.  Service was alright.

Tables super close together, but I suppose the space constraint is what it is."
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2014-02-15,5.0,"I really like this location. The line is never too long, service is quick and the employees are always friendly. Much prefer this one over the store a few blocks up at 23rd, which is always soooo slow."
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2014-12-23,1.0,"This has to be the most incompetent Starbucks location I've ever been to. They're always running out of items and mixing up orders. The employees have no sense of urgency and take their sweet little time, regardless of whether the line is out the door. Why is there even a line out the door when there are 4 or 5 people behind the counter? Get it together."
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2007-12-17,2.0,"Before I moved to New York, I was a soda swilling suburban/rural teenager who had no concept of fast food being a 'bad' thing.  Quick, cheap, yummy.  What could possibly be wrong with that?

Then I moved to this fair city, where enjoyment of fast food is probably the most obvious marker of social class out there.  Nice middle class Manhattanite sorts of people Do Not eat fast food, or at least they don't admit to it.

But I couldn't handle it.  So like many transplanted rural folks, I ducked into a McDonald's or Wendy's every once in a while to get my fix.

Seven years later, I'm happy to say that I've put all that behind me (even though I still think fast food as class marker is really lame, and we should all feel free to eat whatever we want).  

What has replaced the McDonald's run as stealth guilty pleasure consumption experience?  

Oh, y'know, just a slight hankering for Starbucks.  Usually because I have to pee, and hey, some cinnamon-vanilla tea and a holiday sparkle pumpkin muffin would really hit the spot right about now.  So I do it.  I get coffee and a snack from Starbucks.  

I have a feeling it's this sort of thing that keeps them in business, because everyone else I know claims to HATE Starbucks.  I hate them too.  That doesn't mean a frappucino wouldn't hit the spot right about now."
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2008-09-19,1.0,"Second worst Starbucks EVER. (The worst is in the Newark Airport and is reviewed below).  Starbucks is closing 600+ stores.  This should be one of them.

The barista asked me 3 times to repeat my drink order, didn't even look at me the entire time I was there, and dropped my change on the counter because there was a more important conversation to have with the people behind him.  Didn't give a flying f**k.

With 8 million other Starbucks nearby, I guess I won't have trouble finding a replacement, but this was my second awful experience at this store."
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2010-09-02,2.0,"I am not sure which is worse:

a) the fact that I decided to actually order a breakfast sandwich from Starbucks one morning on my way to work OR

b) the fact that I could not get the breakfast sandwich that I wanted.

A very close to accurate, but slightly enhanced transcript of my experience at yet another Starbucks*:

Me: Reduced-Fat Turkey Bacon with Egg Whites on English Muffin.**
Barista: (rings it up and gives me the price)
Me: (begins to tender money)
Barista: (to other barista) What? (to me) We don't have any turkey bacon left.
Me: Did you run out? It is like 930.
Barista: We don't have any. Do you want bacon?
Me: (to myself in my brain) Why would I cave now for the bacon I really wanted? I ordered the damn healthy alternative for a reason. (to barista) Can I just get the egg whites with the cheese?
Barista: We can't do it like that.
Me: (to myself) FML. (to barista) Just this.***
Barista: Sorry.

This is why I hate Starbucks. Those breakfast sandwiches suck, they burn your mouth and are always nuked beyond reason, but I was hungry and I just wanted the healthy one and I left with a bottle of iced tea and a healthy dose of perplexology.

754,starbucks-new-york-554,2009-02-09,4.0,"I am actually pretty surprised by the poor reviews of this place. I am definitely a DD fan over a Starbucks fan, but when I am in Chelsea for Rocky Horror, I actually surprisingly would rather go to the Starbucks. Typically I don't prefer the Starbucks coffee, and find that DD gives me better service.

In this area the Starbucks bathroom is spotless and the DD is nasty. The DD employees are rude but the Starbucks ones are extremely friendly. The DD coffee is still better, but normally not worth it."
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2015-10-09,4.0,"One of the best Starbucks I've been too.  Not to big, not that busy.  Courtney always remembers me and my drink order (and she always has a smile on her face and is singing a tune!)."
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2007-03-23,5.0,"How many Starbucks ARE there in Manhattan? 

The Starbucks at 19th & 8th is not the closest to my apartment. It is not the largest, nor the cleanest. The service is not the best, nor is it open latest (or earliest, not that I'll ever find out for myself). Its offerings are not unique in any way. It is not the busiest, nor is there often an empty table. It doesn't distinguish itself in any way from any of the 183 other Starbucks in Manhattan, but this is my favorite. 

This is where, on a steaming July afternoon in 2005, I got an iced tall vanilla nonfat latte and took an empty seat at the window. I broke out my Lonely Planet NYC guide book and began to circle what I had seen that day and where I might go tomorrow. And an hour later, the guide book warmed in orange highlighter, me cooled in the AC and surrounded by silent hotties and their laptops, I looked out the window and saw the Empire State Building above the rooftops across the street. And I knew someday I would live here -- at that moment I knew. It was my New York moment."
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2015-10-22,5.0,I work around the corner from here and gotta say I've always had great service from the baristas here.  Special shout out to Courtney(I hope I spelled that correctly) who takes care of me all of the time and has the best personality and service demeanor ever. They do a great job here.
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2009-12-08,3.0,"I was so stoked when this place opened replacing the sad Blimpie's that had previously occupied the space.  I lived right up the block at the time and was a total Starbucks-o-phile at the time.  

Then, as now, I wonder who designed the so unfriendly layout of this space?"
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2011-04-30,3.0,A Starbucks in Chelsea. Pretty standard. It's a shame the seats by the window on 8th Ave are facing into the store as opposed to the street as they do on the 19th street side -- this kinda limits the amount of people watching one can do. Also there always seems to be a line at the bathroom here.
754,starbucks-new-york-554,2012-09-16,1.0,"Good location , nice environment , but the service at night is just horrible....I dont know why they always in bad mood..."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-12-31,5.0,"I am pleased to take this time to share with you an experience I had at the Starbucks located on 8th Avenue at 35th Street on Friday February 22, 2019.  First of all, the minute my sister, niece and I walked in on Friday afternoon, the weekend vibe in the store got our weekend off on the right foot!  The music was great and the entire staff appeared to be enjoying what they were doing (despite being super busy).  There was great jovial banter between staff members as well as with the patrons.  A good time was being had by all.  


You see we were spending the weekend in the city celebrating my niece's 28th birthday.  She happens to be a Starbucks fanatic and visits a minimum of once a day.  My sister and I had this elaborate plan to surprise my niece with an illustrated, edited and published copy of a book of poems that she (my niece) had written.  When our plans with a local bookstore fell through I took to 8th avenue trying to find a replacement location to make the presentation.  When I walked back into Starbucks and told our story to Makin, to my amazement he was all over it!  Please don't get the wrong impression.  The most impressive thing about what follows is that at no time did the work flow cease or even slow down but the Starbucks team and patrons all pulled together to support a true Starbucks groupie.  To begin with Makin who was just coming on at 2pm when we were leaving the store the first time not only remembered us but referred to my niece Keisha by name!  


While taking orders, making drinks, serving customers, Makin, Lindsey and Malcolm, turned down the music, announced ""Poetry Night at Starbucks"" while a patron volunteered to read one of Keisha's poems aloud. The look on Keisha's face when she heard one of her own poems being read aloud by a stranger in her favorite place was PRICELESS!  Honestly of the three of us Keisha is really the only one who consistently patronized Starbucks because she is a single adult with no children and  a job  That being said, I will begin making an exception when I attend meetings across the street from your store on 8th avenue and 35th street, thanks to the gem of a team you have in that store lead by Makin!



P.S. If you ever need a spokesperson, Keisha E. is to Starbucks as Tiffany Haddish is to Groupon.  Just throwing that out there.  She's adorable too!  Thank you for taking the time to read my review."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2020-01-19,1.0,"Been to so many Starbucks around the city but this is the worst one yet. Was standing in line with about 7 other people and the cashiers and baristas were all dancing and singing along to rap songs ... I get that you have to have fun while working especially on a Sunday morning but get the work done first and then play. It was annoying that I had to stand in line and wait for the cashier to finish dancing before orders could be placed.

There was a woman in front of me that already paid for her order but decided she also wanted some food, when she asked the cashier if she can order more, the cashier rudely told the customer she has to wait back in line. Why? I don't understand why she had to go back in line when she already placed her order.

Bad customer service experience all together ... wouldn't go back."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-02-24,3.0,"Kinda hard to review a Starbucks when they're mostly all the same but what makes this one stand out amongst the rest is that they have sort of a coffee slinger here. They had a worker handing out drinks outside of the bar area. Never saw this in any Starbucks. 

This is a great idea because it probably helps cut down on stolen drinks in this high trafficked Starbucks. I liked it and think they should do it in other locations!

My drink wasn't half bad BTW."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-10-11,5.0,"I am not a morning person, even with coffee. But the morning crew at this Starbucks location makes me smile. They are always so energetic, greeting everyone, singing along to the music and being hilarious. Also, for a busy 8th ave location, I've had pretty good luck with getting my coffee order within 10 minutes of ordering. It didn't use to be this efficient - I remember avoiding this location because of long lines and average service. So glad that it's really turned around!"
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2020-01-19,1.0,"Because of convenience, I tried this spot out one Sunday morning. I will not be back. As soon as I walked in there was hip hop music blasting and all the workers were dancing behind the counter. I fully endorse having fun at work (especially on a Sunday morning) but not when it's interfering with your work. There were people waiting to order and couldn't because the lady working the register was dancing and ignoring the line. What upset me the most was seeing the customer in front of me get denied for ordering a pastry. The customer had already ordered 4 coffees. After the transaction the customer asked if she could also get a pastry too. The employee responded with ""sorry you have to wait back in line."" I was shocked! Why couldnt she just ring the lady up again?? Absolutely ridiculous."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-05-25,5.0,"Take a CHANCE and come to this Starbucks to meet barista ""Chance"", yes that's his name. Greeted me with the biggest smile and lifted spirits. The sweetest soul! Made my day. 

Tall iced latte with almond milk was great too!"
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-07-02,1.0,"slow as hell service. They ran out of everything I wanted and people behind me got served before me. 

Terrible location. Never again"
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-08-18,1.0,"Worst Starbucks I've been to. There is another one 1 block up, go to that one instead.
4 ppl behind the counter only 1 is making drinks. The others r either trying to flirt with customers or just calling out names from the labels, with no drinks! Don't know tf he's doing that for."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2020-01-08,2.0,"Every time I come here the people who work here always have a great attitude and truly do make sure you are recognized when you walk in and walk out. 

Unfortunately as a previous employee of this company I have to say training needs to be improved. Every time I get a salted caramel mocha it comes out different each purchase. This time my venti salted caramel mocha doesn't even have mocha in it. It doesn't even have a caramel taste. It taste like burnt coffee, my office has better coffee and if I knew I was going to get this bad of a mocha I would've not spent 7 dollars on it. 

Again the people here always are super nice but I hate when I walk to work and realize my coffee is burnt and not at all what I ordered especially being a previous employee. Training of what drink gets what needs to improve."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-10-11,1.0,"This Starbucks was disappointing! Coffee taste burnt I ordered a caramel macchiato and it was just not good, but it was free lol ‍"
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-01-30,1.0,No bathroom and only one outlet. Plus they've got some weird security type guy standing in the middle of the floor glaring people down. Very difficult to get those working the counter to give you the time of day. Hard pass.
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-07-16,5.0,Chance is such an amazing barista! He greeted me and my friend with a warm smile and great energy. This Starbucks location is so lovely and fun - can't wait to come back!
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-01-02,2.0,"This place is way too small for such a busy corner!! I normally mobile order my drink when I'm about 3 stops away, and I still have to wait ages for my drink. There needs to be more space for more employees and faster service."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2017-07-04,4.0,"Pros: it's a Starbucks, you know exactly what you are getting
Cons: limited sitting space

This is not a large location, you should avoid it if you are in a large group, or looking to hang out during the busier hours (like early morning/breakfast time, lunch break).

If you were reading other reviews like I was, you might've noticed that some of these reviews are from a while ago. Although they might've been legitimate complaints at the time, I haven't experienced any of the shortcomings listed in the 1 or 2 star reviews. Also keep in mind that staff comes and goes, and a good/bad experience a particular day during a particular time might not be accurate at a later date and time.

I'm taking a star off my review because the location is small and the music was a tad too loud. If I were looking for a Starbucks to take friends to, I know multiple others around NYC that are much bigger and even have urban-rescued wood for tables! Have fun and discover different locations, but don't worry about the reviews: this Starbucks will serve your drink just fine."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-09-21,5.0,"I rarely review places, but this Starbucks is a standout. It should be the Flagship location and model for nyc Starbucks. I look forward to going there Saturday morning. Staff is great and they appears to be having fun...very unusual for starbucks. It's clean. Impressed. Awesome job guys."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-04-10,1.0,I ordered my coffee 10 mins before arriving for pickup & still had to wait 10 mins for it to be ready. Kind of defeats the purpose of ordering ahead.
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-05-23,2.0,Horrible service. Ordered via mobile. 15 min later no coffee. I asked about it and I was told they would get it. Even though I had ordered earlier I got out on a queue and I had to wait another 10 to 12 min totally defeating the purpose of ordering ahead.
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-09-30,3.0,"Located on a busy intersection, this Starbucks is tucked away into a corporate plaza.  This store is rather small with limited seating indoors, and otherwise it's typical coffee with typical service."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-07-15,3.0,This starbucks is 2 blocks down from the new york penn station! A convenient place to get your coffee. 2 stars off because there was a super long line when i got there and one cashier who was trying to make a customer understand why they couldn't get a specific drink. Waiting was fine if it wasn't so crazy hot and humid outside. I felt like another cashier should have stepped up seeing more than 5 people in the line. My drink was made perfectly so no complains there.
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-06-04,2.0,"Employees seemed to be overworked, thus making the experience very disappointing... love venti, but will not get it from this place ver again.."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-11-19,5.0,this place has such a great vibe and amazing music! the staff is so kind and greet you warmly! the only bad thing is that there was no chairs :(
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-11-18,2.0,"The Starbucks here is friendly with staff but not the fastest service around. To begin with, the line to the cashier itself was pretty long as there was only 1 cashier at that time. Now the waiting time on the other hand was a very long wait. It was  difficult to see if your drink was being made or not as it ended up having the baristas making drinks for some people who you know were in the line after you or that you know weren't mobile. Another thing that was difficult was to see what section of the pick up area was mobile. I was seeing alot of confused faces as some people ordering with mobile we're waiting long after the app said to pickup. The place seemed to be understaffed as there were only 1-2 baristas working at that time and the rest seemed to be at the back/or nowhere to be found. Otherwise the staff were nice and the one making the drinks apologized after realising that mine took over 30 minutes to make. Sadly the drink itself wasn't correct but I didn't wanted to waste more time for the correction.  If you're looking for a drink and willing to possibly wait for awhile, depending on what time you're going for, then this is what to expect here at this place."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-07-09,4.0,Always enjoy my Starbucks. The triple mocha is fantastic. My only complaint are the lines. To order and receive. The whole process easily takes 15 minutes. I hope they find a way to simplify things so I can be in and out.
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2019-01-28,5.0,Thank you to the barista that gave me a Venta cup of my order because she didn't want to waste the remaining tea. You made my day!
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-01-05,3.0,"Pretty small Starbucks meant for grab-and-go. They were totally out of food today, which was a bummer because I was in the mood for a protein box. But I got the egg and red pepper bites and enjoyed them as a snack. Quincy was super sweet and comp'ed my drink when he found out it was my birthday! So thoughtful of him."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-11-21,3.0,"It's always crowded when I work the Parade in the city. They are normally slower than other Starbucks I have visited, so I try not to be in a rush when I go there. Michael was friendly. Seating is extremely limited"
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-09-20,4.0,This place is tiny and packed making it difficult to get around but the staff is fantastic. We were in NY for 7 days and this location was across from our hotel so we came every day. The staff is always moving with a sense of purpose and urgency to support the large number of customers coming in.  I really appreciated that they called every drink out by name and attempted to make eye contact with every customer as they passed out their food/ drinks.
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-04-16,1.0,"This is one of the worst Starbucks I have ever been, really dirty and no supervision. The employees are confused and don't know what they are doing , so disappointing"
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-06-14,1.0,I guess they do not take orders. I asked for sweeted green shaken iced tea and received unsweeted green iced tea.
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-10-02,1.0,"This place needs to get it together with their online ordering. I've waited 15-20 min on a drink before due to lost cups and no apologies. Very annoying. I always have a bad start to my morning when I go to this Starbucks, or to be honest any starbucks in the morning. Other coffee shops near by are so much better it's stupid. Culture and raminis is right around the corner and it doesn't take 20 min for a drink."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2016-09-15,2.0,"This Starbucks sucks, but it's on my way to work so I keep coming like all the rest of the NYC caffeine zombies. 

Seriously though. There's always a line 8-10 people deep. During morning rush hour I've seen employees standing around joking and laughing like everyone on line doesn't have to get to work. Also, I understand it's loud in the store but I feel like I have to scream my order twice, very slowly each time for them to understand me. 

Lame af, but I need my morning coffee so I'll continue to suck it up."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-09-21,2.0,"They don't stock decaf coffee here apparently. I have have hypertension so I have to stick with the low caff stuff per doctors orders- I don't like it either but I've never had a Starbucks bat an eye at me when I order my venti decaf coffee each morning. This location told me they don't stock it because no one would drink it. Ouch, am I no one? I get it though, it's not common. Opted for a decaf americano and it somehow also never got made and I had to ask the barista about it after everyone else behind me in line was gone. He was friendly and made it quickly but I'm still not sure how a request for decaf coffee threw off the whole staff so much. Store was cleaner than most nyc Starbucks, especially considering location adjacent to penn station. Line was long and moved very slowly until the manager hopped on a cash register to help take orders."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2016-01-28,1.0,"COME HERE IF YOU'RE HAVING A GREAT DAY, AND WANT IT TO BE RUINED!

If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  

Disclaimer: every other Starbucks I've been to has provided exceptional service!
I love the Starbucks company!

Now this location is usually bad, but today they really did it.  I ended up not even getting a drink, cause they left such a bad taste in my mouth.

I have a coupon that allows me to receive one free hand made beverage if I made 5 holiday beverage purchases, prior.  And I was on the verge of getting it, but apparently their Starbucks employees don't understand how to enter the coupon codes and have to speak to a supervisor or manager about it. Which is fine, but even the manager doesn't know jack! I don't like to argue these things so I told her nicely that it wasn't expired, she said okay, and then she says I can only receive a holiday drink, and it clearly doesn't, because I know how to read! [check photo i posted]

Now I know this sounds shallow, and impulsive, and don't get me wrong, I understand that people make mistakes, but the manager who was right in front of me telling her employee that it wasn't valid, had her back to me the entire time, she didn't even try to explain that it wasn't valid. I bought 5 holiday drinks for this for god's sake, give me some attention sheesh! And I've worked in the food business for years, I would never treat a customer that way..

Service: -5 STARS!"
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-08-30,2.0,"This Starbucks is very small and always crowded. It's located in a poplar area. The service is not bad, but you may wait a few minutes for your order, due to the number of ppl in line and waiting."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-09-05,3.0,So sad they don't know how to make the Ultra Caramel Frap. No whipcream!???? :((((  I wanted to try but I'll stick with McDonalds' caramel frappes
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2016-12-06,2.0,"Smallest Starbucks I've ever encountered. The line can't get too long or it goes out the door because of how cramped this place is. The workers never seem to get a break although I'm sure they could use one.  Service is average, which makes sense considering how loud the intersection is nearby and how demanding the customers are. There's very little space to sit and it's not relaxing at all- I almost feel like I'm in a McDonalds trying to grab and go. I stopped going to coffee shops altogether for a little while after coming here a few times. Go to Corvo down the street instead- for $4 I can get a sandwich and a coffee (vs. here where I might afford a drink and get an upset stomach afterwards)."
755,starbucks-new-york-144,2015-07-12,1.0,"I've been here at least 15 times because it's close to my office and to make a long story short, you're better off going to the Starbucks  by one penn plaza or on 35th and 7th. 

This location has the slowest moving lines, and I've seen baristas here give attitude back to their customers on three separate occasions. This morning I ordered an ice coffee with brevi and was handed what is essentially a venti cup of milk with ice.

755,starbucks-new-york-144,2018-04-14,1.0,By far the slowest Starbucks that I have ever been in. I placed my mobile order 10 minutes ago for a Very Berry Refresher and I am still here waiting for it. It i'snt even that busy in here today either.  If you have a choice skip this location. There are quite a few in this area and they move waaayyy faster. *as I continue to wait for my refresher. Ugh!

I require a service dog to help me out with daily tasks as well as medical alert and was so pleased the staff was very kind and respectful about my 120 pound furry pal's presence and willing to ensure he was hydrated etc as I worked! As well as gently inform concerned customers of the Americans with disabilities act and our right to be there.

Also, the coffee was exponentially less burnt than at most Starbucks locations so an amen to that."

First for a white mocha frap they made a latte, then Ayie made a vanilla bean frap instead. Made the order at 4:49 and fixed everything by 5:19. Are these baristas even being trained how to make these drinks at such a busy location???"

It is a busy location, but the baristas are miserable and it took me multiple tries to get someone to acknowledge me so I could be given the bathroom pass code as if it was a combination to open a trunk full of gold. (It's 32117, by the way)

The worst part was one of the baristas yelling at a customer who had mistakenly taken the wrong drink. It was clear he was not a native English speaker and was having trouble understanding the barista, who kept getting louder and demanding the drink back. This is a huge tourist destination, there are tons of people who have accents or speak different languages. Please don't scream at people. Also, just make a new one, I'm sure Starbucks can afford it.

Plus side: there was lots of seating and a place to charge my phone."

Everything in NYC is busy and crowded and it is what it is. The staff were very courteous and I received my order as requested in an acceptable timeframe. It lost two stars due to the nastiness of the restrooms. This just wasn't just a bad day. I used the rest room several times and the same HOT piss smell was bad enough to make your eyes water.

Do you know how many people come in here everyday?

Too many. 

I was beyond impressed w the staff here.  Throngs of people inside & the staff were always calm, cool, & collected.  Some were animated even.  And all were professional.

When I came in to purchase half a dozen NY mugs to ship back home, the cashier didn't even bat an eye.  He, along w a manager that joined in to help, carefully boxed the mugs that weren't already encased in a box (the non you-are-here series), & they did so w a smile.  On another visit, when I came in & was having trouble w the Starbucks app at the register, again the cashier did not bat an eye.  I apologized, & she told me ""no worries, you're totally fine.""  

And when I came in to purchase one more mug to ship, it was St. Patrick's Day morning, & there had to be close to a hundred people in here.  Lots of pre-teens wearing green & being really loud (I wondered why they weren't in school).  Families.  Parade goers.  Irish revelers.  And it was the first beautiful & warmest day after the nor'easter, so that understandably added to the joy & the chaos.  The wait for my latte was nuts, obviously.  But the staff were golden.  How they were not pulling their hair out, I don't know.  But they weren't.

Beyond impressed.

5 stars."

None the less, my experiences have been pretty smooth and fast since the last few times.

Pros
- If you're a tourist visiting the city for the first time, surely your chances are pretty high of making a pit-stop here given it's prime location
- The staff is really friendly and kudos to them for keeping their cool while serving coffee to the millions of folks who get in and get out everyday

Cons
- The one thing they could surely work on is making this place a bit cleaner than what it is but then again you could say that about a lot of coffee-shops in mid-town Manhattan :)"

One of the barista quickly recommended an alternative substitution and I love it. Even though what I drank wasn't the intended product, I enjoy the end product. 
I went to at least 5 Starbucks before arriving to this location and they all gave me the answer of ""we ran out"". It was a simple way-out for them since it is a nuisance to make. Which is why this rainbow unicorn frap taste so good when I finally got it. At least this place had staff, who would try to offer an attempt at it rather than give up.

I understand it is a busy store with a gazillion tourists, but waiting 20 minutes for a cold brew which is premade coffee that you add ice and water to is INSANE. I wouldn't be as mad if I didn't know for sure that someone who ordered a iced latte after me got her drink first. So someone who got fresh espresso in their drink got their drink before me? The baristas have no sense of urgency. Especially one guy who moved at a snail pace. Just putting the stickers on the cups took him way too long."

You would think that the girls making the drinks would be hustling BECAUSE it was so busy!!!!   I'm beyond pissed - not necessarily that I had to wait, but because of the complete lack of hustle of the employees.  Absolutely maddening and rude."

I go there at least 4 times a week, and the crew greets me with a smile every time, rain or shine. The quality of their drinks simply cannot be any more consistent, and cannot be surpassed. Out of all the baristas, I have to say that Raven always stands out as the one who consistently performs with a smile under continuous pressure from both the business crowd and the tourists, and still deliver the same consistent quality in the drinks as far as flavor, textures, and temperatures are concerned, not to mention he rolls out his drink at twice the speed of his peers! Watching Raven working his magic in the morning is almost like watching the Frank Sinatra performing during his heydays, as they are both top performers and perfectionists. Kudos! Keep up the great work there!"

This Starbucks lacks customer service big time. So my sisters and I came into this 34 street location, which is also right around the corner from Starbucks. Upon arriving no one was at the cashier, then finally we spotted a young lady on the side conversing with a customer (Seemed more like a friend) 

We waited for almost 10 minutes and still the employee was busy talking to the same customer who then confirmed to be her friend. As they started to converse about family and friends. As well as exchanging goods. The employee starting taking about giving the suppose customer a drink if she brings her favorite sandwich. 

All while she speaking she wasn't doing anything. Nothing but taking, I became impatient and ask her if I can order now. She rolls her eyes at me starts cleaning and acting as if she's busy. I start recording in disbelief, and she tells the other girl ""Im not taking her order so she's going to be tight"" I then ask her for her name she said it's Genesis. But who's to say if she was telling the truth. She didn't even have a name tag on. 

She seemed nervous once I asked her name, and then try's to ask me what I will like to order. It's already been 20 minutes. Girl bye !"
756,starbucks-new-york-535,2016-01-13,4.0,"Get in. Get out. Get on with it.

As my office locations have moved throughout Manhattan, i've had the pleasure of frequenting a variety of Starbucks locations, playing the perpetual 8:49am ""how long will the line be today?"" game.

Yes - coffee, breakfast, pastries...all the normal stuff that exists at just about every Starbucks exists at this one too. The true differentiator for my morning coffee is...how long is this going to take?

Answer? Not long at all! With at least 4 registers open at a time and 5+ people in charge of drinks, iced coffee, hot coffee, even a grande 5 shot nonfat latte (when i'm using my free one) take no time at all.

The whole upper level is essentially the closest thing you'll find to a drive-thru Starbucks. ALL orders (except hot coffee, poured on the spot as always) are printed out and stuck to cups, so the chances of getting your drink right (we'll worry about getting your name right another time) go up exponentially. 

There are 3 linked milk/cream stations so there is rarely a wait, and 95% of the seating is downstairs so there is plenty of room for 20+ people to exist at the same time waiting for their drink.

This is the most efficient Starbucks i've ever been to. My order has always been right and i've never spent more than a minute or two between the time I ordered and the time I walked out the door.

For maximum efficiency on your way to work...this is the only choice.

I like that they have a downstairs area if you want to relax while drinking your coffee. I also like that the quality of the drinks are up to par. I don't like the fact that the tables are messy and no attendant checked whether any cleaning or clutter need to be done downstairs. That's why I gave 3 stars.

Just FYI, It's loud here. The music is loud. Patrons speaking over the music are loud. It's more of a order-pickup-go kind of spot."

Luckily a nice lady took over and made my drink properly but I have never witnessed that or felt so angry and uncomfortable in a Starbucks. I honestly don't know how he works there.

During this time when I ordered other people got there drink before me ,that ordered after me. This location also has a problem with having staying focused while working. Having lots of side conversations and having a really nasty attitude when shouting out orders. Due to this I have completely stopped going here, instead I opt to order at the Ave of Americans location. If I could give the empire building location less than one star I really would."

While staying in NYC on a recent trip this was one of the two closest Starbucks near our hotel. Since we were usually out seeing the city very early we were here for the morning rush most days. This Starbucks was quick at getting my drink made quickie (which a simple so if they mess that up it's a bit worrisome). This place was efficient, clean and had restrooms for the public which noticing the amount of Starbucks in NYC without restrooms is troubling. This Starbucks is in a great location, big enough if you need to get some work done, but not large enough that it's intimidating like some NYC Starbucks locations. Worth going to if you're nearby and looking for that daily dose of caffeine."

Then there was no caramel in the drink, unfortunately I realized once I left. He also put oreo like pieces in the drink itself when it's supposed to be caramel bits sprinkled on top.

Well, i went back and she still wouldn't honor it. Starbucks ended up refunding me. I just don't understand why she couldn't honor the happy hour special, she's in the wrong profession."

That being said it was about negative 47 degrees (ok maybe closer to 30 degrees but for somebody that lives in Alabama it feels like 47 below) and I still had a ways to go to get to my destination so I came in with high hopes they would be able to accommodate a non-coffee warm beverage. 

Location could use a little cleaning, but outside of that has the typical look and feel of any Starbucks you have ever seen.

The Barista was friendly and did a great job working solo most of the time I was there processing everyone's orders (taking money and making drinks). I was thrilled to find out that they had vanilla steamers. Think of it as a steamy milk shake (kind of...not really...but nothing else to really compare it to). 

Venti sized I was ready to hit the road again and finish my hike. Definitely hit the spot on this cold evening. Would return if I was in the area and needed something to warm up with."

I wish the bathroom were a bit cleaner but I understand it can get busy. It wasn't the worst restroom I've ever seen. The large communal table make it easy to spread out and work or have a conversation without sitting on top of one another.

This location is on 23rd street and it gets A LOT of traffic. It's often full with teens after school and that's when it gets loud in here. Early in the day (around 12/1pm) it's not so packed and you can get a seat but after that good luck. The wifi works well and they always the staff is generous with the restroom code. I wish the seating was different but I can't complain about the coffee. The cappuccinos are consistent and if I ever want to try a new drink the baristas are always helpful in helping me decide on what to get and how to modify it.

757,starbucks-new-york-303,2018-04-19,4.0,"So this is actually my first Starbucks experience here in the city. I   was mainly looking for a more residential and home feel aka away from all the touristy areas. I  was not disappointed with this location. A few of the reviews said there is no where for you to charge your phone, but I   am currently charging both my phone AND Mac.... sooo.... yes there are some areas to charge them, you just gotta look. I   ordered a simple London Fog Tea Latte w/ soy milk and SFV (sugar-free vanilla), and being someone who worked for Starbucks for about 3 years prior.... I   was amazed at how good it tasted.. There are plenty of tables to choose from. No not all of the tables have chargers next to them.. but, still. its a good choice. I   also find it amusing having the Dunkin Donuts next to it."

Trash is overflowing the cans and on the floor, the tables have trash on them and are constantly dirty. The employees appear complacent and always mess up orders. I have to remind them multiple times what I order and they still put it in the register wrong. The bathroom is locked but disgusting with standing water on the floor usually just covered up with paper towels or napkins that are soaked through and a toilet covered in human waste. The door looks like it hasn't been cleaned ever and have something smeared on it with writing that never gets cleaned off. You're lucky if there is soap or toilet paper in there."

No low fat cream cheese, no almond milk, music is way too loud to get anything productive done. Not the cleanest either. Yikes. Disappointment after disappointment. Just a nice reminder to stick with the big boy ((real)) coffee shops. Call me critical but if I'm gonna spend hours and money somewhere it should be a certain kind of experience."

Chelsea vicinity of Manhattan draws thirst for caffeine addiction, thereby this Starbucks surprisingly has a large seating/coffee lounge area.

(The coffee was super quick, and tasted like it always does).

I had the chance to strike up a conversation with a delightful older man in line behind me. He was blind and used a stick to find his way. We talked about  handful of different things and he was real nice. It was one of those serendipitous interactions that only happen in busy and diverse places like New York.

I'm happy to say that when the man I'd spoken with didn't find his way to the open check stand, the barista moved over to where he was to help him. He also promised to bring out the coffee when it was finished.

I've encountered so many people working in service industries who would ignore, laugh at, or look down upon people with different needs or personalities. I'm glad the gentleman working chose kindness."

And, what makes it better then just about any other location in NYC is the good seating capacity. But lately they've stopped monitoring or caring who sits there and it has become a hangout in the early morning for homeless and non customers who buy their food from street vendors and sit in their store to eat and steal their wifi.  I'm not anti homeless but my morning coffee is my calm before the storm on an early work day morning and I've lost that at this location."

No complaints, and I'd come back here to study/write if I were in the area."
757,starbucks-new-york-303,2015-08-31,1.0,The staff are rude and unfriendly. You think that I was asking them to do me a favor for a $4.08 drink. It was a raspberry lemonade made with 1/2 water.  Never coming here again. There are plenty of people who can and want their job. Lazy fools.
757,starbucks-new-york-303,2016-08-02,1.0,"For some reason all of the female baristas are Super Rude. I have my suspicions as to why, but to be fair and objective l'll just say nothing."

757,starbucks-new-york-303,2014-10-01,2.0,"Great space, terrible service today. I had to repeat my order four times between two baristas and still walked out with the wrong order.

758,starbucks-new-york-204,2019-12-29,5.0,Great location. Easy in and out. What can I say about a Starbucks that hasn't already been said. They make a great latte!
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2020-03-12,1.0,"A working morning. After four visits I am a little mixed on this location. They have a wonderful large seating area upstairs and the music is great.

Trouble is, the music is WAY LOUD and one of the baristas clearly feels compelled to sign at top volume, get all the attention at all times, and is just waiting for someone to ""discover"" her as a singer. She's not a bad singer, but she is not into her job at all. ""Shaken Green Tea"" is just poorer into a cup with some ice (not the extra I asked for) dropped on top. The Pink Drink I ordered once was not shaken either. Drink quality is based on ingredients but also HOW they are prepared. With the lack of attention to presentation and preparation one wonders about the overall quality and safely of the products as a whole at this location.

Closing time on the Starbucks app does not reflect why this store does. Each time I was there near closing (within 30-60 minutes), employees locked the doors and told people they were closed. Once this happened 45 minutes before the closing time listed in the Starbucks app. This was after that ""signing"" barista was causing a scene holding the doors closed and ""playing"" with someone she knew on the outside telling him he couldn't go in. At that point, no one unlocked the door and just told the steady stream of potential customers that they were closed.

The bathroom is a nightmare. When it WAS open the one time, it backed up and refused to flush. The news to the four people waiting was not well received.

This is my first 1 star review and I am shocked it is for a Starabucks."

All over the USA, Philippines, Singapore, London & New York! 4 people said good morning to me before I ordered, and then 4 behind the counter acknowledged me & smiled.

I came here the other day and used mobile order. If you don't use mobile order at Starbucks yet, you need to! It is a LIFESAVER! My drink was ready as soon as I got to the Starbucks... probably only 3 minutes since I ordered it. I tried an iced flat white for the first time. I loved it! The espresso was velvety smooth and I loved the taste of it... even better than my normal iced latte that I get here. 

There was an employee standing at the mobile order station to hand out drinks. I haven't seen this at this location before, but really appreciated it. It made the process of getting your drink very smooth and ensured that you got the right drink. This is a good spot and if you are looking for extra quick coffee, make sure to download to app and start mobile ordering!"

Oh mine, I was shocked to see how huge the second floor is. It's a hidden gem if you need to do some work or just chill without all the craziness. You literally would feel like you were in an attic. There is a long table in the middle where there are some charging station.

Don't be fooled by what's on the outside. It's the inside (upstairs) than matters. Lol"

The worst."

Absolutely rude."
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2018-04-04,3.0,"Just like all the rest.

They got my drink right the few times Ive been at this Starbucks which does it for me. I would say like others have mentioned is that they don't move too fast here but that's probably because they're in an extremely busy area. The store itself was somewhat clean.

I'd return!"
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2018-08-04,1.0,"walked in at 9:45am on a Saturday morning to loud rap music. In spite of the fact that 3 people were working (being PAID) no one greeted us, tall guy at the register mumbled when I said Good Morning. He never smiled, said my total or said thanks.

There are plenty of Starbucks around so my  recommendation is to find another one. 

Also to the people working there - if you don't like your job find another one!"
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2019-10-01,2.0,Mobile order... maybe they don't expect a human to come and retrieve it? With eyes? Wtf it looks like they dropped it on the ground and picked it up and threw it in the bag. This is for a friend and I feel embarrassed to give it to her.
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2017-05-24,2.0,"The only reason I'm not giving this location 1 star is because I've had a decent experience there in the past. But man, after this time, I don't want to spend my money here.

The line was super long, totally expected at 8:45am, and it moved somewhat quickly so that was good. But then there were masses of people waiting for drinks for a while... I probably waited 10 minutes for my peach green tea lemonade.

When I'm just about to ask them if my order was skipped or lost, I see someone start making it. Then, I hear her ask the other employee next to her if she's seen the tea shaker - the answer was no. They lost the tea shaker and no one even 1) had a minute to stop and find it, 2) go get another or 3) ask someone else to find it or get another... fine, no big deal, it's just a shaker. So, then I notice, as the person is sloshing the tea and lemonade all over the counter and not in my cup, that there's barely any drink in it. But that's what she moves forward with and proceeds to add two more scoops of ice on top of the one she already added. Even better, my drink STILL didn't fill the cup with all of that ice.

Totally not paying $5 to have five sips worth of drink. Super frustrating."
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2019-05-16,3.0,"This location is one of a few in the area - there's another in Port Authority (42nd between 8th and 9th) and another on 43rd and 9th Ave. That being said, this one is the most chaotic. It's understandable why the corner location is attractive for Starbucks but it's a bit of a hassle to go here for a number of reasons. 

1) Firstly, the staff here is good. Not great, not bad, but they do their best. This is a location with an incredibly high volume and pretty fussy clientele (I'll get into that later) so sometimes orders get backed up and they definitely aim for turnaround over courtesy, but again totally understandable. I commend them for their patience and keeping it together. 

2) The location has a pretty bad flow to be honest. There's a huge amount of foot traffic in the area, so it's understandable why Starbucks acquired it in the first place, but the inside is cramped with the ordering area towards the back and the pick-up area towards the front. Due to the large volume of people and orders, there's usually a huge crowd at the pick-up and it can get really uncomfortable/crowded. You pretty much have to work your way through the pick-up crowd to get to the ordering area, which is right up against the bathroom where there's another line, sometimes difficult to tell them apart. There is a seating area upstairs, but the noise/tension in there makes it a difficult place to actually want to sit down. 

3) The clientele is the worst in this location. The area has a large amount of hotels and tourist spots, so you have a lot of folk who either don't know what they want, have complicated orders, and in some cases have zero idea how to pay for what they want and end up cycling through different payment methods. This just contributes to the giant crowd at the pick-up section and it often clashes with commuters/office workers from the area who just want to get their drink and go. If you're in a rush, absolutely do not come to this Starbucks. Either you're stuck behind a German family taking an eternity to buy cake pops and then spit out into a pick up area where you have to fight to be able to hear your name called. 

3) There's a good deal of homeless in the area who often walk in and ask for spare change, prompting security to step in. This more often than not leads to a huge scene in the store. Twice I've been in there and someone has gotten their bag stolen. 

If this was the only Starbucks in the area, I'd get it. But there's two others with a considerably better service/customer experience. It's about a five minute (if even) walk to the Starbucks located in Port Authority, which is much, much larger, has way more seating and room, is considerably cleaner and a clear flow from order to pick up with little or no crowding. The staff there is super friendly, and the vast majority of customers are no nonsense commuters trying to get their coffee and go, not dither around. 

From a marketing and visibility perspective, this shop makes sense. The experience there, though, really isn't the best and they should consider re-arranging/taking more steps to ensure that the flow is able to accommodate the amount of traffic and volume in this location."
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2019-07-01,5.0,Super friendly staff. Line moves fast. All complicated drinks made to order. Didn't notice the upstairs seating until we left
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2019-11-30,1.0,"I placed a simple order (tall medium roast with a few ice cubes) but it seemed that they forgot my order and left me waiting. I had to tell them after 5 minutes that I hadn't received my order and they finally got it to me, but without ice in it. For them to mess up such a simple order is not excusable. The coffee wasn't even up to the normal standard (the bottom was full of grounds). Would not recommend coming here especially if in a rush."
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2019-06-29,1.0,"If you feel like ordering a coffee and then waiting a half hour for them to make it, then this is the place for you.

I've been here three times in the past month and every one of them the same. After ordering you wait with dozens of people whose orders just get made in whatever order the one barista feels like making them in.  If you ask about your order they just shrug ""I dunno"". 

Their priorities are also backwards. They've got one person on the cashier, one barista, and then three people stocking cups and sweeping floors at a snails pace.  The place could be bustling and those cups get stacked one at a time while a single rude barista makes your drink.

I went in today, Saturday 6/29 at 10am and ordered a coffee and a mango dragon drink. At 10:30am and still waiting, I asked the one barista if mine was coming up soon and was told they don't know.  They don't know?! Apparently he's too busy dancing while he's making drinks to help with customers. When he finally got around to making mine, I was sternly asked if I wanted anything instead of a Dragon drink because they were out.  Then why was my order accepted? He just went on to make the next ten drinks without addressing mine.

I will never go here again.  There are plenty of other coffee shops around there."
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2019-07-26,1.0,"I was just here. I waited for 15+ minutes for a tall iced coffee which never came. I asked the barista, Sean who confirmed they were backed up. I followed up with that I was going to be late for work. About 5 minutes prior I saw a group of 4 people who also had to leave due to running late for another engagement. Part of the problem here is they were entirely focused on to go orders which were piling up while people in the store were waiting. Someone also came in after me with a mocha that was a pick up who had ordered prior as was not in the store before me. I always allow lots of cushion work to get to work on time and have a coffee on the way. This was a new stop and won't come here again. They were so late I had to walk away from my order to get to work on time. This store needs to focus on balancing customers that come in and have been waiting with the mobile orders that are overly prepared in advance. Some of which had been sitting for as long as I was waiting."
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2018-03-28,2.0,"I ordered a mocha frappuchino tall on Monday 2p here and it was delicious. I can ignore the 4 mins it took, that's long in NYC terms but fine in normal human terms, but that a tissue was shredded such that I kept spitting up paper bits until I had to abandon the drink at 2/3rds in was disappointing, but I'd already walked far away by this point such that my resource will be to stick to my usual fave, 494 8th Ave (at W 35th St). While this location has a mezzanine and a clean spacious glass main area, the tissue wasn't good fiber. Add that 1 straw wrapper was pre-broken leading me to wonder about QA here altogether."
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2019-09-27,1.0,"Unacceptable, Wait for almost 30 mins to get my drink. The barista didn't even read the tag, they redid it three times to get it right, it just a frappe!!!how difficult it that ? stop chatting with  each other  while you're marking a drink !!"

Overall, there exist some pros and some cons. I believe I should find a different Starbucks to frequent."
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2019-02-02,2.0,"Gave this location two chances and I'm done. The employees are nice enough but the service is awful. The first time, the barista scratched his face/mouth while making my drink. Did this right over my drink and then didn't wash his hands.  The next day, I gave the place a try again just in case it was an off day. They forgot one of the coffees in my order. I waited for a while and then had to ask for it and the cashier looked at me strangely. This location is definitely up to Starbucks' customer service standards."

758,starbucks-new-york-204,2016-05-27,3.0,"Not the Starbucks you want to put out there as a glowing example of the brand...

What's up with the part of Manhattan by the Garden?  Its kind of seedy and the sidewalks are laced with garbage in the morning like the way people probably imagine the whole city was (it's not) had they never been before.  

So this Starbucks fit in to the neighborhood. Staff was friendly and fast enough; I got a seat (as others have noted, next to some interesting people). There were no napkins and the ""condiment"" (not the right word but you know what I mean) station was sort of a mess.

I didn't venture upstairs and wasn't brave enough to try the bathrooms. 

I cannot in good faith give an establishment that provides me with an adequate supply of morning caffeine a rating of less than a-ok.  But more napkins next time, plz."
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2017-06-11,1.0,"If you need to go to starbucks for anything that takes a couple minutes to make, I would suggest walking down an extra few minutes to the next starbucks because it will take you 10x as long at this location. I ordered a cold brew which essentially takes a couple minutes to just pour in a cup. The line was not long with no more than 10 people in front of me. But yet it took me forever to get my drink because all they were doing was making fraps at a very slow rate. A trip to this starbucks which should take no more than 15 minutes ended up being 45 minutes."

Although I understand the bad weather causes longer lines, this service was unacceptable!! There were 4 ladies working the front. I had a very simple order- a caramel latte and a coffee cake. I spend a lot of money and a lot Of time at Starbucks in general. But this is the last time I go to this location! The service was so terrible! The women were so unfriendly and so very very slow. I stood almost 15 minutes waiting for my simple order. One of the staff was named Jasmine. I didn't get the other names . The other customers waiting next to me were also complaining and were very unhappy. You should address and correct the employees that were working the morning shift because I don't deserve to be treated this way. It's not right."

She gave us attitude from start to finish ,rolled her eyes cut us off while we were telling her our order. However we took it up with the assistant manager and she was beyond helpful she came out made sure nothing was forgotten and our food was delicious. The only reason I am giving five stars is for how the assistant manager handled it. Good luck Celeste with the horrible customer service."

Yummy soy chai latte. Nothing to complain about. Starbucks is pretty good at standardizing the quality of their drinks. In fact this was a little less sweet than some other chai lattes, which I prefer. 

The store is pretty small and narrow. It is pretty much the only Starbucks in the area though."

But after 20 minutes, I finally can not wait any more.then they finally start to make my order, without apologizing. Worst service of Starbucks!!!"
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2017-06-08,1.0,"I find it incredibly rude that the female manager lacks the customer service skills to answer a simple question when asked.  Seems she stands behind the counter and does not engage with customers. 

My daughter had been studying at Starbucks. As we stood in line to order a drink, I asked for the manager for the code to the restroom. Thinking she didn't hear me, I tapped her on the arm and asked again. She still did it turn around or acknowledge me. What the...?
Instead, another employee walked over and entered the code on the panel to open the restroom door.

When I returned to the line, I noticed that the manager was still standing in the same place. She had loads of Starbucks pins attached to her baseball cap, so she must be a long time employee. Apparently customer service isn't valued here!"

He was knowledgeable, joyful, and told me more about Bantam bagels and their shop here in NYC. I frequent coffee shops often before work and this was the BEST barista experience I've ever had ANYWHERE. In the hustle and bustle of midtown Manhattan, Scott made my experience seem personal and gave me time to take a breath. 

All Starbucks and Baristas should take note and please congratulate Scott!"
758,starbucks-new-york-204,2015-03-14,4.0,"One of my favorite Starbucks locations in NYC. Usually I'll run in here on my way to work or in the afternoon. It's always busy between 8:30am and 9am during the week but the staff is always friendly and keeps the line moving. Normally I go to a different Starbucks location, but most people I see here when I'm in line are regulars. The baristas know most by name and know their usual orders by heart. This Starbucks location even followed me on instagram!

This Starbucks is located right across from the Port Authority. The ACE subway stop is on the same block too. The bathroom is clean and there is an upstairs level where patrons can sit and relax. There's a nice window view from the upstairs area. Free wifi works well too."

His name is Peter and he is wonderful. Great energy. You can tell he enjoys his life and people. 

Atmosphere is very relaxing. They offer free mediation classes. It's a good step away from the hustle and bustle on the streets. 

I'll definitely be coming back again."

Most chai teas are either too sweet or heavy on the spices, but this one was perfectly in the middle and is served in a good size cup. I'm giving minus one star for the price point, but it seems to be on par with  other NY coffee shops.

The interior is quaint, which can be refreshing from the abundance of modern and hipster coffee shops. I went in around 8.30am on a weekday and there were a few people sitting at the tables, but not too busy if you're looking for a place to work/study. The barista was also very nice!

Definitely recommend stopping by for the chai if you're a tea drinker!"
759,tianti-books-new-york,2019-07-05,5.0,"Stumbled into Tianti by accident. Super cute and relaxing interior. Such a drastic difference from the rest of the world outside, what with the hustle and bustle of KTown and Herald Sq. It was raining the day I stopped by, so the hot chai latte I grabbed was a welcome reprieve. The service was excellent. I'm in the service industry myself, having done customer service for years, and man, the barista was putting all of his boundless energy into our interaction. He had a kind of Alice in Wonderland, I'm a Barista Mad Hatter vibe going to him lol, not a bad thing, just interesting! 

He was, like the store itself, a big change in pace from the busy city outside. Mad Hatter, I'm here to take you on a Willy Wonka boat ride aside though ( and I mean that in a really nice way, like if someone had to lead me through a secret fairy garden I nominate ONLY this guy. Bless him.), his service was impeccable. He let me know that my chai latte wouldn't be as sweet as I was used to, due to how they make it there, and kindly added sweetener as well. 

My friend got a matcha latte (I think) which she loved. Seating was ample, esp on our rainy day. The meditation classes seemed kind of interesting, maybe something I'd pop in for, just for the hell of it. WiFi is also available, something like $2/hour? Overall, would come back! A good place to escape from the city."
759,tianti-books-new-york,2019-08-18,3.0,"Note: I would rate this place a 3.5 but Yelp doesn't give 0.5 stars. 

I wanted a nice place to study while at NYC. The interior is very cute and relaxing. Calming classical music is played as the background music. I had the seasonal feature: Lavender Limenade. The drink was mostly watery but had a bit of flavour of lavender. 

The staff was efficient in making my drink as well as noticing when people leave the tables so that they can wipe down the tables. There are group study rooms available but those are off-limits (unless you reserve). As well, there is a table where items would be sold. There are decent amount of tables you can sit with friends or study. However, there are no outlets located near any of the tables. Furthermore, there is a 45 minute per order imposed but since the place was not too busy, no one noticed anyone being over 45 minutes. Finally, WiFi is only free for the first 30 minutes and must be bought if anyone wants the WiFi for more than that time. 

Overall, the drink was okay and it's a decent place to study if you don't mind the time and WiFi restrictions."

Petit Fours: Cute little multi-layer cakes encased in a harder shell (like a cake pop).  Despite various colors, they all kinda taste the same.  Really sweet, probably because of the sugary shell, so pairs well with an unsweetened tea drink.

Matcha Latte: Felt like the perfect thing to order here, though I'm typically a coffee drinker.  The frothy milk helped cut the bitterness of the green tea powder.  Didn't need any sugar.  Very comforting."
759,tianti-books-new-york,2019-05-04,5.0,"This place is definitely worthy of five stars, and now it's on my must go to spot to work on my laptop, meet a friend or just chill out.

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, but they are also mindful that this is a place of quiet and relaxation for many, whether they're there for the cafe or to read and indulge their mind and body in Falun Dafa, also known as Falun Gong.

Falun Dafa is an ancient self-cultivation way based on the ""universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance. Falun Dafa practitioners take these principles as the guiding focus of their self-improvement. The practice includes a main book, Zhuan Falun, as well.

When you are in the middle of a Big City especially New York with all the people & the Hustle & Bustle & the noise, the construction & the traffic; sometimes you just want to Hit the Pause Button & get away. You would probably pass by this unassuming little coffee shop & not give it a passing thought. You would never believe what's behind these closed doors. Tianti is a Quiet Calm Peaceful Zen Vibe Coffee Shop that plays Classical Music & has Books In the middle of Bustling New York. If I blocked the window you would never believe you are in the middle of New York City. The contrast is like Night & Day.                                   They serve Various Coffee Drinks, Cappuccino,  their Signature Summer Drink Lavender Limenade, Sandwiches, Muffins, Danish, Cookies, Desserts & Waters etc. I had the Cappuccino & The Lavender Limenade & Both were Gooood! The drinks were a 41/4 Stars but it's the atmosphere of Peace, Solitude, Quiet thinking,  reading, listening to music or being on your phone or computer that elevates this to a 5 Star Status.  
If you need a Break & some Peace & need to hit The Pause Button In today's hectic lifestyle then Tianti is the place to go for some Eats, Drinks & Quiet.

759,tianti-books-new-york,2018-10-30,5.0,"I've been passing by this place for quite a while and I finally decided to try it.

It's a very nice and quiet cafe. I love that.

You will notice many Chinese books on the wall, all the way towards the back. Come to find out this is first a bookstore/meditation place and then a coffee shop. 

The coffee shop is owned by a non-profit organization. Their main focus is the book store and mediation sessions they have towards the back of the shop.

If you pass by in the mornings you will see a very nice guy by the name of Tony. He is whom I approached and asked him about the cafe. Take the time to talk to him, very down to earth chill guy.

Now about their coffee! It's great thus far. I've tried their tiramisu cafe latte and their pistachio cafe latte which both have been very nice. I've gone with those two options because for the time being they didn't have caramel which is my go to.

They have a great assortment of pastries. I have tried so far only the maple walnut danish. Very Yammy! Now I do want to try their homemade Tiramisu. Apparently it's prepared by their chef who is a young man from France . 

Their cups are really nice, no handles. I actually like them a lot."
759,tianti-books-new-york,2019-10-17,5.0,"Wow, I think I found my happy coffee spot. This place is a magical respite from the busy and loud rhythm of the city. It's blissfully quiet inside, with excellent orchestral music playing over the sound system at just the right volume, books of many languages line the walls. The patrons are library-quiet, and folks who walk in the door seem to know this. Even the phone rings at a quiet, polite volume.  The display case of sammiches, fresh patries, and other tastiness invites you in.

But even if none of that existed, the reason you come here is for the absolutely wonderful, magical baristo. I don't know his name, but he's part butler, part magician, but all pleasantly refined and an expert at making you feel welcome and warm and happy. At first you're not sure if his somewhat formal  speech is the work of an actor practicing for a role later, but it doesn't matter at all because wouldn't it be awesome if everyone on the planet was this welcoming, kind, warm, hospitable, and pleasant. And damn, he makes a mighty fine mocha latte.

This is my happy place."

It's a good spot to get some work done or to catch up with a friend. 

I only ordered a cappuccino and I enjoyed it very much. They also serve a bunch of pastries and teas as well. Prices are very reasonable. I didn't explore the books during my last visit but I'm sure I'll be back. Service was quick and the staff was friendly!"
759,tianti-books-new-york,2019-08-08,2.0,"Racism! 
This is a nice place, good location, cool barista, but a crazy racist manager.  
We sometimes studied English in this coffee shop.  In this place there are always empty seats and we didn't bother anyone.  But the manager (we are not sure, but she said so) didn't like it.  She refused to give the restroom password, and the last time refused to sell coffee, threatened and kicked my friends out !!  She said that they should return back to Russia.  Im shocked that this happened in New York, where every other an immigrant. By the way, she is an immigrant too (from China). I hope this won't happen to anyone else:( God bless America"

759,tianti-books-new-york,2019-02-12,4.0,"I came across Tianti while searching for a place to do work before watching a Broadway show in the evening. This is a cute little Asian-inspired Cafe that seems to have a Chinese/Buddhist aura to it. Although categorized as a bookstore, I'd consider this place as more of a Cafe than a bookstore. 
I ordered a small Iced Matcha Latte ($5), and an Almond Croissant ($4.25). But were nothing too special, but definitely good items. I liked how the Matcha Latte was not too sweet at all, as I prefer mine to still have a himt of the natural bitter Matcha flavor to it. 
The biggest con about this place is their paid WiFi. I came to this place to do work for ~6 hours, and I was disappointed to find that WiFi was not free. It's $2.95 for 1 hour of WiFi, which I didn't find worth at all. If you need to do work with WiFi, you might as well go to the Starbucks across the street.
Other than this one setback (for me), Tianti is a great bookstore that has a very calming/meditating vibe, and is a good place to sit and kill time when needed."
759,tianti-books-new-york,2019-03-21,2.0,"A total bummer. I saw great reviews and was excited. I ordered a Chai Latte and a Goat Cheese Quiche with Greens. Oh man, that was $20. Even for NYC that's steep. 

I was still hopeful but then the food arrived. The Quiche was frozen in the center and it was the size of a large mug; the greens were less than a handful with a drizzle of olive oil. 
The Chai was OK at best. I should've gone to a restaurant instead!

Fine, I said to myself. Bad luck. At least I can study here. But at 6:30 they turned off the light and stacked chairs in the back half of the Cafe. So I moved tables. (The Cafe closes at 8:30 according to the sign outside)

In short, if you need a place to sit and have an expresso. Yeah you can come here it's spacious and expensive enough so you'll probably find a seat. If you're looking for a snack stay awaaaaay. Away."

Stop by here for a respite from the chaos. Tianti is a peaceful cafe with peaceful pastries and peaceful tea served in a peaceful setting. Yes, you might see some books on Falun Gong, but that's just to get you into the meditative mindset that permeates this quiet cafe. You definitely won't break the bank as you browse the reading ware while sipping your tea and croissant."
759,tianti-books-new-york,2017-09-14,5.0,"Really nice, spacious, quiet, clean spot. 

Impressive on walking in. It's very calming, or at least it is at 2:30 on a Thursday. Plenty of seating. They have a subdued water feature, and it all feels very open. 

The cold brew was excellent, stood up to the cream I put in, and still had a ton of flavor. Price was typical for the area, $5. They had a bunch of cute looking pasties that I didn't try, but would when I come back. 

Wifi is free for an hour, which is fine, long enough for my lunch break but probably not great if you're trying to stay and work. The barista was friendly and efficient. 

Overall, really great spot and I'm glad I stopped in. I'll be going back!"
759,tianti-books-new-york,2019-12-19,2.0,"I used to *love* this place.   I was thrilled when I found it, shortly after starting a new job in the neighborhood.  It quickly became my go-to meeting space.  I found other coffee shops in the area to be less conducive to meetings, due to the loud volume and relative difficulty in scoring a seat.   Tianti had it all -- opera playing in the background (too loud for me personally, but still better than blasting pop music at other spots), good coffee, friendly service (I really appreciate Peter's uniqueness).   There are times I'm here 2-3 times a week and I always buy coffee or tea, sometimes a snack.  

Everything changed last week for me.   First, the prices went up.   Over $4 for hot coffee and over $5 for iced.  That's a lot.  Too much, in my opinion.  But I could've gotten past that for all the pluses noted above.   

During this visit, I bought a coffee, and my guest wanted only water.  I didn't want to buy bottled water (I'm trying not to...) and Peter said the rule is I can only get a cup of tap water with ice if I make a purchase of $12 or more.   How about recognizing that my repeat business is well over $12 and just giving me a cup of water?  Nope.    

This is just terrible customer service.  Penny wise, pound foolish.

I'll find another local place.    I'm not going back."

Tianti is part bookstore part coffeeshop and it does both incredibly well. 

The books seem to be focused on spirituality and meditation and an atmosphere of tranquility ensconces the entire place. There is a fountain in the back room and they occasionally hold meditation events. 

The coffee quality and taste is impressive for a book store and I loved the cold brew (on tap!). Full flavor, smooth texture, and clean finish. They hit all my cold brew requirements. The tea comes in a special cup and has an adorable green top on the string. There are pastries and some other food items if you're feeling hungry. 

The barista is friendly and helpful. He shared some interesting insights on their different cold brew techniques. Coffee, meditation, and quiet space lovers - Tianti is the place for you."

Terrible coffee. One of the worst, most acidic cups of black coffee in a couple years. 

I thought of settling it down a bit but non-dairy milk was additional $.99 or something. It is hard to allow yourself drop another buck when you're already holding a horrible cup of $2.99+ tip coffee. Almond milk doesn't necessarily do the trick. 

I liked the friendly (slightly too friendly) service but didn't appreciate the confidence. I asked, how's your coffee and of course they praised it, told me the name of the coffee brand which I forgot now. I specifically asked if it's acidic or sour, and the guy laughed as if ""oh goodness no!""  But it was. 

I don't like giving out bad reviews but it's a must in this case. If a merchant thinks they have a great product but it's a disaster, it'll hopefully help them improve. Really, I hope they do."

This place really is so unique. It's not kidding when it says it's a meditative experience--there was even a woman (perhaps associated with the cafe) doing tai chi in the back of the cafe in this little section that looked like it was for meditation.

I spent the next couple of hours doing work here. I'm not even kidding about the ambiance though there was a literal fire (more than 8 ambulances) one block away and still I felt completely at peace."

Only on bathroom for the whole place

But the matcha and cookie I got was so horrible. I got a large matcha latte with almond milk for $8.50 which is more expensive than any other place I've had in the area. If it was a good matcha latte, I wouldn't mind, but I felt like I paid $8.50 for water down milk. I couldn't even taste any matcha at all. This is seriously the worst matcha I've ever had! And I should have read previous reviews 

The cookie was stale and hard. I took one bite and couldn't even eat it anymore."

That is soooooo not cool, I don't know any place in NY where you have to pay for WiFi, that is absolutely ridiculous & will make your coffee shop the last resort to go to. PSA #2: they are extremely overpriced... even Starbucks is less expensive than this place. It seems they overcharge in order to make up for their lack of foot traffic-- which is apparent by the way. It's run by some unfriendly Asian lady that seems to only care to make a buck. The space is large, and they have nice tables to work on, but I have two main issues with this business. The main one is that it is not actually a legitimate bookstore as they claim. All of the book are basically just the same book but translated in all different languages. The book relates to some kind of religion, but I found it to be a bit uninviting for customers who may not follow that religion and are interested in other books (like a regular bookstore with books from all over the world) I wouldn't think a business like this would do well because of that. I recommend they grow their selection of books and this way I guarantee they will have more customers. Because the space is quite nice, but the music is bothersome & the books.. well.. there is none lol! 
The coffee and pastries are nice though. But they should really keep their sugars and condiments on the outside where people can reach/ use them, not hidden away behind the register. They're stingy with the condiments."
759,tianti-books-new-york,2017-12-04,1.0,"$5 for a watery, tasteless Chai Tea Latte served by an unfriendly, unenthused barista. Better than the 16 oz. green tea I almost got for $7. Hot water and tea leaves for $7. Are you kidding me?

Don't waste your time. There are so many other amazing coffee shops and cafes in this city. Clearly they are taking advantage of the tourists in the area who will pay anything. So overpriced and nowhere near worth it. Better to go to Starbucks across the street."

Sadly have to leave a mediocre review- they charge for WiFi which most places don't so I didn't think to ask and they don't let you know before you order. It's only after having ordered that I found out, it was a disappointing experience, and a waste of time and money. :("
759,tianti-books-new-york,2017-12-16,4.0,"It's hard to find places that I like in this part of town, but I do like this place. Only been here once but I plan to come back. I had a tea, which was super duper expensive (almost $6) - the coffees are more affordable. It's a huge set of rooms, so there are plenty of places to sit and work: mostly tables and chairs, no couches or anything like that. 

Now for the cool part - the books on meditation and the potential to take a meditation class here (of which I'm only guessing), but it seems that the space is available for this very thing! 

I hope this place becomes a center for spiritual life in the midst of this crazy city. Keep supporting!"

I did some work here from noon to six on a Friday (a lot of hours!!) and they never once made me feel like I was overstaying my welcome. Noise level is low even during lunch hours and the innocuous classical/opera music blends right in. Food is subpar, but also not really what you're here for. I've never tried their tea, which they make a point of recommending, and there's def a next time for that! 

This cafe is run by Falun Dafa, for the promotion of Falun Dafa (as you will see from the books lining the  shelves). If you don't like that, don't come here."

760,starbucks-new-york-151,2019-11-05,2.0,"It really upsets me when you order a drink for $5 bucks and get a half empty cup that is filled more so with foam than the actual drink. I love Starbucks but a lot of places disappoint me simply because the barista doesn't really take their time to properly prepare the drinks. I ordered my usual grande latte but when I picked it up the cup was half empty. It really upset me and I asked the barista to remake it for me and she did. But even then it wasn't good, she probably added a little more coffee than before but still not my usual. 

The location is conveniently close to the train station and this location has few seatings but I don't really recommend it if you are planning to sit here and study. The place is a bit loud. The side tables have the power outlet on the bottom. Overall cleanliness is 6 out of 10 (10 is the highest)."

Walked a few steps further,past Blue Water Grilland here it is.. a beautiful new location. The layout is so spacious and really reminds me of a coffeehouse in Europe.
The place was humming with Xmas day revelers,tourists and freezing customers like me.
The staff was fast and the barista made my chai latte deliciously."
760,starbucks-new-york-151,2020-03-10,1.0,"I would like to preface this to say, generally, my experiences at Starbucks have been, at the most, friendly and professional...at worse, tepid.  But, this past Saturday (3/7/2020), I experienced something at the 750 6th Ave. New York location that I truly find repugnant.  
While at that location, a young, African-American man approaches me, politely asking if I can get him a cup of coffee.  Whether or not his account of being on various medications is true or not, this is a human being asking me for help, so, I immediately respond that I will be more than happy to do so, and even go so far as to add, he could request anything and I would purchase it.
Upon reaching the register, the young gentleman picks and hands me a banana from the stock available, and I share with him to feel free to ask for whatever else, but, the Starbucks barista at the register sternly tells the young man that he is not welcomed in the store and that he would have to leave.  Given the cold timbre of his utterance, I am guessing he is a Manager or Supervisor, but, I may be mistaken.  
I was so taken aback by the above, it took my brain and sense of compassion a moment to register what just happened.  Instantly, the young man asks me if I can purchase him the banana and coffee and I could bring it to him outside, to which I agreed.  My sympathy goes to him for the degradation that he had to experience at being asked to leave...that he was not worthy of receiving his requested fare in-store, but, had to be relegated to sub-human level and receive outside that for which he had asked.  
Upon the Starbucks barista completing my transaction just as coldly as he had addressed the young man, I proceed toward the door and give the order to the young man, for which he is thankful.  Now, I know my single voice does not affect Starbucks' bottom line, but, I will no longer be a patron at that location.
I send the young man much positive energy that he is blessed with good health and a bountiful life.
On a macrocosmic level, I feel this experience is a reflection of how far we still have yet to go, as a collective consciousness, in treating our fellow human beings with compassion, respect, and dignity.  Folks, we need to HUMAN UP...for real.  We can't continue to rely on the laurels of our internal self-aggrandizement at our sporadic acts of kindness (perhaps more frequently, for some) when there are those of us who treat our neighbors as the Starbucks staff treated the young man this past Saturday afternoon.  
Now, I am assuming that it is probable the young man may have frequented that location many times, soliciting help from customers, which I am well-aware is frowned upon by business proprietors.  I understand owners--and their patrons--being put off by those in need soliciting help at a place of business, especially if it is apparent that the individual is homeless.  But, honestly, people...we need to check ourselves from the better-than-thou pedestal from which many of us look down on those who are less fortunate.  
I see and hear it almost every day on the train or just perambulating about the city:  the look of disdain and annoyance and/or the muffled self-righteous judgments projected by commuters or passers-by at the sight of a homeless person.  Many folks' energies--subtle or undeniably patent--vociferously proclaim that they view the homeless as less than sub-human, someone not to be around with even a 10-foot pole.  
Our furry, four-legged companions and other animals--in distress or not--are showered with infinitely more love, understanding, empathy, and HUMANITY than some of us extend to our own brothers and sisters.  I find the following contrast disconcerting, to say the very least:  during my time at the aforementioned Starbucks' location, two pet owners walk in with their dogs at different points, receive service, and leave without consequence.  But, here we have a young man--a HUMAN BEING--kicked out, even with a willing patron accommodating his request.
Is this the point to which our humanity has devolved...?

A disappointed customer...

760,starbucks-new-york-151,2018-12-14,2.0,"As I write this review, it doesn't surprise me that this location was rated so poorly by other Yelpers.

It's your Standard Starbucks franchise, but it seems like the employees needed a coffee break to regroup.

It's a little after 6pm. My son and I stopped in for a quick bite. I will be the first to admit that I am not a regular customer, so I asked if they were still serving breakfast items and needed a price check (no visible signage posted by food items on display). I ordered a venti hot coffee, Teavana peach green tea, butter croissant, almond croissant, chocolate cake pop, and warmed tomato & mozzarella panini ($18.55). 

The first employee lacked motivation and energy. She didn't know which items were sold out and actually forgot to hand over my croissants. After completing my transaction, I moved over assuming that it moved more like an assembly line (one employee would take the orders in and fill any that included a bakery item, cold drink,or sandwich while the other would handle the coffee). I was WRONG! The second employee asked if I was waiting on something as she wiped down her workspace. I was confused but responded, ""yes, coffee.""  I was not even offered a bag for convenience's sake to secure my items while juggling hot coffee and a toddler. I walked away wondering whether the first young lady was taking on the brunt of the work and thus resulting in her lack of enthusiasm when interacting with customers. 

Seated is limited, but we were able to find two seats. The restroom was disgusting. I'd avoid this location."

Large communal table in the middle along with individual high tables and a few smaller ones along the windows.

I quickly became aware that the communal table had those nifty wireless charger circles in it. I also quickly became aware that none of them actually work. RAGE!!!

Until today...

They were handing out free samples of Frappuccino for their happy hour outside of the Starbucks. The employee that was handing them out was holding a tray of the free Frappuccinos and would pull the tray away from anyone trying to take one.  She would say go inside its happy hour. She continued to offer the free beverage and then embarrass people that would try to take it by pulling the tray away...Why offer free beverages if your only attempt is to force people into your establishment by embarrassing them?

Just one more reason not to go there anymore."

My roommate is a contractor/construction worker and works for a legit company I'm sure he would give you a good price, feel free to contact me and I'm sure he will give you a lower price then anyone else, since idk apparently your to cheap to fix them? so people can sit here and buy drinks and work on there computer,phones,laptops cause that is a lot of your business, obviously.

I am sure this review really wont surprise anyone. I have experienced less then acceptable service at starbucks in the past but nothing worth mentioning. This was just ridiculous. I order a Venti cold brew light ice and the barista put less then one third coffee in my cup, added another third of tap water, a splash of milk, and the rest ice. When i asked her politely about the water she replied with an attitude that it was because the cold brew is strong and that that is how all starbucks do it. That is simply not true and pretty gross if you ask me. The same barista also gave a horrible attitude when asked about the bathroom before our order. There is just no reason for this treatment at such a well known establishment."

Having formerly worked in retail, I'm usually pretty understanding of shotty customer service. Unfortunately, this Starbucks exceeds the standard issues you might encounter with bad service. 
Needed to expense it; didn't get a receipt. 
Waited for a long time; understandable, but they yelled at customers who asked about their drinks.
Was sitting down and didn't grab my order in time; he took it back behind the counter and yelled at me when I asked about it (yes, I heard him, I was getting out of the seat as he rapidly yelled my name)."
760,starbucks-new-york-151,2016-08-31,1.0,"UUUGGGGHHHHHHHUUHH!!!!!! I work in the area(ish) and get my delectable required ether from the Starbucks on 6th between 21st and 22nd (my favorite Starbucks ever). HOWEVER!!! Monday morning I was greeted with the pain of inability to order on my phone so, assuming their mobile order system was down again, I walked over fully expecting a warm greeting from my favorite baristas and (probably) an apology via $4 comp card. That didn't happen, because my third home is now under construction for renovations that I am SURE will be beautiful, but were not forewarned about. This brings me to Tuesday....

So yesterday I mobile ordered to this Starbucks, and a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed (yet coffee-less) me trotted over an additional block (in the opposite direction of my job) to get my morning fix, scratching at my neck all the while. Only to arrive (approximately four minutes after ordering) to no drink being prepared. Fine. There are a lot of people waiting. I'm early. No rush. It wasn't until I noticed that I had somehow turned into Robyn S and now i'm the only one left dancing. In the corner. Watching EVERYONE (not just ""you"") making sweet energy out of the love they received from the baristas (obviously in the form of liquid ""I can adult today"" goodness). By everyone, I mean a significant number of people that ordered in person AFTER I arrived. I was annoyed, but I also need my coffee.

Today..... I ordered before I even walked out of the train station. Walked as SLOW as humanly possible (something to the effect of swamp-like) and I STILL stood in front of the bar in that Starbucks for at LEAST ten minutes. I spent the better half of my life waiting for that drink. The problem isn't even being understaffed. There were at least 8 people back there. They were pumping iced coffees out like lava from Melissa McCarthy in a bridesmaids dress and sandals. The ACTUAL problem is the ONLY person I saw doing ANY work was ""Jay"" who is ACTUALLY a barista from the 22nd street location, who ALWAYS greets me by name, including today. Nobody was checking the mobile order sticker printer, nobody was helping her with the drinks, nobody was checking who of the masses was waiting for what.

Customer service on (insert the opposite of fleek)
(Also insert reference to Vegeta boasting about his power level being over 9000, but in reverse for their customer service skills)

Drinks: Coffee, Tea, Refreshers 
     Since I cannot have most of their drinks, I only purchase the Very Berry Hibiscus (venti). I love this drink too, it's in the Cool Refreshers section of the menu. It's a fruity drink, already sweetened with fresh berries added to the drink- oh so good and addictive. This drink is caffeinated, the calories are very low, venti is only 100cals (3 weight watchers points). I've brought this drink from various locations and this place hits the mark every time and they are willing to give you extra berries upon request. If you have not tried this drink, give it a go! 
By the way, I've tried the Passion Fruit tea, cold and sweetened, it's okay in my opinion, nothing to write home about. 

Bakery: Muffins, Croissants, Deserts & More
     Starbucks have a great selection of bakery items, they always look so fresh and tasty in that case but watch out, those small muffins and other items are packed with calories. I usually purchase the Petite Vanilla Bean Scone, it's small and just enough for me at times. I've also tried the Michigan Cherry Oat Bar, Berry Yogurt Honey Muffin, Pecan Sticky Bun & Birthday CakePop. Every single one of these items are so delicious with every bite. Their food selection is pretty good, I must admit. They also sell salads and sandwiches too.

We're out."" WTF. Don't tantalize me! He was pretty solidly unapologetic about it. I got nothing and rejoined my group of friends.

A few minutes later, I decided that I really DID want something warm, regardless of pumpkin flavoring availability. Luckily for me, while they don't have FALL flavors, they did have the CHRISTMAS flavor in early -- peppermint mocha! Go figure. 

It was good, but the spot wasn't great. Wouldn't come back -- not with 254023958 other SBux on the island."

760,starbucks-new-york-151,2011-06-21,1.0,"With the 500 other branches in a 2-mile radius, you're much better off avoiding this particular location: the staff is rude, un-helpful and incompetent.  I went in this morning and requested a tall Chai tea latte with NO sugar.  I only heard the register assistant say a tall Chai tea latte (but forgot the instructions for NO sugar) so I double-checked with the lady who handed me my drink that there wasn't any sugar - she confirmed that she didn't add sugar.  I take my first sip back @ my desk and it's laden w/ white sugar.  

It's such a simple request that one would think: ""How could you POSSIBLY mess that up?""  Well ... they somehow managed to.  Along with the other reviewers, this Starbuck's experience is a total thumbs-DOWN."

761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2019-01-28,5.0,Monday to Friday I get a Starbucks Cafe Misto (Grande) coffee. The service is great and coffee is made with love. I literally kiss my cup every single morning and it helps me make it through my very long day at work.
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2020-03-07,1.0,Ordered a Venti Black Tea Lemonade with 6 pumps of classic syrup which costs $4.84 you would think the barista would make the drink correctly. Why should I have to shake the drink myself?? This is has happened many times with certain employees there who do not care if they make the drinks correctly. The quality of service when comes to making drinks at this location has definitely dropped since it opened up.
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2019-05-05,5.0,"I really really love this Starbucks location. They have great coffee blends, including reserve. They have a very friendly staff.

Reserve blends are really good and I recommend them to anyone who really enjoys a good cup of coffee."

761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2019-02-20,4.0,"This is one of my favorite starbucks location to just sit and chat with friends or just sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee with a book. This starbucks is located inside Brookfield mall in the second floor. Its in the corner area so it wasnt noticeable until you walk further in. There are cozy chairs, bench and table areas. The back area has more tables and has high windows so its much brighter back there. However it is more colder in the winter months. I wish they can turn up the heat a little more though. I had one of Starbuck Reserve coffee which was the Vietnam da Lat one and it was good. I tasted it before adding sugar and cream and I can drink it black if I had to. But I wont cause I like my coffee with sugar and cream hehehe. My friend had the Columbia one under the reserve menu and she found it mediocre. I highly recommend the Vietnam one. There is an area in the back where you can watch the coffee being made. The barista is knowledgeable and answers any questions you might have. The bathroom is located in the back too so feel free to drink all day in Starbucks with friends, family or enjoying a relaxing day with a book on hand!"
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2019-01-04,4.0,"This is a Starbucks Reserve located in the Bloomfield Mall.  It is, beyond a doubt, the largest and nicest looking Starbucks I have ever been in to. There is a large seating area in the front when you first walk in with a big wooden table great for groups.  The serving bar is on the left and extends the duration of the location.  All along the right is several bar tops, chairs, and a large additional couch/chair seating area in the back. My one complaint is that I asked for two shots of espresso over ice and the barista called it a double shot and charged me for a double shot (it wasn't my drink so I just assumed he was giving me the proper title for what I ordered ""two shots of espresso on ice"").  A double shot is 1) not two shots of espresso on ice and 2) more expensive than two shots of espresso on ice.  When I picked up the drinks the barista fixed it for me but I was in a rush so I didn't have time to get the price adjusted on my card.  The drink I ordered for myself was also made wrong but it was a little more complicated so I'll forgive them for that.  The staff were all very nice though and the bathrooms were very clean."
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2018-05-18,4.0,Probably one of the nicest Looking Starbucks I've ever been to. Located inside the Bloomfield Mall (towards the back) it's nestled away as a coffee oasis with soft cushioned couches and Art Deco chairs

761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2019-07-20,4.0,Just as good as other Starbucks. There are plenty of seats but hope they can clean up the space more often.
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2019-12-26,1.0,"I have had several bad encounters in this Starbucks recently. Twice in a row I have had to wait half an hour for a coffee - I understand since this is a busy location and I offered it right at the beginning of ""rush hour"", but it was frustrating when you saw the employees chatting and standing while not working. Then today, the ingredients were unavailable for my beverage (which I ordered through the app), and no one called out my name. after 15 minutes of my coffee sitting there and employees standing around, I went up and asked when my coffee would be ready. An employee explained the situation and asked what I wanted instead. When I said what I'd like, I also asked for a refund since the original drink I ordered was $7 and the one I ordered instead was $4. The employees laughed at my request, and after receiving my coffee, received a very sarcastic ""have a nice day"", and was again laughed at while leaving. I find this to be unacceptable as a person who would usually come to this Starbucks once a week. I will no longer come to this Starbucks and would rather spend my money at other coffee shops in the building."
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2017-10-09,4.0,"They're quick to take your order but expect to wait 10+ minutes for your drink during peak hours.  They're also not great about getting the drinks out in the order they're placed in.  Often people 4 or more behind in line will be done before my cappuccino. There are a few tourists here bogartting tables, but not nearly as many as in the other locations nearby.

That being said, the decor is awesome & the bathrooms are super clean. I live for the cozy leather benches & sanded wooden chairs. There is an acceptable placement of outlets along the cement walls."

 sometimes is festive and Spanish!Welcome to free DISCO!

It's beyond cozy and rustic, and ideal for reading or working. Worth making a trek, even from uptown, just to sit and drink your latte here. Service is so quick, patient, and friendly. I genuinely enjoy being in this Starbucks. After the Starbucks in LA (in Redondo Beach?) that overlooks the ocean, this is maybe the most memorable one I've been to."

Bad:
Could be super crowded during office hours. Lines extend to many meters, bringing people outside, during peak hours. 

I believe the AC is always running in a beliw average temperature.so carry ur jackets or wear those.

Good staff, good seating, good locality. You can even carry ur drink n sit outside the store."

This location is usually excellent and I'm sad to be leaving a 2-star review but my drink tasted as though the blending machines had not been cleaned properly or dirty water was used. Baristas are ordinarily very friendly and since I ordered by phone I am not reviewing based on the service. However, the Frappuccino was really poorly made and I felt like it was a waste of money. Hoping this was a one-time incident."
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2018-07-02,2.0,Great staff however they have been unable to handle crowds lately. Last 2 visits had to wait 20 and 25 minutes. Seems majority of staff is focused on Mobil orders and not the customers standing on line for half an hour.

Even during morning rush hour they're very fast with filling peoples ordering, getting them their coffee and getting them out of there. The staff is friendly and attentive. There is also a slight afternoon rush when people are going in for their afternoon coffee, but even then, the staff is always there and aimed to please."
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2008-08-10,3.0,"This Starbucks happened to be right across the street from my hotel and unfortunately, much closer than any of the independent coffee houses that  I was aware of in the neighborhood.

Every morning the line of folks that work in or around the Mercantile Exchange would be out the door and into the lobby.  Yet somehow the barista's at this Starbucks remained jovial and worked quickly so that there was a steady movement of smartly dressed brokers through the line.

3 stars for getting my drink right and quickly every morning I visited despite being bombarded by dozens of Mr. Fancypants."
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2011-08-24,5.0,"People are complaining about long wait times for coffee in MANHATTAN?!?!?!!?!?!? At peak hours of 7-9am and 2-4pm?!?!?!!?!?!? Clearly, you do not work on the premises, frequent a Starbucks, or effectively function as a normal human.

The World Financial Center: There are FOUR towers, of FORTY+ floors filled with people, Not to mention the WFC is a tourist destination. This is the ONLY Starbucks in here. You mean...other people want coffee?! AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU? Holy crow, what is this world coming to?!!??!!

They are lightning quick in here, and ALWAYS pleasant to me. There's usually 4-5 people making hot drinks and Frappuccinos and 2-3 making iced coffees and iced teas at the other end of the counter. They always notice if you've been waiting extra-long and double check your drinks...and they'll re-make it if there is a problem by chance. 

I really don't think it helps much that half the clientele are so full of themselves or the person they're with that they don't notice their drink was called TEN MINUTES AGO. Seriously, some people deserve a swift punch in the babymaker. Guess it's a good thing I'm not a barista---because everyone would get decaf, sugary, whole milk drinks.

Well done, World Fi Starbucks."

The line is Always really long, but they do a pretty decent job in getting you out quickly. But here's the thing: Starbucks turnover is crazy. So this months great,friendly,efficient,knowledgable staff can quickly become the polar opposite next month. So if you're a repeat customer like me. You might have some high and low points here as far as service. But right now, they have it together."

761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2008-01-11,1.0,"This is by far the worst Starbucks I have ever been to...

so much so, if I were Starbucks, I would close this location so that it wouldn't dilute the brand!

First of all, it has the worst operations management ever. They have tried several ""techniques"" to decrease the flow time and increase the throughput, from taking your orders while you're waiting in line to opening up extra registers, but none have worked. (Maybe eliminating the three people behind each register who do nothing is the key?) No matter what time you come here, you will have to wait in an extremely long line.

Secondly, they often mess up the actual drinks! One day, almost everyone who ordered a hot drink ended up with a cold one - so after waiting in the ridiculous long line, you would have to wait even longer for them to make you a new hot drink. Needless to say, I didn't wait and ended up drinking a cold peppermint hot chocolate... yum... aka, ugh!

They also don't always have the drinks they claim to. The only thing one of my friends gets here is the apple spice - but they haven't had it several times despite it being featured as one of their drinks of the season. How hard it is to put a ""not available"" sign up?

I hate this place, and only come here when they have their holiday drinks. Otherwise, I go to financier!"
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2011-03-21,5.0,"This Starbucks handles an extreme amount of traffic because of it's location. 

After much trial and error, they've finally got their line and ordering system down to a science. Don't be put off by the morning caffeine crush, they'll get you in and out."
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2012-08-14,4.0,"Not only did I need coffee, but also a bathroom. Manhattan can be a hard place to find a restroom but there's a Starbucks on almost every corner. This one at Battery Park provided both services for me. Ground Zero was still a big hole in the ground when I visited here; a mental picture of that still exists in my head. Not a fancy or unusual building but one that stands out for me of the seven I visited this trip."
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2012-09-11,3.0,"No different than any other Starbucks in the city.  Serves the typical Starbucks drinks and pastries.  However, this one Starbucks serves coffee for all the people that work in the World Financial Centers and Goldman Sachs across the street.  It can get pretty crowded with at least 20-30 min wait time to get your order during the morning and afternoon rush.  If the location expanded or had two stores, the flow of service would probably be better."
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2008-05-01,2.0,"This location drives me nuts, seeing as how I've taken one introductory class in Operations Management.  Everything about the flow is wrong and provides for a terrible Starbucks experience.

First of all, there are two register sides, but most people all flock to the left-hand side because sometimes they have ropes set up for the line.  This leaves the right-side register with only a few people in line and a cashier yelling for more customers.  Second, why have 2 sets of registers when the baristas can't even handle one set?  THE REGISTERS ARE NOT THE BOTTLENECK HERE PEOPLE!  Lastly, the flow forces everyone to congregate in the middle, waiting for drinks, and then pushing their way out of the crowd and through the lines again to get out.  It's just mind-boggling how poorly the place was designed for traffic flow.  It can also easily take 5-10 minutes to get your drink (if you get it at ALL), which can really cramp a quick coffee break.

I like my iced caramel macchiatos though, so I'll let them get away with 2 stars."
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2009-02-23,1.0,"Okay, so you know when you have such a horrific service experience it makes you rush immediately to your desk and sign up for a Yelp account so that you can vent about it? Well, that's pretty much (exactly) what happened to me just now.

I frequent this Starbucks several times a week and generally have no problem with it. Yes, the lines are extremely long, but it's one store serving a couple of office buildings full of people, so it's understandable.

What is NOT tolerable is blatant and egregiously bad service. I assume the young man who helped me was a new employee because it was the first time he served me at this location. He had this glib manner about him that quickly deteriorated into an attitude that was beyond unprofessional. On top of all that, he's either doesn't have the necessary intellect, ability or interest to make a basic cup of tea.

Now for the specifics: I ordered a hot tea with soy milk. When he gave me the drink, I'm pretty sure he called me ""Love"", which was completely inappropriate and immature. He gave me the soy milk container for me to put the soy milk in myself, which they do sometimes and I am generally fine with this, but for the price, you'd think they could assemble the drink for you. Then I notice the hot water is filled all the way to the top with only room for a couple of drops of soy milk. And to top it all off, he hadn't even bothered to unwind the string and tag from the tea bags, but just dumped the whole thing in so that the tags were floating in the water!!!

It was completely disgusting and as much as Starbucks is so convenient and has some really addictive drinks, I am turned off enough from ever patronizing one again. This store needs to get its act together and fire this guy before he drives away any more customers."
761,starbucks-reserve-new-york-4,2010-11-25,3.0,"What's can I say, it's Starbucks and probably one busy location. But you can tell that these baristas can keep their cool. I like this location because it's minutes from the NJ Path up on your way through Wallstreet."
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2020-05-31,4.0,"Convenient location in midtown...open 7am to 6pm now. Glad they opened up again...and with all the floor markers for social distancing inside and outside. Creative floor markings outside to get folks to Starbucks! Easy to do mobile order and pick up when you get there. Friendly staff and service. They have almost everything available...just ask if anything. 

Will be coming back! Stay safe!"

It was just so gross and dirty.  Now for the service, it was meh...I ordered and waited and waited and waited as other people got their drinks. I decided to check on what the hold up was and the barista asked for my name and sees my order and says ohhh. Not sorry, missed that?? or anything?? He proceeds to make it with no apology as to my wait for about 10 minutes. I've had others forget to make my drink for some reason or another but they at least offer to make a larger one or apologize for the oversight. Hey, I know it happens but just thought it was rude.

When I asked if this could be changed,the woman behind the counter let me know I have to specify if I DON'T want it sweetened (what?)...I thought a regular IC meant unsweetened..but ok.

The manager (I assume) replies that they ran out of toilet paper and company policy says they can't open the bathrooms if they run out of supplies. The attitudes weren't friendly. Very annoyed at the whole vibe of it all. 2 stars because the drink is actually good."

They are on the corner of 35th and 5th ave. Their door is so not outstanding, so you may miss the door if you walk on 5th ave.

Overall, this is a great spot on 5th ave where you can enjoy the coffee without too much noise."

The staff that work at this Starbucks are by far the slowest workers I have ever encountered. They always seem to be ""busy"", yet simultaneously there is always a huge crowd of people waiting for drinks. With this said, I am not sure what they are ""busy"" with. Today, I walked into this Starbucks and I was the only customer on the line. My first thought was that I'll be out of there by no time. However, I was wrong. My drink was taken immediately, and soon after a heard of people came in. I still thought I would get my drink in no time because I placed my order before the crowd of people. I waited a while and a majority of the people received their drinks before I did. 
I have been going to this Starbucks for 3 years now because it is near my work and to be frank, I've been holding off on writing a review in hopes that eventually the staff would improve. 
I hope that the manager of this location reads this review and the rest of the reviews on this particular site. 
This is a highly populated area of Manhattan and one would think that the staff would be up to par with the volume of people that visit this location."
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2017-09-02,4.0,"Clean place , lots of seating at lower level and good staff. Dropped family to go up the building while we waited with hot coffee and banana cake, my favorite"
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2017-02-10,4.0,"A good location, but the layout is odd. I came in with my wife on our way to Bryant Park and it was in the mid 30's. The coffee was hot, the staff were friendly and we warmed ourselves up and even got to charge our phones while we relaxed."
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2017-09-24,5.0,"A good Starbucks, this one.

I ducked in here for lunch one quiet Sunday afternoon, and it was nice. First, this 'bucks location is a full-size restaurant pretty much, with tables and chairs and restrooms and a comfortable amount of elbow room - not one of the locker-room-sized jobs of some (perhaps most) Manhattan coffee shops. Second, the atmosphere was relaxed enough (during my time there, at least), also atypical of NYC. My order came up quickly and correctly, and I proceeded to have myself a nice little luncheon there, kept company by a good book as a sparse Midtown crowd trickled past the windows. Finally, the restroom was functional, and I left the place feeling nourished and at peace. Bueno!

Big thanks to all the folks at this restaurant, for enabling my lovely Manhattan outing. Keep it up :D"
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2017-08-08,1.0,"I am a gold card member and needless to say visit Starbucks all over the world on my business travels. I can say undoubtedly that the staff at this location is the rudest and most unprofessional I have ever encountered even by NY standards! Just terrible! Shatifa the self proclaimed ""manager"" is running a joke of a store. Filthy bathrooms and floors. Visit any one of the MANY other locations nearby for an experience you have come to expect from a Starbucks."
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2014-01-08,4.0,"Definitely another staple place on our free trip to NYC!  This location was a block away from our hotel and on the way to the subway.  Every morning, I would come by, get either an Americano or a Latte and a quick bite.  Just your standard Starbucks but some things to note.  New York locations use La Boulange pastries and other bites.  Originally from the Bay Area, La Boulange offers a little taste of France!  It was so delish!!

What I really like about this Starbucks and other food joints in the city is the ""on-the-go"" table mentality.  There are high tip tables lining the front window.  It's an efficient way to grab your items, eat quickly and go on your way.  It was kind of hard to accept at first.  People on the street literally pass by and have the opportunity to get up in your business and watch what you're eating.  After the first day, though, I didn't mind it at all.  That's the wonderful thing about NYC.  People don't care.  I loved it.  

Convenient location for Herald Square and efficient staff.  Definitely worth coming back to day after day!"
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2014-12-11,4.0,"This is one of the better cleaner NY starbucks. The service is prompt,  at least in the afternoons and the drinks generally come out correctly. 

The barristas are friendly and helpful. 

Since starbucks are the public bathrooms of NYC, it should be noted that this particular location only has two toilets. 

This location is fairly roomy and has tables and seating."
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2014-09-19,4.0,"I applaud the Starbucks family for generously donating their enormous wealth to realize such an ambitious charitable cause: free public bathrooms in NYC.  

The bathroom itself is quite ordinary.  White toilet, bisexual bathroom signs--the standard fare--I can't complain about free stuff, though.  I made sure I didn't raise the lid to tickle; the next female patron will inevitably back into the bathroom and attempt to sit down without looking--it's a safety issue.

You are welcome, ladies."
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2016-12-02,1.0,Loud and cold and poor service.  This space was cut from the building lobby.  Not in anyway like the traditional warm Starbucks we seek out.  Stay away
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2016-08-24,1.0,Definitely one of the worst -if not the worst Starbucks I've ever been to. An earlier reviewer stated that there are like 5-8 people behind the counter and only 1 or 2 seem to be working- If that's not bad enough- the 1 or 2 workers who are working are moving at  glacier like speed. It's as if they're doing performance art. I went next door to Oxford Coffee and got served instantly. AVOID ! AVOID ! AVOID !

762,starbucks-new-york-322,2016-06-15,1.0,"As a Starbucks regular, this is the worst Starbucks I have ever been to in my life (and I have lived in third world countries). There are about 8 baristas and only 1 or 2 of them ever seem to work. You will wait at least 30 minutes for your drink and it will be improperly mixed or just milk, sugar and ice. God forbid you order a muffin with your drink, then your waiting time is about an hour. I have never seen such incompetence in a Manhattan location before. The baristas just don't seem to give a sh-t."
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2016-10-25,1.0,Stopped in this evening on my way to the graduate center across the street.  I orderef my Starbucks usual (soy misto) they were out of soy so I opted to try the almond milk only to have the batista make my drink with coconut milk.  No sugar on the counter and the most disgusting misto I have ever had. It didn't even taste or look like the milk was steamed.
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2016-09-22,5.0,This Starbucks is my favorite in the area bc a young man that works for your establishment is the nicest best employe you have ! Helps make the other workers jobs easier is polite & you can see he actually cares about his job ! Someone give Frank who usually works weekdays at 830 am a promotion he is the best
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2016-05-17,1.0,"I am a regular at this Starbucks - I am usually there 1-2 times a day, every day, ordering venti or trenta drinks each time. Generally the service is slow but the baristas are nice and professional. However, one Barista - Caren - has made me consider finding another location. I sat down to finish a business phone call and she interrupted me to say that if I wasn't buying anything right then, I couldn't sit there. I explained that I would buy a venti ice tea as soon as I finished my call. She said she would be back in a minute to ""check on me"". She singled me out, even though there were at least 10 chairs open and 4-5 other customers in the vicinity who were seated but had not yet purchased any products...but had not been threatened or kept an eye on.  (I have a photo to evidence this.) 

Then when Caren DID prepare my drink, she got it wrong and had to redo it, wasting my and the other customers' time.

I am one of the most loyal customers at this Starbucks. To be singled out and treated so poorly should never happen - even to people who are there for their firs time. 

Apart from Caren, most of the other Baristas are lovely."

762,starbucks-new-york-322,2017-07-23,1.0,"LAZY, borderline incompetent staff. My drink was a layered mix of milk, sugar and coffee drip that they didn't even bother to homogenize, or present to the customer with a straw, the way other Starbucks locations do. After asking one of the staff who was just bumming around doing nothing - so as not to disturb the staff manning the cash register, since she was alone and had a line of people to deal with - if there was a code to the bathroom, he said ""cashier's got it"" and turned his back on me. Could you, maybe, hmmm, I don't know, ASK HER yourself and come back with the code, instead of basically wanting me to wait in line just for the bathroom code? But when I complained about the bathroom looking like it hadn't been cleaned in a week (ewww!), the same lazy-bum who was now resting his elbows on one of the machines, smiling at customers passing by (not preparing any product, from what I could see), he just shrugged and smiled. Infuriated, I said out loud ""what, don't you work here?"" and left. I have never seen such indolence and lack of concern for customer's experience, feedback or simply the standards and functioning of your own workplace. I will not return, and Starbucks should be ashamed of themselves - this is the n-th location I've been disappointed with. If they don't care about customer feedback/experience, why would I give them (why would anyone??) my money?!"
762,starbucks-new-york-322,2015-12-01,1.0,"I come here at off times, so there are only 2 people ahead of me in line. Nonetheless, it takes 10-15 minutes to get a coffee. Yesterday it was 10 minutes for a black coffee. Absurd!"

763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2020-02-23,5.0,Great pizza with amazing crust and fresh ingredients! We were looking for something near the Vessel and affordable for this high priced area of NYC.  This place delivers!
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2020-03-03,2.0,"- pizza looked like it had been sitting there all day
- cheese pizza was expensive at $4
- $4 cheese pizza was alright tasting"
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2019-10-20,2.0,"Beware! They automatically charge customers 20% gratuity. We were a party of two and when we asked our server about the 20% gratuity, her answer was that it was the ""weekend"". Seriously?? In my opinion, gratuity should be ""suggested"" and our right to tip however we would like. I understand when there's a party of 6+ but making it part of the bill without any notice is sleazy. The service was lacking, they're clearly understaff....that's probably why they feel the need to add gratuity to everyone's check. 

As for the food, we had arugula pizza which was okay. Bottom was burnt and it was very doughy. The caprese salad was better but nothing to rave about. And the wine, $14/glass--super expensive! Not coming back."
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2019-07-06,4.0,"The Luzzo family (if you haven't tried or heard of Luzzo's pizza, DO THAT NOW)  has a place right under The High Line by Hudson Yards. And in a place as cool as this- you'll want to swing by for a panini or pizza slice like no other. 

Still a ways to go in terms of atmosphere and decor but I can appreciate what they're after. It's a very narrow space with particular aesthetic that minimalists will dig.  When I came here on a Tuesday afternoon they weren't too jammed but you could tell, still sprucing up the place a bit. 

I'll come back in a month or so to check up on these guys."
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2019-07-07,2.0,"Walked in and did not get a proper greeting, nice decor but vibes was defiantly not there. As we were not even properly seated, on top of that the water glasses never got filled(apparently they were having issues with their tap system, so should you offer bottled to compensate!

With that being said, we expected the Pizza to take us above and beyond the experience we head but neither did the pizza. We had the 10"" 4 cheese pie, and it was super burnt crust and wasn't up to expectations and match with the price they are charging. 

In conclusion, go to it as a last resort option, NYC has standards when it comes to Pizza and service. 

This place scores are as follows.

Pizza: 1/5
Service: 1/5 

Overall: 2/5 at the Most, that's being considerate."
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2018-12-31,4.0,"Via Trenta which means ""30th street"", is right where the name say, on 30th halfway between 10th and 11th ave.  Very far west, you might say, but it is basically under the high line and is across the street from the massive Hudson Yards development.  

It is owned by the same people that own Ovest a few blocks away as well as Luzzo's, so this is definitely not amateur hour.  The space is a bit small and favors take away, but there are some stools facing the windows and there is a full bar as well.  They have a real espresso machine, too if you are on the go.  

The main event is the pizza and they make it Neapolitan style.  The pizzas are personal sized and a little smaller as well as cheaper than Ovest.  I usually get the Diavola - basically a pepperoni pizza.  It is consistently very, very good.  

Also, the staff here is super nice.  Last week, my wife and I waltzed in here just after closing and they still fired up the ovens and made us pizzas with a smile.  Fantastic stuff."
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2019-06-27,3.0,"Overall it's a pretty cute and decent place. Not elegant but cute and appealing. The pizza was good: crust / sauce a bit on the sweet side (I know you're adding sugar ugh) but still decent.

Giving only 3 stars though cause I ordered a Sabrina salad, what a freaking joke. There was about 1/4 avocado, a few cubes of chicken. Just don't even bother if you're gonna make the salads this weak."
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2020-01-31,2.0,"Food was good, but I had a bigger problem with the people and service here. I ordered a mealpal to pick up,  and when I got to this place:
1) no one was around to greet me and I had to walkk up to the worker who was sitting down somewhere  to the side. She reluctantly stood up and lazily addresses me, without much of a care. 

2) the point of me having a mealpal order iS to get my food quickly. I had to wAit 20 minutes for it because it was never pRepared. she told me I'd have to wait ""a minute"" and after 10 mins I came up to her to ask how much longer. She gave me the worst attitude alivve - stared me down and said  ""5 mins"" as if I was dumb. 

The food was again, really good, but Jesus the service is ridiculously terrrible. Just a bad attitude"
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2019-06-20,5.0,"Excellent and well priced pizza. A Margherita is $12, as are most other personal size options. The Da Mikele was a bit too salty because of the prosciutto cotto, but otherwise really good."
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2019-11-09,3.0,"I come here once in a while because the pizza is actually phenomenal .... the service and staff need a wake up call. If they had decent and charming employees they'd be unbeatable. 

Every time I've come in here I've had to wait around until being recognized as a customer.  Recently I went in with some coworkers and the cashier literally said ""not now I'm doing something"" .... we all left"
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2019-07-07,1.0,"No tap water and 2 guests order forgot.

We found this restaurant inside very charming the decoration was on point with those big wooden table. We were really looking forward to eat there after a long morning wondering around. At first I asked a table for 5, the lady at the entrance told me that she doesn't have any space which was wrong as I show her 2 tables in the corner that we could put together. She wasn't please to do it but it was fine we were just looking forward to sit down. We tried to order water but apparently we needed to purchase it as there was no tap water because of some construction they got recently. We order 3 pizza 1 lasagna and 1 panini. 3 pizzas got out in 5 minutes. After 30 minutes we figured they forgot the lasagna and panini. The lady said she was sorry but it wasn't her fault but the computer. I do not care about computer problem, if she was a little more aware (only 2 other guests at another table was there to take care of) she would have figure that they was a problem. We canceled the lasagna, we didn't have anymore time to waste. She come back offering the water (small nestle plastic bottle) and the panini, but without looking sorry at all. 

If you decide to go there I hope the lady will be in a better mood and won't forget your table service. The food was ok."
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2018-07-02,4.0,Love the pizza. It is definitely not the NY thin style pizza but it is delicious. The price for lunch special is about ~$10 for a pie and it does fill you up. It is a little expensive but it is the city. They also have HH specials on drinks. The ambiance is nice and although tiny it is a cute shop. They didn't have garlic powder which was a bummer.
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2019-08-12,5.0,This is a small high end pizza shop. It's cutely decorated but honestly I don't dine in. I do take out and it is fantastic. I'm moving soon and will miss their pizza.

763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2018-05-24,5.0,"I wanted pizza. I wanted NYC pizza. I wanted it now! So as we finished our eventful walk on the High Line Park (I recommend to anyone who hasn't seen this new elevated park that runs from 14th street up to Hudson Yards. It's remarkable and still in the works). Anyways, we dropped down from Hudson Yards and saw this cute little pizza place that is basically a small alley seating (seats against window and bar). Really narrow but awesome at the same time. Nice decor and service was great. Wife wanted a cheese plate but it wasn't on the menu so he made us one anyways! Nice! I ordered a personal pizza with mozzarella, salami and basil. So did I get my pizza fix? Especially NYC pizza. Thanks for asking, yes I did! The pizza itself is not like the NYC pizza I'm used to, it's more Neopolitan style which I also love. The crust isn't crispy but it doesn't have to be! The dough has a great chew to it and the pizza was super tasty. Fresh ingredients plus charred to perfection. My wife isn't fond of pizza but she loved it! If you are around Hudson Yards and craving a quick pizza meal, def come by here!

****The Good*****
- Pizza of course! I'm sure if you get any type here it will be good!
- Service! Not in your face but really accommodating! ESP when the wife wants something, she gets it! Thumbs up for that!

****The Bad****
- Smaller space, so not ideal for big groups. However, you can make it work! You won't sit across from each other, but if you are with people you don't like, it may be a good thing! ;)

****The Ugly****
- Location may be hard to find. Not necessarily an ugly thing but I had to point out something"
763,via-trenta-pizzoteca-new-york-2,2018-05-29,5.0,"Awesome for breakfast, lunch, and dinner near Hudson Yards and the north end of the High Line.

The pizza is not New York style. You can't get a slice (except for thick, sicilian style squares). Instead, it's a smaller personalized pie with higher end ingredients. Everything about the pizza is delicious, including the dough which is some of the best I have ever had.

In the morning you can get a breakfast sandwich made out of that same dough. It's called a 'cono' and is in fact a cone of pizza dough stuffed with things like prosciutto, egg, and cheese. I mean... come on.

There's a good happy hour, as well, including a Capri Fun - which is, as you can imagine, and adult Capri Sun."

However, when offered water, we asked just for tap and they informed us that the only options were flat bottled water or sparkling. Ordinarily that would be no problem, except for the fact that they not only charged us for the Poland Spring water bottles without telling us until the check came, they charged us a whopping $4.50 each. Food was great, such a shame that the egregious price of something so basic left us all with a disappointed feeling. Moral of the story: expect to be thirsty"

I am not a fan of the communal tables  but those are an option as well. Luckily we found a regular table. I ordered the avocado toast with an egg. I guess there was a misunderstanding with the egg because she brought out a soft boiled egg that I could barely peel. I asked for a hard boiled egg and she kindly brought another one. I don't know why they don't de-shell the egg and slice it before giving it to me but thats another story. I have had it at other Le Pain locations where they de-shell and slice it on top of the avocado toast for you.  Maybe they are busier here! 

I also ordered a tea which was nice but I wish they served it in a normal cup. It was more like a bowl than a cup so kinda weird to drink out of. 

I have a soft spot for Le Pain's... they always have a spacious layout, decent food, and clean bathrooms. The wifi is always reliable as well. I would come back any time..."

I went recently to get some work done at the communal table and lunch. The communal table is my favorite part of this place, it has charging plugs built into the top so I can charge my computer while getting some work done. Another thing I love is if you order the pot of tea you can continuously ask for more hot water, which as an avid tea drinker this is amazing.

On to the bad. I got a half sandwich half salad combo for about $16. The bacon lettuce chicken sandwich I got was so disappointing. One tiny piece of bacon and not even enough chicken to cover the half of sandwich I got. The chicken was also under seasoned and sad. The salad was fine, nothing to write home about but it was edible. 

As much as my server was friendly, he forgot to put in my lunch order so after about 20 mins I asked about it and then he had to put it in as a rush order. As an I'm sorry he brought me over a free ""dessert"", it was this tiny bite sized lemon tartlet which was actually kind of good but the size was so small I finished it in one bite.

This place has a great atmosphere. Warm colored wood floors, tables and walls, plump loaves of fresh baked bread on display and a cabinet full of sweets greet you when you walk in. 

They have a to go counter for walk up customers but we stayed and dined in. 

The menu was a nice mix of breakfast, lunch and dinner options, meaning you could get an egg dish, sandwich or proper full meal plate.
They also had many options for gluten free people. yay! I got the avocado toast on gluten free bread with a soft boiled egg on the side and a soy cappuccino. My husband got the gruyere and ham on a croissant dish and a regular whole milk cappuccino. He loved his and mine was very good.

The quality is superb and delicious- I usually pick their fruit based pastries like their apricot tarts. I highly recommend their breads as well. The drinks here are great. I prefer their lemonades like their raspberry or mint ones as they use real ingredients to get that phenomenal taste.

Accepts card.
Bathrooms available.

Bon appetit!"

764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-04-16,2.0,Went there on last Saturday. Their bathroom was very crowded with people from Bryant park. Even homeless has been there for a while. Didn't feel clean. Tables were empty. It's warm out so many people just use bathroom??? I wanted to try their French doughnuts so bad so I took one home. It wasn't fluffy as I expected. I'm not sure it's worth paying $4.50. I also got an almond chocolate banana muffin. It was tiny. It tasted good but not worth paying $2.50 for a tiny muffin.
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2020-01-01,1.0,"Service is ridiculous. Understaffed or just apathetic. 
Restrooms need serious cleaning. 
Food is good but that's about it"
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-02-13,4.0,"I came here with a group of 4 others at around 7:30 pm on a Wednesday.

It is a very relaxing and chill ambiance as the restaurant was not too crowded. I think in the evening at least, it would be considered a good place to read or have a few moments to yourself.

The waiter recommended a turmeric latte ($4.99) and I thought it was quite good. It had steamed milk and came out hot and flavorful. It wasn't too sweet. 

At the end, the waiter separated our checks five different ways which I really appreciated. Overall, I recommend it here and would come back to try other drinks such as the Belgian hot chocolate, the Hot Honey and Lemon, or the Matcha latte."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2018-12-19,1.0,"I've been to a few Le pain locations and had good experiences, but this one was awful. 

I waited by the hostess table as instructed by the sign. The waiters saw my group, but ignored us for about 10 minutes-not once even mentioning they'd find us a table eventually. (Which there were lots of tables open). 

When they finally do acknowledge us, they take 10 minutes to seat us despite the open table. 

Fast forward 30 minutes later, the waiter finally comes to take our order. 

I had moved on of the chairs since there was a puddle of water and we needed a dry chair...the waiters kept putting back at my table. 

I'm genuinely appalled by how bad the service was. The one pro, the waiter was friendly."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2020-01-03,1.0,"Apathetic service, unseasoned food, could learn how to scramble an egg and be kind to customers."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-09-20,1.0,"Make sure that the bread is fresh! Donot believe them if they say it is! They sliced and sold me a bread two weeks old, TWICE on the same day!
And l paid $9 a loaf!"
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2020-01-23,5.0,"I had the most wonderful experience today with Omayra!  She was attentive, kind, made great recommendations and helpful. I've been to many LPQ's in NYC and this is the first time that I've  written a review.  The food was great - I had the three bean chili and it was yummy! I will definitely return to this Bryant Park location because of Omayra."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2020-01-20,4.0,"Located in a GREAT location across  from Bryant Park - they serve excellent coffee/pastries in their café area though I have yet to  visit the  restaurant which is always  bustling with happy looking patrons which can only be a good sign that the food/service is impeccable. They are  always super fast/friendly at the counter and add special touches like remembering my order. My favorite part is  the music they play, someone has GREAT taste - and it's a good ambiance to relax, meet a friend/colleague/loved one or get some work done on your laptop/smartphone (the front window facing the park has outlets for recharging! )"
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-12-06,4.0,Great service.  Cozy vibe.  Get the chicken soup with harissa... it'll warm you right up!
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2018-05-12,4.0,"I came with a friend for a quick bite around 12:30pm last Wednesday.  We were seated right away and given menus.  I thought our waitress was a bit cold but maybe she was having an off day.  I ended up ordering the Dragon Fruit Smoothie Bowl, Coconut yogurt, kiwi, fresh berries, banana, chia, and granola.  My friend ordered the Warm Belgian Waffle with fresh berries.  My smoothie bowl was amazing!  I loved everything in it.  A bit tart but I like it that way.  The granola was such a great part of it.  I felt inspired to recreate this beauty at home.  I didn't try the waffle but it looked delicious, just a bit small!

There are a lot of vegetarian options here so I plan on coming back to try them all!

Tip: You cannot sit in the dining room if you buy something from the counter, you need to order.  I discovered this the hard way the first time I come to a Le Pain Quotidien."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2020-01-26,5.0,Great customer service and every time I've been here I've been happy with the quality and the freshness of my orders. The salads are amazing as well as the tartines. I've had avocado toast in many places but LPQ is my all time favorite. The warm grain bowls is also really good. Very clean and great place to have a low key lunch by Bryant park.
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-05-05,5.0,Really cute spot by Bryant Park. People here seemed friendly. Lots of people just reading or catching up with friends. The cookies here are huge. The lady behind the counter was helpful. There are 3 restrooms (without codes needed!) It's got a great view of the park. Plenty of outlets to use. Really lovely spot to spend a few hours and unwind.
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-05-27,4.0,"Delicious avocado toast, the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because I ordered takeout and still had to wait about 5 minutes to pick up my order because there wasn't a take out person and everyone was busy doing something. Other than that, my lunch was delicious and I'd definitely come back to order and try new things."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2020-01-20,5.0,"A centrally-located breakfast/café/bakery with a substantial amount of seating. My family and I were seated right away and a served quickly. The menu was concise and full of good options for picky eaters like my sister :)
The ham and gruyere croissant and it's accompanying salad were good, but my croissant was kind of cold. In addition, there was no cutlery at my seat and the server forgot to bring some over for me when seating us. However, it wasn't a big deal and this is a really efficient Le Pain Quotidien considering how close to Times Square and Bryant Park this location is!"
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2020-01-20,5.0,The breakfast sandwich was great and we loved the dressing one the salad.  Price was reasonable
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2020-01-20,5.0,Conveniently located across from Bryant Park. The front tables offer a great view to people  watch. The food is great. The staff provide a great service. Danesha is fabulous. Look for her!
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-04-05,1.0,"My first time here and I came here on a whim just looking for a coffee and quick breakfast bite. Good news- no line to order so that made me feel a bit rushed as the register is near the door- so out of habit I approached the cashier unsure of what to get. So I said "" I will get a latte.. i guess"" You could tell I was a little unsure but hey can't go wrong with that. The cashier responds ""you guess? Do you want it or not?"" 

The attitude was so forward I thought it was a joke. I ordered a blueberry muffin (dry- not so great) which the cashier could barely grab due to the 3"" nails she was sporting. 

Then to find out it cost about $10 just for a latte, blueberry muffin and some snotty service- I wish I never walked in here. Never again. 

note: I came in on 4/5 @ 12:20pm."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-06-19,5.0,"Walking in to the smell of fresh baked good is a LUXURY of course they can get pretty packed and wait times can be lengthy but it is well worth it. The food is served fresh and there are so many options for those looking for more natural and less processed options. We went in for avocado toasts and lemonade and it was phenomenal! the bread was soft and crunchy at the same time and the food was flavorful, a bit on the pricey side but heck it's the city. As for the atmosphere, it was very cute and well lit though very crowded. A must try though!"
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-04-03,4.0,"This pricy, place for great breakfast and lunch is resurging in popularity near Bryant Park.  Have always loved the breakfast sandwiches with a fine blend of cheeses, egg, avocado on a fine brioche.  I also love the oatmeal here, fruit, and fresh squeezed OJ.  If you have great fresh squeezed OJ how can you go wrong! Le Pain Quotidien!!!"
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-02-24,5.0,"My partner and I stopped here to grab some food before our train home! The store was bustling with folks seated and smiling, enjoying their brunch and espressos. There was no line, however, and we picked up the Grilled Chicken and Mozzarella Tartine and the Prosciutto and Fig tartine under the free Valentine's Day promotion. (If you refer a friend to the app, you can both receive free tartines!)

Maria, the store owner asked if we'd like some pastry to accompany our open-faced sandwiches. My partner eyed the Belgian chocolate brownie, while I spied the French cream doughnut. I joked that it was a good selection for my two birthday treats, and Maria gifted me with an extra doughnut! I really appreciate her and the excellent service at this Le Pain. Our tartines were cut more perfectly than any other store I'd been to, so we were able to eat without further cutting. I sampled both, and the prosciutto used to be my favorite, but the chicken is so filling and flavorful. It's very savory and warm, and comes with a small spread of French pickles and olives. The prosciutto, which is much lighter, is also delicious and has a sweet finish. 

The desserts really wrapped up our brunch. My eyes widened at how light and sweet the French cream doughnut was. So so glad Maria treated me to an encore because it's fantastic. The brownie was rich and fudgy with a crisp outer coating. I loved the texture combination. 

Overall, I'd say this is my favorite LPQ in the city because of the consistently wonderful service I've received here. 10/10 on service and staff friendliness."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-06-15,5.0,"We came in for breakfast on a Saturday and were seated right away. The food was excellent for everyone, and my breakfast sandwich was divine!

764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-08-15,1.0,I love le pain because they have breakfast all day but jeeshhhh....The service is horrible! I don't have much to say here but wait staff are working on their own terms. Get another job!

But if you want consistent quality food and a staff that makes your experience pleasant with equal consistency, this is not the place for you. Head to Ole and Steen next door or Maison Kaiser down the block for good food,good atmosphere and consistently ( not just occasionally) pleasant service. Noone needs an attitude with their food."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2017-05-09,2.0,"Oui oui, it is time for a French review. Okay, not really, but when a place is called Le Pain Quotidien, I might as well attempt a word in French. Maybe it would help out this bakery/cafe in being a little better in every facet...or maybe not.

The place felt like it had solid potential to be somewhere you'd want the daily bread (English translation) to come from, but after lunch here a few weeks back I can't say I was impressed. It was a weekday and my mother and I were off from work. Everyone else (including my sis) was still going about their daily grind and so the three of us stumbled into a massively packed location. Surprisingly, we waited maybe 5-10 minutes to sit. Takeout might've been the crowd culprit. 

Despite our quick seating, the service was turtle slow. No one came to our table for at least 10-15 minutes (besides the bus boy with some water). Finally, an elder yet kind woman swung through and took orders from a bunch of tables. Her name might as well have been Mrs. Houdini because she kept disappearing. As soon as she came back with drinks we grabbed her to order as so to not lose her again. By the time the food came, my sis had to unfortunately scarf it down so she could head back to work. My mom and I had the time to eat a little slower, but that wasn't cool.

So what did I eat? Well I started with a glass of cucumber mint limeade, which sounded a lot better than it tasted. Maybe a little too heavy on the veggie as it tasted  more like water with cucumber in it. For lunch I landed on one of their ""tartines,"" an open-faced sandwich on organic whole-wheat sourdough. Mine consisted of grilled chicken, smoked mozzarella, arugula, tomato salsa, and basil oil. Despite its exotic sound, it resembled bread with chicken and cheese on it. Nothing as exciting as I had imagined from the description. It was also lukewarm, but I feared returning it and never getting it back. Luckily, taste-wise it was surprisingly good. Not so surprising were the prices which fit the bill for what is expected in Manhattan. Honestly, when totaled up, it really wasn't a meal worth the money.

Overall, I was going to give this spot a three star review, but after rethinking and typing up everything, it's going down to two. Sorry, Frenchies, but Le Pain Quotidien just didn't do it for me. There's plenty of cafes just like this one that I can track down next time I grab some lunch in the city. Au revoir."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2019-09-27,1.0,"I used the online ordering service and received a confirmation email stating the time the order would be ready for pickup.

When I arrived I did not see a designated area to pick up my order, so waited on line for quite some time to get to a cashier. When I spoke with the cashier, she told me that they did not receive my order because they have ""new systems and I need to order through Ritual or another meal app."" How was I supposed to know this information?

She had to call a manager to pull up my order info, which took more time. When the manager finally arrived and went to the kitchen to have it made, they were out of the item I ordered.

The manager did not apologize or offer to compensate me in any way for my trouble beyond refunding my money. Only when I communicated my frustration with the entire process, the waste of my time, and my disappointment in not receiving my order did the manager think to apologize."
764,le-pain-quotidien-new-york-159,2018-12-25,3.0,"This restaurant was great and was able to seat us quickly. The menu could be descriptive. I ordered the salmon breakfast under the organic eggs section, expecting scrambled eggs with salmon on top. Instead, I got one hard boiled egg, a side of un-toasted bread, and a small plate of smoked salmon for $15! On the bright side, the sunny side bowl was delicious and left us feeling healthy and full!"

I and my friend didn't realize we stayed a little over their closing time, and they were patient for us, the lady there greeted us with a great smile as we left. Another time dining here was also great. Even though it was crowded and service delayed a bit, I didn't mind because they courteously assisted me and my friends. I love their all organic foods."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2020-05-05,5.0,One of the best iced coffees you can get in NYC! I loved this coffee shop so much my friends and I sat down and had a nice coffee date for quite some time. The barista was EXTREMELY helpful and sweet. I ordered a coffee cake to go along with my drink and it was so so good! Next time I'm in New York you can find me here lol!!!
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2020-02-16,4.0,"Came here for a quick drink with a friend and ordered the matcha latte. It already comes with almond milk which is awesome!! At other shops, I always have to ask them to substitute the milk. One thing I love about their latte is that it comes unsweetened so I can adjust the sweetness level to my own liking (sweetness is one thing I can't get adjusted when I order a green tea latte at Starbucks). Also the shop itself is warm and cozy - great place for catching up with a friend!"
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2019-01-23,5.0,"There are Gregory's all over the city but this one was directly across from our hotel (the luxurious Hilton Garden Inn).

Clean, spacious interior.  Friendly counter folks.  Baked goods looked good but I didn't try any.

The cold brew was smooth.  I sampled the Honey Badger which is an interesting coffee concoction made with almond milk and honey.  It was a little weird and too sweet for my taste but the wife liked it.

No complaints."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2020-01-13,5.0,"So I didn't know this was a coffee chain, but that's no matter, I tried the iced coffee with the hint of nutella in it and it was absolutely fantastic.  The inside of this shop was really nice, and the baristas were super friendly to everyone.  Def wouldn't mind stopping in again next time I'm in the city for another iced coffee."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2019-06-20,3.0,"Am I just not used to the coffee prices in NYC or was this latte actually tiny for the high price? There was a lot of ice in the cup and the latte had an interesting bitter taste to it. 

One cool feature about this place though was having plant based straws especially after all the problems plastic straws cause to ocean creatures!"
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2019-09-20,5.0,"You can find decent coffee most places in New York if you're willing to look and I've written maybe 3 Yelp reviews ever. I had to reset my password to write this.

When politely asked for a review, and I asked them for everyone's names because they really do make for a special experience and the least I can do is say something nice when each employee tries to remember my order when I walk in the door and I keep being annoying and switching it. I work nearby and come here a lot.

Andrew - manages everyone and they all seem to like him which I could never pull off, so... that's amazing.

Sara - also manages like a boss and knows how to run a team. Nails my latte every time I get one.

Drew - will always ask if I want to add a chocolate drizzle onto the ridiculous mocha I order just to make it more fun.

Juan - usually on in the evenings and seems super chill. 

Chanel - there all the time, is beyond kind, and usually makes the aforementioned ridiculous mocha I need at 1pm.

Erika - whips things up super quick at the espresso machine.

Crystal - has energy I could never have at 8am and could make Gail Devers cry with her nail game.

Ashley - super kind and I'd follow her dog on Instagram if I had that.

Dillan - usually on in the AM and also super chill and knows my order before I do.

This Gregory's location is truly exceptional for the service and the people that work here. Gregory's Coffee is a decent size chain, but this shop feels like a much more intimate shop with the way they treat you."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2020-02-23,5.0,"Great coffee. I'm obsessed with their lattes, it's a different in a good way. Nice to know they have a reward program. Also, this place is right by my job so I go there often and I noticed that they're very attentive and help you as soon as you walk in. You know, since everyone is in a hurry in nyc. I've ordered food a couple times, 5 stars for food also."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2019-01-24,5.0,"Bold and smooth drip coffee. Not too many tables when I walked in at 2:30pm on a weekday so don't pick this spot if you're in need of a seat. Grabbed an almond bite for a paleo snack and it was delicious (a bit pricey at $3.50)
Some fun looking lattes and drinks, including one with CBD oil!"
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2018-06-29,4.0,"Quiet, quick, and quality coffee! Can't go wrong with an iced coffee with almond milk. I really wish they put the almond milk out for customers, but if you ask for more, they'll just give you the carton. The staff is quick here, and they always put out free pastry samples. I love their mini-donuts! 

I also highly recommend their specialty lattes. The elderberry beet latte is so soothing and subtle (is it obvious I'm a fan of alliteration?). 

There's also a single bathroom stall and fantastic WiFi. Gregory's always comes through for solid beverages and the perfect environment! 

I'm such a Gregular! Has anyone else been to as many branches as I have? I'm hooked. Give them a try, and once you're hooked too, get their app to get a free coffee after you buy a handful!"
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2019-12-12,5.0,"I was excited just looking at the menu because there were so many coffee options. I went with the Hall and Oats which was delicious. Highly recommend. And very fair price for coffee in the city, especially because it's cold brew. I also love that the website provides full nutrition info. Even though it's a chain, it was better than some $6 coffee I get elsewhere in the city."

765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2019-06-24,5.0,"This is my favorite coffee / tea place.
I frequent Gregorys a lot!
Everyone working there is courteous and efficient.
I know each of the staff by name. 
They always greet you with a smile.
And of course you cannot beat their coffee/ teas +"
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2019-06-27,5.0,"I love the atmosphere here. The baristas are warm and welcoming, and once you become a ""Gregular,"" rest assured, you do not even have to place your order, they know. Your drink will be ready before you've paid.  Super friendly staff that works well together.  I love this place. It is the highlight of my day! 

Considering the foot traffic in the area, it is amazing how short the wait is here.  The expresso here is strong. The lattes overall are good, and they often have seasonal drinks. Prices are standard compared to the rest of the coffee shops near by, but the quality of the espresso is way better."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2018-06-21,4.0,"This is a nice coffee shop with a very hipster vibe, the lights are a little dim, and there are what looks to be repurporsed wood for table tops. The coffee is good, and in particular, the cold brew is quite smooth. If you get their flavored cold brews, don't worry about any over powering sweetness, it is more like a hint (and if you want it sweeter, you can add sugar). The service was quick, but I did come at a very quiet time of day. I also got the double chocolate cookie, and I found it to be slightly chalky and much too sweet. 

All in all, not a bad coffee shop, and a good spot to wait for someone. Note: you need a code to open the bathroom."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2019-06-22,1.0,"Very rude people working- Erika was aggressive when I knocked on the door at 7:02 and they open at 7. After I asked for the manager she denied me any access to them, then she started talking bad about me to the customers. She definitely is not well and maybe needs some time off work."

I came in to the 33rd location today, and the crew was very helpful and knowledgeable (they also offered me a free pastry because it was my first time)! Extremely fast service, sharp latte art, consistent drink quality, an overall best customer service I've ever experienced! Thank you to Drew, Chanel, Erika, and Pamela! Thank you for making me see coffee differently!!!!!"
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2018-04-14,5.0,This place is trendy without being overly crowded with tourists and hipsters. Wonderful open faced toast selection. I ordered the spicy avo toast and the honey badger cold brew. My friend got the honey bee toast. Deceivingly we thought the honey bee would be a little sweet and it would be the perfect compliment to the savory spicy avo toast but the honey bee toast had black pepper on it which I actually really liked. I wanted to venture out and try something unique and tried to order the beet latte with oat milk. The barista told me to not order it because it reminded him of wRm tomato soup.  so I opted out. Overall great experience.
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2019-06-26,5.0,"Best coffee in town. Everything about this place is awesome; the coffee, the pastries and the people who work there. I've tried most of the things on the menu and have never been disappointed. My fav is their latte with an extra shot. If you're looking for quick service, friendly people and smooth coffee look no further and go to Gregory's."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2018-03-15,4.0,"Went here recently and was very happy with the amount of vegan baked goods. All the baked goods were clearly labeled if they are vegan, gluten-free, etc. I got the coconut, cranberry scone which is both vegan and gluten free and it was quite delicious. I also got a matcha latte which is made with almond milk. I like that the drinks are clearly labeled as vegan but they also off many dairy free milk options so I imagine most can be modified to be vegan. I did find the service to be slow and the space was a little cramp but I would come again for a vegan treat and a latte."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2020-01-02,5.0,"This is my weekday morning coffee spot. My favorite drinks are the iced Honey Badger (cold brew, almond milk, and honey) and the pocket latte. Even though it is busy in the morning, the staff works through the line quickly and efficiently. Plenty of seating for those wanting to get some work done or hang out for a bit and enjoy their coffee."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2017-10-20,3.0,"Gregory's coffee is an extremely convenient stop on my way to work and I am so thankful that they are open at 6 am because a lot of other shops do not open until 7. I think this is because Gregory's is a chain as opposed to a locally owned shop, nevertheless, it's convenient. However, what's not convenient about Gregory's coffee is the price and the really filthy bathroom. When you come into a coffee shop at 6:15 am and the bathroom is absolutely filthy with a vanity that looks like a gas station bathroom with the most offensive smells, you know that this bathroom was A) not cleaned that morning before opening the shop and B) not cleaned the night before when the staff went home because from 6 am to 615 am I doubt someone went into the bathroom and wrecked it. The gross bathroom is consistent too. Also, there are no hooks to hang your coat or bags in the bathroom so when you go in, you are most certainly not putting anything on the floor so you have to hold your giant purse on your lap, it makes the convenient coffee shop on your way to work, not so convenient.

It's a shame because I think the set up of Gregory's is cool. I like the high top table seating in the entryway. They have a lot of goodies in their food window. Protein balls, fancy toasts, baked goods galore. They also have water bottles, hard boiled eggs and some other things in their refrigerated section. They almost always have bananas on the counter too. They have a house blend, which is what I always get. I think their coffee is a little expensive, however. $3.10 for a medium is steep. I don't know if they are charging me an additional fee for the almond milk I have added, but I always ask for the teeniest drop so now I am curious if that's why the cup seems so expensive. Also, even with a sleeve on the cup, it is very difficult to hold for three avenues, burns my hand and I've been in the restaurant business for years, my nerve endings in my hand are minimal due to burns in the past so if I think the cup is hot, others have to agree tenfold. 

So moral of the story is, their coffee is really good, their blend is unique and delicious. If they cleaned their bathroom and added a hook it would make a world of difference. Also a couple smiling faces behind the counter wouldn't be the end of the world."

Super friendly staff and great with taking your order, but then you wait...and wait...and wait. Baristas are going as fast  as they can but they can't seem keep up with volume with the equipment they have.

Also. If you are used to Starbucks coffee,  this will be a shock.  Everything is much stronger and borders on bitter at times.  Definitely an acquired taste.  I had the caramel latte and it was hard to taste the caramel or anything else but bitter coffee.

Their goodies are delicious, superior to Starbucks however, so ill continue to visit this location when i cant get to my regular places. (It's closest to my work) but only when I have time to spare."

I say """"like"" $3.00? How much is it?"" She says she will give me a receipt.  Receipt shows $3.50. I tell cashier. She ignores me.

The Barista wasn't being accurate with the mix obviously. The muffin was super dry as was the banana bread lying out open. And when I went back for a replacement the guy behind the teller was extremely curt and non apologetic. I told him it was bitter etc. and his response is ""we don't control the premix""!!  You control the milk I said to him don't you. He offered to make another one completely non apologetic or empathetic.  And I just reordered a peppermint tea.  And that's when he said the magic words ""I am sorry"" which is what he should have said first.  Terrible customer service."

SERVICE | Fast and friendly.

SPACE & AMBIANCE | Your typical coffee shop vibe, but a little more hipster feeling. Some tables in the back as well as the front of the establishment. Lighting a little dim in the back because there are no windows in that area."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2018-09-12,5.0,I've tried a lot of different NYC coffee shops while here on vacation and this is the one i returned to. the brew is right for me. roasty and not too much foam which means you get a full cup of coffee. breakfast toasts are also gorgeous and varied. highly recommended
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2018-10-17,5.0,Tried this place because it's super close to my hotel and reviews looked solid.  Now I have been coming here every morning.  Chai lattes with almond milk and bacon egg cheese English muffins have become my go-tos.  Wish they had this in SF.

The lines in the morning are annoying, but they have fresh baked pastries that are unique and I think that's what sets them apart. Definitely better than Starbucks.

Their Aeropressed single origins are pretty good. The espresso here is very robust here but a charred note? I usually get a cortado and some sugar or a cappuccino (very smooth here). Their Walnut Banana Bread is really good, not too dense. They also have a giant Rice Krispie treat made with Chex, which is my guilty pleasure. 

They woo me now and again by dropping $2 in my LevelUp account every few months.

There is a lot of space to sit/work with laptops, but they are usually taken. I have to say this place has some of the happiest workers I've ever encountered, they are always smiling and friendly to everyone! They're never impatient when waiting for your order and also offer suggestions if you're new. Lastly, the tall brunette lady that walks around (manager) is also very friendly and warm to everyone. In fact, she made my Aeropressed coffee one day! Thank you!

765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2018-07-12,1.0,"What's the value-prop of the coffee shop that is not Starbucks? We're local, we're hipper, you're hipper, you're too smart to give your money and time and physical presence to a corporate monster? Great, all fine, but when not backed up with solid coffee, it's all for naught. 

* Loud music at 6.25am
* I must do my own payment work, typing and tapping and signing on an iPad that spins back and forth
* Et encore, du café absolument éxecrable! Stale. Unforgivable.

I can let all the rest go, the hipper-than-thou attitude, the up-sell, the stupid music... but not the coffee. How hard IS it to make a decent cup of coffee? Why must the grounds be so stale that they are past bitter and well into sour? 

Conclusion: the folks working there, and likely the owners, must not really like coffee themselves. They should go work at Dunkin Donuts."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2017-04-13,4.0,"The job had a special going with Gregory's coffee so I decided to oblige. I've walked past this place weekly for close to 3 years and have never went in since I am kinda loyal to Starbucks. The staff at the counter was super friendly and was more than happy to explain all the matchup of coffees and teas. They also offer various baked goods but lords knows I love a good iced chai latte but this time I decided to get it ""dirty"". A dirty chai has a shot of espresso and hit the spot for my afternoon pickup. The small but well decorated coffee shop is great for coffee dates and offline meetings. I will be sure to make this my new coffee spot, just wished there were more locations throughout the five boros."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2017-11-29,5.0,"Background:
Basically a better Starbucks that can be found in any part of Manhattan with offices nearby.

The good:
-Lots of baked goods, freshly baked/made. At the end of the day (after 5 or 6pm I think) they offer 50% off to get rid of the leftovers.
-Many vegan, non-dairy, and gluten free options--best selection of the coffee shops scattered around midtown, in my opinion. The vegan and GF items are now clearly marked in the display case with green labels (but not all are vegan AND GF so read the text).
-Vegan treats include: cranberry coconut scone, lemon poppy seed pound cake, energy bites (most of them, get the choco buckwheat or pb banana!), and vegan bar (get this!).
-Calories/dietary restrictions on the food labels and full nutritional information online.
-Reasonable prices for the area.
-Nice workers.
-Free wifi.
-They're on LevelUp and they also have their own app. $5 credit for your first trip + spend $50 and get a $5 credit.

The bad:
-Sometimes things are out of stock, especially toward the end of the day.
-The Gregory's Coffee locations are all very different, so one location may be bright and spacious, while another is cramped.
-A true coffee shop that closes early, so if you want to catch up on work in the evening you'll have to head elsewhere.

Recommend?
Yes! One of the only midtown Manhattan chains I really like."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2018-04-21,5.0,"All my trips o NY and I see this coffee shop everywhere, but never tried it. My sister ended up going and we are now hooked. Their dirty chai with almond milk is amazing. You can taste the tea and the espresso, but if all blends in so well together. We went back to try the turmeric latte and have no regrets, it has just the right kick of ginger, and the mix of milk and honey is just right. I recommend it!

Also, part of the experience was the barista. I appreciated that he confirmed my order before making it because I realized my order wasn't entirely right."
765,gregorys-coffee-new-york-12,2018-04-17,4.0,"Latte was great. I love thick foam and they got it right without my asking. The actual coffee was boldish but smooth and didn't have a bitter aftertaste. The ambiance is pretty good for a cafe, ample seating, easy but on trend music that isn't blasting so you can hear yourself. And they have outlets. And free WiFi. I love the decor as it's a bit dreamy but dark and has pops of colour. It really reflects NYC even though it is in midtown and is a bit corporate. I'd rate it 8/10."

766,pret-a-manger-new-york-37,2019-12-27,5.0,"While walking through NYC we wanted to grab something easy and quick, but also wanted to sit down and enjoy our food.  We came across Pret A Manger and it was a convenient ""grab and go"" or ""grab and sit"" place.

I got a turkey sandwich, some chips and a soda. We sat down in a very casual setting and enjoyed our food while taking a break from the city.  I have to say that for something that was made in advance it was a great sandwich loaded with turkey and avocado!  I really enjoyed it!  They also had these santa sugar cookies that were pre packed and they were just as good!  

So if you are looking for something simple, easy and quick - try this place.  The prices are not bad and you get a good quality meal on the go.  BTW - we wanted to go back again after some site seeing but didn't make it before they closed.  They close at 11 pm (or at least the location we went to).  I figured in NYC they would have been open later - but I cannot dock a star because of that :)"

766,pret-a-manger-new-york-37,2018-10-07,2.0,"Eh...

Their display case of sandwiches was pretty picked over, lots of empty areas. I selected a sandwich, $8.50 (with tax) seemed a little high for a pre-made boxed sandwich, but whatever. The sandwich was decent, nothing remarkable. But in the end, not really worth the price. 

The service was underwhelming. There was one person behind the counter. She was preparing a coffee for someone else and tried to ring me up as she was still making the coffee. She told me my total and immediately turned around to keep making coffee. I paid with my card and the machine said ""approved,"" which my only indication the transaction was complete. The cashier never acknowledged my payment, or asked if I wanted a receipt. While I appreciate she was trying to keep the line moving, some sort of offer for a receipt, or even a ""thank you"" as she turned back to make coffee would have been appreciated.

My only other experience with Pret was in the UK. So I had some expectations based on my excellent experiences there. Maybe it was too much. But this Pret was way below expectations."

Don't get me wrong, the croissant was warm and flaky, but the inside was still half cooked dough :/ I didn't have a chance to go back and tell them, but maybe they should cook the croissants a little more. 
I hope today's croissant was just a fluke because I love grabbing breakfast at pret and I really like their food."

766,pret-a-manger-new-york-37,2017-05-23,1.0,"Update:
This location has gone downhill in past 6 months. 

Understood it's hard to keep up with the morning rush- but very frequently, if not daily all non decaf coffee is tapped/empty. Someone had to begrudgingly go tell the staff... the coffee is out.

Tip to the staff, brew twice as much and have someone monitoring it until at least 9. 

It's happen too many times for it to be a rarity. 



Always busy, good coffee. 
Grab a cup and pour your own.. then go pay. 

I haven't tried any food, but have enjoyed the multiple cups of Joe I get here."
766,pret-a-manger-new-york-37,2013-09-13,5.0,"Pret - how I love thee!

When I lived in England, I frequented Pret so much they knew me by name. At one location, they would even save a Swedish Meatball sub for me in back (they flew off the shelves at lunch like mad), but I digress.

This is the only Pret in the states where I felt (almost) right at home. I didn't try the New York Meatball sub for fear of it not living up to my British-trained tastebuds' expectations, but everything else I tried was fabulous.

I've tasted their miso soup, salmon and quinoa pot, wild salmon salad, a blueberry muffin, pain au chocolat, cappuccino, oatmeal, and several fruit cups. In one word: YUM.

The only thing disappointing was the cappuccino, but I remember them being less than stellar across the pond, too. It just tasted bland and more latte-ish; a cappuccino should still have some kick.

This place is busy and gets pretty dirty -- they'd have to be hovering over the tables to clean them as frequently as is necessary -- but it's well worth popping into just go grab something good for your belly and your soul. :)

Freshly-made every day + all remnants are donated. Pret rocks!"

When I worked in midtown, I came to this location almost every day for a coffee and croissant. The staff does try to be friendly (their motto), but most of the time they are talking and laughing with each other and the line to the registers is getting longer and longer. The employees at this Pret need to be more organized. This is a busy location so lots of people are in and out during the day. At lunch it's almost impossible to get a table. I've noticed that when I do happen to find one, the tables are not always clean and some of the staff is standing around and chatting. 

A good option here is to get take out and just eat at the office."

Despite the staff screaming at us every morning that there are separate lines for each register creating an every man for himself cutthroat environment, I still went.  I ate breakfast and lunch there most days.  Alexandra makes the best cappuccino, the manager is friendly and most of the team knows I'm a regular.  This morning apparently, they decided to change up their ""every register has a separate line routine"" and when I went to an open register to pay, a customer accused me of cutting (even though he was in a different line) and the attendant insisted I had cut as well.  I left the outmeal on the counter and walked to the nearest Starbucks.  And with that, my $15/ day Pret habit is over.  Thanks so much, 39th St Pret!

766,pret-a-manger-new-york-37,2014-06-18,5.0,"Um why have I never gone to a Pret before now???  
The first time I went to this particular location, I got a small Italian Wedding soup.  Besides them being out of bread rolls to go with the soup (and the cashier didn't offer an apology about that) the soup was really good.  It didn't taste greasy and the flavor was just right, not too salty.  I like that the food is FRESH.  They are constantly bringing out freshly made items during the lunch rush.  I've gone into Europa on the next block at breakfast time and seen their lunch sandwiches sitting there all morning, who's to say if they haven't been sitting there since the previous day.

Anyways, back to Pret.  The separate lines for each register is a little stressful, I always feel someone's skipping me.  But the food is really delicious.  I had a Falafel and Red Pepper hot wrap the other day, heaven in my mouth!  Today I had a half Roast Beef, Arugula, Parmesan baguette.  The baguette didn't break my teeth (HUGE plus) and the roast beef was moist."

If you're in the city, then you are bound to run into a pret. They are everywhere, which makes it convenient when you want to grab a quick bite to eat. I really enjoy their warm wraps and I especially like that they make their food fresh every day. Organic coffee too!

I've been to other pret locations and the employees are always so welcoming and nice and courteous. I know they are probably tired of being SO nice, but they do a good job hiding their tiredness! Which I really appreciate. I came to this Broadway and 39th location once, and that will be my last time as well. I came in wanting some tomato soup. Since I never tried their soups before, I wasn't familiar with their selection. Their tomato soup is called 'tomato and feta.' Maybe it didn't occur to me during that time that tomato and feta = tomato soup! So I asked an employee at the register ""Do you have anymore tomato soup?"" She was shocked that they were out and proceeded to ask another employee if they have anymore tomato soup. Then this employee goes over to their soups, points at tomato and feta, and says to me ""No miss, you're just blind."" I was utterly shocked and froze for a little bit, trying to process what he said to me and did he REALLY just say that to a paying customer? AND THEN he laughs in my face, with his other coworkers joining in soon after. Yes, I was being laughed at and humiliated in front of other paying customers because i had a question.

I am NEVER coming to this pret again."

766,pret-a-manger-new-york-37,2012-12-29,5.0,"Very tasty sandwiches and soups, all with calories posted and many reasonable for those watching what they eat. This is a regular lunch spot for me.

Fairly clean for a lunch place (especially given how busy they are), the staff stay busy and (amazingly) stay very friendly every time I've been there.

Their food is organic, made fresh (it's pre-made, but nothing's from the previous day and the quality doesn't suffer), and the menu changes occasionally. They have separate bins for trash, recycling, and compost.

It's quick (the name is French for ""ready to eat"") and they have plenty of checkout lines during the lunch rush. It's not as cheap as Subway, but worlds better in every other respect, and still not bad for lunch. If you come in the middle of lunch, though, you do have to wait for a table/seat to open up.

They say they have wifi, and even print the password on the receipt, but I've never gotten it to work, and when I ask, they say they don't have it."

They ignore you - will run around and laugh and joke around with all the other co-workers. While this is happening, the lines are never in order because the cashiers are never paying attention to handling the lines. This causes people to cut and makes it unfair to people who have been waiting. Some of the cashiers are very polite, but others have been rude on many occasions. It's just chaos. The food is good of course. That's not the issue. Also - the light roast coffee is ALWAYS empty - and this is around 9/9:30 AM."

I can sit here all day and tell you how much we love the staff at this store and the way they treat me and my brother but you would get bored. 

I would first like to start with the smile I receive from every single staff when I walk into Pret A Manger first thing in the morning, they all great me with warm and cheerful smiles with a joyous ""good morning"" which wakes me up better then your light roast coffee! Besides for the welcoming feeling I get when I walk in, they would instantly recognize I am a usual and have my drink ready before I even get to the cashier which makes me and my brother extremely happy! If any of the staff would realize that I am not feeling well or in a bad mood they would instantly make me smile but asking me whats wrong and asking if I need any help, which I love!

I would specifically like to talk about these two specific employees that work at this Pret which is Darell and Sasha. Those two employees are the best employees I have ever met in my life! They are the main reason I come to this Pret every morning with my older brother! They would make me laugh every second I see them from joking around about my coffee and by having my coffee ready without even noticing. On top of that Darell would make the coffee perfect every single time! Me and my brother like complicated drinks for instance we get a double shot espresso over ice with a hint of hazelnut and just the foam of skim milk. If any starbucks barista heard this they would instantly get confused. But Darell would get the drink right every single time which I love!! To show the love they give me and my brother, one day I walked in sick and Sasha right away realized I was sick. Instead of making me a coffee she insisted I would drink a peppermint tea with lemon and honey. She made this tea for me and I am convinced that this tea made me feel much better throughout the day.

This specific Pret is the best Pret I have EVER visited in my whole life!! Besides for it being the BEST Pret, it is the best coffee shop I have ever been to in my life. From the joyous and friendly employees to the magnificent food and coffee! I recommend this Pret and every Pret to all of my friends, family and co workers! I would love to give a BIG thank you to the whole staff at the 39th and Broadway Pret, and I can not forget about Sasha and Darell the BEST Employees I have ever met!!

I decided Pret would work just fine....  I just got an iced coffee with caramel and an almond croissant.  The croissant was good, I enjoyed it.  The coffee though, reminded me vaguely of some medicine I had to take when I was sick as a child mixed with sterile bandages.  Literally there was no resemblance to coffee flavor.  I've had better tasting coffee from cheap motel rooms.  I could not finish it.  Also, they have ONE single outlet in the seating area, and its behind the trash, so you have to pull the trash away from the wall to get to it, and have to sit right next to it.  That is some seriously poor eatery setup.  

I'd passed Prets everywhere in the city and always thought they looked nice and wanted to try it, but from now on I'll walk the extra blocks in the rain without an umbrella and opt for a Starbucks.  Plus it is way overpriced for what you get."
766,pret-a-manger-new-york-37,2013-10-20,2.0,"Pret is one of my favorite quick lunch options in the city. The food is always fresh and there are a lot of delicious options to chose from. That being said, I was very disappointed with my most recent visit to the Pret location on Broadway and 39th Street. I picked up a cup of the Mexican chicken soup with cheddar, tomatoes, corn, and peppers. When I checked out and asked for the bread that comes with the soup, the employee at the counter said they were out. This was surprising since the restaurant would still be open for another five hours before the six pm Sunday closing time. When I asked if there were any other bread options he said no without any apology. I felt slightly cheated since the small cup of soup sans bread was almost $6. Once I opened up my cup and ate it, I was truly disappointed. Although the taste was nice, there was hardly anything in my serving aside from broth. I left the restaurant feeling ripped off and still hungry."
766,pret-a-manger-new-york-37,2013-04-30,3.0,Over the years working in the area I pretty much go to Pret every morning for a cup of organic coffee.  I mean literally every morning.  So if the light roast is off I know about it.  Our office moved 2 blocks over and I've been going to this Pret since it is the closest.  The organic coffee has been reliably good and the ladies and gents have been friendly every morning.  The sandwiches have been fine and crossaints very good.  I feel the baguettes could have more stuff inside.  Yesterday morning I stuck to bagel and cream cheese exactly because of that reason.  It just doesn't justify paying more and I don't even eat bagels.  One rare afternoon I came in for cup of coffee and temperature was not hot enough.  Don't like warm coffee it needs to be hot.  That was enough for me to head to Starbucks if I need an afternoon jolt.
766,pret-a-manger-new-york-37,2013-06-07,1.0,"Went a couple of Saturdays ago to get oatmeal.  Brought my coffee in from another Pret that had no oatmeal and the guy charged me for the coffee.  When I told him I brought it from another Pret, he begrudgingly deducted it.  Went to get OJ as I was leaving and he charged me AGAIN for the coffee.  This is the same guy from 10 minutes ago.  Again he deducted it but needed to tell me ""If you put it on the counter, I'm going to charge you for it.""  All this with body language that couldn't have possibly have been more condescending.  Wrote to Pret - NO RESPONSE.  So much for customer service.  Never going back."
767,dunkin-new-york-119,2019-09-05,4.0,"This might be the most efficient Dunkin' in NYC. Located right outside the 23rd Street Station / PATH train it is easy for this location to fail in providing quick service during the morning and evening rush. I can almost always bank on coming here without mobile ordering and being in and out in under 3-5 minutes which is practically unheard of at any of the other local coffee shops & chains.

In addition, the staff is typically always really friendly and I love how hands on the manager is when things are busy in the morning. They keep things well stocked and they also have a freezer with some Baskin Robbins cake and ice cream if you are need of any of those products. My biggest con is that it tends to get pretty messy at the sugar/straw station and the tables often have garbage on it from people who didn't clean up after themselves. Wish it was kept cleaner but otherwise, a well-run DD!"

767,dunkin-new-york-119,2019-11-10,2.0,"I work overnight. When I come in at 11:30pm the one employee always greets me with a smile and is very friendly and efficient. When he is not working his co-worker usually ignores me as he sweeps and yells at the homeless man to get out. I have stood at the counter for up to 5 minutes waiting for him to put the broom down and come take my order. When he does show up he has an attitude.  I'm really writing this review because the I only thing open during the night are bodegas. I HATE Bodega coffee. It ALWAYS taste burnt and old. So I wait all night for dunkin to open up at 5:00am. That's what it says on BOTH of the doors at this location and the one on 7th. So I plan my break just right. With just enough time to get there and get back within a reasonable time. EVERY SINGLE TIME I GO THEY ARE STILL CLOSED. I am not talking about at exactly 5:00am I talking 5:15 am, 5:20am, 5:30am! It is always the same lady employee and she is NEVER nice. There has been multiple time where I have wasted my entire break waiting for them to open. Then I walk to the one on 7th and THEY ARE CLOSED TOO! AT 5:40AM!! My thing is, open whenever you want it's your establishment. Who am I to Say when you open and close? But don't have 5:00am on the door AND online. I understand that it is just coffee but if you have ever worked overnight you would get the fact that I depend on that last cup to get me the last couple of hours of my shift. 

I arrived at this location a week or so ago at 5:20am. The door was open but the lights were off. I could see her in the back doing dishes. So I walked in and I said ""hey, are you open?"" 
I didn't get a response because she probably didn't hear me. So I waited. Then when she came up front I politely asked her again ""Excuse me, the door was open are you guys open?"" 
She got pretty upset and started mumbling that the lights are off and she has to still put away the donuts. I said ""Miss, that's why I asked you. If you had said, ""No, I am not ready"" I would have tried to go elsewhere."" 
She took my order but she wasn't happy about it. It was now 5:40am. I asked her ""what time do you guys open because it says 5:00am on the door""
She said, ""Yeah, but we have to put away donuts!"" 

I have worked in the restaraunts for 16 years. Bartending, serving, cooking. This isn't my profession anymore but I still totally understand. Probably more than the next guy. But I don't like how she blames setting up as an excuse to open late. If you open at 5 you need to be there early enough to set up and open at the time it says on both the door and online. Or change your opening time."
767,dunkin-new-york-119,2019-09-09,1.0,"place smells musty as hell, like a crowded MTA bus on a scorching hot day.

Meanwhile there was a young man sitting at a table who had ordered nothing ,and was fooling around on his phone.This is America,such scenes are very disturbing...I wont return to this location again"
767,dunkin-new-york-119,2015-09-19,1.0,"Never coming here again. Ever!

I walk in and may I say the restaurant is extremely clean and has enough seating for about 10-15. Everything is kept neat and tidy. 

I order a combo of my usual. Cream cheese bagel with jelly and a coffee. I told him I wanted the coffee with a lot of cream and sugar. He gives it to me super hot with probably two sugars. 

I wait for my bagel. The employee completing my order was rather young. He worked fast too, even cut my bagel in half for me. He saw me waiting after he handed me my bagel and asked if I needed anything else. I said, ""Yes, a cup of cream."" He repeated what I said and I nodded. 

The employee working the beverage section was off laughing and joking with the manager by the cash register. 

The very nice young employee called him over and said what I wanted. He then asked me again as if the other person didn't already tell him five seconds ago. -.- geez. 

I told him again that I wanted a cup of cream so perhaps hearing it from me it would be believable that a customer could request this. He said, ""No, we no have."" I repeated what he said in confusion and he told me that he had milk instead and would give it to me but I had to purchase it. I said, ""My coffee is too hot, all I need is some milk."" The bagel making employee told him to just give me a small cup of the milk and he looked and laughed at him. 

The manager then came over and asked what the problem was right when I was handed my cup of cream not milk.... Ok, I thought they didn't have any. 

The manager jokes about the bagel making employee being ""The Boss"" for handling the situation so well and the employee shakes his head ""no"" in embarrassment. 
 

I walked away and right when I pull out the seat the manager and beverage employee continue to laugh and as I sit down I hear one of them call out to me, ""Sweetie"". That was extremely unprofessional. 

As I write this review, the same beverage employee is changing the garbage bag closest to me. I hear the other employee call the manager ""boss"". 

This was an extremely uncomfortable situation and I hope to never come to this location again and avoid the awkwardness. 

If it wasn't for this incident I would of rated the store 5 full stars based on cleanliness and fast ordering. Not to mention the lady who ordered after me only got one order of hash browns when she ordered two and had to get back up from her seat and ask for another. I'm sure my incident got the employee worried and caused him to be unsure of himself and miss the order. 

The food was perfectly fine but I wish my experience would of been better. Sucks."
767,dunkin-new-york-119,2017-03-02,1.0,I bought the Angus Steak bagel and the steak was only half the size of the bagel. I hate it when they're cheap with the ingredients. What a measly portion of steak. Extremely disappointed.

767,dunkin-new-york-119,2016-10-18,3.0,"I'm always a bit hesitant about dunkin donuts bc whenever I order donuts, they tend to taste stale. I came in on Sunday and order half a dozen donuts and was actually surprised that they were fresh. The coffee also didn't taste old.  

If the layout was less cramped and there weren't homeless people drifting in and out, I'd give them 4 stars."
767,dunkin-new-york-119,2017-08-24,1.0,"Don't bother coming here if you don't want to be late.

Stopped by on my way to work in the morning for a cup of coffee. Stood in front of the register waiting to have my order taken and was ignored by all the workers as they bustled about or chatted away. There was no one else on line behind me but this was not in the middle of the day, this was around 8:40 am. Still rush hour.

After waiting a few minutes, I didn't bother and left. If this Dunkin Donuts isn't interested in doing business, there are plenty of other coffee shops in the area."

767,dunkin-new-york-119,2017-10-10,2.0,"To the general manager: EXTREMELY capable, efficient, and friendly staff. Good job on hiring. HOWEVER, something is off with the iced coffee brewing process. The coffee has a soapy/detergent taste that makes me think something is being overlooked in the cleaning process. Please fix this!"
767,dunkin-new-york-119,2015-05-24,2.0,"I'm so sad to put back my original review as lower stars I put but thought I had to.

I've been constantly visiting this DD store and I really don't know when it happen but the operation system has been changed.
maybe the owner has been charged and all the workers changed.
and what I got, a bad customer service.
casher were so pushy and rude thought.

really sad to say but I really not interested to stop by this store anymore."

Of all the Dunkin' Donuts I've encountered, this location by far is the cleanest with ample seating and courteous counter service from staff.  Condiments as ketchup for the fast food breakfast sandwich are behind the counter where available only to customers by request."

767,dunkin-new-york-119,2013-10-14,1.0,"Worst watered down tasteless iced coffee I have ever had of all the DD I've visited. French vanilla or caramel, you won't be able to tell them apart. WHY? Both tasted tasteless. Worst of all, it has this funky and sour taste to it. After 2-3 sips, I ended up tossing away my iced coffee. That was how bad it was. Just by the appearance of the beverage I could tell it wasn't prepared right but I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Such a waste of a walk there ... time wasted! 

Hopefully your next visit will be better than mine. Yikes."

I usually stop in for breakfast (A big and toasty and a large carmel latte) and have only ever once been disappointed with my coffee. A couple sugar packs fixed it right up.
     The customer service here is great-- if you taste your coffee and are unsatisfied, they will totally make it again for you. Also, though the line gets long in the morning (I go around 8:30) the wait time is really short. I'd recommend this location for sure.

Try a bluberry vanilla latte extra sweet with a blueberry cake donut. Awesome combo."

Almost like he wasn't paying attention to my order. I got an iced coffee and I specifically asked for very very light ice. I had half a cup full of ice.

I usually don't write restaurant reviews but this was to me what sincere customer service is about."

767,dunkin-new-york-119,2013-05-06,3.0,"I mean, Dunkin' Donuts, it is what it is, so not much needs to be stated here. Although, I must note that this is one of the busier locations I've ventured into, especially during the morning rush hour. Not surprising though due to its key location in a bustling part of Chelsea. It's convenient, right by the train station, major banks and stores, etc. While there is a line always forming here, service is rather quick and efficient. They have at least 4 guys manning the register and 2 whipping up the bagels and sandwiches, and they don't move slow. They give you a number for your order and call them out when ready. For a bagel with cream cheese, it should take no more than 5 minutes should there be no more than 5 people ahead of you. The coffee is the same DD coffee as every other location. I feel their coffee is less on the boiling hot/burn your tongue side though, so it's safe to drink right away. There's a good amount of seating available, and they are usually unoccupied. The supply of their donuts and bagel varieties stay ample throughout the morning. All in all, this location is less than perfect mainly because it's chaotic and hectic during rush hours. It's certainly doesn't help to be indecisive."
767,dunkin-new-york-119,2013-09-17,1.0,"Stopped by here recently to pick-up some donuts.  There were no lines when I walked in so I walked up to the counter.  The lady behind the counter (Yesenia) asked me what I wanted and I told her I wasn't ready yet.  I looked for a few more seconds (SECONDS) and she asked again so I started naming off what I wanted.  After the 3rd one she was like ""Oh just how many ARE you getting?""  I thought that was pretty rude of her, but proceeded to order some munchkins as well.  I followed the signs above the register that said ""Order Here"" and then I walked over to the ""Pick Up Here"" after I paid.  Well waiting there another lady asks ""Are you the munchkins girl?""  I nodded and she goes ""Well if's on the counter over there.""  This store is just full of rude and bitter employees."

It's usually busy but i rarely wait in line for more than 3 seconds if that. Some of the employees know what most customers are getting , but always ask first. The manager I think narendra( I think that's his name) greats all the morning customers and is very organized and moves quickly. I recently left my book there , and the next day the manager found it and gave it to me the minute he saw me. It's cool that everyone here is kind . They are very kind to the blind as they usually come out and help them place their order. Another thing I notice is they work well as a team and I wouldn't of known who the manager is if I didn't look at my receipt . It seems like everyone contributes to the team."
767,dunkin-new-york-119,2012-06-07,5.0,"I saw the kindest thing there this morning and it brought tears to my eyes. A blind person came in and one of the people behind the country greeted him out on the floor and took his order. He led him to a seat and bought him back his order and change. I frequent this store a lot and their products are DD level, fresh and good. You expect that from location and brand. But I find their staff and manager kind. I've seen little things over time that prove it to me."
767,dunkin-new-york-119,2013-05-24,1.0,"My only complaint about this site is that in order to keep the line moving, you have to order twice, once to the person making the coffee, and then to the cashier. Secondly, as young peiople are wont to do, they do not listen when you place your order. I ask for caramel latte large with milk, hot and very very sweet.  What do i get? an iced latte.
Then, when i complain, all of a sudden the hot milk machine is out of order.  Curious, no?"

The staff always greets me with a smile - even when it's slammed - and at this point they've memorized my order so it's usually ready before I even get to the register!

It's not a place I would want to sit down and do work but it was great for an espresso (3.5$).  It was served with a glass of sparkling water which tasted a little flat in my opinion. The coffee had a rich and bold flavor. 

As noted in another review, there are a handful of small round tables and a standing area around the window. The benches in front of the round tables are quite close to the table so it's hard to feel comfortable. Glad I stopped by but I don't feel the need to return given the thousands of other coffee shops in the city."
768,ninth-street-espresso-new-york-10,2018-04-01,3.0,"I liked their coffee fine, but I cannot call myself a fan (i.e., 4 stars) for a couple of reasons. First, their seats are not very comfortable. They have tiny round tables with ""benches,"" which remind me of a hotel lobby. There's also a counter by the window, which is cool, but there are no stools. Finally, there are no electric outlets near any of the tables or the counter. If you want to read or get some work done while you're drinking coffee, I don't think this is a great place. Also, if you do not like ""acidy"" coffee, you may not like this place.

Unfortunately, I'm not that big of a fan of the coffee. I ordered a drip coffee and it tasted a bit burnt/over-roasted, so nothing to rave about really. 

Looks like it would an okay place to meet up with a friend, but I'd probably get a pastry next time and pass on the coffee."

The atmosphere and interiors felt a little sterile like it had only just opened or ransacked of personality. I guess it felt like a modern take on traditional Italian espresso bar without the cafe artwork or the hoards of Italian men play chess. 

My Americano was good. A nutty bold flavour that I probably ruined with half and half. Ninth St. is definitely worth a try but not a must visit in my book."

But bluestone honestly just makes good coffee. In the colder months I just opt for our lattes and cappuccinos which always come out strong and smooth. Never any burnt milk with bubbles floating in the cup like some coffee shops do.  

Their customer service cannot be topped, but one day I find out for sure if all the employees have been to Aussie accent school."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-10-17,5.0,"Thank the stars for Bluestone Lane. I was so happy to find this little coffee house in the middle of the city that had some incredible gluten free goodies in addition to amazing coffee. The pictures on Yelp of their gf avocado toast sold me! They have a whole bunch of toast varieties, but I went with the basic avocado (with added prosciutto). It was made to order and was so delicious. Thick, crunchy toast that actually had flavor and good texture, despite being gluten free. There was a ton of fresh avocado smashed on top, sprinkled with salt, pepper, and I believe a little chili powder and lemon juice. It was bright and fresh and went perfectly with the salty prosciutto, which they didn't skimp on.

The staff was nice and speedy. I loved the atmosphere -- really bright and light with lots of blues. A great spot for pictures! And they had a ton of gluten free baked goods in their display case -- cookies and muffins and more. I regret not buying any of them..."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-01-02,4.0,"So we were looking for dairy free options and yes the place popped on Yelp.

I wish we could substitute cream cheese for avocado spread. You would think it's not a big deal to do for a person who can't have dairy but we had to pay extra $4 for avocado. We are tourists but my friend who lives in NY said it was expected. We also paid for oat milk oh Lord. Pay for everything!

Granted it was amazing!!! 
We could visually estimate a whole avocado on top of this sandwich so that was a relieve. And everything was super fresh. It was boxed and beautifully presented to us. Coffee was amazing! Probably the best we've tried in NY so far. My husband got prosciutto and loved it as well. 

If not the price we would have definitely given the business 5 Stars."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2020-01-01,5.0,"Interior at this location is a quaint quiet spot which fortunately didn't not have a wait (new years day morning). We had the salmon toast, the almond oatmeal, and the breakfast bowl! All were exceptionally savory and full of flavor. Coffee is delicious as well as the motcha latte"
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2020-03-12,2.0,"I come here on occasion. Service is prompt and can be friendly. However, the baristas sometimes give too much attitude over the smallest things. I wish they would stop complicating the drinks.  I placed an order for a macchiato today.  The menu clearly states how it is prepared. Barista made a point of asking me which style I wanted, and when I asked why an explanation was needed, he gave me attitude, and started slamming everything around. After he finished making the drink, then he slammed the cup down as if the whole thing was a big deal. I just ignored him.  Taking off a few stars as a result.  Additionally, the coffee is not consistent. Sometimes it is very tart and bitter, and other times it is great. I'm not sure if they use a different blend on occasion or what, but I like consistency in the flavor profile."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-08-22,2.0,Absolutely ridiculously overpriced. For a coffee the size of an espresso shot. They don't keep salt and pepper out on the table or the coffee bar. It was not an enjoyable experience for me . I had to get up twice ... once to ask for a fork and knife. Second time to get salt and pepper. Not worth it
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-03-31,4.0,"Cute, crowded and obviously popular. My teenage daughter wanted trendy avocado toast during our NYC trip. It did not disappoint. A little heavy on the red pepper flakes, but very good."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-06-20,5.0,"Yes yes... ALL. THE. YES!!!! 

Finding Gluten Free breakfast is usually a challenge and then layer in GF bread that actually has a taste... this place did NOT disappoint! Thank YOU Bluestone Lane for setting the bar so extremely high with your avacado and HBE tosas AND the salmon toast. Hubster and I split the 2 and thoroughly enjoyed sipping on our almond lattes... a work of art Btw.. 

Can't wait to enjoy another cup of your maverick blend joe tomorrow! Xoxo from Minnepapolis"
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-08-16,4.0,Cute coffee shop with plenty seats inside. Latte was amazing! My beet latte was good as well--it's not sweet and it tastes kinda plain. The toast was just so so..but bad but pretty ordinary.
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2020-01-04,5.0,"Just had a delicious meal to go at this place. The young woman I believe her name was Emily couldn't of been more gracious. There was a long line in their system went down but she handled everything with a smile as did her young male coworker. The gluten-free cinnamon toast and also the gluten-free toast with Gotha and strawberries was absolutely delectable! Chai tea latte, fresh pressed juice is, golden latte, everything kind of been better but the best thing was the nice service."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-08-05,4.0,"This location used to be in the same glass building as the Steinway Hall (piano store), but due to construction Bluestone Lane was relocated right across the street. I think the coffee shop is slightly larger and has more seating. I had the tropical seltzer drink - it was great for a hot summer day. You can get $5 coupon if you install Bluestone Lane app and set up an account."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2018-06-08,4.0,"Came by Bluestone Lane again to give it another shot - trying one of their lunch/brunch items - the avocado smash with smoked salmon.

The lunches are prepared to order and placed in these cute bluestone lane boxes that slide out. You can also grab a bag if you're planning on taking it to go and eating it at your office.

The toast looked tiny at first, but is surprisingly filling. Likely due to the toast being a bit on the thicker side (1-1.5 cm thick) to be able to hold the heavy avocado spread without breaking. The toast itself is nice and crisp on the outside and soft, warm and crunchy (from the various oats in it) inside. The dish has a slight hint of citrusy sourness, likely a squirt of lemon on top of the salmon maybe? The addition of some crushed red peppers gives it a nice pop of flavor and depth on top of the black pepper and salt flavoring on the avocado. Wouldn't mind coming back again for this whenever I'm craving a healthier meal option nearby for lunch!

Matcha latte: I personally wouldn't order this again, not because it's bad, but because there are so many better options nearby of better quality. The matcha latte here is made via adding the matcha powder straight to cold milk, and going into the steamer. It comes out with a slight sweetness likely due to the natural sweetness of steamed milk, so no need to add syrup. Not bitter at all and at least it's not clumpy and powdery. However, it doesn't have a very strong matcha flavor to it. As a true matcha lover, I'd go elsewhere (and prefer the matcha to be made with a chasen in hot water, then added to the milk separately, or have the milk poured over). Also, when thinking about a latte, I always appreciate a bit of effort in terms of latte art with the milk pour over, but that's missing given the way it's prepared here.

Seating is plentiful in the public space right outside this location. It's great to have some shade during lunchtime on a not-so-hot summer day (with a breeze).

The employees are very nice and welcoming as well, and the cafe wasn't crowded at all at 12pm.

The baked goods look like they've undergone changes since I last came - didn't get a chance this time to try any, but they seem like they'd have potential. Let me know if you've ever been here before and your favorite sweet - I'll give it a shot!"
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2018-05-12,3.0,"Extremely small Australian Coffee Cafe not designed for you to linger. Very ideal on a nice NYC day when you can take full advantage of its plaza location and utilize the outdoor seating. Otherwise there are few bar stools with window seating or the option to stand. This is not the mobile office coffee shop of other brands. 

Personally not a coffee drinker myself and this was just a meeting place, however their menu didn't offer many alternatives for people like me. Which isn't bad, hey it's a coffee company I wasn't expecting Rosé. I did notice they do offer some variety in snack and small bite options."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2018-11-23,3.0,"Had to write an updated review as this isn't a five star experience anymore. I do fear that for all their success and rapid expansion Bluestone may struggle to maintain quality standards at all their locations. 

This one is small and extremely busy at peak times. The staff are all working hard but it isn't the greatest experience because it full, hectic and claustrophobic during the rush. I don't think that can be helped but it's a downside of their popularity. I pretty much don't get coffee here for this reason, and generally prefer City of Saints across the street. I do however come here for avocado toast if I'm sans breakfast (my office is in the same building). The last few times I got avocado toast the bread was not even toasted properly e.g. cooked on one side, or almost still raw. It has also been sloppily made in comparison to how they used to do it.

As the wait time has also increased I decided to order a coffee from here last time, as I didn't have time to go to City of Saints as well. It was also a disappointment and the oat milk not hot enough. I'm glad they're here but a bit of a dip in quality and not my favorite location. I hope they tighten it up - overall I'm a huge fan of this business."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-12-30,2.0,"While I have been to other Bluestone Lane locations, this one was not the best.  I came about two hours before closing time and it seemed like they were about to close.  My friend and I both ordered cappuccinos which were very good and wanted to have a pastry as well.  Everything was pretty much gone, but what was left looked old and dry.   We did try a cookie which was overpriced for being so hard and not really flavorful. This coffee shop is a great concept but not worth the price for this quality."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2018-02-20,3.0,"Cute coffee shop. Lighting is so nice and perfect for pictures. From the inside there were several side stools thats perfect for a quick snack and people watching. There are also few tables outside. I've only tried their gluten free banana bread ($4) and smoked salmon toast ($9). Both were just average. 

The banana bread did not have a strong banana flavor which is what I prefer and it was slightly greasy (not moist) in a way I can't describe. 

The smoked salmon toast came in a really cute box which is convenient for stay or to-go. My first impression was how SMALL the toast was. It came on a medium sized toast with a thin spread of cream cheese and a thin slice on salmon. Good balance but I'm not entirely sure if the taste made up for the steep price either. 

I'm willing to give other things on the menu a try next time."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-08-04,5.0,"Good place for a quick breakfast..prices for both coffee and food  are pretty reasonable! I got the almond oatmeal which I had eaten to quickly to take a photo. I also got a cold brew (very smooth) and a  almond butter&banana toast. Service was quick considering the foot traffic in there. I appreciate minimal plastic use as well :) I can't speak for the other locations in the city, but I'd IMAGINE them to be just as good!"
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-05-28,3.0,"I work right by Bluestone, so I am frequent visitor. The coffee is pretty standardly priced (read: expensive but on par for the neighborhood), but the coffee is very inconsistent in quality. Sometimes I get a drink and it's the best thing I've ever tasted and sometimes, like today, my coffee is undrinkable. Not sure if it's a difference in barista or roast or what, but it's a bummer to pay $6 for a latte only to have to pour it down the drain because it's so bitter. 

That being said, the staff is friendly and quick. The vibe of the shop is pleasant and it's beautiful inside. I love every playlist they're playing in there, and I've had some truly great experiences with drinks (oat milk dirty chai is my ""treat yo self"" beverage) and food (those hot cross buns!! amazing!!!). I just wish the drinks were more consistent in quality."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-03-11,4.0,"It's a great place to grab a quick bite for breakfast! The avocado toast had red pepper flakes and various other toppings which made it flavorful. The coffee also tasted great and gave me that much needed caffeine boost in the morning. I take off a star because the toast was really hard and tough to chew. However, it's a solid choice if you want some substance! I also really enjoyed the packaging of the products. It was very satisfying to open up and reveal the food inside and the royal blue is pleasing to the eye."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2017-12-16,4.0,"Cute and bright coffee spot right on the plaza of the Grace Building. It's always packed during the workweek, but the service manages to remain friendly. That's the way to do things around here. 

The Golden Latte is always smooth and frothy, giving me the much needed jolt to tackle the 2nd half of the workday. The Flat White is also full and creamy, though in winter months I prefer the Golden Latte's extra boost of immune fighting turmeric. They also offer an array of Doughnut Plant selections. The carrot cake donut is perfect with a nice frothy latte. They also have avocado toast, which I may try next as a light lunch option.

There's ample seating right outside the Grace Building as the inside can get tight rather quickly. But that's because nearly everything is done so well."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2018-08-01,4.0,"I always pass the area and have never seen bluestone, it's a little hidden. I stumbled across it on yelp and thought i had to try it! I order ""the lot"" avocado toast which was to die for! They were very generous with the avocado and other toppings. The only down side is it is a little pricey. You end up paying for add ons which increases the price. 

The location has indoor bar seating and seating outside. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The presentation of the food was was also great! I will definitely stop by here again!"
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2018-12-30,1.0,"It's 11am and the cashier said we can only order one toast because they ran out of containers.  She was short and curt about it, but allowed the people behind us to order anyway.  She and the barista were talking about not having containers for food service and she said that ""its the manager's problem"".

The cappuccino was actually pretty good so I asked the barista about the roast level of the coffee he used, medium or dark as I wanted to buy a bag of beans.  His answer was ""it's an espresso blend"" with a condescending attitude.  I didn't get the bag as I was just so turned off.

I work in NYC so I'm used to city service but this was just bad."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2017-07-11,5.0,"My favorite guilty pleasure is avocado toast.  When I saw Ingrid Nilsen recommended Bluestone Lane on her YouTube video,  I bookmarked this place.

I ordered the avocado toast with feta cheese and baby tomatoes.  For $10,  it's very expensive for one toast; however,  it's a very filling meal.

I also love their cold brew.  It's strong and potent. They don't water it down with ice.  

The cashiers/baristas are always friendly when I go there.  One time,  I ordered a large hot coffee and the cashier teased me by asking me ""are you sure?  It's really humid outside.""  Hence,  I changed my order to ice coffee.

I love this place!"
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2018-11-09,3.0,"Bluestone always serves solid drinks. However  I don't go as often because their pastry selection has been lacking. They keep pushing this bakery called Husk, which is kinda dry. I personally preferred when they used the bakery King Street because their bundt cakes and mini loaves are so moist and flavorful. This morning when I went to this Bluestone in particular I saw a familiar pastry - the carrot bundt cake from King Street. I asked them what bakery did all the pastries come from and they kept saying Husk. It wasn't until I asked about the bundt cake that a lady towards the back spoke up and said the bundt cakes were from King Street. 

Shout out to her for speaking up. Bluestone, please get a larger variety of King Street like you used to have, your customers will thank you."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-04-11,3.0,"People rave about the coffee here but I was here a week ago and it was quite bitter. Even after dumping in sweetener, the coffee had this horrible burned taste to it. I've never had worse coffee, and that makes me sad because ALL my friends and family swear by the coffee at BL. Maybe it was just a bad day? I dunno.

Anyhow... service was great. It's so chill inside, even when it gets super busy. The guys and gals making the coffee and snacks are really friendly and open to chatting, which I love in any coffee place.

The food was good. We ordered avocado toast and vegemite toast and what I LOVED was that they didn't burn the toast! Too many places burn the toast and you're left needing a chainsaw to cut into the thing.. this was toasted perfectly. Not a fan of the paper waste though. The boxes they put a single slice of toast in, is insane. I get that it's cute and all, but there could be a much better way to present takeout food."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-03-26,5.0,"For this year's International Women's Day, the Bluestone Lane (at 42nd & 6th) provided the HBO NYC office the fuel we needed start our day of celebration. Manager Alexander Rivera was more than accommodating when asked to sponsor this event for Women@HBO. Bluestone Lane was a fantastic partner--providing not only coffee (both hot & iced), but they also provided staff to be on hand at the event and a branded set up completely with succulents. This event truly wouldn't have been such a success without them! We are so grateful that they will also be at Hudson Yards and look forward to doing business with their team again"
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2017-04-24,4.0,"Bluestone Lane is located behind STK and right beside the Grace building in Bryant Park.  The line here in the mornings can get lengthy, but it goes pretty fast.  Aside from coffee, they sell avocado toast (so trendy) and other cafe foods.

I've been here a few times now and it has yet to disappoint.  Some of their stuff is pretty pricey, but not too much more than anywhere like Starbucks or a boutique coffee shop.  I've had their iced coffee and hot coffee and it's always been satisfying.

Service here has always been good as well.

Today, I got one of their ""wellness drinks"" for $5, specifically the beetroot latte with almond milk.  For $5, it was a tiny cup of beet juice and milk.  I think I would rather have beet juice, to be honest.  I'm not sure if the beet was in powder form at some point because I saw the barista stirring it as to mix with hot water and after drinking it, it was kind of gritty towards the bottom. 

I'd stick to the coffee drinks here and not much else - the coffee is solid. 

Great place for a quick afternoon pick-me-up or your daily morning coffee."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2020-02-17,5.0,"Absolutely delicious. Got the salmon toast, cheddar & thyme biscuit, and avocado toast with the lot. Couldn't ask for a better, well priced, hearty, delicious breakfast in NYC."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2020-02-09,4.0,Avocado toast with poached egg was delicious! Wish there was more seating. Good central location too. Bryant Park is nearby and if the weather is good you can get your food to go and eat there. The prosciutto and jam toast was great as well. Definitely recommend.
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-01-08,4.0,"Their iced matcha lattes are always up to par (one of my very favorites), with solid avocado toast, a cool vibe, and nice employees. It's a tight spot, with only minimal seating and limited floor space, but it's worth the squeeze. The wait's always short for your food and drink, so it's no problem if you're in a rush, and you can also  attach to nearby wifi if you want to sit for a while and get some work done."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2018-02-25,4.0,"This location is located inside the Grace building plaza across from the BOA building. They have a huge window, so I love the bright natural lights and bar sitting by the windows. It's a great place for people watching and not always too crowded. 

Of course, their famous avocado toast is amazing with smoked salmon or Proscuitto but I think they're a bit overpriced. Their banana toast is a great alternative for $4 especially when you need some extra protein in your diet. You can't go wrong with their coffee. When you're in a mood for some sweet drinks, try their chai latte. Mm, delicious."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2020-01-06,4.0,"lovely place with good food. i always get their avocado toast with either a poached egg or prosciutto and i love it every single time. the matcha latte is good but not the best ive ever had--boba guys does it better. their matcha latte, the matcha settles a lot at the bottom which is weird so you have to constantly stir it which is difficult due to the fact that their paper straws become very weak and flimsy. i support paper straws but theirs r bad quality and do not last through the whole drink which is disappointing"
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-01-20,5.0,Beautiful location with lots of light and plenty of outdoor sitting. My latte was amazingly delicious and absolutely gorgeous. My husband couldn't say enough good things about his mocha. The foam was silky and smooth. Barista was very friendly and did an amazing job with both drinks.
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2017-01-28,4.0,"This box location is located on Avenue of Americas in a plaza area. I thought the decor was super cute. On days that I crave for a cup of Flat White, I usually come early morning hours so I always miss the crowds. Limited seating on the inside by the windows. 

My favorite things to get here are the Flat White, Cold Brew, Almond Croissant, Cookies like Oatmeal and Matcha Chocolate Chip, and the Avocado Smash. Bluestone Lane's Avocado Smash is always solid with freshly smashed avocado, nicely toasted toast, and red pepper flakes. Great choice for breakfast or for a snack!"
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2018-11-23,5.0,"It's not entirely accurate that this Bluestone is at 1114 Avenue of the Americas, as that's the enormous office building that dominates the area.  It's a small little glass walled spot out in the plaza area that serves up good coffee and tea with smiley service.  Stopped in here to meet a friend for a chat and while there's only room for a few in the inside, if you get there at the right time, you can snag a couple stools."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2017-12-02,4.0,"Perfectly serviceable flat white in midtown. They use my favorite extra hefty full fat milk from Battenkill Creamery, which makes every cup of coffee that much better. The coffee itself seems somewhat light and underdeveloped, though, so in the cup, there's less going on than I like in a premium cup of coffee. A quibble, to be sure, but when you charge the prices they do for an 8 ounce cup of coffee, I'm going to be picky.

If they start roasting a brew that's gotta a little more oomph in the flavor department, I would definitely consider amending to 5 stars. Overall, it's a good (albeit pricey) option in the area."
769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2019-07-19,5.0,Love this place!!!!  Food is amazing. Everything is always cooked perfectly all the times.  Love my avocado toast is delicious.

769,bluestone-lane-new-york-5,2017-11-21,4.0,"Always love stopping in here! So glad they opened up more spaces in Midtown, because previously you could only really go to Williamsburg or Astor Place for their coffee. An Australian café chain, they have a small menu but everything I've had thus far is very good. Love their matcha latte, as well as the golden latte with almond milk - wonderful service, cute aesthetic, and lots of seating outside (potentially shared with Grace Building and STK Midtown? Not sure). Perfect for a midday coffee run if you work in the area, or to meet a friend to chat over coffee."

770,ninos-coffee-and-grill-new-york,2019-09-30,2.0,"Overall ** I really just need to give up on these guys as they just cannot get a simple breakfast sandwich order correct.

For years I walk from Port Authority to my office on the East Side and once a week I like to treat myself to a Bacon, Egg and Cheese sandwich. I rotate different places around so I usually end up here about once or twice a month although less lately for the following reason; they just cannot get the sandwich right.

I order the same thing every time Well Done Bacon Egg and Cheese, salt pepper and ketchup. I have found over the years I have to request the Bacon well done otherwise it's borderline raw.

No matter how I order it or emphasize it they will find a way to screw it up. If I get well done Bacon, they forget the ketchup, if I get the ketchup I get raw bacon. I kid you not, I even started to keep track of them getting it right, they hit on it less than 10% of the time. 

Today they topped themselves, raw bacon, no ketchup and no napkins.

I'll add in that ordering is a chaotic scene as there is  no clear system."
770,ninos-coffee-and-grill-new-york,2019-03-25,5.0,"I'm a huge fan of NY breakfast sandwiches, and NINO'S certainly did not disappoint. After waking up too late for breakfast in our hotel, my search started and ended just a half block away at NINO'S cart. It was actually on the north side of 44th west side of 6 Ave. 

For about $5 you will have a delicious sandwich that will set you up great for your day ahead. Only had to wait a couple minutes for him to make it too. He had many other options as well which judging by how many construction workers were ordering, must also be great. 

Thanks Nino!"

771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2019-01-22,2.0,"For the most popular McDonald's in the tristate, you'd think they'd work quick. Boy is it the opposite. Came here around midnight on a tues and can you believe the service was still slow? There was 4 people ahead of me and it took 7-10mins for the cashier to take their order! All I ordered was a double cheeseburger and even that took five mins. On top of all this annoyance, they had a code on their bathrooms, which I do understand, still annoying though. Code is located on your receipt. 
Anyway, this McDonald's is only good for seating, besides that, mehhh, there's plenty of food options in TS."
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2019-06-24,2.0,"Saturday night - popped in for a quick iced coffee. Nothing quick or clean about this place, so there is a lot of standing around on sticky floors waiting for your order. Then again, it's time square on a Saturday night.

Sunday morning - had breakfast here with the family. Accessible elevator was out of order so we couldn't enjoy our meal upstairs and instead had to eat along the long narrow corridor. It was nice to see that they had an accessible bathroom just for those with special needs though. 

For such a big restaurant in the heart of Time Square, you'd imagine management would do a better job at keeping the place clean."

i will say worse because is super busy in tha lines and it's super busy upstair wen u sit down ppl are watching u eat and staring at u like they are , there is way 2 much talking and noise.

Even tho tha bathroom is clean and upstairs is huge i  would still say tha custom service is not good and is just way 2 busy to by food , as i said wen i used to come here in tha past , i don't eat fake food anymore ."
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2019-04-14,1.0,"This is the most over staffed undermanaged McDonald's I've ever encountered. I popped in here at nearly midnight and the place was over run with staff, but they  were NOT trained. They didn't know how to ring up orders on the machine or even how to pack the meals properly. Very disappointed. Definitely A TOURIST TRAP. The "" Security Guards"" are not actual guards. They are basically licensed to prowl women at their leisure. Only visit here in the DAY TIME If u crave McDonald's."
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2018-09-28,3.0,It's one of the more flashy McDonald's from the outside. It's pretty spacious on the inside. The food and service was pretty much on par with what you would come to expect from any McDonald's. I used their mobile app to order a large iced hazelnut coffee for $1. That was a nice way to pass the time as I waited for the nearby movie theater to open for a matinee show.

Two patties, sizzling hot, between two buns, one of which has--wait for it--sesame seeds! And you'll never guess what they put between the two patties. A third bun!!! (Mic drop) And the lower patty has a melting slice of tangy American cheese. Plus there are onions, pickles and lettuce and this amazing sauce that looks like Russian dressing but tastes like heaven. Hurry in before the secret gets out. This could go big. KFC big."

Gets Rowdy after 11 PM

The last time I was here, restroom access was very tight, and there came a point where women were trying to enter the men's room because their restroom had a long line. I had to forcibly obstruct them as they tried to enter the restroom.

Further, this location is not good at redirecting the destitute, and I was threatened by one while I was here. No one should be at the counter unless it's business related. And no employee, McDonald's or elsewhere, should be pandering to this kind of behavior.

Nearby Transit:
M42 (at 7th Avenue)
Times Square - 42nd St  are closest at Broadway
M104 terminates about 40 yards away from here
M20 stops on 7th Avenue, about 30 yards away from here"
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2019-03-04,5.0,"For me, this McDonald's is legendary! It's in the heart of the word-Times Square. It is huge, with 3 levels of seating. There are bathrooms on every level. There are floor to ceiling windows which give you a great view of 42nd street where all the exciting action is taking place-street magicians, hundreds of merry people walking in streams, cute shops and beautiful lights. The lines are a bit long, but it's so fun to have a meal here! They sometimes have promo deals, my favorite is always the Big Mac and fries. I usually have a nice cup of coffee and chocolate chip cookies here, before I head out to see a movie. They keep it clean and the cashiers are sweet. Stop by this McDonald's if your in town!"
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2019-07-09,1.0,"This McDonalds location in particular is one that I know a lot about since I'm a former employee.  Before working here I had heard of the many horrors and abuse towards animals that McDonald's was responsible for as a company, but I was able to see firsthand what the outcome of these actions were.  If the standards for hygiene are not maintained for people, imagine how they would be for animals?  I know that it's just a quick and cheap place to grab a bite, but please consider your own health as well as the millions of animals suffering.  The chickens being raised for your consumption are slaughtered starting at a mere 7 weeks old.  Before they get to see the sun or experience any act of kindness, they're thrown into dark sheds with thousands of others.  Because of how quickly they are forced to grow, they suffer immensely from leg injuries and heart attacks.  Every breath they take is painful due to the ammonia in the air from their own waste, which is never cleaned.  These are just some of the many facts being hidden from you so that you continue to purchase meals from McDonald's.  Just because you don't see these things happening doesn't mean that it's nonexistent.  McDonald's needs to have higher standards for themselves and commit to better welfare policies.  Until then, there are so many other cheap and delicious places to eat in NYC!

771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2017-10-05,4.0,"Sure I enjoyed the chicken McNuggets and fries I had here, but the atmosphere is why I walked an extra two blocks to come here over another McDs. The dark backstage ambiance and the broadway style lights made for an interesting mix up of the usual McDonald's feel."
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2018-08-11,1.0,"This was the worst fast food experience I've ever had in North America. 
I ordered a simple order of two McMuffins and a small orange juice. I waited for a good ten minutes or so, before realizing that my order number had disappeared from the ""in progress"" and ""being served"" lists being shown on their screens. When I explained this to the lady who took my order, however, she told me ""not to worry about it."" 

About another ten minutes later, the same woman--having noticed that several people who ordered after me had already received their orders-- finally handed me my mcmuffins. I began to ask her ""what happened and why did my order take so long?"" But before I could even finish my sentence, she immediately lashes out at me with: ""Don't give me attitude! Look! you almost forgot your orange juice because you've got this fucking attitude! You see? That's what happens when you give me attitude, and now I'm giving YOU attitude!""

I was absolutely baffled. I am a paying customer, expecting reasonable service; so, why would shouldn't it be okay for me to inquire as to what went wrong with my order? How on earth, in that context, is it okay for the employee to be upset with me? Who does this McDonald's employee think she is, giving ME attitude after some sort of fuck-up (which I still don't know as to how it happened) on THEIR part?"
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2017-10-07,3.0,"Your pretty standard McDonald's with above average menu prices probably because it's located in the heart of the times square tourist area. You really can't miss this place with it's flashing lights above the entrance. 

The place is pretty big - there's seating on 3 floors. The bathrooms on the first floor aren't the cleanest (but what can you expect with such high foot traffic?) The bathroom on the 3rd floor was great! It was clean and there was no line probably because so few people know about it (and I probably just attra Icted people who are reading this review now haha). 

Customer service is ok - the workers joke around too much in the back rather than pay attention to the customers. I've been waiting on line and they just kept chatting away.

Overall I'd give it a 2.5/3 stars. It's pretty w tty dark overall and not bright like most McDonald's and it's not exactly the best place to go if you're in a hurry because of the tourists. Early morning during breakfast 9/10am is fine though."

As usual, this location is always busy with tourists and locals all mixed in one, but I was able to order and get my food very quickly. They have a really good system going so even though it's crowded, you don't have to wait too long for your food. 

The only thing I didn't like was the strange odor that was by the seating area. It was really bad and made me lose my appetite. I tried to keep walking down to see if it might be in just one area, but nope! The smell went through the whole back area where people were sitting and eating. I left and went back to my office. Aside from the smell, I was in and out and the staff was surprisingly very pleasant!"

This past Sunday, I unfortunately left my bag on my seat upstairs after eating. I came back to the store at midnight but the workers and manager could not locate my bag. I was positive I left my bag at this McDonald's so I went back to ask it again the next morning. This time, I was lucky to find worker MARIA P. She told me she had found my bag and put it downstairs, so she went to speak to the workers and instructed them on where to search. Considering my bag is North Face and expensive, plus contained things like my iPhone7 plus accessory, it was relaxing to find everything in its place and nothing missing. I appreciate rewarded Maria P. Honestly and helpfulness."
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2016-02-07,1.0,"Ok, so it's a McDonalds, which means that the food is pretty much McDs universal, but I am reviewing about something else, my Happy Meal aficionados, and that is the horrid cesspool that is this establishment's restroom. 

Now, I don't mind having to make a purchase to get the secret code to let me into the restroom, but what I can't stand is the wretched stench of stale urine and other bodily specialties.. Gag!!! Seriously, I've had to use toilets from India to Kenya and this is just about as bad as it gets. Most McDondalds regularly send someone to clean their restrooms, and to further add to my shock and disappointment, this McDonalds is seen as one of the top ten in the world....I'm pretty sure that must be for design and not cleanliness...The clown would not be proud."
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2017-11-13,3.0,This is like the McDonald's where you can see tourists from around the world line up to place order and then eat while conversing in their native language. The line can be ridiculously long and unorganized. They have seating area on the 2nd floor of which is closed after 11pm. Lots of flat screen TVs for you to watch random music videos while you munch on your food. Spot some people fell asleep on the chair or reading newspaper without buying anything. Oh well.
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2017-02-10,4.0,"Just want to drop a note, the hospitality/customer service I got was amazing, definitely not what I was expecting from a McDonald. 

The Staff was opening the door for me to go in and out, the cashier who took my order was extremely polite, directing m to stand on the side to wait for my order, recognizing me and handing me my order with a smile, wished me an enjoyable meal and great day etc. These might be standard hospitality, but I surely have never gotten it from a McDonald.

Anyway, great job!"
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2018-06-17,1.0,"Spent 10 minutes getting to the front of the line, expected as it was busy,  then spent another 10 minutes waiting at the till.

The street food was very good."

I had a frustrating experience today, however. I ordered from the pick 2 menu and rushed out of the store to catch my movie, only to find out that they did not give me two orders of fries!! How do you not double check orders before giving them out to your customers?? I understand that I also had some sort of responsibility to check, but I just feel like this is very unprofessional. No matter how busy of a chain you are, you shouldn't make these careless mistakes. That's $4 I won't get back. By the time I realized I was already in the theater and couldn't go back."

771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2018-07-23,4.0,Cool place. Three floors kinda slow ordering and normal food. Good for lunch.  Eat here.
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2018-07-12,1.0,I had a really bad experience here. All their registers were broken and it took 30 minutes to get my food. McDonald's just isn't worth it if you have to wait that long for such low quality food.
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2017-04-09,2.0,McDonald's on Times Square. Kinda disgusting but then again it's hard to keep a Times Square establishment on Times Square clean.

I specially thought it would be at an extremely popular one like this TimesSquare one.

771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2014-10-27,3.0,"This McDonald's is the McDonald's of all McDonald's. If there were a flagship store on 5th, this would be it. It's this massive conglomeration of lights and grease. 

There's a takeout window for speedy service. And an amorphous crowd (line-less usually) that's looking at the menu / waiting in line / waiting for food in front of the counter of (I want to say) 5 cashiers.

Service is surprisingly speedy, given the foot traffic at this location. There's also plenty of seating. The seating is rather interesting: three-level-tiered, window wall view of TImes Square (or really, the building across from McD's). 

My one complaint is their lack of Spicy McChicken. When I asked, she claimed they had it. When I took my first bite... I knew it was Buffalo Chicken. Putting buffalo sauce on a McChicken does not make it a Spicy McChicken! A Spicy McChicken is spicy chicken with mayo! This peeved me."

Be careful to step over the dejected looking tourists who decided to give up on life and sit on the stairs leading to the upper level. And try to ignore the weeping going on in the ladies room stall. I wouldn't be surprised if all that luggage in the stall with her are all her worldly possessions. 

Then as you force down the horrible new Bacon Clubhouse Burger, try to allow Beyoncé singing ""surfbort"" lift your spirits. No? Yeah... it's just too sad in here."

Mins! Everyone was pushing and screaming. And it didn't help that the people who called the numbers whispered. After maybe an hour of ordering (2 Large Fries an Coke and milkshake) me and my father sat down in a dirty area (because they close the top after 11) and then we ate and left.

It is an awful skeevy place with a manager that literally has 1 tooth in his head, a security detail for the bathroom, toilet tissue that hangs on a string in the filthy bathroom and for all the security they employ, no locks on the stalls...go figure.

There is a white and black dude that guard the bathroom and you must show a receipt of purchase to use their filthy rest room. The white dude has four teeth that are crooked, broken and yellow.  The Black guy is highly abrasive and though in a food establishment, has on filthy clothing and threadbare shoes. This place represents the very worst of New York City, the underbelly, if you will."

On a weekday morning, there is only one cashier, despite the volume of people coming into the location. The cashier (my receipts say ""KS"") could care less about getting your order correct.  There are various people behind the counter wandering around, talking to each other, but not working.  The line to wait for your order is long, and customers frequently find that their orders are incomplete or just plain wrong.  I saw a management person trying to repair the latte machine, so broken equipment is a problem here as well. The restaurant itself is in an old movie theater. It's dark. It's dirty.  This is a great location and McDonalds could brighten the interior to make it more inviting, but it's pretty clear no one cares here. They will continue to get business being right in Times Square, but anyone who works at one of the nearby hotels or tourist sites in this area KNOWS this place is a dive (I talked with them).  I went to this location several times during my recent business trip since it was near my hotel.  It was awful every time."
771,mcdonalds-new-york-124,2013-03-29,4.0,"I normally don't write touristy reviews, however this McDonald's just screams over the top and not in a tacky lame way but in a way that actually fits in with its Broadway theater neighbors. 

The first thing you will notice is the huge McDonald marquee with thousands of individual bulbs lighting up the New York City street, you could actually notice a difference in the temperature when standing under them. 

Next the multi-level inside was decorate in a movie/Broadway theme, very fun. Tables had their own televisions which were showing classic movie clips. Food is your typical McDonald's fare, however when I had visited they offered the McDonald Holes which were great I really wish that those would have taken off and been made available nationwide. 

Any ways to summarize if you are visiting this is probably worth a stop, even if it is just to browse or order something like a light snack or desert, and to people watch. You never know what you will see in New York."

I opted for a Salad with Grilled Teriyaki Chicken, Cucumber, Mushroom, Seaweed Salad, Steamed Veggie, Black Bean, Cherry Tomato, Bell Pepper, Salsa, Teriyaki Sauce, Thai Sauce.

Given the ingredients, I either thought the majority would pre-cooked or the whole thing would be stir-fried or something. But no...giant raw mushrooms, raw peppers, etc. Perhaps, given the growth of places like Dig Inn, Roti Mediterranean, Semson, Minigrow, etc., my pre-conceived notion of ""bowl"" food is a bit warped - but this was not labeled 'build your own salad'. Even at that, the sauces were given on the side - so no help with the dressing then.

While the quality of the ingredients seemed fine, it was more or less a flavorless meal and a very underwhelming experience."

The sushi selection is value priced, while the quality is superb. Delicious and fresh, I couldn't believe my luck in finding this place. The sushi selection is also very large, so you can mix up your choices and try many different sushi variations.

I just returned to Manhattan last week for 10 days for work again, and was happy to be able to enjoy their sushi again. The selection goes beyond fresh sushi, such as fresh hot soup, Poke bowls, sandwiches, etc. I met a friend there for lunch one day who said it was too early for sushi, so instead he enjoyed a fresh deli sandwich. He remarked it's very rare to find such great prices for food in Manhattan. The Cibo Midtown is a shining gem in Manhattan and is truly a ""don't miss!"" stop if you are in the area."

I dont know if they went out of beef and broccoli or didn't have it for the day. I have to get shrimp instead of beef.  The cashier dropped my sauces on the floor when he handed me the food, and he just kind of ignored it. Did not even think of replacing them for me. When I got back to the office, then I realized, my order is missing 1 of the 4 sides. I guess they ran out or didn't have for the day again. NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!"

No napkins set out for customers. Grabbed an energy bar to hold me over if I get hungry later and it cost $4.00. Way overpriced. Weird, cheesy 80s music playing. 

This place would be fine for somebody who needs a quick bite like I did but is more interested in ""taking nourishment"" fast than actually enjoying a meal."

The only thing I've ever been disappointed by was their Pad Thai, but I see that as my fault for ordering Pad Thai at a deli :). If you're looking for a quick bite, a snack, or take-out, it's the perfect spot. I'd vouch for this place time and again, but I don't have to because my entire office already eats here regularly."

Every-single-time I have gotten something from here, I leave annoyed and disappointed for one reason or another. Overall, the prices are too high. A salad here is $10 and 1-2 blocks in either direction the same sized salad would be $2-3 cheaper. When the salad guy rushes you through selecting ingredients, he barely gives you anything...even their cherry tomatoes are cut in half to save them money. There are not many vegan options and the ones that they do offer are overpriced. I really try not to come here unless I have to because of the proximity.

The staff is friendly, the food is great, and the service is fast.

5 stars, I love the Cibo"
772,the-cibo-new-york,2018-07-04,3.0,I've tried many things on the menu from salads to sandwiches.  the bahn mi sandwiches were large but not a traditional bahn mi flavors. I wouldnt go for it again.
772,the-cibo-new-york,2018-01-30,1.0,"I had ordered poke bowls from Cibo on previous occasions, but the last time I did so was very extremely disappointed in the quality.  Even with sesame ginger sauce as a topping, everything was tasteless and seemed unusually slimy, in particular, the white rice and the raw salmon.  As a matter of fact, to avoid upset, I ended up throwing much of the contents away.

Furthermore, I had initially wanted brown rice for the base.   However, the person who put my bowl together sniffed the rice, when the spoon he had dipped into the large container/pot smelled ""off"" to him.  This is a very unsanitary practice on the one hand, and the rice should have been fresher during lunchtime on a Monday on the other hand.

In the past I had looked forward to getting poke bowls from Cibo.  If today's meal is a sign that the quality has been degraded to such an extent, then I doubt I shall be doing so in the future."
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-04-06,5.0,Super clean n friendly - awesome lunch spot~We tried their taco bowl n teriyaki beef sammie....loved all the flavors! We were totally full when we got done~I'll have to try some of their bowls when I come back cuz their spicy pork bowl looked really good~! Glad I found another lunch spot!
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-07-18,2.0,"I ordered a poke bowl from here via Ritual and could not have been more underwhelmed. The portion was not very big nor were they generous with some of the ingredients. The taste was mediocre and there's not much to be said about the presentation either. The two staff members I had encountered seemed like they just wanted the day to be over - definitely not friendly or service-oriented.

In short, there's much better value and service to be had elsewhere."
772,the-cibo-new-york,2018-08-16,5.0,Had a slamming tuna poke bowl for lunch.. definitely suggest this place for healthy options outside of what I got. They have a healthy smoothie stand !
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-05-13,5.0,"Place just recently opened and
it's one of very clean and modern and fancy deli in my lunch area. It's in the garment district.

They have a lot of countless menus including the most fresh asian/hawaiian fusion bowls. Like poke or sashimi salad...

Especially, I want to recommend the salmon salad(I'm not sure this is exact name of that dish.. I will update picture and price)

And the Udon series are good, too.
I think they making their fresh soup daily with own receipe.

And for the Togo order, they packing in the nice fancy paper box. It differ from other delis. It looks very clean and eco-friendly.

The amount of food seems a lot, and price is reasonable.

The manager said they offer the catering service as well. I will try soon for coming office meeting.."
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-09-20,1.0,"I ordered the veggie panini today, which was described on the menu as having marinated eggplant with grilled zucchini and mozzarella with balsamic. After I receive it and pay for it, I open it up to put hot sauce on it, and there was broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower with mozzarella on it instead. It looked completely unappetizing, and not to mention not anything like how it was described on the menu.

I brought it back to them and said this is not anything like how their menu describes it, to which the man rolled his eyes and said ""I guess you will have to just eat something else then"". I ordered a different sandwich, and he told his coworker ""I guess we'll just give this one to a homeless person or something"" and pointed to the old sandwich.

I have been here at least ten other times before and have gotten delicious egg sandwiches, but this experience today was enough for me to decide I will never be back."
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-11-19,4.0,"Lunched here on a Tuesday. Very clean space, fast pace set up. I got a tuna poke it was fresh and yummy"
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-11-19,5.0,Cibo is one of my go to places for lunch. They offer a wide selection from poke bowls to sandwiches. I usually order my food on seamless for pickup and it's available on time exactly the way I ordered it. The poke bowls are very fresh and satisfying.
772,the-cibo-new-york,2018-04-04,1.0,"Work on the block and go there fairly regularly to the point they knew my breakfast order. Refused to make ""breakfast"" eggs on avocado toast after 11am (it was 11:05 and the day before I ordered the same thing from the same guy at 11:30am and got it with no problem) but they have a featured Texas Burger with an egg on it that they serve all day. I'll gladly walk another couple blocks to anywhere that makes eggs that wants to take my money, but out of spite I'm going to go there at 10:55 every day for a week and order very specific egg preparations each day. One day I might even go in after 11 and order a Texas Burger, hold the bun & burger, sub toast and smashed avocado."
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-04-24,4.0,This is for the review of Mealpal. I reserved spicy salmon bowl today for Mealpal lunch. The potion is much bigger than other Mealpal lunches. At first I was a little bit disappointed because I didn't see any salmon. then I found there are plenty salmon cubes under all the salad. It was tasty and similar with other poke bowls which would cost around $12. So I will definitely try out other food there.
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-04-03,5.0,"Wow!! They have a live sushi bar and serve fresh sushi rolls and nigiri sushi!  Very fresh and yummy. 
It's quite impressive!
They are going to have this bar for all next week so you should stop by and try those fresh rolls. 
They have a very good selections of breakfast and pokebowls for lunch. It's hard to find fresh and healthy lunch under $10."
772,the-cibo-new-york,2018-07-06,5.0,I tried Cibo today and was really impressed with the healthy selection and very reasonable price.  I tried the avocado toast.  It was fresh and packed with protein.  Next time I'd like to try the build your own bowl.
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-05-31,1.0,"Got the tuna melt special lunch, the sweet potato fries were undercooked and raw so I had to throw them out. Then the menu didn't say there was bacon on the sandwich. Which by the time I got back to the office to eat it had cooled to the cheese so I just had to throw the whole meal out (I can't eat bacon). Wasted $8.50."
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-06-07,5.0,"Conveniently located in the garment district. It clearly shows its cleanness and fresh decor with its grand opening. The staff members were extremely friendly and welcoming. The Cibo offers variety in their eclectic menu. Whatever your hungry belly desires, their menu ranges from Japanese to Mexican. Check this place out!!! I highly recommend and you won't be disappointed."
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-04-18,2.0,"This place is just okay to me. I actually liked the Mustang Cafe, or Deli (whatever it was called) and was hoping The Cibo was going to be a good replacement since it took over the space. The menu has many options so I'd venture to say that most people can find something they want here. The service... man, the service. Super slow. One guy was in charge of the entire middle section while there were 2 cashiers, a restless manager who was pacing more than anything, and 2 people working the salad bar. Had someone else been helping with the sandwiches and hot other foods, I would definitely be giving this place a better review."
772,the-cibo-new-york,2018-05-04,5.0,"We've had them deliver a group breakfast to the order a few times, and each time has been great! Very freash, egg/ bacon wrap is always a big hit."
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-11-24,1.0,Not good. Period. With so much great food in Manhattan don't waste your time here. Such a waste! Seems as if someone out zero care into the menu... I ordered a sandwich and the items in the sandwich were not even the same as in the menu. Employees don't seem to care. Go someplace else! Plenty of other amazing option..... heck even the 0.99cent pizza places are better!
772,the-cibo-new-york,2017-06-05,5.0,This place is great for lunchtime takeout. Their poke bowls are fresh and reasonably priced. Amazing mango and tuna.
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2020-01-29,4.0,"as i make my way to work i notice another dunkin donuts (plenty in manhattan ) and i decided to treat my slacker workers to a dozen of donuts and hot coffee. nothing fancy here as its a typical dd with donuts , hot and cold bevs and the rest of the dd offerings . some seating inside and free wifi but line is moving slow and no available seat around so i better just order my dz of donuts and bounce. The location is 33rd St off 5th Ave in a busy area of midtown Manhattan so if you come during the morning work rush be prepared to wait a while .overall I am giving 4 STARS as the place is clean and donuts were still fresh when I got to work ."
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2019-07-06,2.0,"I came here a little after 2 PM and ordered myself a cappuccino for $2 with the specific instructions of less ice and less sugar. When I received my drink, not only was it almost completely milk and tasted very weakly of coffee, but it had too much ice and all of the sugar was sitting at the bottom. I ended up eating a bunch of sugar chunks, which was not pleasant. 

The nice thing about this Dunkin is that there is seating and I did not have to wait a long time. There are also charging outlets by the tables. However, I would have been more content if the workers would put more effort into their work, as in following the instructions that are requested by customers, and if they would have been more friendly."
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2019-04-09,3.0,"I am a rare customer of Dunkin Donuts, first time for the last two years, but I tried a delicious cinnabon roll a while before which was fantastic so I decided to have another one in this place.

Cinnabon roll in this location was nothing in comparison to what I tried before. Either it was not fresh or the cashier overheated it in the oven but it was hard, dry and nothing fresh, soft and creamy as it should be. One big disappointment:("
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2019-06-26,4.0,Pretty clean and small location. The only drawback was the wait which took about ten minutes plus having to repeat myself several times that i wanted to get an iced tea lemonade not a refrozen lemonade. Anyway people here were pretty nice and I saw a guy cleaning over and over again so no biggie. Four stars for Dunkin.
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2018-10-30,1.0,"Incompetent staff, they consistently got customers orders wrong and took 10 minutes to make coffee with milk and sugar.

I recommend the Starbucks 1 block away"
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2019-08-31,3.0,Our orders took a long time almost finish my iced coffee before I got my salary they need help
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2019-07-22,1.0,Horrible service. The female worker began rearranging all the donuts from bin to bin and more concerned about the display than taking my coffee orders. She then rubbed her eye boogies and continued to touch the donuts while arranging. My friend & i were going to leave since she never even acknowledged us as we were waiting several minutes while she attended to the donut display. She finally made my coffee and touched my coffee lid which i was disgusted by. i will never return here again
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2017-07-02,5.0,This has been my go to Dunkin for about a year and a half now as I work across the street at the Empire State Building. They are extremely efficient despite their crowds. My On-The-Go orders are always waiting for me in about 2 minutes after I order and the staff has always been helpful and friendly. I think this location if a bit less hectic that the 31st Street and 5th Avenue location given it is not on an Avenue and seems to be visited by many of the workers in the area as opposed to the 5th Avenue tourists. I highly recommend this location.
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2018-05-06,1.0,It's past 7 am right now and this location is still not open when it's supposed to be open at 6. No signs not even a piece of paper explaining why. Not only inconvenient but also shows how management here doesn't even care about the customers. Will not be back!!
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2015-12-09,4.0,Much improvement since they opened and now I've become a regular and they remember what my usual is. Too bad they don't offer the bagel twists anymore at this location. They did have it at a queens location though.
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2014-05-22,3.0,"Clean, super friendly staff & theyre quick.

As usual if youre getting a bagel--ask to toast it twice, they never toast it enough."

I don't normally review chain locations but this is a good one!!!"
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2017-06-21,4.0,"With probably a few hundred coffee options in NYC, this is my go-to spot for its convenience to my office and customer service. The staff there is always incredibly welcoming despite the occasion influx of commuters just trying to get to work on time. And who else loves the new summer cups? Makes me think I'm sitting on the beach soaking up some rays, instead of suffering in the heat of cement city."
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2016-09-29,2.0,"Worst DD that I have visited ever : ( They ran out of the hot chocolate in the early afternoon but they still accepted our order only then told us that the hot chocolate was not available. We switched to the smoothies but one associate clearly didn't know how to how to operate the machine because it took her at least 10 minutes to fanatically push the button, change bowls and another associate finally came to the rescue. I love the DD hot chocolate but did't have the chance to taste the NY DD hot chocolate even I am in one of the DD locations. : ("
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2015-03-30,5.0,"This dunkin is right near my job so it's quick and easy for me to get to before work or while I'm running out for lunch. 

Being that it is so centrally located at a tourist spot and is always busy, I would say their service is great. The location is clean, they are always stocked & best of all the staff is friendly and accommodating. 

Yes, there is usually a line but I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes if my order will be taken correctly and my food will be given to me in a quick time frame. 

I give this location 5 stars because across the board- service, effectiveness, friendliness, accommodating & fast paced they score well. 

This is my go to dunkin when I'm at work."
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2017-02-27,3.0,"For most days, They are ok. This location appears to have problems during the morning rush. I mostly order via my mobile app. Within the last few weeks, several mistakes were made. I received hot coffee when my receipt said iced. Friday I received a large when I ordered a medium (thank you!!) Today I received the large instead of medium, but I also received whole milk instead of skim. Not the first time they are trying to hurry only to give me an incorrect drink, which then leads to them getting backed up since they have to re-make the drink. I am sure I am not the only one. If you not in a hurry, use this location, and double check your drink."
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2016-02-15,3.0,Your typical Dunkin Donuts in Manhattan. Kept reasonably clean. Service was quick and the food was hot when served. Enough seats for the people who need to sit and eat quick.
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2017-07-30,4.0,The Dunkin' Donuts with good service and the coffee quality was good.  Coffee wasn't too water down and actually taste like coffee which is a good thing for Dunkin' Donuts. We also had the turkey sausage flatbread sandwiches which were very good. And my kids had donuts.  Good experience and I'd come back.
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2015-12-14,5.0,"The service at this location is impeccable! They are the reason I am writing this review. The coffee and food are on par with most Dunkin' Donuts stores, but the service is what makes this location so superb. Its a very busy location and even under all that pressure this team of employees are quick and efficient. I started coming more regularly and the staff started to recognize me and my order. I am usually in a rush so I appreciate the time that they have saved me in the morning."
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2018-07-13,1.0,"Manika I typically come to this Dunkin' Donuts whenever I'm on my lunch break, and every time that I go to a Dunkin' Donuts, I order a vanilla bean iced coffee (i.e. an iced coffee with the vanilla bean coolata flavoring). I have never had an issue ordering this in four years and multiple states I've ordered at, even after explaining what I mean to the employee on duty. For whatever reason, the employee on duty, Manika, who apparently also happens to be the manager for the day, refused to make this for me, stating that she would not serve me unless I ordered something that was explicitly on the menu (e.g. vanilla or mocha iced coffee). It is not a difficult task. It's the same process as making an iced coffee but just adding a different kind of sweetening syrup that is advertised as being associated with a coolata. What is more is that she refused to answer my questions when asking her to repeat herself and instead gave me an annoyed look until I finished the POS process for my order. As stated previously, this has never been an issue except for this one employee, and as a so-called manager, this behavior and body language is unacceptable to any guest that walks in. Also, as I am writing this review, she is attempting to usher me out of the establishment. Unacceptable."

773,dunkin-new-york-151,2015-05-17,4.0,Typical dunkin donuts. The location is convenient especially since it's right across the street from my job. It's nice to have a dunkin in the city so close compared to having like three Starbucks on the same block. The service at this location is good. They are friendly and move quickly.
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2015-03-06,4.0,"It's a Dunkin' Donuts, OK? It seems well-run. I work nearby, come to this location a lot, the staff is pleasant enough and they haven't messed anything up. If you like Dunkin' Donuts coffee go here, otherwise that other coffee chain has at least two locations within two blocks of here."
773,dunkin-new-york-151,2015-08-08,2.0,"The server was laughing at me when I used the DD free drink reward. Also, the free rewards I earned is only limited to regular coffee.  Those guys there are not friendly. The girls are better and much polite to the customers."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2020-05-07,3.0,"This Starbucks was right across the street from our hotel in Times Square. This was actually the last weekend of Jan. The store was busy, but not too busy to have waited so long for coffee and hot breakfast. Just ordered a pike, americano, and a sous vide egg bites. 

Our order times were split. Coffees were 5min apart from one another. And food was 5min later. By then there was no one else waiting for their order except for us. 

Luckily we weren't in a rush. Seems like they either didn't get out order done it someone else grabbed it. So they still had to make it."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2020-02-19,4.0,"Okay, we all know Times Square is a busy area but this Starbucks deserves some credit. There is almost always a line. The bakery and refrigerated section are always well stocked. In my opinion, they have the most extensive coffee and merchandise selection than any other Starbucks in the city. If you're looking for a special gift or a specific mug, chances are this Starbucks is gonna have it and have more than one. With that being said, this is a grab and go location so don't plan on enjoying your drink there."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2019-03-14,3.0,"Don't sneer at me for reviewing Starbucks. Otherwise it's Sneerbucks.

This is the smaller of the three Starbucks that I've been to In Times Square but is the most notable because it has neon lights (and I'm not talking about Demi Lovato) as the sign which is pretty cool and unusual - in fact it's the only one I've seen like that."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2019-02-07,1.0,"I went in yesterday to get my latest favorite drink, a salted cream cold foam cold brew. I normally go to the other Starbuck's across from my work because obviously, it's more convenient. Unfortunately, my place was out of my drink. I know now to just order something else and avoid this Starbuck's.

Walking in you notice that the store is fairly clean. Music is playing and not too many people waiting for drinks. I ordered my drink and another for a friend. The nest thing that you notice is that the people working behind the counter are extremely loud talking to each other. 

I was getting really annoyed actually because I was looking at my two drink cups and they were not making them. I waited patiently as I listen to them screaming at each other in a playful manner. (I hope it was playful). But I was getting upset because I was on a break and didn't have time to listen to them shout back and forth.

The girl behind the counter says ""are you waiting for something?"" I then pointed to my drink cups and she said ok.

Very long story short: I had to have her remake the drink twice because I guy jumped in to make my drink and made it all kinds of wrong. 

I will definitely make sure that I do not go back to this location. If I want to listen to screaming and get bad coffee I'll go to a nasty coffee shop. At least then they might make my drink faster and undoubtedly it would be better."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2019-07-15,2.0,"I'm not one to review a Starbucks, unless it is extremely good or extremely bad. There isn't much variance between one in Texas to one in Virginia; same menu, same ambiance, etc. However, this Starbucks just stood out as being below the standard. Extremely long lines, but with staff that wasn't able to accommodate them. Usually during a rush, the line will be long, but will move efficiently. Here, the line was painfully slow, and the staff had no sense of urgency. Once I finally got my drink, it was poorly made. Wrong milk (good thing I'm not allergic to dairy milk, but when you pay the extra price for coconut milk, I'd like to get it), and the bitterness of the concentrated chai syrup was evident. 
Drink got the job done, but not an enjoyable experience"
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-11-02,4.0,"So Starbucks unveiled its Halloween themed drink the Witch's Brew Frappuccino on Oct. 25 and has the drink in stores until Halloween day. The bright purple Frappuccino drink is made of toad's breath, bat warts and lizard scales. ....

Well not really.... lol

The ingredients include an orange flavored, purple colored powder for the drink's flavor and color, chia seeds as the bat warts and green sugar as the lizard scales dusted on top of the whipped cream.  

It's purple but tastes like oranges... 
Sort of like an orange creamsicle. The chia seeds gave it a nice crunch. I love holiday themed drinks so I gave it a 8 out of 10. Not too sweet but light & creamy. The downside to the Times Square location is the homeless people sleeping inside. I wanted to sit down as I waited for my Broadway show to start but had to stand outside because there was no room. It's just unacceptable for paying customers."

The staff has always been patient and kind. The line can be long depending on the time of day you go, but I try to use mobile order."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2019-01-06,3.0,"This is arguably the most busy Starbucks in New York City. It's location right in the heart of Times Square causes heavy traffic at all times of the day. They do not have a bathroom and barely have anywhere to sit or stand. They are usually in stock of everything but I guess they get rid of seasonal things quicker than other places? I came here on a Sunday night wanting a cranberry Bliss bar. It's only six days into January and they said that was a seasonal thing and they no longer have it. However, the Starbucks about five blocks north did have the bliss bar so I'm not sure what the problem was.
Anyway there's nothing special about this Starbucks. If you can wait and walk a couple more blocks, I would suggest that in order to avoid the long lines and cramped space."

774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-10-21,4.0,Great location in Times Square. The entire menu is available. Baked goods look fresh. Staff is friendly but could move faster. Hot chocolate and hot tea are great options during the colder
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2017-10-12,2.0,"Having a Times Square/Broadway location, it is understandable that this particular Starbucks is incredibly busy. I only stopped by for a wake me up cup of coffee. The line was of course super long and as slow as the proverbial flow of molasses in January. This, however, was not for lack of efficiency on the part of the staff. The cause was that every office in the area seemed to have sent a ""go-for"" (I felt so sorry for the ""go-fors"") to make or pick up and bring back some really huge take outs for their offices. 

After having had two cups of coffee, I needed to use the men's room. The restrooms were understandably not just labeled for ""customers only"" but also had combination lock which was a problem. Not only did I have to stand in the long slow line again to speak to a clerk in order to get the combination, but then the number I was given was incorrect. Ugh! So, I was forced to go through the entire long slow line procedure all over again then put up with the delays of the staff figuring out or finding out who had or knew the correct combination number."

But this location is great for your morning mobile orders. I can order from the train station and by my two block walk there, my order is ready for pick up. Just give the guy at the mobile order section your and he'll keep a lookout on it for you. But I did wait especially long once for my order because the staff probably misheard my name and didn't give it to me when it was already ready. He saw that I was standing there for over 10 minutes and didn't bother to check up when it was obvious that I was waiting over the average time for my drink. Plus, he had shifted the the drinks around so it was hard for anyone else to read the names on the cups."

It was like an inconvenience to them to accommodate me as a customer. Like this is what you do. Never in my life have I been to a Starbucks so rude and I am not one to review all like that especially Starbucks but this gets a one star if I could none. My drink was terrible by the end of how many times I tried to explain it over and over again to things that were so simple like LIGHT CREAM AND XTRA ICE. I threw it away and took a loss. I'll stick with my Starbucks from Ohio that is charming and sweet everyday. Stay away from this Starbucks in Times Square these people are rude and don't tell them to adjust anything they will feel like you are a bother.
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2016-12-08,4.0,"Directly in the middle of one of the most famous places on earth Times Square is a Starbucks.
The store is always crowded, But the line moves very fast as there are many baristas walking very hard.
The cashiers were very fast and friendly and I got my drink very fast.
The drink was made perfectly and I was very satisfied.
It is not the biggest of stores and there is not as much seating as there should be, But dont let that deter you from going."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2019-12-28,1.0,"From the moment we walked it it was chaos. The barista taking our order wasn't paying attention and had to be asked to repeat the order numerous times. While waiting, we witnessed rude customer service/interactions by one of the other baristas, Jayquan.  He was overbearing, obnoxious and lacking skill to say the least. The worst Starbucks in Manhattan/Times Square. A disappointing experience."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2019-06-18,5.0,This Starbucks is off da hook! All the employees are chill and make it fun to come here!!!
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2017-11-19,5.0,"This popped up at the perfect location at the perfect time
No line
I was in a rush
Go that chestnut praline latte 
It was amazing 
The croissant was gross 

Anyway the girls were sweet 
God bless em, for dealing with the wackos that go in there daily"
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2016-07-11,5.0,"What a convenience! This SB location is right in the middle of Times Square. The majestic lighting of many of the billboards can be seen from within this store. The billboard I liked the most was the one most clearly seen across from here: the American flag.
For being on Times Square, this place only had a moderate wait time. The line was no longer than the SB lines I've been in back in LA. The service was efficient, and the barista was super friendly (which is one NY stereotype shattered).
I bought an iced tea and a protein snack box. I happily stood by the glass panel wall, looking out into the street as I ate my snack and sipped on my drink. 
After I was done, I ventured out to explore what this part of NYC had to offer.
I'm thankful for the excellent service here, five stars all the way!"
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2019-03-31,1.0,"Stood in line from 6:07 to 6:22 just to get a coffee. Line out the door with employees behind counter on phones and only one register open. No chairs. No bathroom. Yes it's Times Square, but that should mean staff is used to crowds and management plans for them. Very disappointing."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-12-16,1.0,"I love going to Starbucks; however, I just had the worst experience I've ever had today. The people behind the counter this morning were extremely rude and unwelcoming from the get go. I ordered a cinnamon almondmilk macchiato of which I have never had an issue with before. The person taking my order had written the wrong order on my cup and when asked for my order the lady making drinks rudely ignored me. I asked again and she made me a caramel macchiato with caramel all over the outside of the cup. I am lactose-intolerant and I'm very surprised a chain like Starbucks would be so careless about food allergies. I am very disappointed and recommend that no one go to this location!"
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-11-27,4.0,Came in on a Monday morning at 6. The lady behind the counter was so friendly and welcoming. She was happy and bright. Not something that normally happens at this time of the day. We had a conversation and she said that she had just gotten back from NC. It's nice to have someone that is willing to talk to you in a very busy city. It was much appreciated.
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2019-07-31,1.0,This starbucks is the WORST.  They consistently cannot keep up with their orders.  I order an ice coffee daily with LIGHT cream ( meaning - a splash) -its always way too much cream. I asked them to correct it today & they dumped out half of it and added more coffee vs. fixing it. The hot food always takes too long. So you end up with a watery drink and a steamy sandwich. The staff is always busy on their phones or gossiping w/ one another.
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-03-29,2.0,"I Love Starbucks! I am a Starbucks....let's say aficionado and this particular location missed the mark.  It so unfortunate because with a Times Square location it should have exceeded expectations.  The baristas were not attentive to the patrons, they were chatting it up with each other. 

Finally get our drinks & they weren't given to us with sleeves. HELLO ITS A HOT DRINK! And there weren't any sleeves available nor any splash sticks.  The place was a mess!"
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2017-12-09,4.0,"Behold the only 24 hours Starbucks in NYC (possibly, as far as i know). My go-to bucks is not this one but i had to stop by at this location because a) it's midnight and b) kinda thirsty and wanted somethin hot. This bucks is quite small compare to the other bucks within couple blocks away but surprisingly has plenty of baristas actively working to make drinks. I had to wait approx 6 mins for my hot chocolate but no biggy. The staffs were very friendly and clearly they didn't mess around. Now if only this location is a bit bigger then it'll be perfect but eh the world does not always revolve around you, right?"
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-01-04,4.0,"I work across the street from this location and visit it often. I've been using the order ahead feature on the Starbucks app and I place my order when I'm one stop away on the train; only once has my drink not been ready when I arrived less than 5 minutes later, and that one time was only because someone else took it by mistake (a barista then re-made the drink in the next size up, free of charge). It's small, always crowded, and there's nowhere to sit, but the staff keeps the line moving and is always polite."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-05-25,5.0,"I go to lots is Starbucks but I have to tell you this one rocks and it is the stellar team that works there that makes it happen. As I exit the subway I pass 2 Starbucks on the way to my office and always pick this one  . Even though they are probably the busiest Starbucks on the face of the planet the team always greets you and handles your order at warp speed. 

Many peeps even greet me personally !!! In Times Square!!!

Congrats to the best Starbucks team in NYC!!! ( and I go to a zillion of them)"
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-12-24,1.0,"Bought coffee and went sugar hunting. No sugar available at the store. Only sweeteners. When asked the employees, they said that the sugar is finished"
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2016-07-19,1.0,This Starbucks sucks. Tremendously sucks. Huge lines. Unfriendly staff. No bathroom. Ordered a drink and was waiting for it but told they were out of the ingredients! Why wasn't I told this before paying and waiting for drink. Plus I had used a reward for the drink so I couldn't get a refund. I had to scramble to pick something different and continue to wait. On top of that I asked for extra ice and was told by barista I would need to get back in line and order ice!! Never will I go back to this store.
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2017-07-25,2.0,"I arrive at 9:30am. I order a tall hot chocolate, grande frappachino & a breakfast sandwich.

At around 9:40am, I get the breakfast sandwich.

At 9:52am, I get asked by the barista ""What did you order""? I tell him. About a minute later, the cashier who took the order states, ""Sorry, I forgot"".

This is all you need to know about this Starbucks."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2019-05-02,1.0,These baristas are the worst!!! How can Starbucks keep these people?? Every time I have come in here they are so rude!!! I would pass this one for the one on 44th.
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-10-10,3.0,"Extra long line because it is where it is! But there's a Starbucks on every corner so you can go wherever! Not much merch selection, typical. Drinks take 5 min."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2017-09-13,1.0,"Times Square is an incredibly busy place, it sees massive amounts of traffic. So it is entirely understandable that this would be a very busy Starbucks location. As such, this location should be prepared for that. They are not.
When we went in here, it was by no means during one of the highest traffic times. The place was a gong show. There is no rhyme or reason to placing your order or picking up your order. 

We ordered two identical drinks exactly as advertised on the menu board, nothing customized or specialized. Easy, right? We waited and waited some more. The barista appeared confused, she looked like she didn't know how to make it. Eventually she called out my name, told us we had to wait for ""more foam"" to be made and proceeded to dump out what she was making. So then we waited for another 15 minutes. We had seen the original girl on the other side of the bar on her phone. We were trying to be patient since we were told what the problem was, but it was getting a bit ridiculous. So we reminded them we were waiting. So commenced a bunch of asking around before they got back to the original girl who's response was ""I told them to make more foam! They didn't do it!?"". Seriously!? Literally NO ONE was making our drinks, we were entirely forgotten in a game of pass the buck. So then she starts making our drinks. The girl is making an absolute mess over our cups and still looks confused af. Another barista looks over at what she's doing and literally says ""here let me do that"". Her face told us everything we needed to know: our drink was not made correctly. The girls response was ""no they've been waiting a while and I want to get them out of here"". If you cannot do something right, you shouldn't do it at all. Let alone, waste our money by serving us garbage. We just had the same beverage the day before and it was super delicious. This tasted NOTHING like it should. I can't believe it was served to us in that manner and even worse, with no apologies or no type of reimbursement for our troubles. 

If you are looking for a good Starbucks or a good experience at a Starbucks, this is not it. They need better organization, better trained staff, and dedicated duties. I can only imagine what happens when they are actually busy. This was definitely my worst experience at a Starbucks and I was superbly disappointed in how we were handled. Most notably how they could not care less about the quality of beverage they served us. I want my money back."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-05-22,1.0,"I received a Starbucks gift card so I've been using it for the past week and a half. This is the closest Starbucks to my office. So far I've used the card on 5 separate occasions and 3 out of those 5 times, my order has been wrong. I only order iced lattes with soy milk. You pour soy milk and add espresso and ice. But for some reason it still gets messed up because the wrong milk is used. This is the only drink combination I order so I can taste the difference when something is off, not to mention that soy milk is an extra cost and it's not even used. It's my fault that I don't sip my drink until I get back into my office and then I don't want to walk back to get it fixed. Once this gift card runs out, I am no longer going to this Starbucks. C'mon guys, how you get it wrong that often?"
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2017-09-19,4.0,24 7 pick me up.. lean. No bathrooms. Staff is cool. Great view of Times Square. Not too busy after midnight
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-02-09,3.0,"Well, it is a lot about when you come here. The slower hours are better, so they must do something and get things moving faster. I am not sure why they do not hire more workers at the peak hours."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-05-14,1.0,"super slow service, super slow workers.  There were at least 8 people working yet there was only one barista actually making drinks... I didn't know that ordering a tea infusion took at least 15 Min (and counting) to receive.  Worst service experienced at a Starbucks location."
774,starbucks-new-york-124,2018-09-05,1.0,"As bad as it can get. Way understaffed for the amount of traffic this location gets so service is S-L-O-W!!! The place is FILTHY and there are flies all over. Just nasty, Starbucks should be ashamed to keep this store as part of their franchise."
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2019-12-09,5.0,"I absolutely love the pastries here! The breads, sugared donuts, and pastries are what stand out here! 

The drinks are okay, and the salads are tiny... I do not recommend those. The service is also not great...

But the delicate ness and sweetness of the pastries are worth it! I highly recommend trying the pastries here. It's not too heavy either since they're all Asian like desserts."
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2019-06-26,5.0,"This French-inspired Korean bakery practically appeared overnight  at this new location with the distinctive blue coloring and theme.

The layout is the newer Café version where the counter person may prepare or heat up the item you want vs. the older model where you select cold items from the shelves and place them on your tray. You still find some of the popular Paris Baguette favorites but much less of them.  This store is bigger than most of the Paris Baguette you find in midtown and the very spaciousness of the layout lets you mingle around the displays and service areas. 

The breads, pastries, cakes here are like most Asian bakeries, they tend to be softer and sweeter than your typical American or European bakery. You will find the desserts are great and not as sweet and are more on the lite side when compared to Madison Kayser. and then you have Soups, sandwiches, and beverages to pick from, breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night snack.

I am not sure what will happen to the other Paris Baguette on 7th Avenue a block away. If it remains I will have to decide which one to go to when I am in the neighborhood depending what I am in the mood for."
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2019-12-09,4.0,"Love this place and a contender to put Starbucks off their game, if only this franchise would put a store up next to every starbucks...every drink made 
To order so be prepared to wait on heavy traffic days but nothing unusual of NYC!

Pastries and sandwiches reminisce   those in Paris(almost)!  Iced cafe mocha was perfection!  

Will definitely come back each NY visit for sure!"
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2020-02-15,1.0,I bought a coffee cake roll from this location on 2/14 and it had fungus inside -they are selling expired food...worst part is I ate some last night and didn't realize that the sour taste is from fungus and it's only today 2/15 that I started eating and noticed the black fungus inside cake --can't believe it !!!
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2020-02-22,4.0,Nice selection of pastries to go with a cappuccino. Nice vibes and good place to sit and people watch.
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2019-10-15,4.0,The bakery is located at broadway nearby Time Square. That's great for break time. I like the food.
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2019-08-26,4.0,I went and got the cronut here for around $4. It tastes really decent when compared to the dominick ansel cronut. Like same overall taste but toned down. Seems like the healthier and cheaper option for sure. I would consider getting it again because the taste is really similar.
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2019-08-09,4.0,A plus!!!  A whole lot of options.   Great coffee selection.   Friendly staff.  No more Dunkin' Donuts
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2019-08-19,5.0,"Popped in here randomly to grab something for a late breakfast last week and decided to try their croque monsieur. The sandwich was delicious. I have been back since and I have not been disappointed by any pastry or breakfast sandwich that I have tried. Recently grabbed a caprese panini for lunch; it was ready in minutes and was fresh and tasty. 

Not only is the food great, the staff is wonderful. They are warm, friendly, and polite, which makes the experience that much better."
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2019-11-15,4.0,We shared 4 pastries and 2 drinks for $20.  Price is very reasonable and food is amazing.  Try the rice donut. It sounds strange but it has a sweet paste inside. Also the potato pastry is also great.  Quick service and there were plenty of seats. Great breakfast or quick snack right off times square. They have breakfast sandwiches and all kinds of fococcia bread.  Really worth it.
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2019-09-26,5.0,Excellent!! The service is great and the food as well! Highly recommended the almond croissant- but soups- sandwiches and all the we have tried have been great!!
775,paris-baguette-new-york-25,2019-11-29,5.0,Absolutely the BEST cheesecake I've ever had! I can't wait to visit NYC again just to get more

776,starbucks-new-york-123,2017-11-19,4.0,"Very friendly staff and lots of seating. The only thing is the dregs of society sometimes congregate here. I would only give it two starts for that but they also have a restroom with a code. That deserves 12 stars.

Other than that, it's a great Bux, with all the usually Bux items. They have a long high too ""communalL table and a subway bench table. Service and restroom distinguish this as superior. Close to the hotel around the corner and far enough from Herald Sq."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-10-24,1.0,"I ordered 2 Matcha Frapps 
And the barista said the blender was broken after 15 mins later.
She asked me if I wanted to get Matcha latte.
Cuz she said it's the same price.
Bur it was not.
Look what I got.
She only fillef up 80% of latte."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-08-21,1.0,"I tried to work with the staff at this place...stolen food n drink by local homeless daily...and even slow service.

but when you didn't change trays & paper in the oven , even after i told you im allergic to almonds and there are leftover almonds on the paper from another persons order there...i get a blank stare and they proceed to out my food on there...what a complete neglect for safty ...

i won't be visiting again.."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-12-29,1.0,"Came here at 9:40pm Dec 28th. Got a venti vanilla latte. Coffee was ok but Employee was not..
The guy who took my order asked my name for the order and said 'what a pretty name' to me..
Also when I was sitting there with my wife and heard some kind of big slam noise and found out the employee placed chairs on the table upside down but not like placed chairs he slammed chairs down on the tables and threw the trash cans very angry.
I checked my cellphone yes it was 9:55pm and they close 10pm. He could let us know they will be closed in 5 minutes and then I could leave happily but it was kind of threaten to me and my wife.
Maybe he had a bad day but this guy should go back to training center to learn customer service and anger management."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-06-14,1.0,Not a great Starbucks. I often like to order a vanilla sweet cream ice coffee. I notice that this Starbucks charges extra for vanilla syrup and half and half. I also got their blueberry pack for breakfast this morning and the blueberries had mold on it. Wasting my money here. Not coming back anymore.
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-08-03,3.0,"Big fan of Starbucks. Not so much a fan of dirty community space and foul bathrooms. Can't blame it solely on NYC - Starbucks is large enough and should be accountable for clean and appealing facilities. Drinks were standard, ticket times were fair considering high volume, staff was friendly."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2018-12-24,4.0,This Starbucks location is close to 34th Penn station A C E train. I wanted to just grab a nice cold coffee after Christmas shopping. It was around 6PM on Saturday and the line wasn't long so I got my drink quick and enjoy taking subway home.
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-06-23,4.0,They Literally forget to start online orders all the time.  Otherwise a very great location.  I just don't get why they're sooooo bad about starting online orders.  It really frustrates me when I'm in a hurry.  Very irritating.
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-06-12,2.0,This is a bad Starbucks location. There are no tables and the outlets are all covered so you can't use them to charge your devices. It is also very messy in here.
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-04-30,2.0,Friendly service but are table was full of trash that I dumped. A staff member came by wiping tables with a wet cloth that distributed the yuck evenly over the whole table then proceeded to wipe the next table in the same way.
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-11-30,2.0,There are some really hard workers here being brought down by some real slackers.  The guy who took my order read it back to me and had literally half of the eight items wrong.  Service is so slow.  The woman barista was the slowest I have ever seen at any Starbucks.  She was more interested in dancing.  The manager and owner here should wake up.
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2018-09-10,1.0,"Awful experience. Horrible atmosphere.
First off it was 60 degrees outside and they had two portable air conditioning units set for 64 degrees blasting cold air. I requested if they could make it warmer and said it had a sensor and couldn't adjust it. Seriously? What a lie. You mean to tell me a manager can't adjust temperature of units? GTFO  the place felt like a morgue. 
Also, music was blaring loud so had to shout to speak to my party. Turn down the damn music. It's not a nightclub. 
Overall, poor management at this location and liars too."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2018-06-28,2.0,"Far from the worst Starbucks in a tourist-laden part of Midtown, but can I just say this: the goddamn music is ALWAYS. TOO. LOUD. It's so loud it's actually hard to have a conversation with anyone there, let alone on the phone. I've been to bars that played music more quietly. 

On the plus side, relatively roomy, lots of seating, usable bathroom. LOTS and lots of tourists, so I'm amazed they manage to keep it fairly clean!"
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-07-10,2.0,This location never has half/half available. Always order light ice and always get full ice. Not sure what the deal is. I hope they can get it together ASAP.
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-02-07,2.0,"Lines are long but go back quick. However you'll be waiting about 35 mins for one bagel! And you'll be late for work. Smh. I was unable to walk out with my bagel because I had a meeting to attend. So I sat in the meeting hungry. I know, sad. On a 15 min break I ran there to retrieve my bagel and received no apology or at least a free drink. Will not return."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2018-05-09,1.0,So much for a haven.  I come in and purchase an $8 drink and get treated to a sauna of humanity devoid of charging stations or basic amenities.  Nowhere to sit.  Service with a shrug.  Feck this place.
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-07-23,1.0,"This is the filthiest Starbucks I have ever been to. Staff wasn't helpful, and when I alerted them about the bathroom being out of order they said they were aware and were still sending people. For a bathroom that has a key code to keep the public out and to keep it clean. They've failed. I saw the employee wash hands sign in there. If that's the bathroom they are using, I will not be having any food/drinks from them."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2018-08-06,1.0,"I tried this location 4 times now, we live close by, so I really wanted to keep trying, to, hopefully, get a good experience. Unfortunately, I can only give 1 star for the beverages, as everything else, especially the service, is very unsatisfactory. Pity :-("

776,starbucks-new-york-123,2016-05-13,2.0,"I was suppose to go to the 7th ave Starbucks near McDonald's but accidentally went the wrong way and found this Starbucks. No big deal I'll just go to this Starbucks since I only have 10 mins left before the happy hour ends.

This is by far not the friendliest Starbucks I've been to and horrible customer service. Most of the employees were not smiling. I ordered a venti s'mores frappe, a grande iced green tea latte and bought a tomato mozzarella sandwich. The cashier asked for my name for the s'mores frappe but he was writing it on a grande cup. So I corrected him before the barista makes it in a grande cup and he gave me a not very welcoming vibe. I asked for a bag and one of the barista ignored me. Although I still got a bag but she could've assured me and said ""sure"". 

When I got the sandwich, the tomatoes fell out and it only filled up half the sandwich. The rest was just plain bread. 

On the good side they made my smores frappe very good."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2018-05-15,2.0,"They do a good job when it comes to making drinks correctly but the mobile orders come out way too slow and the counters are always dirty with spilled drinks. The other day, I saw the barista knock overflowing ice back in by using his hand."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2016-01-18,3.0,"Stopped by this Starbucks to redeem my reward offer. The cashier redeemed my reward and took my order - unfortunately without checking stock!
Of course I later found out the item I ordered wasn't available. 
Thankfully the staff member fixing the sandwiches and desserts was more helpful then the cashier. She spoke with the manager on site who granted me a courtesy gift certificate but I had to make another selection for the reward I redeemed. 
I had originally planned to eat on site until I noticed a homeless man that I had seen outside now sitting at a table. The growing aroma drove me out.
I'd return but some of the staff there definitely needs more training,"
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2017-09-05,4.0,"This has to be one of my favorite Starbucks in the city. I visit this maybe 2-3 times a week on the way to work and it's always a pleasant visit because they play trap music in the a.m.  What a way to wake me up. They are always very quick with the mobile orders as well and I've only ever gotten the wrong thing once on a busy day. 

Only docked a star b/c as much as I love the music, sometimes it's hard to hear the barista call your name if they aren't loud enough."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2019-01-27,1.0,This Starbucks is seriously the worst. You can expect a minimum 15 minute wait for anything when you walk in. The employees are unfriendly and rude. Get it together.
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2014-01-31,3.0,"Nothing different about today's coffee..Starbucks is... Well... Just Starbucks.. But there's spacious seating space at this location and the line moves pretty quickly at 10 am.
Nothing. Else. To.  Say."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2017-04-07,2.0,"I know this place well by now, so here's my review. It's the most unfriendly Starbucks in New York. There's no contest. The surly staff mostly only half listen to you at best with expressions that say 'whatever' or more often 'idgaf.' The lines are often out the door. They move uncommonly slowly. You'll wait an AGE for the simplest order.

The manager is terrific but the hires do not take their lead from her. This place needs new hires."

I was in need of a jolt in the middle of a dreary day and ended up at this location on 6th avenue - in the middle of a freaking protest.  So, it was packed outside.  Surprisingly, however, there was no line to order inside and I got my order fairly quickly.

What set this place apart was really the customer service.  The cashiers and baristas were friendly and didn't give off that nasty attitude that some Starbucks employees sometimes have.  Cheers to these guys for getting it right!"
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2017-09-27,2.0,"There was no line whatsoever at this location, though there were people inside doing their thing like any Starbucks. There were 4 people behind the counter and it took forever to get my order for some reason. I noticed that there were 3 other customers waiting patiently after I placed my order. They need to definitely speed things up here, and as ESPN always says......Come On Man!"
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2017-01-17,1.0,"I don't usually bother to review chain restaurants, but my experience at this location was so abysmal, I'm making an exception.  

I came here one afternoon recently and ordered a sandwich.  The cashier - Jalen - was incredibly rude and acted like I had made the sandwich name up, which I had not, and I had even cited it correctly.  He just didn't know the product.  Fine, but don't give me attitude because you don't know the products you sell.  

Then he didn't know how to ring up a Starbucks reward and purchase on a single transaction, so I had to give him my card twice.  That's never happened before, but don't blame the customer if you don't know what to do.  

Judging from other reviews of this location, this poor attitude is pervasive here.  I urge patrons who have similar negative experiences to get the name of the employee and contact Starbucks with details.  At least you'll get a refund or a free beverage, and they say they'll contact the store too."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2015-05-25,1.0,"The worse experience just now. This girl was incompetent and she had the nerve to get frustrated with me when she was the one that couldn't do her job in the first place. I just wish I got her name so you Yelpers going to this Starbucks don't have to deal with her stupidity.

Went in today at 11am. As a Gold member, Starbucks offers a lot of deals. So I went in to use my deal: 'Any (emphasize on ANY) breakfast sandwich and ANY handcrafted espresso for $5. First of, she was stupid and was like why isn't your card working? Like she's blaming me that I told her the wrong deal when I even showed her the offer code and everything. 

Then she got my order wrong. She gave me a regular coffee. So, I stood there and told her I wanted an Americano. Instead of fixing my coffee, she starts to ring me up for a 2nd order. So I corrected her, and told her I asked for an Americano before and she gave me the wrong coffee. She gives me a dumb-ass look and starts speaking to me like I'm the stupid one.  

If I could give a negative star for my experience just now, I would. That one star is for the workers during rush hour that are capable of making 10 different types of drink within 5 mins."
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2018-07-31,1.0,"One of the worst most abominably atrocious customer service experiences Ive ever had. Stood for a half hour as customers who ordered after me were served first, the cakepops took 20 minutes alone to reach my hands and when they did it was the wrong order. My drink took even longer and when I pointed out how long I'd been waiting, there was no reason given, no apology or rush to make it, they simply stared at me in slack-jawed befuddlement as if I was some unconceivable thing to them. If another employee hadnt seen what was happening and came over I doubt that I ever would have received my overpriced beverage, still no apology or admission of fault. When it came it was shoved at me with open disdain, simply horrendous."

So I ask him, why u don't put banana in ? He goes . Oh, we run out of bananas and it's going to taste the same !  
I said :no,  u should let me know and I decide if I want to continue take what I ordered.  He shakes his shoulder, looked back at the clueless cashier. Nobody knows what's going on , in Starbucks ! U lucky if u get your order right !"
776,starbucks-new-york-123,2015-05-23,3.0,"One of the cleanest locations I've been to. Very well kept. That's due to how well staffed this location is. They're not one of those stores that tries to cut costs by keeping only 3 people on staff. They obviously realize that quality will stay consistent with more people on hand to attend to the store's needs. 

On the flip side? Not the friendliest Starbucks partners I've come across. As someone who was a barista for a good while, I always made it a point to make every customer feel welcomed and that their transaction was worth it, no matter how big or small. They could use some reinforcement in the ""3rd Place"" training. 

Still a decent location, nonetheless."

776,starbucks-new-york-123,2016-07-24,1.0,Disorganized. I visit here often because it's close to my home. Many times you'll wait up to 10 minutes for a simple iced tea or coffee because they'll make drinks of the people who ordered after you first.

***Just be careful with a fairly new gay Black barrista guy that works here (you'll notice him immediately due to his feminine nature and super tight polo uniform). He says he is the ""Manager"" and told me that I cannot get a Venti refill when I brought in my Grande cup and I've been coming here for 3 years and counting and NEVER had a problem. Please regional Manager of Starbucks in New York, re-train this guy or lay him off, he has a VERY bad attitude and doesn't know the rules despite the face that he calls himself a ""manager""

On the other hand, the rest of the crew are always pleasant and set an example of how barristas should be at every other Starbucks"

Although in the recent months there have been some changes to the original staff from when I started coming it is definitely a great addition. Every single interaction with the people that work there makes my day. This is probably the only coffee shop I've ever walked into that treats their customers as if they're walking into their home. They also have a fantastic spread of pastries which are constantly being sampled which is also another one of my favorite things about this place (can we say score!!!) and unlike Starbucks and all those other big coffee brands you also get to see a glimpse of the owner himself from time to time.(Think I might ask for an autograph next time LOL)"

Their coffee tasted smoothly with only little sourness and bitterness. I felt refreshed immediately after taking my first sip. For self serving bar, it was kind of messy and needed to clean up but they had soy milk for free which would be charged in other place."
777,gregorys-coffee-new-york-19,2019-09-07,5.0,"Great coffee shop close to Penn Station. Clean with lots of seating. Mobile order and Yelp order pickup option.

There are food and juice options alongside unique beverage options of what I consider to be ""miscellaneous"" drinks.  I ordered a cappuccino and it was delicious to my high standards.

This place surely beats any chain coffee around like Starbucks."

It's like a groovy, better decorated and better priced Starbucks. There's hippy wallpaper that looks like old school news paper. The music is nice and the setting is relaxing.

777,gregorys-coffee-new-york-19,2019-02-19,4.0,"I can always spot a Gregory's on the street corner without a problem. Something about the minimalism of their design and defining colors. One of the smaller chains in the city, it's definitely coming up as I feel like every time I'm in the city I happen upon a new one. Their coffee is pretty par for the course, more reminiscent on my palate to Starbucks as it has a bit of that burnt aftertaste. I've really only tried their regular coffee (both iced and hot) and don't have much to add. Wish it had slightly a smoother finish.

I'm mystified that they refer to their counter to pick up drinks as the bar, feels very European of them. The decor in this location was nice, I like the newsprint wallpaper and it was even giving me the inspiration to do my own room in the same manner. The staff was cordial and took two seconds to whip up my basic hot coffee. The place was relatively clean and well-kept which is quite a task for a place down the block from Penn."

The latte made of oat milk was smooth and was prepared at the right temperature.

My coworker who had the flower flavored latte of some sort liked his drink too.

Is it me or is there a bit of a nerdist theme going on in their logo?

Either way I'm digging this NYC hipster coffee"

The coffee isn't that expensive which I like and definitely love the coffee and atmosphere here. Unfortunately, I don't come to this Gregory's that often since I don't work close by and I'm not in this area too much but I am glad I finally tried their coffee."

What a huge disappointment! I bought a donut for $2.50 and a $4.00 vanilla latte and both were disgusting! Never again will I set foot in this place."
777,gregorys-coffee-new-york-19,2018-04-18,4.0,"Good not-bitter not-watered down coffee with almond, soy, regular milk options available. None of that Dunkin' Donuts drivel! 

I generally stick to coffee with almond milk, which I think Gregory's does better than most cafes in the area, unless I want to treat myself to a latte. I advise against getting an almond milk latte. Gregory's just doesn't do it well. Their skim milk lattes, especially with vanilla flavor, are winners though. Today, I splurged and got the elderberry beet latte with skim. Delicious and so aromatic! 

This location has a dim, quieter interior, and is surprisingly roomy for its location. They handle the morning lines very well, and there's rarely much of a wait. If you come later on in the day, it's quite cozy and quiet, and since they have lightning fast WiFi, it's a solid place to work on your laptop or read, while doubling as a great meeting spot. There's even a bathroom here!

Con: I didn't see many outlets."
777,gregorys-coffee-new-york-19,2019-07-27,3.0,"Gregory's coffee is a really nice place to grab a cup of coffee in work in relatively quiet surroundings. The employees are professional and clean but the taste of the coffee itself is not the greatest. They are cold brew is medium roast at best and has an oddly, floral flavor. They charge almost a dollar extra for oat milk and other non dairy options (disappointing). There rest rooms were clean and service was prompt, so if push came to shove I would definitely come here for a coworking situation."

I know i'm from PA and not exactly used to good quality coffee, but I am well traveled and know good stuff when I taste it. Gregory's is as good as it gets. Their specialty coffee drinks are creative as well. Baked goods are fresh. 
My only complaint, they don't take apple-pay. But that's very minor."

Gregorys Coffee certainly has better coffee than most chains around NYC. Maybe not quite on par with small local shops that specialize in many different types of beans, but you'll get a much better cup here than most.

There is a lot of seating, lots of outlets by the seats to charge your phone or laptop, and the location is incredibly convenient."
777,gregorys-coffee-new-york-19,2018-09-24,4.0,"Very clean and quiet location. I got the chia tea latte which was nice. What's not nice is when you ask for soy milk and they add $1 to the price. It's 2018, why are we still be charged extra for soy milk!"
777,gregorys-coffee-new-york-19,2018-11-21,5.0,"Latte double shot in a 12 Oz cup is bliss in a little package.

Come to Gregory's Coffee near Penn Station and have a visit with Kat!!  I'm a nice enough customer - I'm cordial. I tip. I don't expect to be treated like I'm buying a condo when I'm grabbing some coffee. BUT... Kat sure did make me feel like I was a very welcome addition to her day at Gregory's. 

Make her the manager and let her train EVERYONE!! Actually, let her manage EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE. 

KAT KAT KAT!!

If this seems like overkill, I get it. But, it's not. Customer service is a fading thing. I wish I lived or worked closer to this place. Besides this barista, the coffee was good and the carrot bread was honestly amazing."

777,gregorys-coffee-new-york-19,2016-02-06,3.0,"Pretty decent coffee, however it did take a while to obtain.. I was feeling adventurous, so I yielded to the cashier staff for recommendations.  I ended up agreeing to test(bud) driving the vulcan. The coffee took a while to get (it was a huge tease waiting for it without knowing what to expect, as I went into this experience blindly) and a near-miss commandeering's had occurred on my behalf as I eagerly waited (aka I kept trying to snatch up peoples drinks).

The coffee was ground, poured into a cylindrical object, boiling water added, stirred and pressed through into a beaker and poured into a double layered cup to go. I imagine the experience would have been elevated had I opted to drink-in. My coffee companion also was in the adventurous mood, who tried a coffee based out of Ethiopia. We jokingly said that the coffee was being imported as we patiently(ish) waited for our hot beverages.

Ambiance was nice - very gentrified vibe and clientele - with a mix of wood tones, much like other coffee shops. It was very clean and filled with multiple opportunities to hole up in a nook or congregate while standing. Overall, I was happy to experience something different in the world of coffee. If you are in the adventurous mood, just let em know! Don't go for the standard americano. If you go here, get a latte to stay (comes with a nice foamy design in a porcelain cup)."

777,gregorys-coffee-new-york-19,2018-02-08,5.0,"I love this location. It's not too crazy in the mornings, even with it's close proximity to Penn Station. There's an app for mobile ordering, but I never feel the need to use it since it's not crowded. There's ample seating and the layout is nice, perfect for mentally preparing yourself for another workday. 

The drinks are great as well! Lattes aren't too sweet, and plenty of variety. Some mornings I just want a smoothie. The pastries are also delicious and not ridiculously overpriced. My only recommendation would be to add almond croissants to the menu.

And the best part is the loyalty program -- become a Gregular! There's tons of perks, and they're really good about promos outside of the typical birthday drink. Hit me up for a $5 referral :)

Wait time: none, even in the am commute

778,starbucks-new-york-232,2018-08-17,1.0,"COME HERE FOR BAD BARISTAS

Dropped by this afternoon because it was too hot outside and I wanted a drink to cool down. After I ordered my drink and was waiting for it, I was initially going to give 5 stars for how smooth the transaction had gone because I didn't see any problems with the store.

However, after getting to my drink after my name was called, I noticed the lack of strawberries considering I had ordered 6 scoops of strawberries. This is my go-to order at all Starbucks so I know how full the drink should be with strawberries. I had also been watching the barista make my order and noticed she hadn't scooped 6 times. When I brought this up with a worker, he asked the other barista who made my drink if she added 6 scoops and she proceeded to say she had. At that point, I showed him my drink and quickly came to the conclusion that this wasn't a fight I wanted to start and I just wanted to get on with my day so I left it as is since it didn't seem like the barista or her manager were willing to add more.

I've had this occur at other Starbucks locations before and they were all quick to fix my order when they realized they messed up. However here, they didn't want to own up to it. Additionally, they further messed up the order by adding tap water instead of lemonade as I had requested. I don't know what they think they were doing but they were obviously slacking at their jobs.

This definitely made me question why my family and I are such loyal customers of Starbucks when they have a history of screwing up orders that are given in black and white to them. And also makes me question why they allow for customers to make customizations if they aren't willing to actually make it."
778,starbucks-new-york-232,2019-12-30,1.0,"It'a really not that hard to make coffee, but this place sure just loves messing it up. I ordered my drinks 20 minutes before I'd even arrive at the place, and when I got there, there was nothing (wtf). So I go up to the barista (who was on her phone) and ask about it, to which she says ""Sorry"" and starts making them. She then hands me a frappe, and I say ""this isn't what I ordered"" (as I ordered a hot drink). She insists that I 100% did, even though I ordered this drink from the literal hot drinks menu ? I keep telling her that I want it hot because I have a sore throat, so she takes the frappe out of my hand, says ""fine,"" sticks a straw in it, and starts drinking it herself. Seriously, not that hard to do your job ?"

I kept it simple and went for a tall mocha, yet the amount of people taking advantage of the free drinks in the hour it was promoted for, was insane! Luckily, I wasn't in a rush and was patient enough to wait for my beverage, after all, it was free :).

This location although overly populate (mostly because of the freebie) was organized, clean and running in order.

 If in the area again, will go back to use my gift card, received as a gift, yay me!"

Although it sometimes gets very crowded, they move the ordering line along swiftly and the music is ALWAYS jamming. They play a mix of old school and new school r&b as well hits at the top of the charts. They've never gotten my order wrong and the cashiers have never been rude when taking my order, contrary to some reviews that I have read.The only thing they need to work on is how the line wraps around the store. There should be a rope or barrier that forces people waiting for food/ drinks out of the way of people lining up to order. It always gets confusing and annoying. Other than that, this Starbucks is great."

778,starbucks-new-york-232,2018-02-15,1.0,"This is by far the worst Starbucks I've ever been to.
Being that it is close to the office, I gave it a couple more tries. 

3 different experiences, 3 different days. 
The first time I ordered a Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew (same every morning), there was no vanilla syrup at all.

Second time, ordered the classic oatmeal and brought it back to the office. The oatmeal tasted like it had been sitting out for days. The grain had expanded into porridge. It was disgusting, I had to throw the whole thing out.

Third, ordered cold brew again, the barista had left the empty cup with my name on the counter. I assumed they were waiting for another batch or something. The barista came out and asked what we were waiting for, I said the cold brew. She said ""well we don't have any that's why there's an empty cup on the counter."" 

It's a shame I won't be going to this Starbucks anymore being that it's so close to the office.

I can see why this location has so many bad reviews."

The music was so loud that the employees had to escalate their volume. and I'm sure that if I were to stop and try, I could feel my liver vibrating. OkaySoMaybeItWasntThatLoud, but it was loud. And it wouldn't have been odd to have a slow grind dance corner in the back.

Although there's extra seating upstairs, good luck finding a seat thats not occupied but someone who isn't even a paying customer. I appreciate that Starbucks let's people hang but seats should first go to paying customers who are looking for a place to sit and eat/drink their Starbucks purchase.

As I had just returned from client visits in New Jersey, and dropped my car off at AVIS close by after sitting in an hour of road rage inducing traffic just going a few blocks out of the Lincoln Tunnel I really needed some caffeine and a bathroom break. Badly. 

Good thing there is always a Starbucks somewhere in sight! I am so happy that Starbucks has placed their locations all over town for coffee and an occasional bathroom run. As I was walking back to my office I stumbled upon this one in the nick of time.

Decent looking location, clean, with an upstairs seating area and free wifi.

I purchased an iced coffee and was also able to use the surprisingly clean facilities. Only one bathroom here though. Service was quick with a smile and I was on my way. Even though it was busy they kept the line moving quickly.

Yes, I should have taken it back, but I wasn't going to go through the line and the nonsense all over again.   

I will admit, I had gone to this location several months ago.   And yes, I had much the same experience with a hot beverage.  Shame on me for being ""twice"" stupid in this regard.

We asked Milli Tilli when Starbucks opened - what year it opened.  She wasn't interested in answering our questions at all. She was really cold and gave us a look like :order your food, I don't have time for this: kinda look. Kinda ridiculous if you ask me. It really screwed up our energies.

Finally get there and order my stuff. There's about 20 people crowded around the barista and drinks slowly coming out. I wait about ten minutes, barista who looked incredibly angry and unhappy tells me there is no iced coffee...do I want cold brew. I ask how long the wait is...the look on her face was like I insulted her. Wait 5 minutes longer, finally get my iced coffee. Ask where my bagel is. Oops, they ran out so don't get that either.

All of the times I'm in New York I've received spectacular service everywhere I go and after sitting on a 7 hour bus ride into the city, I went to get a coffee and the young Latin man at the register, probably about 18/19, was so involved in a conversation with his coworker that when I said Hi for his attention, he gave me mean eyes. After putting in my order, he turned away again and I called for his attention again. And again I received the mean stare and he told me to not be disrespectful. I said excuse me. You've had your back to me this entire time, giving me zero customer service and I'm being disrespectful..Where's your manager on duty. All the employees ignored me. As I stood there I hear the young man tell his coworker that I'm lucky, so and so. He threatened me. Again they refused to answer me about a manager on duty.

I ordered a turkey club combo because you know I can read, then I ordered an apple fritter. I get my sandwich and I ask the lady for an iced tea, ""We don't have iced tea""......

The service in general is adequate but indifferent. The donuts are stiff and a bit dry. And the coffee has a strange bitter taste that I did not recognize.

Disappointingly, through a hard lesson learned majority of Pennsylvania Station, Long Island Rail Road Concourse level's employees are stolid and extreme callous.  Ayia, such apathetic, stolid and a unfathomably nasty high attitude index servicing clients which publicize employees' extreme unhappiness and unfulfillable desire to be physically present.  This is what these businesses call ""customer service""?  It is called lack thereof customer service as I've been newly liberated from a customer service industry!

Albeit Tim Hortons is a chain donut cafe and home based in Canada yet they seemingly do not have equipment for registers to print out sales receipts or sales record. The staff manually handwritten me a sales receipt still unable to fulfill my request for lack thereof information."

Despite the excellent reputation that the Tim Hortons chain seems to enjoy in Canada, they certainly have not managed to achieve that with their tiny Tim Hortons outpost in front of the Hotel Pennsylvania. I made the mistake one morning, while passing, to walk inside this joint and order a breakfast sandwich, along the lines of bacon, egg and cheese on an English muffin. Well, it turned out to be ABSOLUTELY THE WORST breakast sandwich that I have ever tried to eat in my life, and I was forced to throw it away in disgust after two bites. The sandwich was the most bland, sterile, flavorless, anemic thing that I have seen that passed for food. The egg, despite the fact that I had ordered ""whole egg"" was just a tiny disk of bland white plastic matter with not a trace of yolk in it, and, as for the cheese, well, think of the very worst 1970s imitation ""American cheese-like food product"" the cheese was grossy and the color was such a bright yellow that it scared me. As for the Canadian bacon, well, that is better left unsaid, else I might vomit on my keyboard from the memories.

The other doughnut I had was a Boston Cream Doughnut and boy it's sweeter and non-greasy than Dunkin Donuts.

The double double (2creams and 2 sugars) were absolutely brilliant and it all added up to under $4.99 what a deal.

I've tasted Starbucks coffee and it's bitter, and Dunkin Donuts coffee too mild but Tim Horton's roasted coffee is perfect Medium Roast.

Anytime I go through Penn Station I'm  coming for another Timmy's Run.

Please serve poutine I really want some."
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2012-06-13,3.0,"i had eaten at this chain many times while visiting montreal, but had no idea  this existed in the states!  since i liked their food in canada, i figured i would like it in the states as well.

i ordered a cold turkey sandwich ($4.79) and red velvet brownie ($1.45).  the turkey sandwich consisted of sliced turkey and a bit of lettuce on white bread.  they filled it with a lot of turkey, which i liked, but taste wise, it was just average.  the brownie was tasty and had good texture.  it was like red velvet cake, in slightly denser form.  they also topped it with frosting (probably cream cheese) which was nice, just like a slice of red velvet cake.

customer service was just ok.  it wasn't very busy or crowded when i went, but for some reason the cashier did not seem very happy when i was there, and didn't like it when i corrected her on which brownie i wanted."
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2009-08-16,4.0,"Inside Penn Station on the LIRR level, is yet another DD that became a Tim Hortons.  I hadn't tried any of the US THs yet but was a bit leary of trying on inside the station.  I needed have feared -- the Bagel BELT breakfast sandwich was actually quite good!  Not just mediocre fast food breakfast good, but actually tasty good.  The combo deal of sandwich, medium coffee, & a donut only cost five dollars and change, which is pretty good at Penn.    Would definitely go again the next time I need food at Penn Station."
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2010-12-15,4.0,"I'll never forget the first time I tried Tim Horton's. I was braving 20 below temperatures at the Heritage Classic -- the first-ever outdoor NHL game in 2003 -- in Edmonton, Alberta. 

On a night that beer actually froze, I stood in the top row at Commonwealth Stadium and warmed myself with a blend of Tim Horton's medium roast coffee and Old Crow whiskey. I can almost taste it now, that was one of the best, coldest days of my life. 

These days, I get my fill of Tim Horton's at a far less exotic location: Penn Station's LIRR terminal. Anyone who has frequented this branch of TH in the AM knows that barista Jimy is just about the happiest, freshest breath of air in the whole damn joint.

The other day I ordered a cup and then realized I had nothing in my wallet. No problem, Jimy said, you can pay me tomorrow. Anyone who wants my coffee, he said, gets my coffee. 

I get it, Canada definitely gets it, and one day NYC may get it. Tim Horton's is cool."

779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2011-09-30,5.0,"youre my fav coffee place in all of manhattan.  Not cause your coffee is so damn good I dream about it, but cause the girls that work there are the best.  They know my order even if i'm not there for weeks on end, and prep it while I walk up.  They smile and say they're happy to see me, wish me a nice day when I leave AND hooked me up with a Tim Hortons card to save me $$ on coffee cause I go there everyday.

def something to be said about a smile and good customer service.  I hope you ladies get a raise."
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2016-04-23,3.0,"When I told my Canadian friends I'd bring them here, they just looked at me. I've never been to a location in Canada, so have no basis for comparison. No complaints of the two (three?) locations within Penn Station, fairly basic. I like coming here because there aren't as many cops as there are in other donut shops."
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2009-11-16,3.0,"I was hungry and about to catch a train at Penn Station. My dad wanted coffee so he gave me $20 and asked I bring him back a cup and said I could get whatever I wanted from here too. So I ended up a cup of coffee for him, and two donuts and an orange juice (that was not from concentrate since it tastes better even though it is more expensive) for me. 

I failed to give him his change back. My dad was not surprised. This reminded my dad as to why he never gives me more money than I need when he sends me on a mission to buy anything.

By the way, the donuts were pretty good. Staff was nice too.

I'd come here again. Hopefully, with my dad's money."
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2013-10-10,3.0,"I wouldn't go as far as saying that the doughnuts here are bad, but this is clearly the weakest of the three major doughnut chains at Penn Station (Krispy Kreme, Dunkin Donuts, Tim Horton). The doughnuts here just don't taste right. It's too cakey. Krispy Kreme is MUCH better."
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2011-01-04,4.0,"Coffee is pretty good. Didn't have a chance to try their famous donuts but I will if I ever head up north again. I think I'd have to try this place again to give a more accurate indicator of how good they are. I literally was chugging this drink before I jumped on the LIRR at the last second and was almost late for my flight, lol. The hectic atmosphere might not have been conducive to that great of a drinking experience (or the reverse)."

I am so happy to have you in my life again, you're like family to me. With your coffee that is never over 20 minutes old, your tasty selection of fresh timbits and doughnuts, your awesome prices, this relationship will never end.  The only sad part is that your stores down here put you to shame, there needs to be a full service Tim Hortons, serving sandwiches, soup, and with a bigger variety of baked goods (most importantly the little butter tarts). I'm wishing you the best of luck and all of my love Tim, you'll need it to bring these Starbucks loving, Dunkin Donuts box o' joe carryin' city slickers."
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2015-08-06,1.0,"they don't give too much meat on a sandwich, I found only 10gms of meat in a philly steat sandwich...more mayo than egg in a egg salad...you will gain many calories and weight with dough from their high doughy flour bread..its not heathy....they are always hiring because they run a sweat shop...be aware of the calories and fat from tim hortons..u are eating only the fat bread in sandwiches ..the shop on davie st is a rip of when I noticed no meat or very very little meat on a 6.00 sandwich..totally ripped off"
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2010-03-01,4.0,"Good coffee and donuts. Place is similar to DD if you never been to one before except it's a little better than DD. The only negative is they are too friendly, they try to take your order from the lobby before you even step into the store."
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2010-02-03,3.0,"Having experienced the real Timmy Ho's in upstate NY on the Canadian border, I may be jaded, but I also know bad service and old donuts. Both are offered by the Penn Station location and even amidst a disastrous strip of gastronomical injustices and pathetic attempts at wholesome nourishment passed off as food, I still think I'll stick with a liquid diet underground."
779,tim-hortons-new-york-7,2010-04-30,1.0,"BAD, RUDE SERVICE!!!  Don't even think about going here when you are pressed for time.  I waited very patiently for my change while the employee behind the counter had a long conversation with her co-worker.. meanwhile I had a train to catch as most people at Penn Station do!  This is not the only negative experience I have had there.  Save yourself the aggravation and go to Le Bon Cafe instead.  They are fast, efficient and courteous... something I have NEVER experienced at Tim Horton's.  It's too bad, because their stores in Canada are much better."

It's a little thicker than almond milk, so it makes me feel like I'm not drinking a skim latte which is nice. They have very friendly baristas and excellent customer service. It's a nice place to sit and work. The tables were very clean."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2019-07-16,1.0,"Let's discuss food allergies, taking ownership of mistakes, and corporate customer service 101: the bare basics.

A Gregory's employee packaged up and sold me a scone. Normal, right? But after eating half of it I realized it was not what I asked for: not a GLUTEN FREE Scone. I'm allergic.

Customer service is the backbone of any organization. Each interaction is important and is part of a longer customer journey that builds trust and creates lasting relationships, especially when a customer gets extremely sick. Without customer service resolutions, we likely wouldn't have customers for very long. The Better Business Bureau would be overloaded as well as the courts. 

I thought I did the right thing: I called the location within 1/2 hr of the incident - no one picked up (called 3 different locations, over 4 hrs - nothing). 
I sent website customer inquiry - urging them to rename their items more clearly, to train their staff. I did not hear back.
I tweeted them. They responded!! They asked to be DM'd, so I did. Again, urging them to rename their items, train their staff, letting them know how sick I got, and how sick someone with allergies and celiac can get. How serious this is...  

No acknowledgement. Not a word back. This is a company that calls themselves a ""lifestyle + wellness"" brand with ""world class service"". Gregory's Coffee put me in Urgent Care, in agony for almost 2 weeks. 

Gregory's Coffee: your silence speaks volumes - ""if we pretend it didn't happen, she'll go away"".
 
Be responsive. Take responsibility. Apologize with sincerity and acknowledgment. Ask how you can help: this is why I was reaching out - to raise awareness and prevent what happened to others in my situation. 

Be authentic! Your website story is filled with unicorn stardust - much different from actual reality. 

Shame on you, Gregory's Coffee."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2019-01-21,4.0,"This place has always been a great spot to go to either for a morning coffee or a afternoon ""pick-me-up"". Having tried their various brewed coffees, express drinks, and finally their smoothies, I have come to find their Almond Milk Latte to be my favorite. It is neither too sweet, nor too strong for your tastebuds, and provides you with the extra energy you need to continue working hard. (Will definitely try a ""Dirty Almond Milk Green Tea Latte"" soon, dirty meaning adding a shot of expresso.)

My second favorite drink is a regular latte, the milk foam smooths out the toughness of the coffee, and is also savory at the same time.

Also to mention is their Morning Boost smoothie. Although I usually have that smoothie in the afternoon, it does act as a healthy afternoon snack for me. Its contents include low-fat vanilla, yogurt, granola, strawberries, blueberries & protein - vegan and gluten free, and super healthy! The taste is great - fresh and sweet, very good treat on a hot summer afternoon.

One other thing to mention is that they accept Apple Pay, Chase Pay as well as the App - LevelUp, which is a good way to accumulate points/rewards for your visit, and still enjoy the benefits offered by your credit card. Just in case you forgot your wallet :) 

Finally, it does get very crowded around 3pm to 3:30pm in the afternoon, so plan accordingly to avoid long lines."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-29,2.0,My flat white order took forever to come! I was running late for my meetings. Plus the barista had no idea how to make a flat white. So bad

Kidding. Aside from that, the medium, no room, cold brews consistently pack a strong amount of caffeine"
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2019-08-09,1.0,A medium iced decaf and medium cold brew around $8. Decaf was nothing to write home about and my friend thought the cold brew was very bitter. Not friendly or welcoming barista.
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2018-11-08,3.0,"The coffee is good, though not extraordinary, and it's pricey. Small drip is $2.60 for a small, basic espresso drinks (latte, flat white, etc) run $4 for a small, and a small caramel macchiato is more than $5. if you want nondairy milk that'll cost $1 extra. That's right, a full dollar extra for soy milk. So if you're lactose intolerant or allergic to dairy, your caramel macchiato is $6 plus tax. This isn't a mom & pop specialty cafe, the stuff isn't organic or advertised as fair trade/ethically sourced, it's just pricey. Surcharges for run-of-the-mill nondairy milks are a pet peeve of mine, even when it's just 25 or 50 cents, and Gregory's takes the cake with the outlandish $1 charge. 

They roast locally (Long Island City) and have single origin coffees, if so if that's your thing maybe don't write this local coffee chain off. There's also free WiFi and a decent amount of seating, so there's that."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2018-02-15,3.0,"Walking from Port Authority to Carnegie Hall, it was hard not to notice how nice Gregory's Coffee looked through the glass.  Yes, their atmosphere is just great, and it's a wonderful place to sit down and relax in the middle of Manhattan.  Lots of people are reading and meeting for business deals.

However, the coffee is just average.  It does not compare to the atmosphere.  Although initially it may seem they don't roast their own beans, they do off site in Long Island City.  The flavor was just bitter and had no nuance to it."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-22,5.0,"Absolutely loooove the coffee here! They should have a rating of more stars, I'd sure give it to this coffee store.
The baristas are really welcoming and nice! Professional & extremely courteous, something you don't find easy these days in NYC.
They greet you as soon as you get thru the door. Location is always clean, organized and very well kept. 
The service is fast and outstanding in sense of accuracy in taking your order and get it right the first time, they never have messed up my order. (It's really annoying to rush to a coffee place and pick up ur order to later find out they messed it up if you know what I mean)...So this doesn't happen here.
Something that really has me coming for more is the flavor choices, I'm really hooked up with their ""Night Vision"" and ""Greg's House"" they are delicious...I'm really picky customer and trust me these brews are off the hook. Love my latte designs!!! Keep up the good work guys!"
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2018-08-24,1.0,"Very disappointed of the cappuccino I ordered. 
I drink cappuccino all the time and love to try new places. Thus, since this coffee shop is only one block from my new work place, so decided to give it a try. 
Asked for a medium cappuccino with whole milk, but the barista called out it's a latte with my name on it. I confirmed with him that I ordered cappuccino not latte, because latte is more milky to me. He told me ""this latte is kinda cappuccino"". YES, HE SAID THAT. What do you mean for ""kinda cappuccino""... do you think cappuccino=latte!? 
However, since this was the first time ordering from them, so fine, I trusted him and gave it a try. The result came out very disappointed, it's a latte for sure, and it tasted like 90% milk in this latte. 
Very disappointed and won't come back again."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2019-09-10,1.0,"I had to wait 15 minutes for my coffee and it made me late for work.  By the time I got it, my order was wrong. I was charged for almond milk and I never got it. Save your money and support a small business."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-22,5.0,Always clean and quick service location !!! Love to stop by every morning before work. Baristas are very polite and always get my order right!!!
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2016-11-28,4.0,"This is my go-to coffee place (and it applies to any Gregory's across the city.) It's a great chain with strong, delicious coffee that has consistent quality across NYC.

Here's what you need to know about GC:
1. Lavender lattes ALLLLL the way. I'm serious. Try it, get it, thank me anytime.
2. Any version of the coffee is good.
3. There are a variety of milks available to match your preferences.
4, All the pastry selections are solid.
5. All the seasonal specials are here too!

Overall, it's the best possible chain of coffee you can get. Always skip Starbucks and go for Gregory's."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2017-12-26,1.0,"First time here and OMG never will I go back to this place again. I rarely leave 1 star review but this one is definitely a one

Staff: 1/5 Very very bad attitude while I ask her if she can explain to me some of the menu items on the board as they are not very clear to me...and she said ""can't you read??!"" with a demeaning look in her eyes....yes I can read but if I know what it is after I read all the description I wouldn't have asked!!! So unprofessional!!!

Eggnog Latte: 1/5 It's not exactly the name on the menu as I seriously don't remember what this is called but it's very sweet and very thick..I almost chocked myself after 1st sip

Almond Butter Cranberry Coconut Bite: 1/5 The size of Cake Pop and it costs $4.00 and it tastes horrible....like some sort of chemical you can not swallow. I have made similar stuff at home with a keto/Paleo receipt and mine tastes 1000x better...

Raspberry Rugelach: 4/5 the only not so bad food I got here

Seriously, I would give it another try if it weren't the staff that just pissed me off so bad. Here you go my #5 one start review out of 100+"
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2019-07-23,4.0,One of those spots that proves healthy doesn't necessarily mean flavorless or ostentatiously expensive. Do recommend.
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2017-10-06,5.0,"A great vibe.  Relaxed and not pretentious. Good coffee, not overly acidic, and delicious pastries. Especially the wheat donuts, no stale pasties here! The people behind the counter are friendly and quick.  I wish Gregory's would come to Texas. The coffee is smooth, the vibe is cool and the people are great. what else could you ask for?! 

Service 5 stars.
Coffee 5 stars
Food 5 stars

Only downside they are a little hard to find in a city where Starbucks is every couple of corners!"
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2017-06-02,4.0,"Nice, smoky drip coffee at an affordable price. I usually prefer lightly roasted Ethiopian coffee, black. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the earthy, chocolatey, yet not too heavy, standard drip at $2.20 for a small cup.

Nice barista and chill table sitting area (course we went in the early evening, so it was pretty empty). There was a sign about forming lines on there morning so I assume it can get pretty busy before work hours. 

They had some interesting drinks I would love to come back to try."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2018-09-28,2.0,"You lost me.   On THREE separate occasions I stopped to your location to get the HONEY BADGER as I have enjoyed it.

Each time you are out of it.   It seems that to ask for it after 3:00 PM means that it is unavailable.

You advertise it, you promote it and then you don't have it.

I asked the staff and to be honest, they really don't care.

Not pleased.   

For a prime location, I am surprised you would not have a better inventory."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-23,5.0,"Omg the staff there is amazing, every morning they greet me with a smile and make my coffee just the way I like it. I would give them 5 stars 100 times over if I could"
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2019-10-22,5.0,Love this location! Recently visited it while in NYC. (First Gregory's ever!) and Madeline helped me with my order and suggested the Nu-Brew! Delish and such amazing customer service!!
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2017-03-24,2.0,"Needed a place to work for a couple of hours on a Friday morning, and heard good things about Gregory's Coffee so I decided to give it a try. With a large stack of glazed donuts and donut holes, one would assume this might be a specialty of theirs, so I ordered one along with a drip coffee.

Let's just say I gave the donut two bites, and threw it in the garbage. Worst than Dunkin Donuts. Worst than an old donut from a Sunoco. Seriously disappointed. If you're going to serve soggy, gritty donuts, at least make them cake donuts as opposed to a poor attempt at selling yeast raised donuts.

The coffee was fine, I would grab another cup here down the line. However, the donut sins warrant 2 stars."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2017-02-18,4.0,"Definitely should come off hours, it gets crowded and the seats are limited. Love coming here though for chai lattes and cappuccinos."

I wanted to mix things up a bit from what I'd already tried near all those theatres so I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and found Gregory's within walking distance a few blocks away. 

I zipped over and got a delicious iced coffee and a pastry and sat outside. It was a gorgeous June afternoon and I couldn't have asked for a better location. It's right in the garment district so there's a really neat needle and thread sculpture outside, right by an information booth if you want to know more info about the neighborhood.

Staff was really pleasant, coffee was good, and there were lots of snacks and pastries to choose from. It's a wonderful stop if you're going to the theatre, doing some shopping, or just need to refuel throughout your day."

Great natural taste, not too sweet like most artificial smoothies spots and service was nice and swift."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2018-10-27,5.0,Great place & love the coffee!! Ill definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood. Enjoy !
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2014-02-24,4.0,"I've been wanting to try Gregory's for a while, as I work one block away, and I always get sucked into Coffee Bean on my corner. Today, though, I decided to head to Gregory's to grab an afternoon latte. This one is located in front of the big button and needle on 7th and 39th. 

Anyway, the cashier girl was very friendly - we bonded over being left-handed - and told me all their latte flavors (hazelnut, vanilla, pumpkin spice, etc). I went for sugar-free vanilla. It was delicious and put all other vanilla lattes I've had in the city to shame. The quality was top-notch. They also did the foam art which made me feel fancy shmancy. I can't wait to return to try other drinks. They had a bowl of a variety of pastry samples available at the counter. I took quite a few... don't judge me.

The place is small and averagely crowded, but it wasn't hard to find a spot to sit. It's very chill and a great place to read or do work. What I love is that the baristas don't yell out the name of the drinks for people to pick up. That annoys me at other cafés. Also their little teacups for espressos are adorable!"
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2016-06-27,4.0,"Great location and nice taste! I especially like the chic interior decor, countertop, and the view from this shop!

780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2017-05-07,3.0,"Just okay coffee--more acidic than I would like and it seems like it has been sitting out for awhile. That being said, the decor is cute and being an eye doctor, I'm sort of drawn to it. Service could be better, no one ever smiles!"
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2016-08-29,4.0,"I've been a regular customer here for about four years. I really love their iced coffee and lattes, and I prefer it to the other non mass-chain coffee shops in the area.  (I'm not a Starbucks person and I drink Dunkin at home - no need to buy it as a treat.) 

Their service is quick and speedy, and everyone is extremely friendly. 

Three things

1) I wish they'd just put up line partitions, at least during the morning rush, to get people to understand that there are three separate lines.  I think this would be much more efficient than them repeatedly yelling, ""There are three lines.  Please form three separate lines.""  People simply don't know that unless they're a regular. Because the distance from the counter to the door is short, a crowd forms quickly and isn't clear to people in the back who just entered that there might be separate lines.  It's awkward for the people who DO know there are separate lines and it makes me feel like people think I'm cutting when I'm not trying to. 

2) They weirdly don't take names when they take your order.  I wish they would because I've had my drink swiped twice and had to chase down a person who ordered the same drink, but after I ordered.

3) They should put a big sign up by the door by the counter to let people know not to stand there because employees are constantly opening it to refill the milk containers.  I've seen several customers get knocked into, some while holding a drink.  I learned that lesson the hard way. =/ 


Stuff to note for customers: 

- I put this as a tip, but look at their Instagram profile and check emails before you go in.  Coupons/discounts are occasionally available. 
- They're LevelUp participants - yay for more potential discounts."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2016-01-20,4.0,"I ordered a medium almond milk chai.
Ulterior motive: use of the bathroom and needed the door code. The bathroom was very clean. 
On to the drink.

The chai was very, very good. I want another one right now. Even with almond milk, they managed to get a nice froth on the chai and I didn't miss the dairy at all. It was well spiced, and I got a seat along a counter looking out the large windows. Next time I'll go in for the chai and not for a bathroom."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2017-06-04,1.0,"I come to this Location often because I work close by.

Don't order anything with espresso or you will have to wait at least 15 minutes. Everything else is served quickly. I got so tired of waiting that I've boycotted the place altogether. I don't have time to wait that long! 

Taste is bad too, especially for cold brew. Very bitter and has an ashy flavor, I think they burn the coffee beans. Other locations are better!"
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2016-11-28,5.0,"Gregory's Coffee is what Starbucks used to be when they first opened.  I hope they never sellout in the corporate world and begin watering down they're supply like other chains.

They offer competitive pricing.  What I enjoy particularly about this location, is not only the fresh and delicious coffee, but the staff is excellent.  There have been occasions where I had an issue with my order and they've assisted me ASAP with no hesitation.    

Also, every Wednesday they have a great deal on certain specials through Instagram if you follow them."

The desserts looked awesome and will try them later on..."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2017-10-08,5.0,The coffee here is great! Its super strong and gets you through the day. My favorite snack is their home made granola which is under 4$ and they give you a cup of milk for it. I have it for lunch sometimes and its super filling. Their expresso shots are better then the cold brew. I suggest ordering a dopio over ice and adding your own milk.

Brush up your snowflake cutting skills and visit this coffee shop as they have amazing coffee and nice baristas!  The soy chai latte is very good, not overly sweet, with a layer of soy milk foam."
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2017-02-03,3.0,"On principle I cannot give this place more than three stars because 1) it is a chain store, mom and pop indie stores 5ever, but more significantly, it's the coffee shop closest to where I work. Therefore it is by default that oasis of no imagination: it's there. I can get non keurig coffee there. 

The drip coffee is dark and VERY strong, I was very caffeinated and dehydrated all day. Vegan bar and carrot cake slab are winners, both not too sweet or oily!!"

780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2018-06-21,5.0,There are two Gregory's near my office and within a block of each other. I love them both. I love the coffee and I'm a snob about coffee. Theirs is one of the few that is really good enough to drink black. Don't get me started on the baked goods. I can't take it. The Chai glazed whole wheat donut and the Chex Mix treat are amazing. The people who work at both locations are exceptional. I'm so impressed. I hope the company keeps growing without losing any of its charm.
780,gregorys-coffee-new-york-3,2014-08-04,4.0,"I work in the same building as Gregory's, so I'm kind of sad I don't come here more often...probably because i'm not a fan of their iced coffee :(

But, their iced lattes and dirty chais are delicious! They also have free tastings from time to time, so definitely drop by when you get the chance! The staff here is also super friendly and nice.

They've recently switched over to levelup, so if you use that app, take advantage of the occasional free credit they give you!"
781,starbucks-new-york-496,2019-12-04,3.0,This location has very friendly employees but ordering from mobile at this location is a mistake you do not wanna make.

Typical Starbucks menu of items.

Really tiny location.  

Very limited seating filled with wifi hogs who take up space for hours nursing one coffee.  

Worst of all the bathroom was closed/ out of order. Really?

Can't drop the kids off at the pool here!"
781,starbucks-new-york-496,2018-01-05,3.0,"It's the little things that sometimes really make all the difference.  When I stepped into this Starbucks today I was a bit put off.  No, it wasn't the seating - there was actually plenty of that free (well, I consider anything above five seats free in a Starbucks ""plenty"") and no, it wasn't the fact that I'm not sure the bathroom was working.  It was partly due to the small mob of school kids who were getting in the way of the line, bumping into customers (and causing them to spill their drinks) and partly the exhausted look on all the barista's faces.  You could tell every single one of them needed a break and that it had been a long day and I felt for them.

The decor in this branch has been upgraded with the wood panel and modern look that most Starbucks branches have adopted.   It is a nice set up and I kind of liked the long bench seating though I can imagine it would get uncomfortable sitting there too long (which might be the point).

So what made the difference?  Frankly the service and end product.  I ordered a Chai Latte and the barista who took my order smiled, was courteous and made it a point to tell me to have a nice day.  That sounds odd to say right?  But how often do you get that at Starbucks?  I sure don't.  The fact that you had these crazy kids in the place, the long hours and so on and she still took the time to do this (and make a good latte to boot)?  Well done Starbucks.  I'll be back when I'm in the area."
781,starbucks-new-york-496,2019-04-06,5.0,"This is the closest Starbucks to my job. Getting my order can be kinda slow, but I guess that's expected given Starbucks is such a hot commodity. That said, everyone is always super nice, but Abie is a rare gem who goes above and beyond for the customers. I could be having the worst morning, and his infectious smile and purity outshines all of that. He is truly remarkable and I'm grateful he's at this location. I'd trust him with my life tbh. I think human interaction is overrated, but he gives me hope in the human race. Please consider giving him a promotion or a raise. He deserves it and is totally carrying this establishment on his back."

He always has a calm smile on, no matter who he is dealing with, which is fascinating to me because I would wanna drop kick everybody that early in the morning. Anyway, he makes my morning calmer.

The woman was busy making drinks, finishing orders and the guy was just standing there--laughing, chatting with her. I figured ""oh, he must be in training, because he's waiting for her to welcome me or say something."" So I waited patiently. After about a minute of this, he finally looks at me, full-on (he'd already noticed me a few times but just didn't say anything) and says ""Whaddya want?"" Lol. Kids these days. I was sort of taken aback I was almost laughing because it was just such poor customer service. If I ever get a job at Starbucks, I'll be sure to ignore guests for a full minute before finally turning to them and saying ""whaddya want."" No smile even to back it up.

The woman was very nice, but this guy was a bit of a tool.

Starbucks itself was very messy. No one had swept in awhile. Perhaps ace over there behind the counter could pick up a broom while he flirts with his lady friend."

He must forget that the customers keep stores open as well as his job!

And they are more pricey than other locations!"

I couldn't help but notice 3 customers came in with their dogs ( not serviced) and a woman had her dog stand up with It's paws on the counter. I've worked for Starbucks 2 years so please let me know if the rules changed where dogs can come and go as they please to get a puppachino. One of the workers was eating or chewing behind the counter very frequently, the music started off ""cafe style"" then it was obvious that someone was playing their own personal playlist (I've done it a few times). If you're going to play your own playlist, make sure it isn't vulgar or so loud. I don't want to hear Rihanna Sex with Me while I'm studying and taking a quiz online (great song tho.) Overall,  the staff is very friendly, animated and lively. I do feel the supervisor needs to ""Supervise"". My drinks were excellent. Thank you."

One time, the barista messed up my order, I kindly told her ordered iced vanilla soy latte and she gave me a hot vanilla soy latte. It was 90 degrees on a summer day so I preferred to have a cold drink. I kindly told her I ordered iced, The barista gave me a dirty look, and was banging on items hard as she re did my drink. Every time I go she always gives me such bad attitude, always changing the pronunciation of my name in purpose and would laugh as she says it and my order takes time while others who ordered after me got their orders first. Because of this I stopped going here and just get my daily lattes at joe's coffee."
781,starbucks-new-york-496,2014-07-30,1.0,"I'm giving three stars instead of five stars because of the long lines. Some staffs are little rude but some are sweet as my coffee. This Starbucks is not a good place to grab a quick drink or to study because of long lines and the noise level is high here.

Edit: Now I'm giving one star because this one worker is actually very rude to me. I'm done drinking with my coffee and waiting for my company here. One of the worker saw me waiting without drink on my table and she points at me from the cashier section and yelled ""you can leave already"". Well, I don't see any regulations posted on the wall or the door for the amount of time you can stay here at Starbucks, so I'm still here sitting at same place without any drink because I finished the drink already. I'm just waiting for my company."
781,starbucks-new-york-496,2017-03-23,3.0,"The prices and quality of food items are not adding up these days with Starbucks. As much as I love the coffee, I have started to purchase other items (food). The portions are overly priced and not always presentable in appearance. Leaves one to believe or think the food isn't fresh. Of course, if it doesn't appear fresh; it's likely not. Take a beware approach when dipping in a Starbucks; no one location is a like. Two stars is what I wanted to leave this location; but the staff was exceptionally nice and held a smile when I pointed out dislikes with their food choices.  That's important!"
781,starbucks-new-york-496,2016-11-16,5.0,"Maybe they replaced the baristas and fixed the bathroom, but my experience was epic here. They were super nice and made one of the best 6 pump chai lattes, no water, extra hot with whipped I've ever had. The manager even came over and asked me how my drink was (Julia). I didn't hang out long, just returned some emails etc, but not sure what everyone is complaining about. Maybe they changed stuff around but it was my favorite Starbucks in Manhattan when I visited!"

I just went in there to get a frap. I am in the middle of a busy thesis-writing schedule and just need some cold coffee and a break from the madness. I go in and order. The barista starts hitting on me, coming on very strong and very creepy, and I want to run away. He says I'll have to wait a couple of minutes for the frap because he wants to talk to me. I told him that's not going to happen -- I just want my coffee. Then he says he might then have to ""lock"" me in the Starbucks until I talk to him. I am totally creeped out. I feel like running out, but he already has my money that I gave when I placed my order. 

Then he says: Do I at least get an A for effort?

No, you disgusting, unprofessional piece of $hIT. You get a C for creep!

I told him: You know, you really shouldn't hit on random strangers. I am married, and it's just not ok for you to hit on me. 

First of all, even if I was completely single, I gave no indication to this creep to hit on me and make my time at Starbucks so completely gross and uncomfortable. I was obviously uncomfortable with his behavior, and he just continued harassing me. 

I got my frap and left, and now I will NEVER go to this location again.
Whoever the manager is needs to fire this garbage."
781,starbucks-new-york-496,2016-12-26,1.0,"I used to go here every morning for a cold brew before work and maybe a bite if I didn't have time for breakfast. 

As the holidays neared, I was given a card upon purchasing my cold brew. Purchase 5 drinks and get a free drink. And given a sticker for said card. 

Anytime I purchased a cold brew, I was given a sticker. Even at a Starbucks on Alton Rd. in Miami. 

When I go in to redeem the card for my free cold brew, the woman behind the counter (caucasian female I believe) tells me I can't redeem it for a cold brew. That it's only for a holiday beverage. 

Well, I don't want some peppermint mocha nonsense. I just want my cold brew. The same drink I've been getting stickers for en route to what I thought was a free beverage. 

When I asked this woman why I wouldn't be able to get a free cold brew given the fact that cold brews were what got me all of the stickers to qualify for the free beverage, her brilliant response.....

""They weren't supposed to give you stickers for the cold brew. They were just being nice"". 

So apparently multiple baristas in multiple cities were ""just being nice"". 

Which I guess means she decided she didn't want to be nice and just honor my card. 

So, this Starbucks will never see a single penny from me again. $4-10 per day out the window. 

And I'll take my business to the Dunkin' Donuts across 23rd street moving forward. 

Well played."
781,starbucks-new-york-496,2014-11-20,2.0,"Well, SOME Starbucks has to be the slowest Starbucks in NYC, I suppose. Pity that it's the one closest to my home! They recently renovated the space so it's much improved from the previous run-down appearance, but what really needs renovating is the staff. 

I don't know whether it's because they're understaffed, or whether it's because 90% of the staff they have is utterly clueless and can't even remember what you asked half a second ago, but this Starbucks has the longest wait times of any that I've been to here. Even when there's only ONE person in line ahead of me, it seems like it takes them a solid 3-5 minutes to finish a simple order. 

Honestly, no matter where you're coming from, you'll probably spend less time getting your Starbucks if you walk over to 7th and 23rd, or down to 8th and 19th. And if you want to see them really flinging the drinks rapid-fire, head to 9th and 15th. From now on, I'm only visiting this Starbucks if I want an excuse to get out of the office for a longer break and utterly kill some time!

Only given a second star because hey, it's still Starbucks, and I love it."

The seating is limited however when the staff sees a non customer sitting they give them every opportunity to purchase a drink or free up some seating for us regulars.

Wait wait i just remembered its because the area has drugs and mischievous individuals who use it as a shower or hang out.

For one the bathroom is out of service every time I come here and there are very few places to sit! I might be being a negative Nancy but I like my Starbucks at least somewhat spacious and with a clean, functioning restroom.  Nothing against the staff here but this place seems poorly maintained."
781,starbucks-new-york-496,2013-10-24,1.0,"Now first of all, this is Starbucks in Manhattan, so there are certain things one can expect.  Lines at 12:30pm on Thursday, 10/24/13 - expected.  Some rushing amongst Baristas - expected.  Perhaps the Half & Half might be empty - expected.

What isn't expected is to be yelled at for informing said frantic Barista that there is no Half & Half in the pourer.  ""We're OUT OF IT!"" she exclaimed, ""USE SOMETHING ELSE."" I was pretty surprised, I didn't know Starbucks actually ran out of Half & Half.  But I was willing to use the Whole Milk just to get the hell out of there.  

I grab the Whole Milk pourer - that's empty too.  I bring it to the front.  ""JUST LEAVE IT THERE"" she yelled.  Within 15 seconds, someone who appeared to be a manager , or at least someone with a calmer head, came out from the back holding a brand new cold Half & Half and Whole Milk pourer.  I told her that the Barista had yelled that Starbucks had run out of milk.  She shrugged, and walked away.  

So - why are baristas declaring they are out of milk items in the middle of the day?  That is something only a manager could decipher.  What I do know is that next time I'm giving my cash to Cafe Grumpy around the corner, where ironically, the staff is really nice to you and lets you drink milk."

I asked why, my coffee with my name was just standing there... he just refused to move his hand and hand me the cup. I asked for a refund since I can't wait any longer.

I am judging this on a scale of Starbucks's... not on a general coffee shop scale.

The staff seems nice, but this location is a little dingier than the average Starbucks.

For me, Starbucks is all about the seating... and this one is woefully lacking.  It's small and however friendly the baristas, it cannot make up for the fact that I can't park my laptop and my latte inside this location.  

The Dunkin Donuts up the street has cheaper coffee, free Wi-Fi and WAY more seating.  There's also a Baskin Robbins.  Need I say more?"

First one of the employees, kept making customers sit on one side of the table as to ""not block the aisle"" which was pretty irrational logistically to have all customers smushed together with little space on fairly big table. Second, since when is seating ""reserved for customers only""? It's a rainy day and it wasn't even crowded. Not even a little. You mean to tell me I can't casually sit there even though I was minding my business? Stupid. I've gone to various locations without buying anything and it was fine.

This is a great location!  Even though it's often crowded, the staff keep the line moving, even during the morning rush.  The store is clean and the milk/sugar station is always stocked.  The baristas are friendly and they always get my drinks right- even though they're overly complicated.  I only wish they had a little more seating."
781,starbucks-new-york-496,2011-08-17,4.0,"PREFACE--I strongly suspect the address may be inaccurate, as I clearly remember this Starbucks being on 8th Avenue, off the corner.

Anyway.......here's why this is a MUST-VISIT location.  Plain and simple, this is people-watching paradise.  The doors, you see, open inwards--i.e., when entering from the street you need to push the door instead of pull.  Since 99% of all businesses have doors that you pull to enter, push to close, this leads to all sorts of confusion, both on entrance and exit (despite the ""push"" and ""pull"" signs clearly affixed to the door).  Sit here long enough and you will see literally dozens of people fight with the door, pulling it like it owes them money, staring in total confoundment inside the store, assuming that if the door isn't opening the way they expect, it must be locked.  

The other day I got a special treat, because in addition to the door drama, the bathroom was also out of order, a situation that always leads to Starbucks Drama with a capital D  (""Is it REALLY not working?""  lol).

Oh yeah....besides all that, the place is nice and clean, laid-back, and doesn't seem all that crowded (perhaps because a large chunk of potential customers think the place is closed)."

Many of these shops have now sprung around the tri-state area with different shapes and sizes. For those who don't know, Paris Baguette is a heaven for someone who loves French-inspired desserts as well as pastries with a Korean twist to makes them lighter and less rich. 

They have goodies from a chocolate chip cookie, and sticky buns to strawberry shortcakes and coffees too.

The bakery items were well stacked and easy to follow for purchasing. I took one of the buns and kept it near the register for the attendant to check out. But the lady at the count picked up my milky bun and added it to the order of another lady whom she was checking out.

When I informed her that it was mine, she realized and called out another employee to do a reversal. It took them some time to figure out how to fix it and send us our ways. The milky bun was very soft and  delicious, but the whole shopping experience for just a single bun was so lengthy that seemed as if I went out on a weekly grocery shopping.

P.S: I've updated my review from a 2 to 4 star rating, considering their genuine care to reach out a dissatisfied customer and compensate with a complement. I declined to take up the complementary offer, but felt their intention should not go unnoticed."
782,paris-baguette-new-york-29,2020-01-01,4.0,"I stopped by here on New Years because I was on my way to Bryant Park and wanted a little snack. I believe this Paris Baguette is new and recently opened up. The interior is very clean and organized. There are not many tables to sit at, so it may be a bit difficult to find seating if they are busy. The employees are friendly and happy to answer any questions.

I ordered 2 chai lattes and 2 raspberry fruit pastries. I really like the raspberry fruit pastry because it was the perfect amount of sweetness. The raspberries didn't taste unfresh/old either. The chai latte was good, but I do wish it was a bit sweeter. It seemed like there was very mininal amount of sugar added into it and mainly milk. So, if you would rather have a drink that isn't too sweet, I would recommend the chai latte.

Overall, I had an amazing experience here and would definitely come back if I am in the area."
782,paris-baguette-new-york-29,2020-03-16,5.0,"Great location in Midtown. I have been to several location throughout New York City, but this one is clean and spacious. I ordered a croissant with small hot chocolate.. both were actually really fresh and tasty. The service was prompt and staff were super friendly, helpful and courteous."
782,paris-baguette-new-york-29,2020-02-02,5.0,"If I lived near here I would eat here every day. Each item, whether breakfast or lunch was beautifully presented, made fresh, and not expensive. There was so much to try! Our chocolate croissants perfect for sharing, brioche sandwich so good, and salad very flavorful."
782,paris-baguette-new-york-29,2020-02-20,4.0,"A little bit of Paris in the big city. It's not quite but it is a bit convincing due to the name and treats. I've been a bit fond of Paris Baguette due to the name and my obsession with Paris but I never fully stopped to grab something to eat. 

So, I took the chance when I was meeting up with a friend. They had a short time so we stop here to grab something to snack on before he had to rush to work. 

It was a cute set up. Definitely a place that's grab and go. Seating area is small but it's understandable due to location. It is in-between herald square and time square soooo you can imagine the foot traffic. It's located on 38th & 6th Ave.

This place is not really a coffee shop. It's more like a pastry shop. Where you come get something sweet and keep going. If you looking for a cake or a mini treat for a coworker or a love one, this is a place to go to. They have many options, all just dependent on what you want and budget. 

What I didn't know was that they didn't have bagels. When I went up to ask for a bagel I was shock. Bagel to me is the cornerstone but seeing what the brand is about I get it. Traditionally the French have pastries and a cup of coffee as their breakfast. Now I'm not sure if that's why the set up is this way but it's a good guess don't you think? 

So we ended up getting the grilled chicken sandwich. What I wanted next was the Belgian hot chocolate because you know I have a thing fo hot coco. But at last they didn't have any so I had to settle with regular got chocolate. I was kinda heart broken. I really wanted to try the Belgian hot chocolate. I hate settling. 

The sandwich was a six out of ten due to the size and price. It's a grilled chicken sandwich with cheese, lettuce and tomato. When you first look at the sandwich it's huge but when they toast it, it decrease in size. I don't think honestly it was worth $9.00. The hot chocolate was also a six out of ten. I like how it was sweet but not too sweet. 

You may not be able to find your basic coffee shop menu items but desserts and cakes are a win here. This is all just how it looks btw. I have not try their cakes/desserts. Maybe next time I'll try a dessert instead. 

BONUS::
The manager at this location was so pleasant and warm welcoming. His name is Ralph. I had to come back and use the bathroom. Before I could even ask he gave me the code. Then when I had trouble, I was saying sorry to bother and he said don't be sorry I'm here to service you. I thought wow, never have I had such a pleasant interaction. He is the reason why I am giving a 4 stars instead of originally 3 I was going to. People don't realize quality customer service goes a long way. Just that extra kindness. Made me feel so important. That I was not inconveniencing him and that he was happy to help me. 
He was more kind than the cashier that was helping me.


It's such a bad habit that we say I'm so sorry to bother when technically the person is there to help us. It's apart of the job. I appreciated that moment honestly."
782,paris-baguette-new-york-29,2020-02-03,1.0,"The worst latte in manhattan.  For close to $6 for a medium and with plenty of competition around you would think this place would know how to make a coffee.  I had a Mocha...it tasted like frothed milk (no espresso flavor) and when I poured it out (because it was undrinkable) all of the chocolate sauce was pooled at the bottom.  

For this type of place, charging that kind of money, I feel robbed and for that reason I'll never step foot in there again."

  I'm not a coffee drinker, but my lady is...so I can't comment on the product except it smelled and acted like regular coffee(i.e. kept her from clawing my fucking eyes out).   

  Place is small, staff is efficient, and the paninis looked dank.   Free wifi and even though I can see it getting filled fast, it still looked like they optimized the area for seating."

I am an addict, but not a snob. It may not have the full flavor of a Pinkberry or Red Mango, but the toppings are fresh, the yogurt is tasty and it is so much cheaper.

Plus free wifi, great AC, very friendly service and plenty of seating? I'm a fan. Now if they'd only open that store in Brooklyn..."
783,roastbean-coffee-new-york,2009-10-10,3.0,"Admittedly this will be a fairly incomplete review as I had a business meeting here and just had a chai latte, but there were still some noticeable pros to RoastBean.  Directly across the street from a Starbucks, RoastBean is slightly dissimilar as they offer frozen yogurt and paninis in addition to the coffee and tea.

The interior is small but suitable.  The service was very friendly and quick and the place was busy the whole time I was there.  I wasn't a big fan of my chai latte - the foam was too creamy and the blend was too much sweet and not enough spice, but I like the environment here and would come back for frozen yogurt or a different tea."

I don't dislike the stuff (I refuse to refer to it by the five letter shortened version in the same way I'd rather put a knife through my eye than say obvi), but is it really that good?

We were walking from the N train to the Del Klose marathon at the UCB when my friend saw a large banner advertising 39 cent/oz frozen yogurt.  I'm not even sure she suggested we should go in, I just followed her to the back of the store and the yogurt options.

I ended up going with cookies and cream frozen yogurt with cocoa puffs, sprinkles and peanuts.  How can that possibly be bad?  It wasn't the best dessert type thing I've ever had, and the cost seemed fine for what I got..  I get what some people are saying about them only providing the extra large cups; you almost automatically get more than you want.  But at the time, that was ok for me.

It's frozen yogurt, which is pretty much the very definition of a-ok for me."
783,roastbean-coffee-new-york,2009-06-11,1.0,"This is just about the yogurt, did not try the coffee
There gimmick is frozen yogurt at .39 an oz. Guess what?? That is no bargain. 
They have several flavors, no nutritional info anywhere, so I am assuming full fat and full sugar. 
The yogurt itself is ok, but the deal is this: they have one extra large size of container and you pull your own yogurt then pay per oz.  So, unless you can get by with a smidge of yogurt sitting at the bottom of a huge bowl, you'll load up and spent the better part of a 10er pretty easily.
No take out bags, not enough help at the counter, poor traffic patten leading to a complete bottleneck to pay.
No."
783,roastbean-coffee-new-york,2009-09-02,4.0,"I really liked the concept of this coffee shop.  Sure, $0.39  per ounce is no steal of a deal, but it is pretty tasty and if you include some of the fresh fruit in the bowl I think it is much more healthy then a blueberry muffin calorie bomb from the Starbucks across the street.

783,roastbean-coffee-new-york,2009-08-26,3.0,"As a coffee shop, this place is so-so.  Definitely go for the fro-yo.  
The music is really loud.  The air conditioning is just a tad bit too cold if you're sitting beneath a vent.  The coffee is pretty good.  They do have free wifi albeit a little slow, but just the fact that there is free wifi is a plus.  There are not many power outlets to be found, so sitting here working on a laptop can be iffy if it's crowded.  

However, the self-serve frozen yogurt with a good variety of toppings is highly recommended by this reviewer.  They have a great selection of yogurt flavors, and it is priced extremely well."

784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2016-02-05,4.0,"I've only been here a total of 2 times. I work up the block from this location and to be honest - I really don't eat McDonald's often...I mean,
I may not be the world's most health conscious eater, but I do know how to keep it real and I'm very ""quality of life""-centric when it comes to what goes into my digestive system - so if the craving for MickeyDs strikes, I'm answering it.

First time I came here I got a grilled chicken snack wrap with small fries. It was my old boss' idea and I went with it...a $5 mildly satisfying lunch on a day where I had fancypants dinner plans after work, sure!

The second time I came here was for a work-related project. They're a corporate client of ours and we needed to photograph a lot of their food for their ""All Day Breakfast"" campaign. In order to do this, own of my awesome coworkers and I came here and ordered $118 DOLLARS WORTH OF FOOD. 

I often joke around in restaurants when the menu looks amazing and I'll say something along the lines of, ""I'll take 5 of everything please!"", but on this particular day I had the pleasure of using that line and meaning it. 

I ordered 5 of everything on their All Day Breakfast menu along with a few other more lunch time suitable meals, a large caramel latte (my coworker) and a regular Oreo McFlurry (that was all meeeeee! I had legitimately been craving an Oreo Mcflurry since last November after a friend's wedding - It was GLORIOUS!!!). 

Our food took maybe about 20 minutes for their team to prepare. They packaged it really nicely in two huge paper bags (I didn't even know MickeyDs even had huge branded paper bags - it's as if they were ready for us, lol) and also provided a good number of napkins, plastic forks/spoons and a separate paper bag full of sauces and condiments. 

I'm sure our order was one of the largest ones they've probably ever seen. 2 or 3 people freaked out upon seeing the order screens in the back and came up front to confirm with us and with the register guy. Nope, it's not a typo - get crackin'! 

We experienced excellent customer service, true efficient and as we waited we enjoyed people watching cuz the clientele here around lunch time is more enjoyable than 70% of the stuff on YouTube. 

I'm sure I'll be back for Oreo McFlurries when the weather gets nice again :)."

I ask her if you want me to pay extra money on my extra BBQ and Honey Mustard and she said No but next time i have to tell before not come and ask for the sauce later. What kind of Rule is this? I always ask another Mcdonald's for extra sauce and no one have problems. This is the first is last time at this spot. Very BAD Service.

784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2017-11-13,1.0,"WARNING: DO NOT EAT THE NEW CHICKEN TENDERS!!!

My friend and I went here because it was convenient. It was closest to our train and cheap considering where we were. The place, itself, is a bit small. No upstairs seating like most in the Manhattan area. Also, there is a common theme to every McDonald's I have ever been to: they're uber sketchy. So shady. 

Anyway, I got my usual 20 piece chicken nuggets and a medium coffee, drowned in 7 sugars and lots and lots of cream. My friend got the 4 piece chicken tenders meal with a large fries so we could share. Now, as he describes it, he said that not all good should be cubed. It's okay with guava or beef jerky but chicken shouldn't be one of them. This was his reaction after the first two bites. 

My friend let me have a bite. Oh man, hahaha. It tasted like a block of inedible chicken. To evoke echo my friend: it's chewy yet juicy. I was not so diplomatic. It was terrible and I couldn't even finished the piece I had in my mouth. He was able to finish enough of it that it wasn't a waste of his money because of ample amounts of Sweet and Sour sauce. In his words: Sweet and Sour sauce makes everything better. 

As always, my chicken nuggets were good as well as the French fries. The latter were golden brown and perfectly salted. So skip the chicken tenders."

Afterward a man came in and asked them to please take his order because he had to go to work. I agreed and instead we had a women speak to us as if we were her kids.

-How did they give me a a fish fillet sandwich with all the fixings but with no fish? (and looked at me crazy when I showed them the proof!)

I don't usually eat McDonalds but when I do, please understand that I'm risking my health and digestive track for 2000+ calories so it should at least (imo) taste good.

Best McDonald's experience I've ever had."
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2018-12-09,1.0,If I could give this location negative stars I would. I was just in there to pick up my food after using the app to order it when the rude cashier who refused to give me her name (but her colleague called her Sota or Soda) called me crazy at least 4 times in front of other customers and her manager who did nothing to reprimand her. Somehow the app didn't work correctly despite my having an order number after I completed the transaction. What kind of people does McDonald's employee when they are allowed to call customers by derogatory terms just because she couldn't seem to find the order number in her system and I wanted her to try and have some extra else assist- namely a manager.

Says the woman, grinning and chatting, and slowly settling in to hang out with the guy working the cash register. He's grinning back, clearly in agreement with her.

As they grin and chat to each other, the other register is taking customers' orders, at a steady pace. Customer after customer places their orders.

""There's two lines!"" she crows, still grinning and gesturing at the empty space behind her, where zero customers are waiting. ""I don't get these people.""

She continues talking, while the other register continues taking orders. A single line continues to form, and move, while she hangs out at the other register....

Let's get something straight lady. When you're busy talking and taking up the register guy's time and crowing about the single line, there's a reason for that. It's because your line ISN'T. FREAKIN. MOVING.

We're not the problem. You are. 

Other than that, not much else to say about this place. McDonald's, you guys need to work your line better. Don't tell us to form separate lines when only one of them is moving. We're not stupid. 

They're convenient. They sell fast food. That's it."
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2012-05-14,2.0,"Coffee. One of the things I just can not live without. It's also one of those things that McDonald's does pretty good.

As it's gonna be a long day at work today and this outpost is right across the street from my office and I had a craving for their coffee I jumped in after getting off the subway. Tasty hot cup of coffee. Mmmmmm.......

Can I just stick an IV into my arm and pump it right into my bloodstream?

Still, this location always seems to have sketchy characters around it begging for change and hanging out at the tables. Even though the place went through a massive renovation last year and looks nice it's still basically the same."
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2014-05-22,1.0,"First of all...this location takes FOREVER! I came in for a simple iced coffee.  Asked for a splash of cream and no sugar...cashier looked at me like I had 3 heads.  Didn't realize that was such a diva request?!  Then the girl making the coffee had to double check what I was asking for...seriously?!? And these workers think they deserve more $$!  Sadly I like McDonald's coffee way better than Starbucks..but a simple request is asking them for too much.  Good coffee.  Horrible service. A plain iced coffee should not take 20 minutes, especially when there are only 2 people ahead of you.  Oh, and I forgot to mention my ""splash"" of cream looks like they dumped the whole damn bottle in there..looks more like a splash of coffee.  See pic!"

784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2013-06-11,2.0,"I don't know why so much hate for a McDonald's? I stopped here for a McChicken since I was ridiculously starving. (It happens to everyone, right?)

Walked in and in awe of how nice this pace was. Large TV sets, glass walls, leather seating that was rather modern and artsy-architectural. Went to the cash register and wanted to buy something but it was CASH ONLY. LIKE WHO DOES THAT? Thank gawd I was with a friend, otherwise I might have rage-quit on them. You don't tell starving people that you are CASH ONLY.

Is a good place to chill and literally a block from my office, so I anticipate coming back -- maybe, if I have cash (seriously though, what the frack?)."
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2016-08-01,1.0,"Worst McDonalds EVER!!!  The cooks in the back are temperamental and have to be coaxed to move quickly. Food is left in the heaters until are sold... I purchased a a dried out over cooked Apple pie at 12:30pm. The stamp time was 9am! The counter help are across the board rude and seemingly have something better to do than take an order. This is definitely a JV team without a good leader!!! Not at all what one could expect from a high traffic store located in Manhattan on Park Ave. 
Take a few more minutes and walk to the Madison Park McDonalds. Much nicer there."
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2016-01-18,3.0,"This location is insanely over priced, incredibly slow and filled with entitled customers. However, their employees are very nice, very talkative and engaging. I was impressed with how the overnight front counter clerk was talking with those who engaged with her. 

However, should there be a rush, they were intensely understaffed."
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2017-07-08,1.0,The male manager on duty on Saturday afternoons is a real creep and a lousy manager. This is the worst McDonald's in Manhattan. The food is always room temp. They don't have coke in the coke machine. The place is filthy!
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2013-12-21,1.0,"Other than the fact that its super conveniently located right outside of 28th Street Station (6) on Park Avenue and that it has more electric outlets than your average coffeeshop, offerings are the same crappy low class food you'll find at any McDonalds across the nation. I like their $1 Coffee and Sweet Teas though

One thing that's annoying is the Latino looking manager hunting people down for chilling or 'loitering' around the tables. But for those of us who bought something, leave us the FUCK alone and CHILL OUT and stop giving that certain 'look' like we're some jobless thugs or something. Some of us want to unwind after a 15 hour work shift with some coffee while charging our phones for God's sake!

I saw a shady Black (yes I emphasize race because that is keeping it mad fucking real just like YOU want it homies!) drinking beer out of a brown bag and loitering around and the manager didn't do anything. Que idiota cabron que sos ni verga te pareces manager jodido! Lol"
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2015-07-07,1.0,"Worst McDonald's I have ever been to. Slowest service on earth, they have a screen that lists what numbers are being served but for some reason 3 people simultaneously still are screaming out numbers. I asked for non fat milk in my iced coffee and you'd think I asked her to harvest the coffee straight from the beans or something the way she looked at me and turned to a fellow co worker to tell her what I asked for. Meanwhile someone was on a ladder in the middle of the store doing something with the roof while it's extremely busy... And not to sound like a stickler but they didn't put any of the caramel sauce on top of my iced coffee I guess since I asked for a ""special"" request....."
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2017-09-28,1.0,"They charge 55 cents for a water cup and 25 cents per extra sauce you get after the first complementary one. The staff is very unfriendly and demeaning, and the restaurant is dirty and badly maintained. Will never return to this location."
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2014-04-04,3.0,"It's McDonalds: same tasty menu and options. The location is convenient as it's located right by the train in case you emerge from the space below with cheeseburgers on your mind. I do like the computer display system that allows you to see when your order is ready and something about the layout seemed newer than other McDonalds, but maybe I was just excited because I was having a killer craving."
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2015-01-02,2.0,"Come here if you're looking for an uncomfortable experience. 

The cashiers as well as the customers make this an unpleasant experience.  Initially, I intended on staying here to eat. However, within 5 minutes of stepping in this Mcdonald's, I did not wish to stay at this establishment any longer. The cashier seemed extremely disinterested in his job and mumbled the whole time. 

While waiting for my order, a man approached me and attempted to talk to me. I made it blatantly obvious that I did not wish to converse with him, however he continuously tried talking to me. There was also another customer who told the cashier to call his friend because he needed some Xanax."

784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2015-03-12,1.0,"Avoid this one as much as possible. They constantly have homeless people and drug addicts hanging out here especially in the evening after 630. I've seen management try to kick them out but they just come back a few minutes later. If management did a better job at keeping them out or calling the cops to get them out, I'd give them 3-4 stars."
784,mcdonalds-new-york-106,2016-12-13,1.0,"Waited 25 mins in line. One person at register. No ice cream.  No apologies. Once my sandwich was ready, they kept skipping over it until I insisted they hand it to me. It had to be because I dared mention how long I waited. It made me concerned to eat it so I threw it away. Worst fast food experience ever"
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2020-01-12,3.0,"During the week mornings it's overcrowded due to the surrounding offices, it's to be expected. But the amount of mistakes made with food AND drink orders is almost comical at this point. Additionally, their mobile ordering is always off when it makes no sense for it to be, particularly weekend mornings when the store is empty."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2018-10-07,5.0,"I was seeking out aother great Starbucks location near my job. I was in need of their passion lemonade tea and Bingo! This location had it. 

I received GREAT service at the register when I asked for my refill. I am currently a gold member via the app so my refills are absolutely free. A barrista almost insisted that the refills are only for coffee, but a manager had to correct her. Thereafter I left with a great drink and happy with the service. 

Pros: 
no long lines
Nice barristas
Fast service
Great drinks

Cons:
Not well informed employees

Enjoy!"
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-07-19,5.0,"This has got to be the best Starbucks. In a way, I am glad too many people give it one star.  I hope it does not get too busy, although it is VERY BUSY in the mornings M-F.
The design of the space is comforting and they have Reserve Starbucks similar to a five star restaurant or hotel, VIP members only section.  Right now at 3PM it's extremely crowded and noisy like the stock exchange with the finance crowd! 
;)"
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-07-18,5.0,"My perfect rating is based on how classy this location is.  I have never been inside a Starbucks Reserve Bar before and the experience was amazing. 

 We just want to grab a cup of coffee and extend to this place our interrupted girls talk from the lobby. The ambiance inside for a coffee shop standard  is  very pleasant and relaxing. Perfect for a meeting. Perfect for computer works. Perfect to study.

The location  offers more than the regular SB coffee shops. More coffee choices. More desserts. More pastries choices. More sandwiches choices. They are using eye catching special equipment dedicated for premier coffees. The baristas are friendly. Plenty of seats to choose- from the bar to lounges to group tables to individual chairs. Plenty of charging station that will make you smile. 

My girlfriends had coffees. They all loved Starbucks coffee. They are die hard Starbucks fans. I had their strawberry- green tea cold drink. For some reason, I enjoy trying whatever on their current special seasonal  promotion. I want to be part of the team that could say something about it especially if they decided to keep it and put it out there after the  test. Honestly, I like cold drinks over hot especially on this kind of summer temperature. Their tea pleasantly surprised my taste buds. This is how I wanted my cold tea be done. 

We didn't wait long as others were complaining about.  We could had come on the right time. 

I'll suggest this place for friends that will be meeting up in the future. 

Just perfect."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-11-06,4.0,"So to me all Starbucks are the same, especially when all I order are vanilla lattes. This location however has a reserve bar where you can sit at a bar stool and watch them make some cool drinks. 

I had a friend in town who absolutely lives off coffee and bringing him here was like bringing a kid to the candy store. He really enjoyed it! I tried some of the samples they had and really liked them, they also had what looked like coffee on tap. It was a cool experience, for me I'll be sticking to my usual but for those that really enjoy the process of making coffee this is a cool place to visit."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2019-10-23,1.0,"This is a very busy store and no doubt the staff are under pressure most of the day. This is not an excuse to be rude to customers. If someone asks checking on there order it's because it has taken too long to make, 20min to heat up something is too long. The coffee is average at best. That combined with the servers attitude that it is a privilege for me to be ordering there will not entice anyone back. Online orders also go missing all the time."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-04-16,5.0,"This is probably one of the most luxurious (decor and atmosphere wise) Starbucks I've been too!

A friend that visits this Starbucks often told me about it and we met up to catch here last year. I never knew it existed until my friend brought me here and boy was I hooked up the decor and atmosphere here. It's not your typical Starbucks because they have leather couches, plenty of standing room, and super cozy. This Starbucks is different because they  it has Starbucks Reserve drinks which are suppose to be more top of the line and etc.

I came here twice with my friend and the customer service and atmosphere hasn't disappointed me here. I tried the Nitro Cold Brew and it is amazing! I've had Nitro Cold Brew at other coffee shops before, but this one is a lot more stronger and doesn't taste acidic. They also serve it in an interesting cup where you can also get a lid for it if you need one. 

This Starbucks can get crowded especially around the afternoon. I don't know how it is in the morning, but I would imagine it's more peaceful. I like this Starbucks a lot because it feels like a nice space and place to be outside of work and school. It's a nice place to sit in and just enjoy your cup of joe!"
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2018-05-29,4.0,"The music is LOUD. So it's like going clubbing at 10am while getting your coffee.

This place is packed during the week but has a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere Sat/Sun. 

I would totally give it 5 stars if not for the loud music. Also, love their high ceilings and spacious layout."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2018-11-10,4.0,In my opinion the best Starbucks in New York.. the great part is that you can customize the drink you like and brew it whichever way you like because they have all kind of machines available
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2018-08-19,1.0,"There's no way to sugarcoat this. This place is terrible. I know that you don't come into a Starbucks with high hopes-to say the least-but this one fell below even my very modest expectations. Despite the fact that it was nearly empty-I was the third guest-it took over five minutes for the staff to even say hello. When I was greeted it took forever for them to accommodate me-as they chatted with each other at their leisure. The wretched pop music was overpowering, despite the fact that hardly anyone was there, and it also wasn't the cleanest location I've ever been to. 

Hard pass."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-06-04,4.0,"The ratings here seem to based not on the drinks or service,  but on how busy this location is.  If you had to wait a long time for your latte,  how about you take a moment to look up from your phone and think about how many people are around you.  If you chose rush hour at Starbucks,  that's your problem and not theirs.

Now let's talk about what matters.  COFFEE!!!
This reserve bar is killin it!  These guys know how to pour a shot.  I've traveled up and down the west coast.  From Seattle to San Francisco.  Trying the best roasters.  And I love this Starbucks.  It is the best Starbucks.  I also say this with the caveat that usually on my travels, Starbucks is a desperate last resort that leaves my stomach hurting.  Not here.  I trust their pour.

Besides making a dope espresso drink,  they are super nice, and very very fast.  The amount of customers they manage to process is incredible.  I've even had customers check out my flat white at the sugar station and ask me... hey what did you get?  It's a flat white baby,  treat yo self next time.  Pass on your adult sugar rush, forget the frapp, and trust the reserve bar to make you a drink you would swear came from a tiny hipster mom and pop shop."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-04-05,5.0,"This is the premium Starbucks called ""Starbucks Reserve"". The ambience is fantastic, professional and clean. I guess it makes sense since  it's in world financial center you don't have to deal with NYC tourist crazy crowd.  It's a good place for business meeting or casual hangout. They serve premium coffee bean called ""Reserve"" but seems to be okay nothing exciting about the coffee. Definitely recommend it! 

FYI- Address on yelp seems to be wrong, I would recommend to check on Starbucks app for right address"
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2016-05-13,4.0,"Let me get this out the way... Though they have seating this is not a typical sit down and spend the rest of your day here Starbucks. It's inside one of the Brookfield Place buildings so it gets tons of traffic from the workers in that building and the other ones its connected to. Nonetheless even with the high volume the service is quick and friendly - they even take your name but I rather them not stress trying to spell mine so I stick to initials...  

This visit was a bit funny because they got my drink wrong and had no one to blame but themselves because they didn't read the nicely printed sticker. But like I said it's a high volume store, their working with their buddies so mistakes happen. My drink was quickly fixed with no fuss and they were still chipper about it....  Most of all... dun dun dun... my drink was darn good!!!! (Iced Venti, No Ice Chai Latte!!!!) 

I'll definitely be back cuz once you're hooked, you're hooked!!!!"
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2016-12-06,3.0,"In this location, you have to drink your coffee with your pinkies up, very fancy plaza. The demand of this location can be chaos and the line can be left out of the premises, but the staff is always well lethargic and able to handle it.  The coffee are very well made, you also can see it when they make in front of your eyes. 

The establishment is quite large and most of the furniture is very comfortable which makes a perfect place to have a good coffee chat or study which is your preference. 
It, needless to say, The WiFi is free as other Starbucks."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2019-07-15,1.0,"Waited over 30 minutes for my mobile order and they got the order wrong.  Don't use this Starbucks, go to one of the others a few hundred feet away.  It's worth the extra two minute walk."

I got a Sun-Dried Brazil Sertão latte  (milk chocolate and toffee note with a malty sweetness) doesn't that sound fancy this place is one of the few Starbucks that doesn't feel like Starbucks. Baristas are all ways friendly and help only downside to this place is it gets really crowded. All n all this place is a must to visit."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-03-16,2.0,Would have given it a 5 but I went here just after 6 after seeing that they open at 6 from the Starbucks app.  I was surprised when the doors were locked at 6:10am and a worker inside said they open at 6:30am.  A corporate business such as this cannot just open when they feel like.  They should be opening as advertised. Disappointed.

May 2017 update:
Ok in January they had recently opened.  Still slow, how can they be so bad.

January 2017:
There are 10/15 baristas and it is sloooow.  Took over 10 minutes to get coffee.

This is World Financial Center."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-04-19,3.0,Beautiful Starbucks reserve and the cafe was spacious and relaxing just to be inside. But the wait for my drink was way too long and no one else was waiting. Super nice as it is a reserve and has other coffee menu
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2015-10-09,4.0,"You can not get any more basic than Starbucks.

This location is mainly in place for people who work in one of the world trade/liberty street buildings and the line tends to go pretty fast even though it is usually long. Since I have been going here they have never messed up my drink and I got a free drink once cause someone from starbucks corporate was there.

So if you are feeling the need for coffee that is always good you can go here."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2019-01-27,5.0,"This has been one of the best Starbucks that I have ever been to. I visit in the mornings during the week and let me say the staff there are very friendly, and efficient.  Even some mornings when it is extremely busy that am staff still remained friendly and got the customers in and out. I hope their boss knows how hard they work. Keep up the good teamwork."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-01-26,1.0,"I waited almost 15 minutes for a pour over that it turns turns out was put to the side. 

At first I though this was a one off thing so I return later after 4. They are out of everything but kindly offer me a pour over. I think nothing of it until I realize they are charging me extra for a pour over version of what they had run out of on drip. 

Every time I've tried going here there is either an extensive wait, overcharge for some random item, or poorly done coffee. For what they charge there are many places in this area that do it substantially better for the same price or a little less."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-09-11,1.0,One of the slowest starbucks ever. Its across the street from WTC & its 9/11. Lots of people. The baristas were too busy chatting with regular customers & joking & dancing with each other to give good service. Regulars who came in & paid after me were given their drinks before mine. Then manager was having meeting with some employees & took up 3/4 of seating in the back of store. The seating is beyond small. Paying customers were standing or sitting in window sills to accomodate the employees sitting at tables by themselves instead of having meeting outside in lobby. Horrible service
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-10-13,1.0,"If you plan on waiting 10mins for your drink, sure come here. If you get a dam green tea frap and it's overfilled it's hell on your work clothes why the fuck do they always seem to overfill at this location, like today it overfilled and spilled all over the cup, my hands were sticky by the time I got to my office (soon I noticed my clothes were stained as well) And can I say they pick favorites the dude in front of me got his drink overfilled and spill onto his cup, the lady just gave him another cup ontop of his cup why the fuck didn't I? Seriously fuck this location"

785,starbucks-new-york-417,2016-08-17,2.0,"What can you say about this Starbucks location. Well, the people who work here are super rude, not at all welcoming and basically just ugly people who are about as unpleasant as anyone can be.  You kinda just have to suffer through and get your drink.  

I can't imagine being encapsulated in such a miserable existence all day.  When you leave this place you can feel the tension dissipate.  Go Starbucks."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2016-10-09,1.0,Service is slow at best.  Music is too loud on the weekends. They should rotate everyone out of this location and start again with new staff.

- Fast order processing.
- Always greeted with a smile. 
- Courteous interaction.

785,starbucks-new-york-417,2015-10-28,2.0,Today's service was awful! Ordered a regular coffee and a toasted bagel with cream cheese. Got the bagel with cream cheese about 10 minutes before I finally got my coffee. When I went to put sugar and whole milk in my coffee. They had both vessels empty! They are usually better than this but today they were awful!!!
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2017-05-10,1.0,"Hit or miss Starbucks. Ordered coffee at 11am and was in and out with correct order. Came back at 330 for happy hour to get a frappucino and the barista didn't listen. They made me a latte, not even close to my order. If I didn't work in sports and had time I would have argued it."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2013-03-09,4.0,"Great new location after moving from 3 WFC due to renovations in the complex.

Really love the new aesthetic that Starbucks is bringing to its new stores, the natural wood, the open airy space. In this new location that have made great use of the space, a large communal table, and even some seating tucked away behind the service area for more discrete get togethers.

It's Starbucks, so if you are a fan then this is definitely a great new spot to check out. The staff are friendly and the coffee is just fine. Crowd control is the only issue here during peak business hours, with people ordering tripping up over one another."
785,starbucks-new-york-417,2014-10-10,1.0,"I'm not one for reviews, but this Starbucks is horrible. The lines are always long, the staff is slow and unfriendly, and somehow they always seem to be out of the type of milk you're wanting. Why a coffee shop is out of half and half on a weekly basis is puzzling. This store is also always at least ten degrees colder than the rest of the building, at best. I used to work a few blocks away and had nothing but good things to say about the staff and service there. Unfortunately I can't say the same about this store. Do yourself a favor and go to Devon and Blakely or Olive instead."

785,starbucks-new-york-417,2016-06-27,3.0,"Service has gone down since they put the mobile app in place. The printers don't work. I've been late for work multiple times. It is complete chaos lately. Drinks are made incorrectly. Waiting almost 30 minutes for an iced coffee with sweet cream is not ok. The lines are out the door and once inside all you hear is other customers complaining about the same issues. If you can't keep up with the mobile orders maybe you should only use it during less busy times if that is even possible. I feel bad even writing this because the people that work behind the bar are so pleasant , the coffee shop has just become pure chaos and they can't keep up."

The employees bustle around and get you in and out in a timely fashion."
786,mcdonalds-new-york-419,2019-07-31,3.0,Customer service is poor! I had an issue with the machines and the cashier accused me of trying to get a free meal. Had to get the manager involved to explain what happened.

786,mcdonalds-new-york-419,2017-11-22,4.0,"A little slow-paced on a Friday night, but near some nightlife so I'm sure traffic picked up later and hence the pace. No public restrooms, but restrooms for customers! Go on, get yourself a lil' burger so you can pee! There were stairs to go upstairs, but they were closed so the downstairs was teeny. But there were open seats! There's also an ATM inside!"
786,mcdonalds-new-york-419,2017-09-17,2.0,"Two stars for getting my order right. Minus three stars for the terrifying clientele, the urine smells, the very long wait times, the cold fries, the lack of line/queuing guidance. 

You can sit downstairs at a counter or upstairs and sit with homeless/mentally ill people who will have loud, sometimes threatening conversations with themselves. Or if your oblivious daughter looks at one of them (breaking the cardinal NY rule) they will verbally assault you. After that other people will make rounds asking for change and become furious when you refuse them. Really regret bringing my family here."
786,mcdonalds-new-york-419,2019-02-18,2.0,"For being listed as the Fanciest McDonald's by the Gothamist I can't say the experience was any different (from any other McDonalds).

786,mcdonalds-new-york-419,2013-07-05,3.0,"Growing up in New York McDonald's was like the ultimate meal for children which was better than NYC Board of Education's typical lunch.  Fast forward... to adult years of 2013 era where it is not an ideal nutrition nor health conscious.  I came here specifically to attain two measly apple pies totaling $1.00 as I love apple pies.  Note:  Apple pies are sold as a set of two where patrons cannot purchase one.

Service at 686 Avenue of the Americas McDonald's store # 17480 is quick as it was before the peak lunch hour chaos and seating is limited."

786,mcdonalds-new-york-419,2018-08-02,1.0,"Horrible  customer service! General manager/ owner lacked professionalism, a short Spanish man with balding hair. I will not spend another dime in this establishment. It seems he may only be hiring spanish people here.  I only noticed Spanish workers . I paid  for a coffee  the manager/owner took my order,  and the server refused to give me my coffee.  Even after she served several others and stood with one large coffee in her hand, I told her it was my large black coffee. She looked at me and did not respond. at that point, I had requested speak with the manager possible store owner who took my order, I explained that the server had my coffee and although I told her I ordered a large black coffee she refuse to give me my order.    This Manager/ possible owner  stated I had a bad attitude.    It was a younger manger who came over and gave me my order. 
I am seeing other reviews that are striking a similar cord.   This owner or head manager is clearly the problem with this establishment.   I don't patronize McDonald's for much more than a coffee, I surely won't step foot in this place again.   This man  clearly felt comfortable disrespecting a paying customer.  I felt very disrespected a black women in this establishment."
786,mcdonalds-new-york-419,2013-01-08,3.0,"Apparently I am the Duchess of this establishment. That's kind of depressing. I blame its proximity to my job (next door) and one of my best friend's boyfriends (he occasionally posts photos of McD french fries and then I need them immediately).

As Christopher M. points out, ""the food is good. It will kill you but it is good."" I have to agree. The... quality? of the food here is generally better than at other McD's. When I say that, I mean that the meals are definitely more put together. I do not mean the food is made out of better things because that's just not true at all in any way.

I've also found the service here to be consistent, fast, and friendly. Unlike every McD I have ever regularly patronized, they've never gotten my order wrong.

Finally, the dining areas at the front of the store are always clean when I go. They seem to be on top of keeping them wiped down.

There are infinitely better options in the area, but if you need something that is fast and cheap because you are short on time or money, it's going to be good-ish here."

The worst part of this location is definitely the staff though. They are rude, uninterested, unhelpful, unapologetic, accusatory of customers (I was told ""Do you see 'no cheese' on the receipt? You must have ordered it wrong"", as if I'm not familiar with my dietary restrictions). Don't ever go here."

786,mcdonalds-new-york-419,2015-02-06,3.0,"I bumped this review up to 3 stars. Mainly because the service has been a lot better and more attentive than it used to be. Plus I went into and got to huh someone as payment instead of money which was pretty rad. 

Still need to work on the nightly homeless shelter that gets together in front. Please please work on this, so uncomfortable getting swarmed for change every time going there."
786,mcdonalds-new-york-419,2016-09-27,4.0,Great staff. This place could be busy at lunch time around 12pm but drive thru service is fine. Restroom is not so clean. There are always people around this place and sometimes even inside begging for change or asking to get them food or drinks
786,mcdonalds-new-york-419,2017-05-02,2.0,"I never go to McDonald's. Ever. But today... I needed something quick and not expensive. Enter McD's... ordered one of those new signature crafted sandwiches - really just for the maple bacon - and imagine my surprise when there was no bacon on it. Very disappointing.

      I had a coupon for a free small coffee with purchase of a large sandwich. Coffee costs the same, no matter what size you order, so i asked for a large instead. He gave me a whole cock and bull story about he couldn't accomodate my  order because it would 'mess with his cup inventory' when i'd seen, on more than one occasion, associates throwing away cups from incorrect orders and their own personal drinks. What a liar...! Needless to say, he lost a customer that spent 35-40 dollars a week over .40 cents worth of coffee.
      There is also a young hispanic girl that works in the morning that always has an attitude.
    I gave it two stars, because there is a dark skinned woman (Jamaican, Maybe?) Who is the sweetest, nicest mcd's associate i've ever dealt with. She would know my order and have it waiting before i even got to the counter.
     However, because of consistently bad service, i now go to the dunkin donuts on 23rd for breakfast instead.

Might want to avoid this one."

This location is near my work, so I stopped by for a quick breakfast meal there (I crave their hushbrowns sometimes).  What a disappointment!

However, by this point it was my turn to order, a lady that was the same race as the cashiers cuts in front of me. I tell the cashier that I was next. She looks at me as if I spoke in some unintelligible language, gives me a dirty look, completely ignores me and waits on the woman who cut in front of me. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother writing reviews about places but I feel as though it was because of my race that I was ignored."

The food is good, it will kill you but it is good. I prefer the big mac sometimes I am a quarter pounder type guy.  The fries, I love the fries. The reason I am given them three stars is the place should be a little more clean. If your food will kill people at least provide them a sanitary environment to eat it in."

They take a cheeseburger, remove the buns and shove the remnants into a wrap.
I can predict the future today. Filet-o-fish snack wrap. It was actually pretty tasty :o

Angus THIRD Pounder Swiss & Mushrooms Burger
The Swiss cheese and the mushrooms were a nice addition. However, the Third Pounder Angus patty was disappointing. It was dry and flavorless. I can, and do, all too often, enjoy dry and flavorful fast food burgers (The Triple Whopper is my favorite!). The flame-broiled exterior, tomatoes, lettuce, and ketchup meld it into a very good burger (TRiple WHopper!!).

But, this burger was dry, and flavorless.

I don't mean to spread insult on top of injury, but they charge over seven bucks for this cow pie!

For two bucks more, I'd be feasting on a Peter Luger's Burger, Shake Shack Burger, Corner Bistro Burger, Jackson Hole Burger, etc...."

And instead of the cashier instead offering to do it herself, she GAVE ME THE WASHRAG. And then a fight broke out and the staff acted like nothing ever happened. But then again, what could they do? All in all...this place is ghetto as hell. Not to mention, the bathroom on the first floor doubles as a dressing room for homeless people. It is so filthy that when I walked into it, I thought I stepped into the basement in the movie, ""SAW III"". YUCK!"

The handful of cheeseburgers and iced coffees I've had have been consistent, but service here is slow and odd. From the halting, unsure behavior of the cashiers, you would think I was the first person to ask for a cheeseburger to go. There's no need to go the salad fridge, the soda fountain, ask a coworker, and then look in the french fry machine. Are the cheeseburgers not slotted at the same counter each time? Where might this cheeseburger come from? Where has it been? Truly troublesome! I shudder to think of the bathrooms."

There is one large, central communal table, along with more private stools at the ample, floor-to-ceiling windows, with a nice view of Broadway/31st if enjoying the weather--or people watching--is your coffee-drinking pleasure. 

They just opened Monday, and are having a half-price off all coffee drinks promotion, which seems quite generous. My cortado was excellent, full-price quality at the bargain rate $2.12. And the salted peanut butter cookie was nice as well. Smallish selection of food/pastries, but a beautiful setting for great coffee, with friendly baristas who seem to know what they are doing."

Don't assume the size.) 
While annoyed, it wasn't too much a big deal until I took a sip. The taste was very harsh because they defiantly used the last bit of the coffee beans. Very bitter and burned taste.

Store # 7792 in Flatiron where the setup does not handle crowds well for order pickup as it is one chaotic mess.  My daily deal is always simple that consist of hot Green Tea and/or one banana or fruit salad mix which I never have to wait an eternity.  Oddly, the price for the fruit salad deluxe at $3.55 is slightly less than other Starbucks.  The condiment stand counter is a giant mess with spills from customers' coffee, sugar spills and no ""Splash Sticks"" available.

There are very few tables or couch to sit for newspaper reading or laptops.  This location is very cold, uninviting, impersonal and not welcoming."

After I complained to the trainee, the busy-bodied barista jumps in to loudly complain that it was my fault! He then continued to mock me and make rude comments while he made the correct drink.

Oh yeah, I think there was a restroom here for customers. However, self-important and pretentiously naive baristas and forgettful baristas lower this place from 3 to 2 stars.

Get rid of the red haired girl and all the ghetto baristas that seem to give customers an attitude when THEY are the ones who messes up customers' drinks.

I like it because it is definitely less crowded than all the other starbucks that I pass by every morning on the way to work.  The long lines make me cringe, but this location is practically empty.  They have a few tables and mostly counters to look out the window.  The staff there are tolerable, nothing more and nothing less.  

I like my french vanilla coffee, and if I am feeling adventurous, I throw in a shot of half-and-half."
788,starbucks-new-york-114,2015-08-29,1.0,Bought my coffee and these people don't have a restroom for their customers. Omg.  One more thing I hate about NYC
788,starbucks-new-york-114,2016-03-04,1.0,"Aside from the fact that it is poorly constructed and uncomfortable once 10 or more people are inside, the customer service is awful. One person in particular, Annie is her name. She seems to think the faster she gives someone their coffee the better. NO! Listen to the person and give them what they ask for in an orderly fashion. She rushes and encourages you to yell your order to her while she is doing something else just to get you out of there faster. Throw in an attitude along with that type of work regimen? Not a place or person you want to deal with, ever. Annie and this Starbucks go hand in hand. They both are GARBAGE!"
788,starbucks-new-york-114,2011-12-09,3.0,"Dear Hardworking Barista, 

In the event you see someone waiting for the restroom, kindly refrain from running the water. You're making it very hard for them to wait! 

Signed, Puddle Preventor

P.S. Just like every Starbucks in the city, the restroom floor is sopping wet!"
788,starbucks-new-york-114,2011-06-18,3.0,"When you think of Starbucks what comes to mind is drink, unwind, chat, get some work done, snack....etc. You are catching my drift here, eh. Well Not at this location, it is not great at all. The staff is not as professional and friendly as other locations in the city. There is one particular barista that always seems to be having a bad day. He serves with a nasty attitude. And don't bother telling them that your drink is not up to par. You are better off going to another location and have them remake the drink. This location is such a small place, they do not have comfortable seating. 
And let me say, I Love Starbucks! For the summer time the Mocha Coconut Fraps are amazingly delicious. In the winter time I like to dive into a Caramel Machiato. Yum Yummy. 
If you are in the area Don't Bother going to 27th and 6th. 

Go down on 6th ave to 24th and you will receive the costumer service that you deserve. The staff here are Awesome and there is plenty of seating space."
788,starbucks-new-york-114,2016-08-18,1.0,"Ugh, pretty disappointing for a Starbucks. Went here every work day for a week, every time something was wrong. My name was wrong 3/5 days, order was wrong 2/5 days. There seems to be 6 employees but only 3 are working.

At least, I HOPE they are, because flakiness like this really ought to be drug-induced. 

There were only two people ahead of me in line. One was arguing with the staff because they got her order wrong (and apparently charged her wrong, because she went back to the cash register and had to re-do her transaction), and the other appeared to be polishing off War and Peace on his iPad.

It took twenty minutes to get my Frappucino. Literally. Twenty minutes. With two people ahead of me. After around Minute 14 I was like, ""hi, I ordered a [caffeinated milkshake for grownups], did you plan on making it for me?""

They asked my name. Like they had planned on remembering it when I gave it at the register. Like a Starbucks with only three people in line should even NEED your name. 

I mean, there were three people behind the counter. One to service each of us.

Or, the way they do things, three to do whipits in the back room."

I needed a coffee.  Badly.  

Despite the dreaminess of the previous night's activities, there was no way that I could deny my sleep deprived state (""Godammit, you should know better by now!,"" the Little Voice scolded me.   ""I know, I know,"" I replied, ""If I give you a cup of coffee will you forgive me?"" I asked.  ""I'll think about it,"" sniffed the Little Voice, and then turned to look at some cute shoes in a store window we were walking past.)

And on the way to yet another nondescript commercial casting I kept my word:  A coffee for the L.V. and a package of madeleines for me.  Like all of the stores in it's ever-growing family there are the usual coffees and treats.  However this Starbucks is one of the transient kinds--people constantly moving in and out, checking their calendars, checking their messages, never quite staying long enough to really make eye contact with their fellow caffeine addicts.  I can't blame them.  Though there are tables to sit at, the acoustics at this Starbucks are not what I would call ear candy.  A cellphone conversation at this location is in my experience, close to impossible.  I hope that Mr. X doesn't try to call me now, I thought.  I wonder if he'll ever call again.  (""What a surprise THAT won't be,"" says the L.V.  ""You may be right,"" I reply.)  But I realize that I'm hoping he proves her wrong."

789,paris-baguette-new-york-27,2020-02-24,5.0,My favorite place to get a croissant and a hot chocolate. NOTE: they changed the chocolate they use so now it's a Belgium dark chocolate which is still great but you have to make sure that you ask them to put in the sweetener or else it is a hot bitter mess.
789,paris-baguette-new-york-27,2020-01-29,3.0,"I've been to several locations, so I feel like I can accurately compare and give a fair assessment. This Paris Baguette seems disorganized, with the staff a little clueless with what the store offers and a bit of an attitude.
Being that it is a chain store, shouldn't they be offering the same things? A simple iced green tea shouldn't throw one off. I had to suggest that she charge it as a black iced tea and not a more expensive latte....just common sense. 
still, as mentioned in the beginning of this review, I go to Paris Baguette for a reason and it's for their bread/pastry products which were standard here."
789,paris-baguette-new-york-27,2019-11-06,4.0,"I miss the Union Square branch (the roominess of space!) but now they opened a branch right by 23rd street.  It's still fairly new, the service consistency is not there... yet. I've been here quite a few times during the breakfast hours. 
I love their pastry and cakes, it's lighter than the usual American cafes (lighter in sugar). 

Process at Paris Baguette: 
Upon entering, pick up your tray, lay down a parchment paper, pick up a pair of tongs and begin selecting your treats! 

I would often buy a good 5-7 items for my team.
Some staff would individually wrap the pastry, which is great because someone on my team is allergic to nuts. This would prevent cross contamination.  However, literally the next day, another staff would just pick the pastry up with the wax/parchment paper and put them all together into a paper bag.  When that happened, I had to buy another pastry but asked it be separated. Then there's one time, when a staffer misheard what I ordered and overcharged me - but thankfully, her manager was able to correct and refund my card. 

I welcome having a lighter yet delicious option, as opposed to their friend next door (chick-FIL-a) with a food coma induced type breakfast.  Enjoy!!

Surprised that they don't have Apple Pay! 

Staff is friendly and service is quick!

Had the breakfast croissant sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it! The croissant was perfectly flaky and buttery, as I'd hoped. 

Will definitely be back! This would be a nice place to get some work done on my laptop or read a book."
789,paris-baguette-new-york-27,2019-09-27,2.0,"Yeesh service was positively horrendous!

 I tried to give my tray to the girl behind the register but she kept reaching over the register to bag my items. How does that make sense?? She was also embroiled in an argument with her manager, another customer and another associate. They all kept saying we are out of green tea, we are out of green tea! (They can't brew more or...?) The poor lady was waiting for her green tea cake. Afterwards my girl was just speaking poorly under her breath about her manager for the remainder of my time there. I was also THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WAITING TO PAY. 

I hope they're just working out the kinks but that was a TERRIBLE experience."
789,paris-baguette-new-york-27,2019-12-02,2.0,"I worked for 1y on this block without ever having noticed this location until today thus this location must be just a few months old.

Their Union Square, 8th Ave, and Chinatown locations among others have all closed recently, the result of poorly executed aggressive expansion plans 2y ago. Pity but it's expected given my long-term disappointment by their cakes. From 6y to 3y ago, my family and I would for a nearly month pace of someone's birthday would get the blueberry yogurt cake ($36). It was a family favorite since it had rich cream, light blueberry taste, a difficult-to-control recipe, lovely consistency and texture, and overall stellar quality. A restaurant's ability to repeat a dish sets it apart from other providers. We noticed the rapid fall off of all those factors 3y ago and rapidly within 2 cake buys switched to the then rising and equally expanding Tous Les Jours. We've never looked back and after today's incident, am confident we made the correct choice. The total spend forfeitted is literally $100s, so Paris Baguette should take note of the scale of loss.

Their other goods are none the better with many veering too close to the Chinese baked goods which so so many Chinatown bakers do better for literally 1/3 the price along with Bake Culture and a dozen competitive Korean bakers, big and small all. They also tried midtown Manhattan lunch goods but who'd pay $8-16 for a sandwich worth 1/4-1/2 that? They also flopped in the quality of service as staff clearly turned over quickly and now rarely have any Koreans which puts into question their adherance to their origins. The customers are few, especially noticably in a such copious empty space even in such a high foot traffic location. No throngs of regular Asian girls, an often reliable sign of food quality, confirm what all others (except those newbies led astray by some travel guide) feel.

Paris Baguette tried some rewards program late last year which was namely my entering the receipt number into the app since the app never worked to auto-accept the register's purchase. I also remember 4y ago they gave a free annual print calendar which had 2 coupons monthly. Never used any of the 24+ coupons, even the free item ones, since they were either irrelevant (like some item which made no sense to their business model) or required such an unusually large purchase as would unlikely occur, say, $75 special cake order or $18 lunch item order. Neither mattered to save Paris Baguette's loyalty since they were both so poorly executed.

This new location thusfar isn't reversing the service declines as surly distracted staff with dour or neutral attitudes lacking heart gives customers that same feeling in addition to food made without the necessary care for this tier of competition."

789,paris-baguette-new-york-27,2019-10-12,1.0,Worst Paris baguette ever. It's new and beautiful but the staff is not trained well. It took 10 mins to get my cold brew and they asked me multiple times what kind of milk I want. During my long wait I saw them give guests drinks and the subsequently take then back because there weren't sure what kind of milk was used.

It was quite good then (review: http://bit.ly/2SuBzLs), and luckily it was quite good in Bryant Park (review: http://bit.ly/2yGYACN). It could be that the park itself always puts me in a happy place, and Joe could serve swill and not dampen my spirit. Who am I kidding? I'm still prickly about my caffeine, and in response, the baristas at Joe make a fine Cafe au Lait for $3.75 (photo: http://bit.ly/2OcBfxz). It's just a kiosk, but they are productive in that tiny space. The best part is grabbing a well-worn table in order to nurse the beverage under the coddling London plane trees.

COFFEE - 4 stars...happiness is a thing called Joe
AMBIANCE - 4 stars...well, I'll give them credit for being in one of my favorite patches of urban greenery
SERVICE - 4 stars...pretty good all things considered

790,joe-coffee-company-new-york-13,2019-11-14,3.0,"I generally love Joe's coffee, but I find the little hut here at Bryant Park a bit below their typically excellent standards. I mean, I sympathize, it is outdoors in an oft-crowded park, but the service can be brusque and--due to the crowds, perhaps--the beverages come out a bit hit-and-miss.  Also I bought beans recently and didn't even get the courtesy free coffee, which I thought was pretty standard.  At any rate, there are so many excellent coffee shops within spitting distance of the park, you're probably better off grabbing something elsewhere and carrying it in for your jaunt around the park."
790,joe-coffee-company-new-york-13,2019-05-27,4.0,I had a nice espresso this morning at Joe's as I was walking around Bryant Park.  It was a beautiful day and I was happy to be alive! Life is good!
790,joe-coffee-company-new-york-13,2017-05-28,5.0,"Strolling down memory lane and bumped into brand new Joe Coffee Kiosk plopped in the heart of Bryant Park! I used to work near Bryant Park four years ago and I was absolutely enchanted with this little kiosk that is adjacent to the quaint little carousel. Consistent with the rest of midtown, this NYC gem of a park (infinitely better than Central Park in my opinion...) has certainly gotten a face lift in the four years since I have been in back. 

The service is quick and no-nonsense. The cashier gladly accommodated my request for an extra pastry bag. I ordered the strawberry sugar-dusted passionfruit danish (a special collaboration with Union Square Hospitality Group) and soaked in the Memorial Day Weekend gloriousness at a nearby park table. The location is wonderful and I cannot wait to spend my weekend mornings with a Cup of Joe at Bryant Park!"
790,joe-coffee-company-new-york-13,2017-06-24,4.0,"The location is awesome in the midst of Bryant Park. There are a lot of tiny tables and interesting people everywhere. There is even a board game area. 

The coffee itself is good but not the best. I would recommend that latte more. It is a lot more smooth. The purchase process is in a speed of light. 

The bonus is that cashier I had is really pretty! Haha I love looking at good-looking girls."
790,joe-coffee-company-new-york-13,2018-05-06,3.0,"I appreciate the baristas trying to get to everyone's orders quickly, but they need to come up with a system for customers that have ordered already.  It's complete chaos.  Customers don't know who is on the line and who has ordered already, and then after people have ordered, they're all standing right next to where you complete the payment transaction.  I don't like that at all because that's how peoples' credit card information is stolen.

On several occasions now I've witnessed customers basically hovering right next to other customers as they had their wallet out seeing everything in it. There's really no excuse because there's plenty of open space in the park to direct people to out of the way.

I made a point of being sarcastic about it today and one of the guys behind the counter didn't like it, but I didn't care. It's my credit card information that would've been exposed for the guy on his cell phone to view in clear sight, but if it was the barista's credit card out there where everyone could see it, I'm sure he would care.

Other than that problem, this location is fine overall.  Actually this line situation is a problem at just about every Joe's I've been to and they need to address it, but space is generally a problem at the other stores.  This location however is the only one where everyone hovers right by the payment portal.  Maybe they should start taking down names so that customers don't all have to pack up by that area."

Located in scenic Bryant Park, it's a cosy little stall where you can take a little bit of a breather from the hustle and bustle of downtown Manhattan. The staff are always super friendly when I stop by, and they've never gotten my order wrong. I visit 1-2 times a week and always order an iced almond milk chai. The flavors are very fresh and it gives me the boost I need to start my work day. The energy bites are really good too, the perfect combination of cocoa and coconut. Yum!

While I was still deciding what to buy, a very rude blue eyed, curly haired young lady was extremely impatient and kept asking me if that was all SEVERAL TIMES. And it's not like they were super busy and had a huge line. It was afternoon, there were 1 customer behind us and another young man taking orders. This is not how you treat a customer! I ended up not buying any coffee for me and the coffee I got for my friend was not that good. The chocolate ice cream was delicious. Will I ever buy anything there or recommend that place to people? No."
790,joe-coffee-company-new-york-13,2017-06-22,3.0,"I've been a fan of Joe Coffee and was super excited to see a new stall in Bryant Park.  What's different about this one is they also serve ice cream so I decided to try their strawberry-lemon sorbet. But for $5, you get a very itty-bitty single scoop that looked rather pathetic.  The flavor wasn't fantastic either...it tasted more like lemon than strawberry mixed into it.  The other flavors they had were vanilla, chocolate, and stracciatella. I should have gone to Pinkberry instead. Or just stick to their coffee and pastries."

791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2020-03-04,4.0,"i love the drinks at BL and how plentiful their locations are in the hudson yards to times square area. the 11 times sq location is surprisingly spacious and has a nice atmosphere to break up the hubbub around it. unfortunately, they seem to still be optimizing their online ordering platform. despite there being no line, the staff didn't know i had ordered ahead 15 min prior and i had to draw their attention to the order, which was meant to have been ready by the time i arrived. not a dealbreaker, just something to note if you're in a rush.

note that all the wellness drinks come with almond milk already and that elmhurst brand oat and almond are both offered."

Staff was very kind. They are cashless, which I thought was pretty cool. Had never been anywhere cashless before.

The highlight was the coffee though - it was really fantastic. Tried a few different varieties over the weekend and they were all great. The latte in particular stood out.

Word to the wise, they don't offer any flavored syrups.

Overall loved this place. Wish there was one back home."

Well, that was me in Bluestone looking for an outlet! Normally I case the place before ordering a drink to ensure the facilities have what I need to get work done: 

1) Outlets 
2) Comfortable Seating
3) Moderate to Low Noise 

It is NYC so I pretty much didn't expect to get moderate to low level noise anywhere smack dab in the middle of Manhattan. Anyway, I ordered my coffee and THEN proceeded to look for a place to sit and an outlet. For one, the seating was minimal. I had to scout for that sh*t lol! Maybe because it was 9am, but man it was packed. I finally sat down and got my coffee only to realize my phone was on 10% and my laptop was deader than LaKeisha on Power. I frantically searched for an outlet only to realize THERE ARE NONE!!!!!! NADA! This is NOT the place to get work done on a partial charge. 

Overall its a cute place that makes one heck of an oat milk latte but I just can't realistically come here to work for long hauls and maybe thats their way of rotating people out of the shop. Ill be back for a nice cup of joe but not to work!"

I passed by this coffee shop with my friend when I was on the way to phantom of the opera #73. I'm always on the lookout for new coffee shops so I wanted to try it. After the show I stopped in while my friend had a smoke.

I got her a hot chocolate and I got myself coffee with half and half. My choice was boring but I'm back with my nutritionist again to loose some weight I regained. Maybe if I'm in the area again for a special occasion or save my fruits and carbs for the day I can have an exciting drink or food.

My coffee was pretty good and it was done fairly quickly. My friend loved her hot chocolate. The coffee shop looked clean, sleek and very nice. I learned they had an app after I paid for the coffee so if I go back again I will get the app for the $5 credit."

The barista was extremely friendly and the service was fast.  I can't recommend this place enough."

Their coffee is decent! Quality place to go if you need something healthy and quick, but there is no need to charge the price of an entire dozen of eggs at Trader Joe's for ONE egg on an avocado toast. $3 right? Insane!"
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-08-14,5.0,"Bluestone Lane is a hidden gem in the hustle and bustle of the Port Authority area! The store is self is always very clean and very quiet. There is not tons of seating, but there are a few tables and chairs. 

I have been coming here for about a year now and have never had a negative experience! Today, I ordered my usual nonfat iced latte  (if you haven't already figured it out from my other reviews, I am an iced latte fanatic!) and the salmon toast. Both were awesome! I love their espresso flavor. It is rich and velvety without being too overpowering. The salmon toast is super flavorful! I love the oil on top and the abundance of cracked black pepper. They also give you a lot of smoked salmon which I appreciate. 

I would definitely recommend this spot for good coffee and a light breakfast or lunch if you are in Midtown West area!"
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-03-14,3.0,"Very clean and spacious. Came in and ordered an almond cappuccino and decided to order the avocado toast to see if it'd be better than the Broadway location. I added a poached egg and feta to it. $3 for each add-on! Avocado toast was way too pricey. Staff was friendly and service was quick. 

Cappuccino: 3/5 it was good, but I've had way better. And lost a point from me for the lack of latte art. Not IG-worthy.

Avocado toast: 3/5 better than the other location and glad the toast wasn't burnt. It had a lot of avocado in it which made it really filling. But it could've used more pepper and lemon juice. 

I don't think I'll order a whole meal again. Way too pricey."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-11-07,5.0,"I always pass by the street but never saw bluestone lane! It's right across port authority, very close to everything. 
Loved the ambience, it's quiet yet energizing. It's a very ""clean"" modern interior design. Not many seats but it's pretty good for he crowd they have. To top it off, their smoked salmon toast with poached egg is the best! Along with their cappuccinos... prices are the same as any other nyc cafe."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-09-09,3.0,"I was here with a friend for breakfast before work at around 7:45 am on a week day. There was ample seating areas so we sat at a high table. You order at the counter then if you're eating in the restaurant, they bring the food to you. Pretty pricey, about ~14 dollars for a cappuccino and avocado toast. I'm not the biggest fan of avocado toast but nothing about this was special and it had way too many pepper flakes on it. The coffee was lukewarm at best when it got to my table."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-08-09,4.0,"Surprisingly quiet and peaceful, for being in such a busy area. It's right across the street from Port Authority. I ordered the Aussie Iced Latte. It was very creamy, but not thick. They put a scoop of ice cream in the coffee, instead of ice cubes for this drink, which is great as it doesn't dilute the flavor when it melts. The coffee was noticeably bitter and the ice cream was very sweet but when it melts, they balance each other out, but it takes a while to melt and is hard to mix in. It's a bit over priced, but it's a good spot with nice atmosphere, good coffee, friendly staff, and quick service."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2020-03-11,5.0,So far it is my fav coffee shop in Manhattan. They have one of the best bakery and coffee
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-05-09,5.0,The iced latte was refreshing and delicious. The environment though was really what sold me! The beachy theme and feel with the lighter blue subway tile and the wave prints on the wall and the airy feel. My whole team by the end of the week was visiting this coffee shop over Starbucks!
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-04-04,4.0,"Clean! Clean eats, clean drinks, clean shop. Amazing in the middle of the city. Some coffee shops you leave feeling like your teeth are coated in sugar or the coffee didn't taste right. This place, I left fresh, the coffee was good yet lean, and I knew my daughter was eating a nutritious snack. 

And the service was friendly!!"
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-03-25,5.0,"Love it here!!!!! We came almost by closing so I was not able to try what I wanted to, but their hot brew was so good. They had the flagstaf which has notes of almond vanilla and chocolate. You could tell it had been a good hour since the last brew, but it was nice and fragrant."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-01-16,3.0,"I love Bluestone Lane and most all its franchises. We got the avocado toast and salmon toast here, and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't up to Bluestone Lane's typical standards. 

The avocado toast was fine, with a little olive oil drizzle, but the salmon toast seemed a little basic, just with a spread of cream cheese on slightly under-toasted bread. It was still good, but I think it could have been better.

The set-up of this café was a little odd, and I can easily see how it can become quickly congested and slow to move through during busier times of the day. Luckily, I got here early on a Sunday morning, so it wasn't too bad, but it was quite difficult to figure out the layout despite how much space they had in the store. 

I love Bluestone Lane and still do, and this store had a great location and kind staff, but I'm hoping that this franchise can up its food game a little bit more before I come back."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2018-06-06,4.0,"Love their coffee and non-coffee drinks. And the cashier Patrick and one of the baristas (forgot to ask for his name) were so nice and friendly. There's a drink called Iced Milo, which I didn't know what it is. They explained it to me and saw that I was still confused, so they made a small cup of milo for me to try. I absolutely loved it (it does taste like Ovaltine) because it was milky and chocolatory. I needed caffeine, so I ended up getting an iced latte (also loved it! Creamy with whole milk but didn't lose the espresso taste). 

It got really crowded after 1:00 pm. And the free WiFi is good for like 1 hour. After 1 hour, you need to wait for some time, which I wasn't able to test out. I waited for 5 mins and it still didn't work. Then my friend came so we started chatting and left afterwards. 

So if you want to stay here working, it's probably not a good idea. But if you need to have a bite or grab a drink and give yourself a break from the exhausting work, this is definitely your go-to spot!"
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2018-04-23,3.0,"Solid selection of coffee drinks and convenient location right by Port Authority. Food is quite pricey, though, and not really a great place to work. 

There are only a few tables and the chairs have no back and are made of a stiff plastic. There are also no discernable outlets by any of the tables. Seems like the wifi is inconsistent as well - didn't work for any of the 4 hours I was there. 

Overall, as a fan of bluestone I'd stop by for a drink to-go, but probably not again for a meeting or to work."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2018-12-03,4.0,"Loved their toast! Loved the coffee and most importantly extremely loved the service I received!!!!!
I ordered a salmon avocado toast since I couldn't decide between the avocado toast and the salmon toast."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2018-06-11,5.0,"Okay, great location right in the heart of the city and a perfect place to start before that show you are going to and don't want to fall asleep in those comfy broadway seats.  

So why is this 5 stars, why doesn't it get better than Bluestone Lane?  Because I had the best dirty chai I've ever had.  If you like a dirty chai get it here.  The service is great to, very friendly and good for a conversation and a laugh no doubt.  

I loved my first visit to Bluestone Lane, the iced milo my wife got, was enjoyable, but I think it doesn't have any coffee any it unless of course you ask for it, so that didn't  help her pep at the show, but the show was good enough, so no worries there.  Just be mindful and ask about the Iced Milo and the coffee content before you order it if you're looking for some coffee.  

We loved this visit so much, we decided to check out the Bluestone Lane Cafe on the Upper East Side, I'll have my review for there soon.  Can't wait to check out the Bluestone Lanes in DC."

The cashier didn't tell me that it's only valid for ordering ahead (which I only found out after emailing customer service). So, $6 down the drain and no help from customer service. Won't be back."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-07-05,5.0,Cute little coffee house in Time Square. It was right next to our hotel so a very easy walk. I love the color scheme.  Coffee was great!

791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-12-21,2.0,Won't even heat up your biscuit. Ridiculous. Workers couldn't smile if they tried. Coffee average. Avocado toast is the only reason for 2 stars.
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-06-20,5.0,"For being a location right next to Port Authority (a super busy area) it is always clean, surprisingly quiet, staff are friendly & the service is great! 
I stopped by a number of time before heading to PA  whether it was to grab a quick coffee or stay to work & eat. Never been disappointed with my experiences. 
One time I had a coupon card that allows you to get one free coffee of any kind/size. I also ordered 2 pieces of toast with jam & butter. Once I gave the cashier the coupon he decided to comp my entire order! Given that it was an $9(ish) difference, it made my day. 
I really love the atmosphere Bluestone has, & they're coffee/food is pretty good too."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2018-07-25,3.0,"Went here to get a chai iced tea and a snack.

The chai iced tea was good (I added oat milk), but I decided not to get a snack since there were flies all around the food that was sitting out.

This is a nice location and seemed very new and clean, so the flies all over the place was a bit of a surprise--be aware."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-04-19,4.0,Ive been reminiscing of LA's Alfred's Mocha Latte with Almond Milk and this was the closest coffee I've found similar to it. I love my coffee when you can taste the bitterness but there's a hint of sweetness as well.
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-03-18,5.0,"Excellent experience every time I come in. Fast, efficient and great tasting everything.
I didn't have any more negative experiences since my first review, and I am very glad I gave them another chance!"
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-11-25,2.0,"7.15 I got in this coffee shop, trying to get an espresso based drink. But apparently they clean coffee machine 45 minutes prior closing, so you can't order latte. Disappointed"
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-01-16,4.0,"It's located near Port Authority, so serves as a great option to kill some time between your commutes. Given the location, it seems generally busy but is decent sized with some dine-in tables as well. Besides the cafe, it also offers an attached convenience store - you can get water, bottled drinks, chips, etc. I think the area is saturated with convenience stores, so I'm not sure how well that part of the business does. My review is for the cafe - which offers a small but well done menu. They have well crafted coffees, teas, and toasts. I got the hot chai tea latte - which was amazing. It was the perfect level of sweet, perfect ratio of milk and chai, along with cosy cinnamon dusted on top. To pair with that, I opted for the salmon toast which was also very good. Toasted whole wheat bread with a layer of savory cream cheese, topped with tasty smoked salmon along with a few sprinkled dill leaves for the freshness. The taste of all the ingredients together in the toast creates a yum combination, however, I do think the bread could be a little fresher. Service is okay, definitely a great place to get coffee/tea and toasts. Very clean and organized space."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-11-02,2.0,Boyfriend and I were grabbing breakfast early Sunday morning and I ordered a latte and an avocado toast with poached egg. I am not exaggerating it was the worst toast I've ever eaten. I took one bite and I threw it away. The avocado was hard not ripe and the egg was so cold. I feel like they had it pre-made and it was just sitting there before they gave it to us. Still confused why this is place is so highly rated. The coffee was terrible too. We went an got an acai bowl and a really good latte down the street someplace else.
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-04-27,4.0,"Great food and beverages, the matcha latte is delicious! Nice music and friendly workers! I'll come back for sure!"
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2018-05-08,4.0,"Great customer service at this location, my cappuccino was served with a smile early in the morning.   Close to Times Square and Port Authority making it a easy stop for coffee before work."
791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2019-08-11,5.0,"This is a very clean, efficient cafe - surprisingly not too crowded or sorry considering the proximity to Port Authority. Other pros:
* lots of light
* quiet
Chai latte was solid.

I'd return"

791,bluestone-lane-new-york-21,2018-04-21,3.0,"House coffee was nothing special. The food was yummy and decently priced. I had toast with banana, honey, and almond butter on it. I am still making this simple but fantastic concoction at home, hehe. 

Overall this place had a nice ambiance. The area was clean, large and open, and the baristas were friendly. 

And to be consistent with my reviews- yes, the seating was plentiful."
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2020-02-05,5.0,"This is my go-to Starbucks during the work week. They make my day every day. They're my favorite team that works super hard and very efficiently. They're calm under the crazy morning pressure and never stops to make sure their customers know that they're being taken care of. 

Also shout out to my girl, Sam! I love her to death and admire her so so much!

Thanks guys for being amazing!!"
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2019-07-08,4.0,"It's super crowded with lots of ""seat warmers"", so expect to just get your Starbucks and go. (3 stars)

They try hard, starting with a barista during morning rush managing all mobile orders.  They have new espresso machines, which make a smoother shot.  For that, they get an extra star."
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2020-02-10,1.0,No service - very unprofessional staff ! Workers just stand around having persona conversations ! Staff are all rude with no customer service skills ! No line at all at cashier yet left to wait for 5 minutes for service...finally cashier remembered he had a job to do & in a huff & bad manner started taking my order but getting it all wrong in the process !! I left & went to a competing place for some actual friendly service !! Management needs to train the staff correctly at this location - SMH !!!!
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2019-05-17,1.0,This location is probably the most under staff Starbucks I ever been to. It was 2:00pm in the afternoon and I had to wait 19 mins for my grande ice coffee. Two people at the register. One person wiping down and cleaning and two people making drinks. I counted 21 people waiting for drinks. When I got my drink I noticed people waiting before me were still waiting for their drinks. People had this annoy look. Piss poor store management. Not a good customer experience.
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2019-12-28,2.0,"Service is slow, lack of seating and bad design on the seating.  It was a holiday season and I am sure that everyone is over work.  However, I am expecting more quality from starbucks.  However, when you need a coffee and other french style cafes were closed.  We need starbucks more than ever."
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2018-03-26,4.0,"Starbucks is a Starbucks is a Starbucks. 

Cookie cutter like decor. 

Spacious - unlike other locations (downtown FiDi...) - you have no idea what small cozy space is like until you had your visit to the location by Battery Park, on Water Street, across from 1 NY Plaza! Ugh... 

4 stars because their mobile order system is ""On-Fire""!! 

I went from... 'dang... 20 mins for a mobile order that I placed 5 mins ahead?! So 25mins!!?! What efficiency??! #whattheshit'! 

To... ""ah-maze ball! Placed a mobile order 5 mins ahead. Bam! Waiting for me as I entered the doors!'

Slowest Starbucks service ever!!!!

Find another Starbucks. The line is always super long and why do they only have 4 employees. 

Ugh. I hope they get more help in here. 

On a good note, love the caramel brûlée latte. It's great. Love the new holiday decor. 

Nice and spacious Starbucks. Not too many seats."
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2019-11-07,5.0,"I have never written a review for any Starbucks before, but I needed to write a review for this one. The manager Sam is great, I always order through the app and the servers here are usually very prompt, friendly and accommodating. It is definitely a crowded location, but if you need to get something on the go it is perfect for that."
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2019-01-05,4.0,"The best part of this Starbucks is the people.  The customer service is always on point and I enjoy interacting with the baristas.  

On the flip side, I will say the service is not the fastest (definitely not the slowest though) but what Starbucks has great efficiency.  

Small amount of seating in the front.  No public restroom."
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2018-07-05,2.0,"You've seen one Starbucks, you've seen them all but I hate this location for the sole fact they do mobile orders wrong. En-route to this location I place my mobile order and ""cha-ching!"" off with my $6 Starbucks goes before I even step foot inside the store.

In NYC I frequently use mobile ordering & think it's a travesty that not every business doesn't embrace this concept. This Starbucks location is one of those rare locations that seems to not only want to take your $6 before you arrive but they want to ransom your beverage upon arrival. When I got there I saw no ""mobile order"" display as I'm accustomed to at other locations. It seems the staff holds my beverage freaking hostage behind the counter making me insist on handing over what I paid for. Not ideal when I'm in a rush, the point of mobile order was so that I could walk in and run off with my expensive beverage.

I get that they probably keep the beverages behind the counter in case of beverage theft but seriously how bad can that be? How often does someone really ""steal"" beverages? I suspect customers in haste simply walk off with the wrong beverage rather than taking a moment to check.

So there you have it, this is like any other Starbucks but mobile ordering sucks!! I have to end this review because I'm in a rush and I'm searching for my mobile order at this Starbucks right now."
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2019-03-23,5.0,"Great new layout, staff are efficient, new bars pumping out high quality beverages. Just a beautiful, chill Starbucks for engaging, working, or just sitting and enjoying the view."
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2019-06-01,2.0,"Worst run Starbucks in midtown. Chronically understaffed, so employees are crazed and literally running behind the counter to get orders filled. Will often have all registers staffed and taking orders, while one person does both coffee and food order fulfillment.  Huge lines as a result, waits of 15 to 20 min from payment to get order.

Avoid if at all possible"

This is the worst starbucks in midtown.  

Example of how freeloaders ruin public spaces and expect to be catered to free crap at the expense of others.  

Place is filthy and overwhelming for any amount of team members they have.  We the people - gross stupid tourists, gross vagrants ruin the spot by trashing the area- condiment areas all grossed out by these people expecting free shizz.  

Starbucks should make smaller locations.  Get rid of the bathrooms and start making these places so huge.

You suck."

792,starbucks-new-york-220,2019-06-24,1.0,Honestly so annoyed at this location. I ordered 2 cake pops via mobile. I stood there for 30min before I had to ask someone where they were. It's only then that they tell me they're out and don't have any. Literally such a waste of my time. I then had to wait longer in line just to get my money back.
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2019-01-18,5.0,"This is a very busy Starbucks location. They get high volume of orders on a daily basis so it is understandable why there is quite a wait.

792,starbucks-new-york-220,2016-01-22,4.0,"Only one type of coffee available; no Sumatra or signature. Not even a bathroom  available since ""its being cleaned"" for one hour.

 The coffee was great nonetheless. But my 4 stars is for them having absolutely No Music At All!!!!!!! OMG, this is the perfect way to enjoy your coffee or tea!! This is the way it always should be: No McDonald's oven alarms (which somewhat still existed at this visit) or music whatsoever! Amazing, like being in NYC when everyone is out of town and you cant find a car or person anywhere in some parts. If yelp had video this would be a great clip.

I will be back again I'm sure. I just hope they got a working bathroom and some signature overpriced/rated coffee to go with it. For now off to time square for my signature fix."

I happened couple times already , and I gave it a shot again thus morning, there are very few guests so there is just no excuse to mess up the order. Guess what , the staff she forgot and she did apologize very casually while chatting with others .

Plus, it's a health hazard. I used their restroom to find there was NO soap dispenser and no soap in the bathroom and the roll of toilet paper on the floor. How do the employees wash their hands to serve customers?! 
I didn't buy anything and am so grossed out.
Plus tables or the space still has garbage everywhere. 
I guess there's no Maid service..........
I'd give them zero stars if I could"
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2017-06-12,1.0,"What has happened to the 35th and 7th store in New York City? What happened to Roger, and Lisa, or well, any other employee that had any modicum of competence? While I know that I have had my up and downs with this store, the level of service I have gotten over my last few visits has been so sub-par that I am truly considering cutting my Starbucks card in half and giving up 23 years of loyal support.

This staff in this store is totally clueless. At 2:00 there were only 4 people behind the counter. The store was slammed. There was 2 people on the register and one person making drinks so slow that my newborn has now started college. Then, being literally 20 drinks behind, the last one was moping. While I can appreciate a clean restaurant, shouldn't moping behind the coolers be done when the drink tickets aren't reaching the floor?

Because of the inability of the staff to properly manage the flow of the store, my drink took 25 mins to make. Then on top of it all, the girl that was moping, then proceeded to pick up 6 cups, sticking her fingers in the rims to move them from one counter to the other. Not only is that gross normally, but she didn't even pretend to wash her hands before doing that. Then she starting complaining about how she isn't even supposed to be there. Perhaps Starbucks needs to up their game in hiring.

Whoever is managing this store should be fired. I'm not usually one to call for someone to be let go, but the inability of this manager to even control the flow of this store is so bad what other choice is there really? As corporate leadership, you all should be embarrassed of this store. Is this what your brand has become? Do you have so much money that customers no longer matter?"
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2015-06-24,1.0,"Came here once on a Monday morning to try the Starbucks in the area. I tried to order a S'mores frappe and then a Caramel Ribbon Crunch but they had neither, so I settled for a Caramel Frappe.

It's very loud and the cashiers don't seem to care too much about service here, preferring to talk to their friends behind the counter. While I'm sure the baristas are doing the best job that they can, this location is simply too busy to get a drink out promptly. Unfortunately, my drink didn't come out too great either... probably the worst drink I've ever gotten from a Starbucks.

It's expensive because it's the city, the lines are long because it's in the city, and it's right next to Penn Station, so it's even worse. I don't think I'll be coming here again.

The bathroom wasn't even working during my hour of need."

Amazing that Starbucks allows this sort of illiterate and unsavory people onto their team. First thy  forget to make our order then when we ask them what happened , they curse us out for Not asking after our order sooner. The manager did not do anything to correct he situation: instead of offering  an apology, he impersonated a deaf mute mime. Which was better Han the cashier who cursed us to our face. 

The 2 star rating of this location has to be chalked down to the kindness of strangers"

However, today has been the 3rd time my very simple order of ""salted caramel hot chocolate"" has been incorrectly handled.  

All three times, I got the version that has espresso in it.

All three times, I have specifically stated ""I simply want your hot chocolate with salted caramel, not the espresso as well.""  

In addition, the third time, after I asked for my actual order...I got only half of my grande container filled with hot chocolate and no salt...

I'm legitimately feeling bad writing this 1 star review because the workers are nice, but the only reason I come here is for  the salted caramel hot chocolate, and I can't really rate you any higher if you mess this up ~33% of the time."

To have a restroom this filthy near consummables is kind of alarming for a germaphobe like I am. Of course, I only discovered this AFTER I had consumed a whole cake pop.

The baristas seemed friendly and efficient, making drinks quickly and reducing the wait time significantly for the customers in line."
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2017-06-06,1.0,I wanted to have a great Starbucks latte my favourite. Noticed a free drink sign if u download an app. So i did it. Then i was told to buy a Starbucks card and only after this u can have a free drink. Ok. Done. I asked for latte. And he gave me regular coffee with milk without a foam. It was disgusting. I hate this place now because of such a disrespect.
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2017-05-21,5.0,"Damon and the rest of the Sunday afternoon crew just made my day. I came into this Starbucks crying over a personal issue and left feeling significantly better. I don't even know if they realize how meaningful their kind gestures were to me. Thanks for the love, guys!"
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2015-10-10,1.0,"This Starbucks is the worst in getting the orders right. In person, I've ordered the Trenta size drink and 3 times, they made me a grande drink all 3 times. I had to get it remade 3 times. The first time the girl gave me an annoyed look that I would ask her to make what I paid for. Then when I ordered from the app, it took me longer to get the drink then if I went on line to order it. Today, I ordered a drink and requested extra whip cream. Not only did they not give me any extra, there was no whip cream added. WTF!!!! It's not even busy!  
This was for a client and the client now thinks I can take a simple order and get it right. ,|,, ,,|, this Starbucks!!! Get your shiiit together.

Update: Again this morning they gave me the wrong size drink. When I order a large I don't want a tall. Why is it this place continuous downsize my drinks. Also, they did not add lemonade to my second order of ice tea. What's up with this place? Are people here all the bad baristas go? I would like to say this was done by one barista. But this has happened with 4 different baristas."

792,starbucks-new-york-220,2016-07-30,1.0,It's irritating when you're a paying Starbucks customer and individuals are sitting with no type of Starbucks purchase and paying customers trying to find seating to enjoy their drink. Staff needs to enforce customer-only seating!
792,starbucks-new-york-220,2012-07-03,4.0,"When I first began working in this area, immediately this Starbucks turned me off. Whether 8:30am or 3:00pm on a workday, there is some sort of line at this location. During the morning rush, we're talking a line 20 people deep, sometimes more.

However, I have to disagree with previous posters and say the service here is top notch. They always have a barista going through the line with a walkie-talkie taking your orders, so even on those mornings when you walk in to a 25 person deep line, between taking the your order quick and the folks manning the registers being speedy as well, you can go through a huge line in a few minutes. 

And surprisingly, all the baristas here are super friendly. Personally, I'd want to kill myself if I had to make coffee for a bunch of tourists and disgruntled office workers from the Garment District, but the folks that work here are always friendly and always go out of their way. 

Yes, seating is almost nonexistent and the location is a bit tight in terms of space. But for a disgruntled office worker like myself, this location does the trick for me."

it wouldnt have bothered me so much aside from the fact THEY HAD NO AIR CONDITIONING ON AT 95 DEGREE WEATHER.  

i literally stayed for about 10 mins before i gave up and walked away...... 

if you're a new yorker, dont bother with this location, theres one on 35th and 8th extremely fast service."

I understand that orders are placed incorrectly especially during crowds, it just happens so much more often than any other Starbucks I've been to, so I've gotta wonder what they're doing wrong. Also there's always vagrants. They need to take some tips from the 31st and 7th location.

There is a really awesome barista there, though. He looks like McLovin and is always on the ball."

Giving it 3 stars because it checked all the boxes without being amazing. Good (if rather boring) coffee, mostly friendly staff (hey, everyone has an off day now and again), and despite it being busy, the line moves very quickly. Even during a rush I have never been in there for more than 10-12 minutes from time of entering to getting my coffee.

Tip for anyone who works nearby, go here before 9am, between 10-11am, or after 1pm. If you go at those times, the lines are MUCH shorter and you can be in and out in 5 minutes no problem."

793,feroce-caffè-new-york-6,2019-06-24,3.0,"This is a cozy place where you can enjoy some food and drink at a table inside, or place your order to go. The selection for breakfast items was pretty standard, though I can't recall if I saw a variety of muffins or pastries, mostly croissants and such. I was a little surprised when I tried to pay cash and the cashier said she wasn't sure she could, because she had no change. Fortunately, I was trying to get rid of mine and had exact, which relieved her. I charge things 90% of the time, but people still do pay cash, especially for smaller purchases. 

Coffee - decent coffee - is available in one size. While there were 4 carafes from which to select a creamer or substitute, only 2 of them were labeled, and I had to guess which would be what I wanted. Hopefully the labels will go back on these carafes soon. It wasn't the best grab-and-go breakfast experience, but it got the job done."

Coffee was not good!

Avocado on toast & an over cooked poached egg, so it wasn't event running. The green on the side got no dressing! 

Shockingly the Bar upstairs got a 5 stars review from us but down at the cafe was this bad! 

Being a Marriott Bonvoy member, I'm a bit disappointed in this brand new hotel big only 2 months!

Two espressos and an almond croissant, enjoyed ""for here"" at the bar. 

Unsure of the negative reviews, this place is cute and simple inside, quiet, and the staff were all very polite. 
The decor is a seemingly beautiful intersection of modern, art deco meets Italian.

793,feroce-caffè-new-york-6,2019-03-24,1.0,"Bizarre experience. While the hotel, Feroce Bar and Feroce Restaurant were top notch and enjoyable, this place for breakfast was something else...

Our waiter just completely ignored us for some reason...I've never experienced anything like it. Even after letting him know we were ready to order, he said he just needs to drop of some stuff to another table and will be back. After watching him take orders from other tables, bring items to other tables, and not making eye contact when we looked at him...we knew something was up. We got up and just asked to pay for our sparkling water and coffees (which came out to $25, which would be ok if it was actually worth it).

The waiter did not even say anything when we went up to get the check...just kept looking down. Not sure what the deal was. It's a shame because the bar on the 2nd floor and Feroce Restaurant had such amazing attentive service.  They need to step it up during breakfast, especially on a Sunday in NYC. (This place was not even busy....wonder why)"
793,feroce-caffè-new-york-6,2019-05-22,4.0,"I stayed at the Moxy hotel for a week and frequently came down for coffee and food. The services was attentive and friendly every time.

However, I do wish that there were better + more pasta options."
793,feroce-caffè-new-york-6,2019-08-10,5.0,Beautiful space and atmosphere! Got an iced latte and was delicious. The waiter told me it is usually served in a plastic cup w/ lid and straw but the waiter kindly served it a glass when I requested it. I would recommend to management to make this standard practice to reduce waste- less garbage and less cups to buy. Excellent service!
793,feroce-caffè-new-york-6,2019-07-28,5.0,"Great espresso, finally. Most places will serve you espresso that is too much (in amount), too acidic, too burnt or not good enough. This caffè is guaranteed to make you feel like you were drinking ""un espresso normale"" in some tiny caffè in Italy. Also, the cornetti (Italian croissants) are to die for, especially the creme-filled ones."
794,7-eleven-new-york-21,2014-04-30,3.0,"Best 7-Eleven I have ever been in. Plus the closest to Lord & Taylor.

Seriously, this store is very busy with a high-end customer and the construction workers from across the street and the local cops and basically everyone, office-workers, socialites, homeless. And everyone is treated very well, and equally. Always a line - but it moves very very fast.

They are super fast. If only one cashier is working, they will use both registers. The only store I have ever seen that is faster than the customers.

I am in here almost every day for something. Plus they have a great selection of fresh local vegan sandwiches and salads."

I'm trying to get a Slurpee but the machines is sputtering the sugary slush out and I would really prefer the flavor I am trying to get but the Slurpee machine seems to be having a slight technical issue. The only dude that seems to be managing the shop comes to me and looks at me funny and tells me ""no more"" in a not so nice manner, nor rude manner but how was I suppose to know before I grabbed the cup. Like I said, I just wanted that particular flavor.

Kit Kat chocolate bar and a Slurpee, yeah but next time I'll find a different 7-Eleven."
794,7-eleven-new-york-21,2018-01-25,1.0,What a fucking joke this place is the employee is an absolute clown  he took advantage of me being a tourist and sold me FAKE WINE for $15 dollars and when i asked if there was another other stores nearby that have wine he said no they have the same stuff but are more expensive! I went to Walgreens afterwards and saw it there for $5.99! it was the worst thing that has ever passed my lips since Boone's farms in college...actually Boone's farms would have been better!

The staff is always rude and not helpful when you have questions.

The food is always expired in the hot food case."
794,7-eleven-new-york-21,2012-03-06,3.0,"Why am I reviewing another 7-Eleven? Because it's there and I can dammit!

Actually, I was walking home from lunch today and passed by not even realizing this location was even in my work neighborhood.

Nothing like getting a hot cup of coffee after a big lunch to help digest. I don't know why I like 7-Eleven. Maybe it's because they have multiple flavored coffees to choose from that actually taste pretty good, and a bunch of flavored creamers to add to them. I always enjoy an ice cold Slurpee and this location has eight different flavors. These spots are like mini-groceries/drug stores and you can find almost anything here in a pinch. Plus, 7-Eleven's are normally clean, bright, and organized as this one is. Counter staff here was nice too. 

Still, I refuse to eat those meat product thingy's on the rotating grill. I don't care how drunk I get or how late it is. No sir, no how! Is that really meat anyway?"
794,7-eleven-new-york-21,2012-08-09,3.0,"Immediately following a job search lecture nearby NY Public Library- SIBL, 7-Eleven was my on-the-go dinner!  Well, when you're on a budget it may not be the best meal but is edible and foots the finances.

Store # 35057 sits on Madison Avenue which appears many 7-Eleven are culminating in Manhattan, whereas this location is microscopic small.  There is no floor space for a checkout line to wrap around.  The structure appears newer and very modern.  I was able to attain a simple and cheap sandwich at $4.99 with wholesome package of three chocolate chip cookies at $1.49.  Cashiers are attentive and friendly in a non-robotic form much better than the typical 7-Elevens."

I won't be there for it!!!!!"
794,7-eleven-new-york-21,2013-11-10,3.0,"There was a time when a 7-11 was one of those places that New Yorkers only told legends about unless you were in the suburbs.  I remember as a kid I had one near me on Long Island but I only recalled seeing one near Port Authority Bus Terminal over the years.

Starting a year or so ago however, 7-11 began to follow in the footsteps of places like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts before it - popping up everywhere!  This spread continues today and this 7-11 is part of that growth of the chain.

This is a medium sized 7-11.  There are the usual aisles of junk food and convenience items.  The day I went it was for coffee so I went straight to the gigantic coffee island set up towards the side of the store.  It's actually quite an impressive set up with a couple dispensers of each flavor.  In the middle is a chilling chamber with creamers, milk and even flavored creamers to use.  I wound up picking the Hazelnut.

Check out was quick and I didn't find the staff over friendly or unfriendly - just neutral.  I noted with some amusement behind the counter they were selling an umbrella with a handle shaped like brass knuckles designed to (I'm not kidding) allow you to text while you hold the umbrella.

The coffee was good, not amazing but on par with Au Bon Pain.  In other words, not too heavy on the flavor but it does the job in a pinch.

A good 7-11, not extraordinary by any means but okay to visit if you need to grab something quick."
794,7-eleven-new-york-21,2014-03-14,5.0,"I really can't say anything more than what the other reviews have said, other than that it was the best service we've ever received. Well, I guess that was to be expected from such a fine establishment with a rich suburban history - a part of everyone's coming-of-age story who grew up on Long Island. A truly magical place. Late night, it's eery glow is straight out of a southern gothic novel. 

The service was friendly and warm, and not pretentious at all! We've gone out to eat at restaurants that made us feel supremely uncomfortable, and 7-11 felt like we were having dinner at a fancy friend's place! The counter men were super sweet, and promptly brought warm brioche rolls every time I gobbled mine up (for the foie gras). If I can get a basket of those brioche rolls I would be in HEAVEN. They were buttery and flaky and warm - like a fresh baked croissant! But EVEN BETTER.

I wanted one of the hot dogs, but my companion opted for the Wagyu beef upgrade, which was like eating juicy fatty tender... I can't even call it beef since it was like a cross between pork belly and tender filet! 

The butter was also amazing. Must have been made that day from fresh cream. 

EVERYTHING from my meal at 7-11 was astounding. ASTOUNDING. I also had a stomach ache for a few days after since I'm not used to eating such rich food, and I ate WAY too much which was way too much for my digestive system... but anyway, worth every mouth full."
794,7-eleven-new-york-21,2012-04-22,2.0,"I wasn't at a computer at all yesterday so I'll do two Underdog reviews today.

This 7-11 isn't as good as the one I usually go to on 3rd Avenue and 28th Street--not as clean, surly staff and the fountain sodas don't taste as well-mixed.  Otherwise, it's your standard 7-11."
794,7-eleven-new-york-21,2012-06-22,4.0,"I believe this placed opened earlier this year (January?).  I just remember walking by it's familiar sign with a ""Coming Soon"" notice on the door, and saying ""YIPPEE! - I see slushies in my future!"" I haven't had the slushie yet, but I have enjoyed their iced coffee and the bahama mama sausage sandwich (which was yummy).  I'm a hot dog girl peeps - I grew up with hot dogs in my fried rice for heavens sake.  So, naturally, a place that has a huge variety of hot dogs cooked all different types of ways speaks to me...loudly.

This 7 Eleven is kept clean, and the cashiers are very nice.  It's not very crowded, which suits me perfectly.  I can get in and out in 5-10 minutes."

The entire store was just overtly unclean. The manager should be ashamed of the condition of this store. I will never go back.
794,7-eleven-new-york-21,2012-06-19,4.0,"I'm a fan of anything open past midnight since most shops close insanely early on the West coast.  It is seriously an issue for night owls.

That being said, I was barely finishing up the dregs of my crazy walk to/from the Brooklyn Bridge from E. 48/Lex but after being disappointed by various bad shots due to the construction and scaffolding, I was dead.  My legs were swollen.  A blister was forming on the bottom of my left foot.  And my shoulders were aching from the heavy camera gear and tripod stowed away in a sling.  Throw in a day of 80 degree temps with the humidity to boot........I was looking like a nasty sweat-dripping mess.

Apparently this is attractive : being grumpy, dressed in leggings + t-shirt, slinging the camera gear, and sweating like a pig.  Because during that 5 mile trudge back to my hotel, I received numerous cat calls from passing cars, packed bars, and 3 men from their dump trucks.  What a compliment.   

When I realized I had only 18 more blocks to cover prior from reaching the hotel, I ducked into this 7-Eleven to purchase something to drink.

7-Eleven works for several reasons:

1.  Slurpees during the hot summers.
2.  Cheap-ass coffees for all times of the day.
3.  Beer/drinks/sodas + chips in the event you forget about that potluck.
4.  Cheap-ass hot dogs and nibblies for those in need.
5.  Clean bathrooms.  Better than gas stations.

And in this case, the staff were sociable and interested in what a tourist like me was doing out around 1:30 a.m. in the morning.  I purchased a Snapple diet lemon drink in a glass bottle and let's just say it was finished way before I finished walking those last tortuous 18 blocks home."

This location is close by Park Ave and the 28th St stop of the 6 train. Although quite small, they do have several stool seats and a side table to have some space to chill out. Not too convenient if you plan to work and sip coffee, however. I love coming here at lunch time for my afternoon coffee break. Try their pour overs and ask about their specialty coffee.

If you're familiar with the brand, they make their own coffee and are known for their specific drinks. They also sell a few pastries up front. The service there is helpful and knowledgeable about their drinks. The space is beautiful and branded. Check out the decorated bathroom!

795,devocion-new-york-2,2019-09-25,5.0,"This is a special new Devocion devoted to the cascara coffee cherry which has a unique flavor that is not what the espresso aficionado may expect. I remember when the big corporate green giant of coffee took this on. There wasn't nearly this much complaining from that. I think the cascara flavor is a change of pace in my normally, well caffeinated world. I usually switch it up from nespresso to matcha to regular ole coffee quite often on the daily. It's nice to have options.

Just knowing that this is a cherry makes me taste a cherry like flavor. It's really good with the ginger lemon combo. It tastes like health and a cold tea almost. They have this on tap along with several other cascara options including ice cream. I came in on their opening promo and paid what I wanted.

The space itself is smaller than the other Devocion nearby but accommodates about 4 seated people and probably 10-15 total. It feels big and open though due to high ceilings and the window in the front has a nice view of a sidewalk tree that makes it feel less industrial/concrete jungle."

They are offering Cascara + Coffee bar and that is the first concept in the world devoted to the coffee cherry. 

The barista was supper nice, he explain what's the cascara, and give us some sample to try. It taste a bit like sparkling juice, with hit sweeten from the fruit. (no sugar added) 
They have 4 flavor, I like cascara ginger line and original fl. Both taste super refreshing 

And we also tried  cascara ice cream. It tasted a little bit like honey caramel flavor. We ordered a latte to company together. They went great together. Should've order a affogato instead!

The place is nice inside...and they have a cool vibe going on but if the thing that they are suppose to be showcasing is bad then they should maybe try harder."
795,devocion-new-york-2,2019-09-28,2.0,"I came here during the week where they have you pay what you want for the drinks. Totally awkward because the way the barista phrased it made me feel like I had to donate way more than I should for a drink.

I never had cascara and I never will again. The beverage is very sweet. Also the after taste was very unpleasant. 
Very disappointed in the fact that they use basic plastic cups instead of the biodegradable ones.
2 stars for the decor even though there are only 5 seats available in the whole cafe while the baristas area pretty much takes up half of the cafe...weird."
795,devocion-new-york-2,2019-09-19,5.0,Devocion is one of my favorite cafes in the city so I was incredibly excited to hear it has moved into my neighborhood!! Their coffee and pastries are so delicious esp their croissants. I used to go almost every day in their downtown Brooklyn location! I tried the affogato today thinking it would be coffee ( it was cascara) and it wasn't for me but i think it was just a matter of my personal taste.
795,devocion-new-york-2,2019-09-19,5.0,It's a small but cute coffee shop in midtown east. Everyone was friendly and knowledgeable. I had a nice latte. It tasted good and had beautiful design. Pastries looked good but I didn't get a chance to try them. They have bathrooms available.
795,devocion-new-york-2,2020-01-08,4.0,"Delicious drip coffee, nutty and caramel notes, good price. Great space. They need more chairs but I think it's more of a Euro vibe of a standing espresso joint. But good stuff either way."
795,devocion-new-york-2,2019-12-16,1.0,Lousy coffee - cold and bitter. Chocolate croissant tasted like an everything bagel- must have been next to it on the tray.
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2020-02-11,5.0,"I was not fond of Starbucks a year ago, fyi. This franchise always just seemed so complicated and snobbish, because of things like their idiotic size chart (grande is not medium), and being overpriced, etc. 
But my wife got me a Peppermint chocolate frappe. 

Then boom! Hooked. 

This particular location is convenient no more than the average Starbucks, but one trait I truly appreciate is their customer service. For me it the biggest mistake an employee could possibly make is to make any customer feel annoying. 
Every employee I have encountered here always seems to have an unlimited amount of time to help every single person. It is just a coffee shop, but there are places - especially in New York - where that can be messed up, too."
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2018-09-23,5.0,"Every morning I go get drinks at Starbucks and past few days I had worst experience with them at Starbucks that's on Broadway. 

I was so craving for cafe americano with hazelnut syrup. I was near Manhattan mall so I decided to go inside that mall and there I saw Starbucks! 

I always place an order on mobile so yesterday I used the mobile order too. I didn't know what location was it so the guy that worked there told me which one was. 
The guy was very nice unlike other few Starbucks I know. 

I ordered what I wanted it! And the coffee was just good! It was just perfect! Yes they greeted! Yes they were respectful and helpful unlike other few Starbucks I know. 

If I ever be in that area again I will definitely stop by to Manhattan mall to get my Starbucks for cup of coffee!"

Staff at register seemed to be new and took longer than usual for order. I could get none of the staff name because they all had them blurred out from their name tag so i guess no one can call them out individually for their wrong doing."

I hate that there is no where to sit and you just have to eat while standing. So I can only give 3 Stars here."
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2016-01-26,3.0,"I basically go there every single day for my coffee since work just cross street. 

It's just a coffee bar back on 1st floor in Manhattan mall. No seat. 

It's really busy in the morning around 9. They get more baristas during that period but still gotta wait and ur drink may messed up. I have no problem with whatever I order at any other time of day there. But in the morning before my work, I feel my drink taste not right. After it happened few times, I just go to other Starbucks. 

So I do suggest don't go there for the peak time but try another location just 1 min away on 32nd st. That one is a spacious store with tables n seats. Normally not that busy and get full collection of food, snacks, pastry or sb products."
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2015-04-15,3.0,"This is like a Starbucks Express with no seating, no wifi, no luxuries associated with the Starbucks brand.  It's your typical Starbucks location just don't set the bar of expectations too high and treat this like an ""express"" location.

I got my usual coffee concoction but decided to try the new Bacon, cheddar and egg sandwich which tasted awful!  I have never had a Starbucks breakfast sandwich and never will I buy one ever again.  I'd recommend McDonald's for breakfast and Starbucks for coffee only.  The breakfast sandwich I purchased tasted like bad hospital microwavable food.  Jimmy Dean Delights taste better than the Starbucks breakfast sandwiches, seriously.

Otherwise for this location stop by for your quick coffee fix."

I was greeted by Andrew by Miss.
During our brief conversation, he kept 
calling me Miss.

Thank you very very very much much Andrew.
I hate when people call me ma'am.  I hate it so much.
The day Andrew was calling me Miss was the day before my birthday.  I get depressed around birthdays and something simple as Miss really help.

At work, I am constantly telling me no to call me ma'am.  If course they do because they know it makes me made.

Thank you Andrew.

Also before getting up to order both Andrew and the other gentleman who was working were very sweet and kind to all of the customers.  I know that this Starbucks gets extremely busy at times.  They both worked very hard and a long line did not form."
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2018-11-01,1.0,"The worse Starbucks ever in the 33rd St Manhattan Mall. The service is horrible and it's been like this for as long as I can remember. Every time I go here I regret it. I usually walk further out to the 32nd St Starbucks where the service is fast and great. But sometimes I'm pressed for time so I've stopped here a few times, since it's closer to my office, even though I'm risking that more than likely I'm going to be made to wait too long but hoping that one time I'll be wrong. But of course I'm not wrong. There's usually only one barista making all the orders and she/he is usually talking away with her/his coworkers, or refilling the ice, or pulling out supplies to stock up, etc (when there are other employees there doing the same work) instead of taking care of the orders of the people that are waiting and have to get back to work. It seems they do it on purpose cause they KNOW we're waiting and they don't give a damn. And they've over toasted my croissant cause they put it in with other orders that require more toasting time, which leaves my croissant hard and inedible. Or they completely forget to put in my order in the oven and I have to remind them that I'm waiting for a croissant, so of course now I'm waiting even longer. These are instances that I've experienced at different times but it's still so frustrating because service at other Starbucks is not like this. I expect better since it's a STARBUCKS. I'll never use this location again. I wish new management would take over and whip these employees into shape. The professionalism starts at the top how employees work and give service. Don't waste your time here, walk further to a different location."
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2016-06-28,1.0,"This is by far the worst Starbucks I have ever encountered in my entire life. This review honestly deserves no stars whatsoever. Here are the reasons why.

The baristas are extremely rude and the customer service that they provide lacks in every single department. There were two baristas working at the time I visited this location. I assumed one stepped out for a restroom break so there was only one person working the register. The lady who was working the register had noticeable tattoos and she gave off a terrible vibe.. She took forever to come over to ring up my order and when she did finally come over, she was just rude and she wasn't really even listening to me as I was placing my order. Note that this summer they started with the new Sunset ""Granita"" drinks and it starts after 3PM according to the emails I received. I ordered the Strawberry Lemon Limeade Granita. I was unsure of the pricing for this particular drink because it was not listed on the menu boards. This barista rang me up as a strawberry acai refresher because all she heard was strawberry due to her lack of ability to focus as I was ordering. She was having a conversation with a man who had already had a drink and was waiting at the waiting area for the drinks. As I walked over to the waiting area, the other barista had returned and was making drinks. The tattooed barista came over and said ""this drink is for her"", there was more than one ""her"" waiting for drinks and the drink she made was the strawberry acai refresher. I was still thinking that I got the strawberry lemon limeade granita so I didn't think that refresher was my order. My boyfriend had ordered right after me and his drink came out already so I asked the baristas if the refresher was mine. The tattooed barista said ""yeah you ordered the strawberry refresher"" in which I replied, no I did not order the strawberry refresher and I told them exactly what I had ordered. So the barista who was making drinks, just gave the refresher to the man that the other barista was talking too and I'm not 100% sure but I think he was probably a friend of theirs. As the correct drink was being made, the barista actually made TOO LITTLE of the drink so she just topped it off with more lemonade. When she topped it off with the lemonade, I already knew it was going to be extremely sour and tart.. I was correct. The drink was the most disgusting drink I had ever had from Starbucks. I had to MANUALLY mix up entire drink to distribute the topped off lemonade because of the mistake the ""barista"" made. Both of the baristas were really rude when I said that they had my order incorrect, they half-assed their job and provided the shittiest of service. They only had one job each and they both managed to mess that up. Why would anyone hire such inadequate workers...

I will never be returning to this location ever again. Save yourself the trouble from coming here, there are plenty of other Starbucks that will actually get the job right."
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2013-10-17,4.0,A very small yet convenient starbucks in the shopping mall. You don't have to wait long in line and the drinks are pretty good. I love to stop by here whenever I shop :)
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2016-02-04,1.0,"This is absolutely the worst Starbucks I've ever been to, and I've lived in 5 states and 3 major cities. They all work at a snails pace and often make the drink completely wrong. They are more concerned with talking to each other during morning rush than getting people their much-needed caffeine in a timely enough matter so that we are not all late for our jobs. Please, I'm begging the management - either train your current staff or dump them and start fresh. Thanks for your time."
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2013-04-29,4.0,"Pros: the employees are fast and friendly with a low level of turnover (it's comforting to see familiar faces every morning).

Cons: the 8 floors of offices above the Manhattan Mall supply this Starbucks with a never-ending line. If you catch it at the wrong time, you'll be waiting ages. When it gets too bad, I usually go to the Starbucks down at 31st and 6th (pro-tip!)."
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2015-10-07,2.0,"Meh. It's convenient but the first day I went, no decaf. Second day, no change for bigger bills. Annoying and basically issues I've never run into at any other Starbucks."
796,starbucks-new-york-250,2015-05-05,2.0,"Not a fan of this Starbucks. Service is what it is, at Starbucks I am looking for speed not customer service. My issue is every other Starbucks I have ever been to when you order coffee they turn around, fill the cup, and you are on your way. This Starbucks puts your cup in line with all the other drinks. So on a warm day like today it takes 15 minutes to get coffee while they make 20 Frappacinos."

797,mcdonalds-new-york-393,2019-06-23,4.0,"Stumbled into McDonald's after not being able to find any ice cream places around the area so I went for my usual sundae. 

Upon entering I noticed how new and renovated this store looked and my thinking was confirmed by the other reviews on here. 

When you enter, there are about 5 self serve kiosks to the left (great that you can either pay with card at the kiosks or choose to pay with cash at the register so anyone can use the kiosks and it's not just limited to card payers). Further in the store to the left are the register counters and the pick-up counter is straight ahead. 

Service was very prompt and fast on a Saturday night and surprisingly, it wasn't crowded. 

There is seating upstairs and on ground level. The trash cans also have handles on it so you don't have to touch your hand onto the swinging door when you dump your tray which is a plus. 

I found it very strange that there was no music at all. It was very quiet and conversations felt uncomfortable. It felt like you couldn't have private conversations because of how quiet it was. Not sure if it's like this everyday or if it was just a one-off instance when I visited."
797,mcdonalds-new-york-393,2019-09-07,4.0,"Clean and newly redone. I do appreciate the option to pre order before walking to the counter.  They were very efficient. I mean this is McDonald's for crying out loud, you know what to expect!"
797,mcdonalds-new-york-393,2017-12-26,3.0,"I stopped in on a cold blustery winter night a few weeks ago for a pre work coffee. Imagine my surprise when I realized I was finally at one of the McDonalds restaurants that had self service kiosks.

I used one to place an order for a $1 coffee. I waited a total of 5 minutes and though my order number did not appear in the order kiosk in the kitchen, the workers knew to prepare and did so in an expeditious fashion.

The whole decor was a lot nicer than your standard renovated McDonalds and the dessert display vaguely gave me Starbucks vibes.

I haven't been back since but one of these days, I'll go back and reorder my coffee knowing I never have to interact with anyone at the register."
797,mcdonalds-new-york-393,2019-10-15,2.0,"Generally speaking, McDonalds offers a quick and fairly consistent fast food experience. The appeal of this location is that it is close to Penn Station. The restaurant itself was pretty clean but the restroom was locked and no one could find a key for us. However, the biggest problem was the food. The big mac I purchased was incredibly stale, to the point where the buns were actually hard and difficult to bite into. Not sure if this was an isolated experience or the norm here. May want to try a different location or the Shake Shack in the station itself."
797,mcdonalds-new-york-393,2019-01-08,4.0,"I've been to this location a hundred times in the past decade and after the full store renovations I like and prefer the automated self-serve setup McDonalds has begun implementing. The location has ample seating on the second floor and while actual customer service can be hit or miss I'm happy to use the automated self-serve kiosks to place my order which has me interacting with the staff less so the likelihood of experiencing ""bad"" customer service from a human being having a bad day is minimized. Otherwise, this is your typical McDonalds."
797,mcdonalds-new-york-393,2019-12-25,1.0,Terrible establishment. Workers do not know what they are doing and look clueless as to what to do. Workers are not paying attention to customers and are having conversations while food is coming out. Workers are oblivious to customers needs and are having attitude.
797,mcdonalds-new-york-393,2015-05-12,3.0,"Having gotten sick and puking on the train to NYC, I needed a resting spot and wasn't sure what was open in the city so early in the morning with no coffee shops in sight.

Thank heavens for this McDonald's which was my AM solace. The crew member who took my order was friendly and nice, when all I could stomach was orange juice. He gave me the OJ and a cup of tap fountain water in a biodegradable plastic bag -- strange, until you realize that they don't use cardboard cup holders in NYC but bags with dividers inside instead.

I proceeded upstairs into the dining room where it was filled with people. Free wi-fi and a space to rest. They have a posted 20-minute no-loitering limit but no workers hassled me despite my having my laptop out, thank goodness. I could tell that lots of other people there had the same idea and were just using the space to rest.

Just another example of how McDonald's always makes me feel at home."

It seems that @McDonalds have decided to focus on both service and speed in these parts. I love it! I wish I can say the same about Brooklyn locations; they need to tweak the experience there. I cannot talk much about their food in this review, because McDonald's is simply fast food. I can say I will try to locate 'build your burger' locations to create a proper review.

797,mcdonalds-new-york-393,2013-10-16,2.0,"While getting ready for a lecture nearby, I decided to drop into this McDonalds to get breakfast.  It's not the healthiest food, but the egg white delights that have been added to the menu recently are good and better for you than the average bacon sandwich you get at delis.  I also dig their coffee in a pinch (and it's cheap).  Even better, this branch has been renovated with the new ""Mc Cafe"" format, with dark wood, modern looking furniture and an architecture that suggests modern art more than 80's utilitarianism.  I was also hoping to charge my phone, and I had heard some of the ""Mc Cafes"" had charging stations.

Perhaps it was the cashier who got three coffee orders in a row wrong.  Perhaps it was the security guard (how many McDonalds have security guards at 8am?).  Maybe it was the sheer number of people hanging out without food, but I think I should've known there was something weird about this McDonalds.

I found the charging station in the back seating area.  It's a long counter with a horizontal line of lights, the plugs are set in between the lights.  It's a neat arrangement and comfortable with bar style seating.  I settled in, plugged in my laptop and iPhone and settled down to eat and get some work done.

I noticed, with some curiosity that a couple was sitting at the end of the table charging a laptop, a Blackberry and two iPhones.  One was a guy who was jittery.  Another was a woman eating a lollipop (again, it was 8am).  I tried to ignore them but couldn't help but notice how much of their conversation revolved around weed, and how many people kept coming up to them and how the guy would disappear now and then with them.  Eventually, both of them vanished for a bit, leaving all their electronics charging and unguarded.

Upon their return, the woman's lollipop went flying across the table, hitting my laptop.  She took it back without apology, and instead went on to complain about germs on her lollipop (she went back to eating it).  Meanwhile, the guy took out three rolled cigarettes and began to do math on how much each one was worth.

Meanwhile, across from me a guy whose arms were inside a hoodie looked up, declared ""It's cold in here."", put his head down and proceeded to snore loudly for twenty minutes.

Needless to say, my experience here was unique, and not in the ""I hope to repeat it again soon"" way."

There were hordes of people waiting in the wings for their food to come out though. That discouraged me right away. Either way, we got a chicken wrap and some chicken nuggets.

797,mcdonalds-new-york-393,2009-02-18,3.0,"I came here because I had to catch a bus in front of the Macy's across the street. 

The starbucks near there had very limited seats, but this joint is 2 levels, with plenty of seats to go around.  It was crowded., but its just bc there are so many people here. I still managed to find a seat here.

I sat down and checked my email on my computer, and these 2 dudes sat down next to me, and it was kinda humorous. One guy was pretty thuggish, but he was professing his love to his partner who was pretty flaming, saying how pretty the guy was. The thug said that, ""how do you eat that stuff and stay so pretty"".  The other guy just said he had a high metabolism or something.  

Anyway, this is a solid spot. 24 hour McDonald's and its near the Madison Square Garden and pretty much on top of the subway.

The food was pretty standard, but pricier than what you would get at a different mcdonalds and that's what you get for a McDonalds in an expensive real estate area."

First floor, counter and kitchen.

We arrive 10:22 after ranger hockey game.

We ask if they have 2 fish for $3, they said not at this location.
Then we ask if the have 20 piece Chicken McNuggets for $5.XX some change - no it was $6.XX change.

We ask these question, the manager was counting the store take for the evening in one of the cash registers.

We purchase small item.

We dine some were else that might cost more by few bucks.

I ordered the $3 meal deal which a one of a select number of sandwiches with a small French fries. I ordered the spicy McChicken. I used the kiosk to order and went up to give it to an order taker.

I got my food in less than 10 minutes. Before I left, I looked in the bag. The food us correct but no ketchup packets. I didn't see a place with ketchup packets nor a ketchup dispenser. It was too crowded to ask the original order taker.  The spicy McChicken was actually hot but nothing I can't handle. The fries were fresh but not too crispy."

Not to mention the fiends/crackheads/homeless that stand outside this McDonald's every single day! Matter fact they're inside the restaurant too. It's crazy that the cops allow this every single day. 

Sometimes it's a hit or a miss. I only go when I have no other lunch options! They're also more pricey than the normal...

798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2017-09-30,2.0,"It's McDonalds, so what can you possibly expect besides a stomach ache and a not so pleasant experience. 

Anyway, knowing this and usually avoiding McDonalds altogether except for their occasional breakfast trips, I decided to come here out of desperation due to hunger. Though their breakfast menu is available all day now (something I always maintained they should've done), I don't trust ordering breakfast at any other time from most locations, because they'll tend to half ass it - so I was glad this was the morning when most of the options are already there.

Coming inside, this place was crowded and noisy. It's fairly sizable considering it's Manhattan location (about 2 blocks from MSG). I just wanted a simple bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit, with a hash brown, and a small orange juice (served now in bottles). I saw their banner and while I wasn't expecting anything less than a standard McDonalds experience, I was happy it was there when I needed it. 

It was very busy inside. While standing in line, there were at least two customer issues with something and whether or not they were actually right or not (1 was, the other wasn't), they insisted on yelling as loud as they could and one of them almost seemed aggressive. While the employees here were not the best I've ever seen, they seemed to handle these customers well despite the customers' behaviors. They remained calm, though some of the other ones were distracted from their own jobs away from the customer issues that they'd stop what they were doing to gawk at their coworkers getting verbally harassed. Most of the employees though seemed to handle the madness pretty well. 

While McDonalds is McDonalds, this location was very loud and a lot of customers were acting like they were in their own living rooms instead of in a public space. I would question taking younger kids here with some of the very loud and vulgar talk that a few of them were engaging in - not to mention the two customers in line shouting at the employees with little to no regard to anyone else. I get it, you're frustrated whether you're right or not, but just because someone is behind a counter doesn't give you the right to talk the way you're talking - even more so when there are kids in line. Maybe I came at the wrong time, but I can only go by what I experienced in the time I was here. 

There was someone cleaning the tables quickly as people were leaving, which is always a plus. Some of the seats had cushions instead of that hard plastic that most locations have. 

A nice innovation was the monitor showing your order and when it being made and served. Whether it was fast or slow, depends - though mine was simple enough and the wait time was minimal. They still shouted my number anyway. 

The breakfast was as standard McDonalds as could be, but I knew what I was paying for. 

All in all, just an option in a busy area with a lot of likely better food choices. It's McDonalds and all that comes with it - from their employees to their ""food""......though in this location, it appears the customers are more the problem this time."
798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2019-02-07,4.0,"I should clarify, I normally wouldn't write reviews for a McDonald's (because this is Yelp of all places and alas the two definitely don't normally mix), but this particular McDonald's stands out for two things:

1) being open 24/7. Because sometimes I'm looking for a super cheap place open at 2:34 am in midtown for a late night snack that I don't have to spend $30 for.

2) the music playlist, which plays French avant garde Jazz electronic music (that I would expect to hear at a nighttime warehouse lounge in Bushwick, Brooklyn). I've shazamed songs from St. Germain here, which is awe-striking feat in itself. Who would have expected corporate midtown schtick  McDonald's to have a playlist on par with House of Yes? Whoever manages the music playlist knows their shit. 
I find myself reluctantly shazaming something new here every time I pass by.. just because I'm usually thinking.. WHAT IS THIS WEIRD GROOVY FUNKADELIC SONG?! I NEED TO KNOW.

So... Let's give a big thank you/hurrah to whoever manages the playlist. You've earned your dear employer a rare Yelp review that's good."
798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2019-07-10,1.0,Worst location ever. Shady people. Homeless people. Drug addicts. I would not bring family here especially children.

It's a mad house during lunch time! The people who have their receipts in hand...move along so you aren't blocking the register line *common sense*

I ordered a Crispy Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich...yes just the sandwich! The service from paying to getting my order was fast maybe because I only had a sandwich instead of a meal. Woah baby this was so yummy though!"

798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2017-10-09,4.0,"I'd expect a McDonald's near Penn Station to be pretty terrible, but they've actually kept this location reasonably nice. It's newly renovated and clean. The bathrooms are clean, and there are multiple stalls, with soap and toilet paper in the dispensers. They have security guards walking around inside. It's right around the corner from the ACE stop. The food is obviously standard McDonald's food, not much to say about that."

He then went back to his job, I ended up asking his name, Roman, thank you for your effort and dedication which kept the customers calm and collective."

I was stranded because my phone was dead and I needed my phone to charge so I could request my lyft driver from my iPhone to get home. So I was waiting to turn my phone on and I had to deal with a miserable black man that obviously works for this establishment harassing me about making a purchase, everyone knows how dirty this place is why would I buy anything off a McDonald's menu but to call the police because I ignored a dirty looking old man is beyond insane and as I was walking out to my driver, he told me ""bye slut"" I wasn't wearing anything provocative, I have a federal job working 9-5, I had on jeans and a denim button up shirt yet I get called slut.

The lines are not usually long but they are very disorganized and the wait time for can take over 15 minutes for just a sandwich. The food/promotions was on par with other locations.
798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2018-02-21,3.0,Had a coffee there not bad. Usually cold but this was served right. Pretty busy and staff could be a little friendlier and could be a little cleaner but I am also keeping in mind the location and foot traffic  so overall positive experience.
798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2016-04-05,2.0,"The infamously druggie-filled McDonald's is true to its name thanks to the many rehab and homeless related places nearby. I don't know their hours & patterns but wish another reviewer did so. I got my fries & got out alive 4/1 2p is itself gladness. I feel really sorry for all the tourists, especially those at the New Yorker hotel across 8th Av, who come here thinking America is great again. This location has a strangely modern McDonald's architecture for such rough security and loiterers. The staff does a great job but the security guard is either missing entirely or as bad as missing."
798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2016-08-02,1.0,"Rude employee, dirty dinning area, and they over-charge customers.
They charged a price to replace coffee for orange juice in the breakfast that's almost the price to just buy a separate one, didn't notify me and gave me someone else's receipt when I asked for the receipt. When I came back in 5 minutes to buy the $1.99 2-burritos, I only got one and she refused to give me the receipt."
798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2017-06-28,1.0,"Stopped here in the morning for breakfast.   The food was usual McDonald's.  However, this place was scary and they need to have a security guard in place.   There were many homeless people here sleeping.  The thing that bothered me the most was individuals that lashed out at the customer's while eating for no reasons.   Those folks just hanged out at the place. One of them stood next me looking at my cell phone.   I worried about snatch and run and put my phone away and left.   I would never come back to this location ever.  Beware!"

798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2016-05-18,4.0,"I'm seeing some average reviews, but I have to rate this McDonald's as the best I've been to. The crowd is what you'd expect: people from all walks of life. The food tastes as you'd expect:  mysteriously flavorful with unhealthy undertones. However, what makes this place stand out is the quick service and beautiful delivery. I got a cheeseburger yesterday that looked like a skinner version from the commercials. This is amazing considering that McDonalds was serving 20 other customers at the same time. The cheese was still fresh and melting onto the meat when I took it from the package. Whoever works in the back... I have renewed respect for all of you. Also it's nice that there's a ""bouncer"" of sorts to the place and someone is always cleaning."
798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2015-07-20,1.0,I came in for lunch searching for the minions toys.  This is the only Mcdonald that refuses to sell the toy alone and made me buy the happy meal in order to get the toy.  This location is a combination of a homeless shelter + disneyland...very interesting.  It is the only location where you can see homeless/addicts and tourists dining at the same restaurant.  The police was there patrolling and kicking out loiters taking up seats. I would stay away from this location.

Not to mention causing a lot of trouble, harassing customers attempting to purchase food.
The security guard DOES NOTHING.
Anyway, too many druggies around causing trouble, the $1.00 coffee is not worth risking ones life."

I saw with my own eyes the disgusting not even clean fry try that an employee was gonna put back until a manager saw the same thing and told them to put it on the floor. The owner of this Mcdonalds needs to clean house and start over. The inside is actually nice but when you have homeless and crack heads there, it sorta takes the elegance away. So SKIP this McDonald's location and go somewhere else!"
798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2014-03-22,1.0,"I feel kind of stupid even writing a review of a McDonald's. I mean, it's McDonald's, how good or bad can it be?

But this location made me want to cry. The interior is lovely! They clearly spent a good deal a money to make it look modern and clean and welcoming, and they did a great job. It's very handsome and comfortable. Well, as comfortable as seats and tables bolted to the floor can be.

The service on my one and only visit was a bit confused (I think they were having problems with their registers) but everyone was pleasant and apologetic. The food was what one expects, but that is not what I am rating.

I am rating the fact that at 2:10pm on a sunny, mid-50 degrees Saturday afternoon, fully 5% (I counted and calculated) of the seats were occupied by apparently homeless, definitely unbathed citizens. It was difficult to find a seat that was far enough away from an unappealing odor to not make my lunch unpleasant. I cannot imagine what the population of this restaurant is at 11pm, or on a cold or rainy day.

I have great compassion for homeless people, as does the city of New York and numberless charities. There are plenty of places where they can go to stay warm and dry and get a healthy meal. A commercial establishment that caters to families and children is not an appropriate substitute."

Waited in short (though chaotic) line to order, then waited ten minutes for $1.51 refund because no one ever made ice cream. Thought about bugging an employee, but they don't pay attention to anyone except the person they are helping. *This is an experience I have had twice in my last four McDonald's orders at different locations. Last time cashier ignored my request for a refund."
798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2015-09-28,5.0,"This review is for the store's ""ambiance"" not the actual food. I can't believe I just said ambiance when referring to a McDonald's. My friend and I were fascinated by the reputation of this McDonald's. So much so that we ventured from Murray Hil and Hamilton Heights respectively to check it out. From the New York Times article and other Yelp reviews, we were expecting a dull, yet somewhat intimidating body guard at the establishments' entrance, followed by low-lifes with various addictions (mostly meth and heroine) loitering at scattered tables. Contrary to our belief, it was a pretty nice McDonald's - clean, alert employees, bright. Maybe the methheads were taking a day off or maybe they ventured outside (it was quite a nice day) but we were unable to spot even one. So for fellow adventurists out there, no need to check this place out - no much to see, unless you enjoy McDonald's."
798,mcdonalds-new-york-427,2016-07-19,2.0,This place is always crowded and the cashiers are rude. They hold personal conversations at the register and argue with customers. Donot go here if you want good service.

If you do go be wary of the bathroom or sitting down they use and deal right in front of you... Mostly altercations, loud talking, passing drugs, nodding off.

Magazine Cafe is a small magazine store. But they know how to cram almost everything into a small space. 

The fashion/beauty section is right by the door. If you're a fashion or fashion photography lover, they have a decent selection of international and independent magazines. 

If you go into the back, they have some older issues for a discount. 

They also sell snacks by the counter. The person that works here seemed like a nice guy. Since I've never been in anything like this back home in Atlanta, I'm a fan."

He called me on my cell phone to give me the exciting news!!!   Magazine Café is the best!!!!   The customer service is great!   I look forward to doing business with you again in the near future."

the service is exemplary.

my FAVORITE resource for all which is new and relevant!"
799,magazine-cafe-new-york,2012-11-01,4.0,"Haven't been there in person but have ordered from them. I applaud their selection. International magazines are harder to find than you'd think it would be in this internet age. Anyway, shipping was fast and the magazines are reasonably priced. If there was anything, its that the magazine I got was a bit nicked around the edges and there was no more and it was an annual collector's edition. Sigh."
799,magazine-cafe-new-york,2011-11-17,5.0,"The staff is absolutely wonderful! They know every magazine, are very courteous and extremely helpful - they even call me to let me know when new magazines that I want come in! They also offer shipping so its very convenient to pick up a ton of magazines and just send them. They have a truly impressive selection of domestic & international magazines, every possible trend & trade magazine you could need in any design field. Definitely the best & most organized magazine store in NY!"
799,magazine-cafe-new-york,2012-10-03,1.0,"This place sucks! I was hunting for a copy of a certain international magazine that Magazine Cafe had. They said they were holding all of their copies for one person. (No doubt some self-important writer/photographer). But they would give me one of the copies for triple the price. No thanks douche bags. Nothing like taking advantage of those in need. This guy is also probably the first to complain about Western Capitalism and doesn't understand the irony. Thanks for nothing. I'm gonna check one of the other 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 magazine shops in NYC before I ever even think of giving you a dime. And I spend a LOT of money on magazines."
799,magazine-cafe-new-york,2009-11-12,5.0,"So, I am an out-of-towner who frequently travels for a living. Sure enough I enjoy my work as I constantly encounter a wide array of places that leave me with lasting impressions, good and bad. And, then there are places that not only meet your needs as a consumer, but, truly make it worthwhile for you to remain loyal to them.  One such place is Magazine Café, located right in the heart of the city between 5th & 6th avenue.

I only stumbled upon this treasure of magazines during my recent visits to the city, for both business and leisure purposes. I remember, the very first time I was just shopping at the flagship stores when this elegant looking ""Magazine Café"", caught my attention. With no particular desire to buy a magazine at that very moment, I walked into the store more out of curiosity and what a pleasant surprise awaited the ardent reader in me. 

I was simply amazed at the vast arrangement of books and magazines this place carried in every category may it be domestic or international. I personally enjoy fashion magazines from around the globe to keep up with the ongoing trends and I do not believe there was a magazine I could not find here. Not into fashion? No worries. They carry magazines for all interests: Arts, architecture, Food, Travel, Foreign Language, Computers, Business, etc.  you name it and they have it. In case they do not, they will gladly get it for you. 

Not just that, their prices are very reasonable and the staff was quite helpful as well as courteous. The atmosphere was so relaxing and what could be better than a cup of coffee to compliment it with.  Yes, it is indeed a reader's dream. I spent much more time than I had expected and also ended up buying a couple of magazines of my interest. 

I have now been to the Magazine Café a few times and must say I still leave the place with the same satisfying experience as I did the first time. I strongly recommend this place and can say without any hesitance that you shall not be disappointed."
799,magazine-cafe-new-york,2013-12-06,5.0,"Magazine Cafe is my personal go-to store for magazines. Since I live Uptown, and work in Midtown, those Downtown shops are not very convenient. What I care about in a magazine shop is selection and space. Does the shop have the magazines I want and more, and is there enough space for me to comfortably browse? Magazine Cafe offers a ""yes"" to both questions. Arguably every great magazine is available at Magazine Cafe, even a lot of hard to find Japanese magazines. And the shop is adequately sized so I don't feel like I'm constantly bumping into folks while browsing. The staff - I've had no interaction with them beyond making a purchase - is altogether fine. They don't make me feel nervous or guilty for leaving the store without buying something, and they're perfectly polite. I recommend Magazine Cafe highly for the Midtown shopper."
799,magazine-cafe-new-york,2013-03-13,5.0,"Magazine Cafe has a wonderful selection and employees that are more than helpful.  This business has wonderful customer service. The office I work at is always in need of multiple magazines, I call ahead and check if they have what we need in stock, if I ask they will pull the magazines and have them ready for me when I arrive.  I highly recommend this place!"
799,magazine-cafe-new-york,2009-01-21,5.0,"Wow what a store. I'm a professional fashion blogger and need fashion magazines all the time. These guys have the best selection of magazines if ever seen. They carry everything from fashion, art, architeture, health, entertainment, photography, hobbies and much more. Plus they have loads of foreign magazines from UK, Italy, japan, France, Germany..... .I would recommend this store to everyone looking for any magazine. Also they have  an online website magazinecafestore.com where you can buy the latest issues of these magazines."
799,magazine-cafe-new-york,2009-12-16,5.0,a friend recently turned me onto magazine cafe's online shop and i was so impressed!  i've never seen such an amazing selection of fashion and home magazines.  i was able to purchase a hard to find magazine here and i can't even begin to describe how amazing the customer service was.  they were very attentive and helpful and took time to answer my questions.  very nice people and a nice selection of magazines!
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2020-01-10,5.0,"Best coffee. Best people. Nothin but love from these folks. Case in point: Had super crappy day, 13 hours and not over yet. I trip over to grab a cup and a cookie but they're closed and everything was cleaned up and put away. Not only did they show me love but one of my fav employee (and a stone cold fox) gave me the cookie out of her own take-home bag. Nothin. But. Lo"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-08-19,4.0,"Dirty Chai. My favourite hot bevvie, made excellent by the baristas of Gregory's. This location is right by one of my per diem gigs and I ALWAYS grab a cup of something here in the morning, on my way to work.

I used to wait until I actually walked in to order by brekkie but since downloading their awesome app, I order remotely on the ride in when I'm about 5 blocks away and my order is usually ready by the time I arrive. My go to is the dirty chai w/oat milk, which is chai with a shot of espresso. The oat milk makes it super creamy. I'll add a peanut butter banana power bite which will hold me over until lunch. The breakfast toasts are good also.

I've never been to any other location so I have nothing to compare it to but in regards to other franchise coffee shops (conglomerates that shall remain nameless), this one is great! They have complimentary ice cold water and courtesy cups for customers to enjoy while waiting for their orders. They are super efficient in that a couple people take orders and while they're fulfilling the food orders you pay the next person and someone else is fulfilling your drink order at the same time. When they're not busy it is very streamlined but if they are busy, it can take forever because of their efficiency accepting orders as well as the online orders they're receiving.

The app saves you a lot of time. You basically order on your phone and when you arrive, you just pick up your order at the designated area on the counter for app orders. Your beverage will have your name on it. My only issue is that while they put a receipt with your name on it on your beverage, your food order will just be sitting there in a brown bag with nothing to show who it belongs to and sometimes it will be sitting there, before your drink is placed so if a lot of people are ordering food items, they'll be touching that bag to check if it's theirs. One time a lady took my power bite with her drink and they were looking at me like I had grabbed it already. They need to print two receipts for orders containing food. Place one on the cup and one on the bag so we don't have have to worry about contracting norovirus from some grabby patron or have someone snag our breakfast. 

Aside from that one incident, I've never had any problems. Definitely download the app if you frequent Gregory's because their rewards program actually pays off. They give you a lot back for using the app and I've probably only paid for about 4 out of the last 15 orders I've placed through the app due to the rewards I receive."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-10-06,4.0,"Came on a Saturday morning right at open (which I was surprised that they don't open till 9!). It's a cute little space and they had decorated for Halloween which was a cute touch. The menu looked really interesting with a mix of cold and hot coffee drinks and the baked goods looked delicious as well. I don't usually drink cold coffee drinks but theirs looked interesting enough to try next time.

I went with a cappuccino with macademia milk but they had all different kinds of options for milk. You could do almond, oat, soy or macademia. It cost an extra $.95 to swap out from their whole milk which is kind of pricey but probably on par with NYC prices. But my drink was super delicious! Very smooth and the flavor of the macademia milk added a nice nuttiness to it."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-09-25,5.0,Very pretty matcha latte. This one isn't as sweet as the ones in Starbucks and a bit lighter than the one from 2 Beans and so much better than the one from Tartinery as all the matcha power are evenly mixed and also has more flavorful than the version from Taylor street. The one thing is that that is lacking is that it isn't as fresh in that delicate matcha taste as the version from Ippudo tea.
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2018-12-11,4.0,"A roomy Gregory's with plenty of friendly staff and available seating. This location never gets busy, unlike their 44th/6th sibling, that's half the size but twice the clientele. This location has long communal tables great for getting some work done. I never stay long though, usually in and out with a latte or smoothie in hand.

Their fairly new Lean Green smoothie tastes great, and nutritious enough for a light lunch. It's dairy-free, yet still nice and creamy from whey protein and a mix of spinach, strawberries, blueberries, and almond butter. I'm also a huge fan of their Morning Boost smoothie, with two types of berries, and granola, yogurt. It tastes like a drinkable dessert! Great offerings in a neat space we've all come to expect from Gregory's."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-07-16,5.0,"I've been here multiple times and I keep coming back because of the smooth coffee, nice working space, but also wonderful ambiance. Not too bustling although people are coming in constantly to grab their daily Joe but there has always been space. The workers and barista have always been really friendly. My first time I came I got the small drip coffee that hinted with flavors of chocolate and nice with less acidic tastes. The dirt chai was not too sweet and just frothy enough. Added a shot of espresso and it was the perfect star to my morning with the banana cake I got. Would highly recommend. One of my favorite chains in this city that boasts high quality while also catering to many"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-11-23,5.0,"Second visit here. Great service and coffee. Ice latte my go to drink was made well. Pretty standard prices when it comes to coffee. Place doesn't get too crowded compared to other coffee shops nearby GCT. Lots of ample seating and desk place, with power outlets and wifi to get some work done and being productive. They also sell a lot of pastries here. Would definitely recommend if you're around the area for a good cup of coffee!"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-07-02,3.0,Tried the chocolate chip cookie and it was hard as a rock.  No chew whatsoever - just had a chalky taste and texture to it.  Better off going down the street to Taylor and getting a better cookie for $0.50 more.  Had to throw this one into the trash can.
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2018-05-04,4.0,"Another week, another Gregory's visit! This location has great service and quality coffee. I went here before an event in Bryant Park for a chai lavender latte, along with their crunchy peanut butter power bite and a slice of carrot cake. No, it was not all for me! The power bite tasted so natural and healthy, and at 175 calories, it's the perfect snack to split with someone. The carrot cake (440 calories) was so thick and juicy, and had so much actual carrot in it. Went so perfectly with the star of the show, the latte. I fell in love with this latte, ladies and gentlemen. The taste is so subtle and so delicious, and even made of skim milk, did not lack any substance or ""meatiness."" I can't wait to treat myself to this silky smooth beverage again soon. 

The location is relatively clean. Their bathroom could some work, but at least they have one!"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-12-05,1.0,"the manager on duty has no customer service kills. she's too bossy towards customers
just cause I'm not dresses in a suite she was talking down to me"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2018-10-02,4.0,"I come to this shop from time to time. Usually there isn't much wait so it's good to stop by even when I'm rushing in the morning. Also, they have a pretty good app where it gives a lot of double points or $2-3 discounts on certain days, ordering ahead, and birthday drinks, etc. 

I usually get latte here. I tried many different flavors like mocha or lavender. I really liked the lavender smell but I find their coffee to be really light. It's very bland. I'd give 3 stars since I'm not a huge fan of their coffee but because the app and service is great, and the location of the shop by Bryant Park, I'm giving them 4 stars."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-09-14,3.0,"This was my first time at any Gregory's Coffee. I probably won't return. I visited on a Saturday morning and there was one other person in the shop. It was cute and the pastries looked beautiful. For this I am giving stars but the rest of my experience was less than stellar. The two staff behind the counter seemed dull; no welcome or hello. But maybe they were nervous or new..can't blame them for that. I ordered coffee which was weak. My vegan breakfast sandwich was plain and tasteless. My cranberry scone was very good. Payment was made on a tablet and as is customary these days, an option to tip made itself available. I usually tip and this time was no exception. The lowest tip option was 25%!!  If they would have grown the coffee and delivered it to my hotel room I would have given 25% but I opted to leave  a couple of dollars equal to about 10%."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2018-07-30,5.0,"This Gregorys specifically is a great work place compared to some of the other locations in the chain. Lots of seating: long communal tables in the middle as well as plenty of 1-to-2-people side seating (with plenty of outlets). +free WiFi and bathroom.

*** DRINK ***
Try the honey badger cold brew drink. It's refreshing and a nice changeup from all those other cloyingly sweet coffee drinks on the market these days."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-09-20,5.0,Nicest staff! So polite & generous. They are quick and get your orders to you quickly. We use this place a lot for work so they are always accommodating with any big orders we have. The snacks and treats are the best and the NuBrew is amazing
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-02-11,5.0,This is the promised land. Everything I expect in a coffee house and more. Listening to the bk music added a nice tone to my matcha latte. Sunrise Market for a Japanese seaweed lunch followed by a matcha latte at Gregory's.
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2017-10-02,3.0,"I had a nice flat white here and it was almost free after using the LevelUp discount. I thought it was pretty large compared to some other places, and it tasted great. This location is spacious and the employees are friendly!"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-09-18,5.0,"Amazing coffee shop with excellent service. Recommend 10/10. Had an iced matcha latte that was pretty good and great, delicious pastries"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2015-12-28,4.0,"While coffee quality at Gregory's has suffered a bit from the effects of mass production from franchising, this relatively hidden location of Gregory's has one of the most relaxing, airy ambiance for a coffee shop in Midtown. It is also one of the cleanest coffee shops by far.  It certainly helps that it is not too crowded even during rush hours. 

While the coffee quality is fair, the selection is plentiful between the house blend and a variety of single origins. The banana bread and other pastries pastries are as good as any other Gregory's location. Lastly, the store manager, Joseph, and his team are very friendly and pleasant company. As a whole, Gregory's remains a well oiled machine and continues to provide the midtown workplace with solid coffees and pastries for all occasions (including holiday promotions). Keep up the great work!"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-04-05,5.0,There's a lot of Gregory's coffee's throughout the city. But this one right by Bryant Park is my go to. It's close to Grand Central And Bryant Park. I really think Gregory's coffee has some of the best stuff. I love their wellness drinks options. Especially the tumeric latte. Hopefully one day Gregory's will take over Starbucks and dunkin donuts for world coffee domination. In the meantime I'll just hope they start spreading to Connecticut where I live.
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2017-11-27,4.0,"Cappuccino coffee and croissant in a perfect way!!! Nice place and very friendly staff. I will come back
I.love it"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-09-18,5.0,This cozy coffee shop is the best place to go when I'm feeling like I need a change of scenery from the office. The staff is always kind and they make really great matcha!

Still recommend ."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2018-05-04,5.0,"Quiet and perfect to get work done(good music doesn't count as noises of course).
Seasonal turmeric tonic drink was a great springy drink to have!"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2016-01-07,3.0,"Finally a coffee shop in NY that has done it right!  I was looking for a coffee shop close to my office and after reading some reviews I came in to try for myself.  Walked in and automatically liked the setup of the shop and everything else about it.  Very cool vibe with great pastries displayed right at me which made me want to order them all but I have good will power.  The woman at the register was extremely friendly and helpful when I was ordering.  I told her I've never been here and she asked what I was looking for and then recommended.  

Coffee was hot and fresh and tasted delicious.  If I had more time I would have stayed in and relaxed but had to get back to work. Definitely coming back here when in NY for work.  All around this is a cool spot for coffee with a wide selection of pastries and coffee."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2018-05-10,5.0,"Fastest and best customer service I have ever seen!! Starbucks: take notes. Gregory's is always fantastic for my morning pick me up, my usual is a large iced almond milk chai and an almond crunch, but their chia seed pudding is also a fantastic choice. I'm greeted every morning by a smiling face who consistently gets my order done accurately in literally seconds, no matter how long the line is. Love it!"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2017-03-10,3.0,"Decent coffee - one of New York's chain coffee stores. In general, I always found their coffees on the more sour side but they have a decent Alex room of unique blends and brews. 

Well, still better than a Starbucks if you want to go with some more craft brews."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2016-12-24,4.0,"Great service and quality coffee & pastry. The barista recommended her special drink - chai lavender latte. I've tried lavender coffee drinks in the past and did not like it... but this was so delicious. It wasn't too sweet and the subtle lavender paired nicely with the chai. I highly recommend this drink! 

Also try the blow out! It's basically a cinabon with chunks of chocolate. Make sure you get it heated."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2018-12-28,2.0,"Plenty of space to hang with some good pastries. However, the $6 latte (Blue Bottle price for reference) I had was absolutely awful. It was made way too hot and tasted burnt. The foam was completely flat. I expect more after paying so much for a beverage, but what I received was more along the lines of a McCafe product.

I thought it was a fluke, so I gave it another chance. Nope, it was the same terrible quality. I could see coming here and using it as a place to work, but the coffee is extremely overpriced for what you get."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2017-10-24,4.0,GREAT PASTRIES. I seriously love them. BUT the coffee is a let down. The milk they put out for self pouring is kinda gross. And it weirdly doesn't mix in. I would not recommend that or the tea which is gross. BUT GT THE PASTRIES. I just had the chai donut. So good.
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2016-02-25,5.0,"I love Gregory's!!!
Especially this location.
I came here today and stayed in my corner for 5 hours. No one said anything to me and the staff were all so courteous. 
I had the kona something.... Which was aero pressed coffee and it was really good. It wasn't overly strong. Plus, for those that enjoy soy milk:they have free soy milk! 
Free wifi.. Clean bathroom... Nice staff. And great coffee. What more can I ask for?"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2016-04-05,4.0,About as happenin' as its other locations. The location and employees are pretty satisfactory. It's a little roomier than the other ones I have been in.
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2015-10-31,3.0,"I went there yesterday with a friend, in the early/mid-afternoon.

The positives:  the staff were very pleasant (and the barista was particularly endearing, as his face was ""done up"" for Halloween), there's a decent amount of seating, and the restroom was clean.  I got a small drip coffee ($2.35 with tax).

The big negative:  they BLASTED (pulsating) music the whole time (and when I asked one of them if she could please turn down the music, she said she couldn't because it's behind a wall), to the extent whereby my friend & I had to practically *yell* in order to hear each other - and we were sitting at a tiny table.  Also, the coffee was barely even mediocre-tasting.

Due to the miserable situation with the non-stop blasting music, I won't return."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2019-02-08,1.0,Three strikes you're out.  I urge you to not even give them one try.  Super rude mgr and poor quality service and coffee.  Your best bet is the Starbucks across the street!
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2015-07-25,3.0,"Pretty big place with a unique decor that leaves you curious and wanting to know more about it. Cool posters and great selection of breakfast pastries. I haven't tried much aside from a few coffee drinks from here. The drinks were alright - run-of-the-mill drip coffee. The Aero-pressed coffee is actually quite impressive. Great flavor to it. Not too bold, but very nice for the first cup of coffee you drink on a Monday morning.

I come back from time to time... but it's not something I crave."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2018-11-26,4.0,"I've been to a couple of Gregory's coffee shops on several occasions.   I always get a latte with Almond milk which is very good and I have tried various vegan pastries, all good as well.  I've had the cakes, scone, vegan bar and chocolate ball.  My least favorite was the scone.  The cake was very filling and moist.  My only complaint was that it needed to be a little sweeter.  The vegan bar is packed with nuts and dried fruit and the chocolate ball was enough to satisfy my chocolate craving.  So happy to see more and more establishments offering vegan options.  I'll take Gregory's over Starbucks any day!"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2015-11-20,4.0,"This place opened up relatively recently.  A co-worker often goes here, and she raves about the place.  I decided to try it out.

Yes, the coffee is very good.  I like the redeye, which is regular coffee with a shot of espresso.  Of course, you can order the various types of coffee, espresso, lattes, cappuccino, etc.

So, if you are looking for an alternative to Starbucks, this is the place.

Unfortunately, Gregory's Coffee is just as expensive as Starbucks.  They also sell donuts at $2.50 each.  I was tempted to take my rating down to three stars just for that, but their coffee is really good.

Also, the staff here is very friendly and helpful.  They were polite and answered my questions.

And the décor is nice too."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2015-03-17,4.0,Very pleasant place-en route to the dentist and had time to kill-not overly crowded ( which was nice).Dentist is in area so will return and recommend.
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2015-02-03,4.0,"Stop in for latte today. Nonfat. It was decent. A darker roast to the bean. But clean tasting. No aftertaste. 

They had some pastries. And some sort of yogurt based items.. I'm honestly not sure what they were. Looked interesting. I wish they had some sort of healthy vegetarian breakfast option. Yogurt didn't have ingredient label, so I didn't know if it was vegetarian or not. They had a ham pastry. Only other option was sugar. It would be nice to have oatmeal, or more savory pastry option that didn't have meat."
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2017-12-13,1.0,"Went to pick up my drink and a friends (ordered from the app to pick up), and after waiting a while for hers we realized her order was placed for the wrong location. I kindly asked if her drink could still be made because the app automatically locates the closest Gregorys and it was clearly not functioning right, and they said no because they would lose profit. Lose $4! That's terrible customer service. I get it wasn't a mistake on their part, but not being understanding and being worried about losing $4 is horrible customer service. Was a regular and will not be going back there again!"
800,gregorys-coffee-new-york-17,2017-04-01,2.0,"Such a cute coffee shop, It's cozy and nice service. But my iced chai tea latte was absolutely terrible. It tasted watery and the small cup is SO small. For $6, I should have gotten way more than what I did. The cup was literally filled to the top with ice. It took me about 2 minutes to finish the entire cup because there was little to no tea in it. I will never waste my money here again."
801,dunkin-new-york-36,2018-12-03,4.0,"Location: Small interior. Not much more than standing room. But it's in close proximity to Penn Station, so that's a great plus.

Staff: Pleasant and knowledgeable.

Menu: They make great Vanilla Chai. It's only reason I stop at DD now and if you make me a weak Vanilla Chai, I won't come back.

Wait Time: YMMV but I've never waited more than 5 minutes. Now I'm sure, if I stopped in during peak hours, that wait time would increase.

Will I return if I'm nearby?: You betcha.

It doesn't get simpler than that."
801,dunkin-new-york-36,2019-11-23,2.0,"It looks like I'm at a grand opening. I'm here with my daughter. We are African American. There is only one other customer Caucasian. The other customer had his order brought to him at the table where he was sitting. When my daughter's order was ready they called from the counter ""order 17"". And looked at her waiting for her to come get it. It 2019 it's astounding to me this behavior continues. She's a professional sketch artist who was treated less than a customer who was allowed to enter with two dogs. VERY DISAPPOINTED. New Stores should take diversity training before opening the doors."
801,dunkin-new-york-36,2017-02-09,3.0,"It's funny, I came here after going to the DMV and I was in line at the DD waiting to get coffee for almost as long as it took me to renew my license!   It was 9:00 am and they had one guy taking orders and it just took a long time.  12 minutes from start to finish.

I was taking the train from penn station to Boston I saw this was the closest location to penn. I dident think there was going to be a Dunkin' Donuts in penn station. 

The staff was fine I just ordered a wake up wrap and a small hot tea. Just something to hold me over. I came in at around 10:30am there was only 1 other person in line. It was quick and painless."

I love this location they make the coffee correctly, some other locations put way too much cream in it and you end up with a cup of half-and-half instead of a coffee with half-and-half, others don't put enough, or a caramel maxis to has no caramel, however this location always gets it right it's very clean and I've always been satisfied with everything I have purchased here."

Went to the one on 34th and 8th and when i got there, the fellow told me he would not make me a sundae because it was too late, yet it was a 24 hour place.
arriving at the one on 31st and 9th, there was obviously none in there because i was after midnight on a sunday but it was very clean and the man who made my sundae was extremely friendly.
they ran out of reece's half way through making my sundae so without asking he went into the back and looked for more, after he couldn't find any he came out an apologized, no worries ill just have oreos instead with the sundae. 
Very nice guy!! friendly and helpful and willing to take the extra step! 
thanks"

801,dunkin-new-york-36,2014-06-30,3.0,"I'm giving 3 stars to this Dunkin Donuts because A) they are never crowded during my morning commute (I've peeked into the one at 31st and 7th numerous times and always packed) and B) I've always gotten what I've wanted.  However, getting what I wanted has been a chore.  

I decided to join the Dunkin Perks loyalty program where they gave me a free medium drink coupon for joining and another one for my birthday (a few months later).  Both times I was given a hard time by the staff when trying to use them.  There is one guy (the owner possibly) who made me feel like I was trying to cheat him. I thought these coupons are supposed to entice me to be *more* loyal, not less but guess not every franchise got the memo.  When using my birthday coupon, they argued that they couldn't accept the coupon because the QR code was worn out from the paper being folded...that's perfectly reasonable to me, however there was a number typed under the QR code that was completely legible and when I asked why they couldn't type that in, they ignored me.  They offered no other resolution and I was tempted to just return the Coolatta and walk out the door, but I was in need of caffeine.  I racked my brains and remembered I might still have the email saved in my inbox so I asked if I could show them the email on my phone.  At this point the line was getting longer and those behind me started ordering, so I had to step aside and rest my Coolatta on the bin near me while searching my phone.  My internet access was spotty so it was taking a while for me to find the email, but this manager proceeded to scold me for resting my drink on the uneven surface so I had to move further away near the condiment station.  Finally I found the email and they scanned it and I was on my way...5 unnecessary minutes wasted because they didn't trust me.

Coming from someone who works in Marketing, hassling the customer is not a way to make them want to come back.  In this case, I had completely valid coupons so antagonizing me was absolutely ridiculous, but even if they were expired or something was wrong with them, they should never treat the customer in such a way, especially in front of other customers.  

Sadly, I will probably be back at this Dunkin but will make sure I keep my order simple (e.g. a  regular coffee) and will save my longer (read: pricier) orders for another Dunkin despite how crowded it is."
801,dunkin-new-york-36,2014-08-03,5.0,"Ordinarily, I'm not a huge fan of DD, but this one may change my mind. 

Open 24 hours, the first time I came in, I went in for a snack and came out with a coupon and a deal on donuts since the worker had realized it was my first visit to this location. Upon my second visit, he waved but wasn't overly intrusive as I spoke with yet another friendly clerk. It was clean, the donuts were fresh, the coffee was good, and the wi-fi was strong. All in all, that's all I was looking for. 

I live in the area, and, every time I've entered, the staff was friendly and productive. The line is never long, even in the mornings, as they get people moving *quickly*. Nice job, Dunkin.

Granted, I didn't see anyone in the Baskin-Robbins area, but I have seen people come from that side/come out with ice cream, so I know it exists. I can't speak to their ice cream prowess."

Seems like the people that generally come into this particular DD, are wannabe coffee snobs, IMO. 

Like they think they're at Starbucks living the plush lavish coffee life.
Newsflash: thats a Coolatta, not a damn Frappaccino lmao, get off that high horse.

Like this instance: 

Customer: ""Can you make my Coolatta 2% milk, and do you have any Madelines?""  The guy behind the counter looked at her like she just fell from outta an airplane.

In my head I'm like Madelines??? Bitch youre at Dunkin Donuts, they have DONUTS & shit, lmao, none of that fancy shit you find at Starbucks.


I dont have anything negative to say about the workers. They do their jobs,  and smile, which i know is not always an easy task given the kinds of people I observed in here on more than one occasion.

I asked the guy behind the counter if the Baskin Robbins was closed and he said no, they can still get me some of the Baskin Robbins' drinks (as long as they don't involve ice cream). I don't know what the deal is here but they shouldn't claim to have a Baskin Robbins if they really don't and they certainly shouldn't be using the ice cream fridges for storage, it doesn't look good."
801,dunkin-new-york-36,2010-10-15,3.0,I don't frequent the Baskin Robbins but Dunkin Donuts has always been good to me. And they toe the company line. Not much else to say. They do what you ask and it's pretty clean.

802,spice-professors-new-york-3,2019-12-27,5.0,Not sure how I've missed them at the Bryant Park winter market in years past; but I'm quite happy I found them this year.  The spices are so good I've been creating some tasty dishes.  The teas are the best so flavorful and aromatic when brewing.  My online cart is already full.
802,spice-professors-new-york-3,2019-07-28,5.0,"I was walking down a fair in Astoria when I smelled a bunch of spices. Usually I'm indifferent about most stands but the large variety of spices and teas intrigued me. The man that was there was very informative in telling me the difference between the teas as well as letting me smell all of the teas (multiple times). 

I ended up buying the french provence blend and the relax yourself blend for $10 a piece. I also bought metal steepers to enjoy my tea. The steeper holds about two teaspoons so it's enough to make a strong brew if that's your cup of tea (pun intended). 

 I've already had my first cup and I'm hooked!"
802,spice-professors-new-york-3,2019-10-15,3.0,"Very disappointed. The tea seemed stale and had little taste. I got 4 containers of tea and 2 of them had 'tea debris' that I think are used to make tea leaves. I bought earl grey and something like a princess grey. Certainly these teas did not impress me. The seller at the street market was not very knowledgeable about tea, which was a shame."
802,spice-professors-new-york-3,2019-07-28,5.0,"Stopped by their stand while at a street fair with my girlfriend. We both enjoy a nice quality tea so we just had to take a peak at their selection. 

We bought the ""French Provence"" and ""Relax Yourself"" wellness teas for $10 each. Before bed that night we brewed a cup of each blend and it did not disappoint. Very nice quality, rich in flavor, and effective. The ""Relax Yourself"" blend is infused with chamomile buds, a personal favorite of mine. Like my experience with other chamomile blends it did settle my stomach after a meal and made me very comfortable. 

Now that we are satisfied with their tea we will be back for some of their spices for cooking chicken, steak, etc."
802,spice-professors-new-york-3,2019-05-30,5.0,"Best Chai Masala I've ever had!  If you come across them do yourself a favor and stop. You won't regret it.  I look forward to discovering more spices to spice up my teas, cooking and life."
802,spice-professors-new-york-3,2018-04-04,5.0,"I first discovered Spice Professors at the Bryant Park Winter Market. I bought a couple of teas and spices on my first trip. However, we soon became addicted and went back for more. 

My husband requests for the Jamaican Jerk spices all the time and said he wouldn't mind eating that every meal (great with chicken). That particular spice blend is a staple in our home (gonna purchase another 3 large tins right now cuz we are running out of it soon). For culinary spices, I am also using the Chinese Five Spices (great with soy sauce based Chinese stews and Fried Pork Chop). I also use the Shawarma mix for my Shawarma Chicken, Cabbage and Rice. I also like a few of the teas (yet to try all) - love love love the Blood Orange Rooiboos Tea and the Ginger Peach for a perk me up. I have a few other flavors which I have yet to try yet but the Pina Colada and White Summer smells heavenly."
802,spice-professors-new-york-3,2018-08-12,5.0,"I was at a street fair a few months ago  when I smelled their amazing spices and teas and had to stop and check them out. I love spices so I wanted to try one of each but I settled on the Jamaican jerk blend, Indian masala and the holy detox tea. The spice blends are wonderful- fragrant, flavorful and fresh. I use them on chicken, fish and steak. I also got a tin of turmeric and sprinkle that on just about everything I cook. The holy detox tea is hands down the most amazing tea I've ever had. After one cup I felt energized and wonderful. Today I came across them at another street fair and stocked up on more teas and spices. The people who work the stand are very informative, helpful and very sweet. It's good to know that they have a website that I can order from once my stash is low and street fair season is over. Great products- highly recommend."
802,spice-professors-new-york-3,2018-01-17,2.0,We purchased some tea from the Spice Professors at the Winter Market in Bryant Park a couple weeks pack. It smelled great in the shop but fast forward a couple of weeks the tea tastes very bland and nearly flavorless. Despite experimenting with brew times and quantities I cannot create a good cup of tea with their blends.

803,starbucks-new-york-532,2020-03-01,2.0,"WHO KNEW COMMERCIAL MATCHA EXISTED. I was excited to know Starbucks actually sold matcha latte but I was a bit skeptical. I was right to say the least. 

I am grateful that I had matcha latte at Café that specialize in making there drinks from scratch. No commercial short cuts to be precise. 

Starbucks matcha latte was soooo creamy it threw me off. Like it was too creamy. It honestly some how felt like creamer was in it instead of milk. It just was too thick. I just don't even know how to describe it. It's not even on their menu. I just ask them because my co worker was getting something to drink for me. 

Matcha Latte is a bit grainy. It's basically green tea. So it's a bit strong but good. The taste you kinda got to get use to. So I can understand why maybe this is the reasoning behind Starbucks creating a creamy one. Something easy that people would like.

Unfortunately, I don't like it because I got introduce to original matcha latte early on. so if your like me you will likely not like it. If you never had matcha ever and don't mind a creamer version, then hit any Starbucks for it. 

I personally don't think it's great because of the fact that's it's not on your menu. I guess it's apart of the Ghost Starbucks menu. Ha! Who knew it existed."
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2020-01-11,2.0,"This Starbucks location is a nightmare. The lines are always insanely long, even with 5-6 employees behind the counter. It takes forever to get a drink. To make matters worse, when I came here a few days ago, the barista gave me a bent cup, so when I went to take a drink of my hot tea, it spilled out down the front of my jacket. Not ideal!

Save yourself the headache and go to another location - this one is a mess."

We were in there for about 5 minutes, and this guy almost knocked the door down and threatened to call the cops on us for using their filthy bathroom.

Walked in here around 4:45pm and it wasn't busy at all. Was able to go right up to the counter and order my drink. The dude was nice and took my order and I was able to scan the free birthday drink on my phone. I got the venti size because the free drink can be used for any sizes. If it is your birthday, make sure to open up your Starbucks app and use your free drink on the largest size possible to get most out of your freebie. 

The lady made my drink pretty quickly. Probably had to wait like a minute and it was ready. Was able to located some straws on the end of the counter. The island didn't have them. I also asked for a bag and another guy was nice enough to give me a bag. There are also seating upstairs. Nice Starbucks. Not too crowded and pretty chill spot to sip on some coffee after work."

There was only one, in the corner, and thankfully I had access to it (otherwise my phone would be powerless for the next few hours).  I ordered a plain croissant and the attendant toasted it, which was lovely.  I thought that was pretty cool how she could just tell that I love my carbs toasted.  There were a few tables and counter along the window at which one could sit, so I sat by the outlet at the window so I could also people watch as people walked down 7th Avenue.  The croissant was delicious!"

They have to hustle harder  around the CHEAPSKATE STARBUCKS POLICY which is HIDE THE DAIRY ALTERNATIVES. I would even pay extra to not have to have the Barista ""dole out the Almond milk"" This SLOWS me down and makes my experience HELL. During my lunch break I TRULY LOOK FORWARD to going to buy coffee and enjoy the experience, this ruins my experience and aggravates me to no end. I have a dairy allergy if that is not bad enough, I have to slowly sip the coffee and taste if there is enough milk each time as the Barista doles out the milk in Increments, This slows me down and slows down the Barista. STOP THIS POLICY STARBUCKS IT IS ANNOYING AND PETTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PUT THE Dairy alternatives out for the customers, OR AT LEAST put one out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I came here to give a bit of juice to my phone while I'm enjoying my Chai Latte bit of course the only outlet was taken. After walking around the whole store asked a barista if there's any other outlet and the answer was NO. First Starbucks I've ever been with one outlet.
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2017-09-11,1.0,"I ordered through mobile and you would think that ordering through mobile and going to pick it up would be faster than ordering in store because you get the skip the whole line. That's not the case for this store. They waited til I got there and shouted out ""Elaine?"" And made sure I was there then proceeded to make my drink. 

The barista made one/two of my drink and handed it to me. I still stood there because I was still missing one. They obviously acknowledge the fact that I was still there but didn't ask what else I needed til I said excuse me. Service was extremely slow. There was two people at bar. There's no reason for it to take more than 5 mins to make a drink. The store wasn't busy at all. 

Also I ordered a drink with whipped cream. I did not get my whipped cream.

Today's service was slow and not super friendly and it wasn't very busy either; ordered a grande cascara which is a simple enough drink. I like this new flavor because it's not too strong and artificial tasting even if it really is. Even the mobile orders sat there while people waited patiently. They do have upstairs seating, which is convenient.

Next time I'll probably opt for another place on 7th since there are plenty!"
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2018-12-07,4.0,"I think Starbucks barista turnover is relatively high, so I personally don't think reviewing baristas is that useful. This Starbucks is fine, and I would even say better than average because there is a good amount of seating. Upstairs is great because there's not too much movement up there but if you prefer a little white noise, you're removed from the busyness but can benefit from the energy. If you're looking to do work, there are no power outlets upstairs (not sure about downstairs, but I wouldn't work downstairs because there is less seating and more commotion)."
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2018-05-04,1.0,"Worst service around specially from Sthep, consistently very rude as I stop here most days on my way to work. Never acknowledge when a question is being asked and yells at customers when they try to get an answer

I will NOT recommend this locations because they are just rude and slow."

I love this Starbucks for two reasons. 1) this location has balcony sitting upstairs .. so cozy to have coffee & look out to the street. It also, has long table for meeting or studying together. Downstairs has round table with long chairs for group hustle meet ups. 2) It has extra, separate EXIT door to the next door ( avoid crushing the waiting line .. avoiding accidents ) I love the team members here as well.

Mumbling... My drink was hot, instead if ice. When i tried to tell her this, she didn't even turn around to acknowledge me & talk to me. She just kept facing the other way making a drink while screaming, what size? Sugar? I'll re-make it! She made me an ice. Disgusting. Threw it out on my way out. Very Ratchet employee. Smh"

Matcha frap is good, taste best with less sugar."

Given that it's on 7th Ave that's no surprise, but wasting 15 minutes of my morning for an iced coffee is a little ridiculous (that's 6 mins in line 1 min taking my order and 8 mins waiting for it). The line usually wraps around the store in the morning and not enough employees are on hand to keep up. I stopped going here a few months ago when I found a better Starbucks on my walk to work between Penn Station and West 40th Street. 

Only perk of this place is that they fill your cup all the way up to the top. Awesome for those of us who drink our coffee black!"

Instead, they keep the mobile orders BEHIND the counter, so you have to flag down a very busy barista to ask if your coffee is ready to be picked up, since they only call your name one time before placing it back there in Siberia. Makes sense :)"
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2017-12-19,2.0,"Confusion Rules Here

It's a big and busy Starbucks and you would think it should be organized to handle that. But no. 

If you Server doesn't ask for your name, you're not going to get your beverage. You will have to waive your receipt at someone until they figure out that they have an unclaimed beverage for you 
 (My experience)

The women next to me received her drinks but not the cakes she ordered. The servers politely explained they were not responsible for cakes, only drinks. So she asked what to do ?  Go back to the end of the line and ask. She refused and asked that they find her order. No One was looking for it. She got understandably angry. They finally brought her half her order. I guess half is as good after waiting 20 Minutes. 

Avoid this location. Find another Starbucks"
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2013-10-29,1.0,"They covered all the outlets. Who does that?  I know it's common for Starbucks in NY to do it, but it's rude especially since they pride themselves in their reputation as a laid back place to relax. They even have a dedicated upstairs for it. 

It was also ridiculously slow. There were 3 people in front of me and it took like 10 minutes until I could order

An employee was pretty rude to a girl because she was sitting there and didn't have a coffee in front of her.  She had only just gotten there and the employee called her out across the room.  buy a $2 coffee and you can sit there all day,  take a few minutes to settle in before you get one and get embarrassed infront of everyone in the immediate area.  Doesn't seem right to me"
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2013-08-05,4.0,"SB's are a dime a dozen in NYC. 
What makes this one stand out the most is the staff. 
Very friend and humorous team of employees working when I was there on a Sunday afternoon. 
I also enjoyed the upstairs lounging area which is a bit quieter than the tapping of laptop keys in the main area. 
Prices are comparable to other SB's on every other corner."

I spoke to an employee wanting a refund.  He found my empty cup in line took me to the register and refunded me on my mobile app.  I waited 20 minutes and left without a coffee.  Unacceptable.  Horrible customer service.
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2016-10-28,1.0,"Ordered a tea latte at this location.

The drink took 25 minutes to prepare. For something that takes 25 mins to carefully craft you'd think it would be done as ordered. No it wasnt. To top it off genius barista though it would be a good idea to save an extra second..and put out the cup lids on her wet nasty counter so she could access them quickly. Not very bright people that work here. I went behind the counter and replace the nasty wet lid myself...STARBUCKS go and pay more for your staff so you can hire better qualified staff.

Staff is just lazy and careless..going through the motions of a dead end job."
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2014-11-25,3.0,"Okay so the coffee is typical for Starbucks...  The facade is kind of hidden on 7th Avenue.  The sign isn't very noticeable from outside. This is just across the street from my office. But this place is hit or miss. Sometimes you get a fast batista. Most times it is just SLOW.... Lines during the week are just really long and are up to the door. Sometimes you can't get in without hitting someone with the door. Staff service is okay, mostly friendly. Batistas are usually overworked. They need 2 baristas at all times to keep up."
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2015-08-03,1.0,"The dirtiest Starbucks in the world. Trash all over floor upstairs and downstairs. This place has the worse ambiance ever. Also, I ordered an iced coffee, black-no ice. They gave me a half cup of coffee. I asked where's the rest and the Barista replied, ""Thats how much you get without cream and ice."" I said, well I'm a rewards member and will only come back for a refill. His reply, ""oh well, just come back for a refill."" WHAAAT!"
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2016-04-27,5.0,"Super impressed by the baristas' customer service, so it's surprising to read these other reviews. I work on 34th and Broadway around the corner, so I'm in the store about 4 days a week to either pick up coffee or sit and do some work. My experience has always been that the baristas are friendly and visibly do their best to move the lines along as quickly as possible while still being polite. Coffee is great of course--although I only ever get a regular cappuccino or black coffee.
It is inconvenient that there is literally one plug available for guests too use (you can charge your phone using the attachments they lend you to put on the ""charging pads"" but that doesn't help with laptops)."

I wanted to sit and stay a little longer (there were many groups around my age just hanging out drinking coffee and making use of the free wifi) but I had other obligations.

If I'm ever in the area I plan on returning."
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2016-09-15,3.0,"Not overly pleased with the service of the individual making drinks. I realize they're busy, however I ordered 3 drinks, got 2 right away, and ended up waiting 10 minutes for my 3rd drink. When I asked about it the barista rudely responded, ""it's coming."" I've had better experiences at other Starbucks around Manhattan."
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2015-10-16,1.0,Employees have no sense of urgency. Move at glacial speeds. Just all around low caliber service. Not what you expect from Starbucks.
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2013-04-08,5.0,"This is the first two-story Starbucks I've ever seen. The first floor, at ground level, is inviting in that the crowds are not forced to stand by the doorway, but rather there is bar-like seating wrapping around the front interior which directs waiting patrons away from the incoming ones. This is appreciated greatly. 

Secondly, the space for the line is open, but clearly presented. A word of caution though, the bathroom is tucked away in the corner near the line and can be misleading. People waiting to use the bathroom, which is clean and well managed, appear to be waiting in line to place their orders. When a native sees this opportunity to one-up the out-of-towner accidentally waiting in the bathroom line to order coffee they will seize it. That can be frustrating.
 
Once you order your coffee and begin looking for a sitting spot you'll most likely head upstairs. This area is cozy with about 12 to 15 seats and overlooks the first floor. Because the traffic here is frequently moving, your chances of getting a seat are high, though you may need to wait a few moments. Never be afraid to gently ask someone if they will be leaving soon, but only if there are signs like wrapping up their power cord or shaking their empty cup a little. If you are quick, and the ordering line is short enough you can attempt to get a seat prior to ordering. This is risky in that leaving something behind to mark your stake in the spot also creates an opportunity for your things to be stolen. Never leave anything but an empty backpack, a book, or an empty jacket in your place. As well, look at the people near your spot and judge based on your inner gut. 

The atmosphere here is very upbeat with a young crowd as well as business folks. The music is soft and the patrons respectful. When a Starbucks is so inviting with easily obtainable seating and friendly staff, it is a perfect spot to start or end (usually open 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.) your day at the Big Apple."
803,starbucks-new-york-532,2017-05-31,1.0,"This place is TERRIBLE. I have never experienced such slow and disrespectful service. It took them 25 minutes to make my simple drink that should have taken 2 minutes. On top of this, there were maybe 5 other people in the store at this time. When I made it very clear that I was not happy with their service, they laughed it off, and purposefully took longer."
807,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-14,2020-03-09,4.0,"SO cute in here I couldn't stand it! LOL
We were walking back to our hotel when the green and pink colors caught our eyes, so we had to check it out!

We were greeted by two girls and they were both very friendly. This location is very small! About two or three small groups took up the couch space and we had a group of five which made it pretty cramped. 

I really wanted to get the matcha soft serve but I was so full from lunch so I opted for the matcha lemonade. Way too tart for me. I would've preferred more of the matcha flavor. 
We all tried different drinks but our favorite was definitely the purple drink! The lavender wasn't over barring so it didn't taste too flowery. 
We also tried a matcha latte and they made a cute palm tree on it!

Good place to grab a quick pick me up and take some Instagram worthy pics! As we were walking around, we noticed they have a ton of locations and some with a lot more space!"
807,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-14,2020-06-03,1.0,"Just. Not. That. Good.

Great marketing, poor matcha. They don't do it right (maybe sightly better than Starbucks?) We all know that's a low bar to meet, though. For the price this place charges, you're better off getting a matcha fix through your own means (buy it online and DIY!) or from another store. 

Doesn't help that the owners are racist MAGA supporters. Just ask their own former employees!"
807,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-14,2020-02-29,5.0,"A small location compared to their Broadway/W 27 street location.   This new store can probably fit 8-10 people sitting.  They do serve ice cream as well in this location.  The service was very friendly and their match latte chai at $6 was pretty good and strong matcha flavor.  I was originally planning to give 4 stars but their friendly service and clean environment earned them 5.

Please click helpful.  They are near the corner of 42 nd street and 5 ave. (Near Bank of America ATM machine) They are 3 mins walk  from Bryant Park and 2 mins from New York Public Library - Stephen A. Schwarzman Building."
807,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-14,2020-02-13,5.0,"The 6th location (4th in NYC) just opened at a great spot right near Bryant Park.

They have the same fun and Instagrammable stuff as usual, including the current Matcha & Peppermint flavors of soft serve, which makes it one of the better options in the area for a good quick dessert and of course coffee."
807,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-14,2020-02-24,5.0,"This area definitely needed a matcha shop. The store was clean and there was no line when I went (Monday afternoon around 3PM). I got my usual matcha latte and the service was quick. There aren't many seats so this is definitely not a study spot. I can see it being a crowded location in the summer because their ice cream is delicious and generous, relative to what is around the area.

Not sure if they have loyalty punch cards like their other locations, but when I paid with a card they asked about earning a point so I signed up."
807,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-14,2020-02-28,4.0,"I loooove matcha, and am very excited that Cha Cha Matcha just opened here. I don't drink coffee, so I am not used to spending a lot of money on sweet iced drinks at Starbucks. I begrudgingly paid $6 for the matcha lemonade and was horrified to find that I loved it. I'm going to spend so much money here, it's truly awful. The staff members were really nice and service was quick. Go before the crowds discover this place."
807,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-14,2020-03-13,3.0,The nitro latte that I got here was not as creamy as I thought it was going to be. This definitely is not my favorite location of cha-cha Matcha. Their grade of matcha is fantastic though
807,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-14,2020-03-03,5.0,Love the purple drink (lavender and Cbd). It's like a taste of heaven. Sometimes I add matcha and it's the perfect blend
808,starbucks-new-york-423,2020-01-22,4.0,"As far as Starbucks goes this one stands ahead many. I often go here in thick of morning rush hour and you've all likely experienced the chaos. It used to be a long line at the register and then waiting. Mobile purchases helped alleviate the register line but now the line for pickup is longer. 

Well, this Starbucks has a dedicated employee on the outside of the counter at pickup (typically a rockstar named Onassis) that will personally call out the names on the cups and hand you your drink - with a friendly smile and greeting. Likely he does this 100 times a day. He doesn't skip a beat and is always trying to help or make things better for us, the customer. Well done. This is rare and highly commendable. This type of experience is what makes this Starbucks my favorite. Onassis is a star and I look forward to him handing me my order each visit 

Above that, it has everything you'd expect from Starbucks including a fresh makeover and a decent amount of seating (with an upstairs too). My only wish (and this is for all Starbucks) was that there garbage/recycling area was better informed on which items go where. They leave out key things you're likely to be done with and want to discard but you're not going to know if it's landfill or recycling!"

The second time, I ordered my free birthday drink (venti chai tea latte with soy milk) and a bagel, toasted and buttered. They didn't put the butter directly on the bagel which was kind of weird... They gave me two pats of butter so I did it myself.

This location has two levels with ample seating on both, also."

They are real idiot!!!"
808,starbucks-new-york-423,2019-08-24,2.0,"Simply put, it's rare that I encounter pleasant experience here. Today I ordered a mobile drink and instead of informing me that they didn't have all of the ingredients, I was give a bland drink instead. I did ask for a substitution for the drink, and it was made, (still not containing what I asked for) however I was met with a ""not to be bothered"" attitude."
808,starbucks-new-york-423,2018-04-09,5.0,"I almost don't want to review it because this location is such a hidden gem to me, but it's not fair to keep it to myself. 

My Starbucks rubric is nyc is as follows: is there seating? Do they make the drink correctly? Is there a bathroom? Is it a reasonable distance from work?
My answers to all four of these are YES! So they get five stars for me. (Follow up is, is it near Times Square? Fortunately, the answer to that is no)

There is a TON of seating here, shared space in the back, a large bench location along the wall with tables, shared table in the front, and then also an upstairs! Very nice, I've always been able to snag a seat here during my 4:30-6:30 breaks. The music isn't too loud either, which is great if I need to make phone calls.

Like I said, they have a bathroom which is awesome and a rarity. It's not sit-on-the-floor clean, but for city standards it's pretty nice. 

They always have the cream/milk pitchers stocked as well as straw containers and my drink tastes like it's supposed to. The employees are perfectly nice and competent."
808,starbucks-new-york-423,2018-01-05,3.0,I've been in here a few times and the staff is always been nice to me . The store itself is nice and big plenty of seating . Service is decent and fairly quick . The bathrooms on the other hand aren't so pleasant but it's not unusual for certain places in NYC or even public places in general.
808,starbucks-new-york-423,2019-03-28,5.0,The manager Jaham is amazing. She asked me if I need a free refill when I run out my coffee. Such a sweet person!

The display case is clean and well lit. Everything looks good! Refrigerated foods and drinks are also displayed well and fully stocked. 

My barista, Joel, was polite and friendly. He greeted me with a smile and a ""good morning"". When he called out my coffee order, another barista repeated it incorrectly and Joel promptly corrected him (in a nice way of course). I also ordered a danish which somehow came out of the oven a bit dry...? Still good though! 

Other employees were zipping around making sure tables were clean and free of debris, garbage cans were emptied and the bathrooms were tended to. 

Good way to start my morning"
808,starbucks-new-york-423,2019-07-18,1.0,Can't make a drink right when you order from an actual person instead of the app. I must have said what I wanted 5 times. They took forever to actually make it and then still got it wrong.....pathetic
808,starbucks-new-york-423,2017-01-06,4.0,"I don't go to Starbucks as often as I used to but my last couple of visits to different branches are leading me to think that the chain is realizing that a ton of competition is encroaching upon its business model so they are having to change their game up to compete.  This Starbucks located in midtown Manhattan is a great example. 

The space is absolutely gorgeous.  It is wide open and goes deep into the building.  There are two floors of seating, something you don't see very often in any coffee shop in Manhattan.  The colors are heavy contrasts between light and dark colors.  Add to that some beautiful photography in a back section and some cute drawings on another wall and there is a sophisticated charm to the decor.  Someone definitely gave this layout a lot of thought.  It felt instantly comfortable and modern all at the same time.  On top of all this the space was very clean.  Not one table had garbage on it and all the surfaces looked like they had been wiped down.

I ordered a Chai Latte and it was made very quickly (this was around 6PM on a Friday).  The staff was quick and efficient, though they seemed to be scrambling around a lot behind the counter.  The chai came out great (though a bit frothy compared to other places).

I would definitely go back here for a drink if I am in the area.  I was very impressed by my visit."

I will not be back. Yeah the decor is nice and blah blah blah but it looks like every other Starbucks. News flash: treating customers with respect is part of the job. I understand you don't like it but don't take it out on someone who was nothing but pleasant.  And putting regular milk instead of soymilk on the low is not cool.
808,starbucks-new-york-423,2017-09-03,1.0,The worst Starbucks! Filthy and service was severely lacking. The barista seemed irritated when customers arrived. All the tables are dirty and the garbages are overflowing. Will NEVER RETURN!!!!

808,starbucks-new-york-423,2017-03-28,3.0,I usually hate ordering from starbucks and just do the mobile ordering. But I was looking to find a place to sit while I wait to meet up with my friends. I just got my lashes done and this place was conveniently right across the street from me. Usually starbucks are pretty small but this one had a lot of space and even an upstairs! I hate small starbucks because they never have a bathroom I also hate most starbucks because I know they use to have a bathroom but they got rid of it. Super annoying. This one however had a bathroom so that's always something nice to know if I'm stuck in midtown. The people were super nice and it wasn't really crowded granted this was in the middle of the afternoon so there wasn't a morning rush or anything. I wish most starbucks had this big design though it's super comfortable and a lot of charging ports for your phone!

808,starbucks-new-york-423,2015-06-16,4.0,Love this brand new Starbucks! Spacious and clean. Lots of places to sit.

I had ordered my food through the ritual app. When I got there to pick up my order the guy at the register claimed he didn't receive it. I told him I have the confirmation for the order. He asked me to replace the order. I explained to him that I couldn't because I would have to pay again. The purpose of me using the ritual app is for me to pick up my food without the hassle. This prolonged everything. I showed him that I had made the order before he finally gave it to me. He gave it to me with an attitude at that. What I found funny was that he gave me the food right away when I showed him that I paid for the food. It makes me think that he knew I ordered but was trying to get me to buy again. Any ways I had got their chicken Guacamole wrap which was a little on the expensive for the size. I've seen wraps bigger for that size. The wrap wasn't all that either it was okay but I've had better. This place could work on their customer skills that's one.
809,aleef-cafe-new-york,2018-12-15,4.0,"I stayed at a hotel nearby and wanted to try some coffee besides Starbucks. They had a wide selection of hot and iced coffee, smoothies, and juices; it was hard to choose. I got an iced caramel latte and it was excellent. The man let me try it and wouldn't charge me unless it was too my liking. Great stop for anyone looking to pick up breakfast or lunch."

809,aleef-cafe-new-york,2017-08-15,5.0,Bought food at this place every day for 1 week while in New York with my 3 kids. Very friendly people. Healthy food!!! Grab and go big fruit cups. Smoothies are delicious. All kinds of healthy snacks. Tried several things on the menu and all was great. Highly recommend this place to nearby hotel clients. Met a lot of international travellers while waiting for my food and we all commented on how good the food was at this place.
809,aleef-cafe-new-york,2017-06-21,1.0,"First, ordered off grubhub (was charged on my card) and i go to pick it up and the workers have no idea what grubhub even is. So i order a new sandwich and finally get it after 20 more minutes (i pay for the second time) to bring it back to my office. I take my first bite and almost break a tooth on a super unripe avacado. I remove the rock hard avacados to continue eating and the sandwich was dry and not tasty. Couldn't even finish it. Will never go back again"

809,aleef-cafe-new-york,2016-07-26,5.0,"What a jewel! Aleef is a tiny shop with huge warmth and the freshest food in the area. Most places in the garment district throw salads together with no regard to the quality of their ingredients. Aleef has the highest quality and best flavor. IT IS ANOTHER LEVEL. The menu is vast, based on your own creativity. Plus, you walk in and feel like you are home. 
This is my place and I invite you to make it your own."

Too finicky for my taste

The EBT system was down the last time I was here. I attempted to return merchandise to the shelves and the cashier got physical with me. Apparently this place has been beleaguered with sticky fingers in the past.

I just wish she hadn't been that way with me. The No EBT sign was poorly placed. I have always been a paying customer at 7-eleven despite my circumstances.

Yeah, I would avoid those things at all costs.

Not only did it turn the other way, it broke in to two pieces! I haven't had this problem with even the $5 umbrellas I have bought from the street, I went back to the store on my way back home, which was around 3 hours later, and explained the problem. The two cashiers at the counter couldn't speak a word of English and it was impossible to communicate with them. After a little while they dialed in their manager, allegedly called Sal (not even sure if it was true). I was met with the terrible customer service from someone who boasts running two stores. He was extremely rude, did not know how to communicate, and pretty much accused me of ""playing a game"". For someone who regularly shops at this store and has spent a lot of money in the last year, I was stunned at the cavalier attitude. Too bad these guys have just lost a valued customer."

Some of the fountain sodas didn't taste right because they were watery. One worker didn't want to ring me up, because she was not ""Clocked In"". The other almost made me pay for my free drink. They need to be more customer friendly and actually manage their location. Also, be mindful of the bums I usually see outside. Not very welcoming.

My husband and I live practically across the street. We always go to this specific location because of the location. It was Super Bowl Sunday we came in to make a purchase we usually split up to cover more ground. I felt like someone was following me throughout the store so I turned to see this tubby man just gawking at me then to come find out he wasn't following me but my husband it just so happened that he was next to me that how I put 2 and 2 together. Just your average racial profiling which is disgusting. The store was getting busy on a visual standby I say 90% of the patrons were Caucasian but instead of tending to everyone in a timely matter this so call man tiredly ran behind my husband because he had the impression that he was going to steal. Then what appeared to be a middle eastern boy snapped his fingers at me to get my  attention to pay, which is totally out of line and disrespectful. If that disgusting short fat man and his rude disgusting staff is working I would not spend my hard earned money at that branch it's sad because no one should ever have to feel uncomfortable or disrespected when making a purchase."
852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2019-09-20,5.0,"I am giving 5 stars solely based on being able to use the bathroom without being thwarted by any customer only policy, which frankly I found surprising. 

If I ran a business right in Times Square I would most certainly have a customer only policy for bathroom use. 

In any case, I am just glad that I was able to go, abs I didn't see any customer only sign, no one stopped me or questioned me, and the bathroom was not locked.

Kinda odd to give a review for something like this, but if it counts for anything, I left the establishment relieved and wanted to give, at least what I feel, is due credit."
852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2019-12-09,1.0,This McDonald's is one of the worst of the worst McDonald's there is they don't even deserve my one star The  staff is rude and disrespectful and Treat customer like crap . I ordered a bacon BBQ burger I got a double cheese burger with bacon like seriously. I will never go back to this McDonald never..
852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2019-08-02,1.0,"Bad customer service. The staff makes it so obvious that they hate their job or tired by giving bad attitude to customers. In addition, they don't give condiments to customers but gives only 3 ketchups when asked nicely by customers. Foods are alright but the bad customer service left a bad taste and impression. I recommend you to eat else where where they actually gives you condiments when you ordered a meal."
852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2018-03-04,1.0,"Ok... Let's admit it, even those whom are fortunate as I have been to eat at some of the best restaurants in the USA (and beyond) have had a MickyD's at one time or another.

So given some old memories,( it's been 2 yrs) I seemed to have a hunger for a Big Mc. Maybe it's the sauce confusion that it was like an old Carroll's Club Burger. 

Anyway-  asking for it on plain bun took 2 tries because sesame seeds and I do not get along. "" So sir you want a Big Mc plain?"" No I want a regular BigM just on a plain bun.

Hey what can I expect, but after 2 tries (one sent back)they got it. I had patience, it might be there 1st job right.

Ok to the review... The worse burger ever. Just lifeless meat patties, dry, even a bit cold. Awful. Barely a 1. Never again. With so many choices, well I don't need to find Tums after as I did here.

The Macy's location is clean, small , on the kids clothing floor so lots of kids as expected.

For all the readers that just might fall weak to some old childhood Happy meal happy memory, forget it. One is same for all in this type of factory, and it is just bad taste. Never again unless maybe I am stuck in Spanish island with only fish for 3 months, would I consider breaking down again."
852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2018-07-27,1.0,"Possibly the worst McDonalds ever. The staff is rude and lacking! They clearly hate their jobs and possibly their lives based on the way they treat everyone. I get it, they are extremely busy but they chose that job. The owner obviously doesn't spend enough time in this location because I doubt this is what they would want for their franchise. A girl is just trying to get some fries. DAMN!"

I didn't notice at first because i thought since she used the register then it should be that price. i do not know what she input or what she clicked because she overcharge me. I only got the happy meal toys and i know the toys were $1.62 each. So overall i was not happy with this experience at this McDonald. I will not go there again.

852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2008-03-22,2.0,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this McDonalds location is the one on the 7th floor of Macy's. Who would have thought? Macy's is home to one of many fast food eateries! Business must be hurting bad if they need to sell off their real estate.

This McDonald's is crowded and caters to the rich. No it's not any more expensive than the McDonald's down the street, but the portions are small. My french fry carton was not even expanded. They just slid some fries in the there flat. Boo hoo. We weren't offered any sauce for our nuggets either. Aren't we supposed to get at least two for our ten piece and one for our four piece? Stingy! No wonder you are making money. Ripping off the poor folk.

The customers are strange here. They like to stare and they also like to steal your food. On waiting for our trays to be filled this one girl kept grabbing on to my tray. I told her twice that was my food and she still did not understand. 

Throw down! 

I'm going to take myself to the McDonald's near Bryant Park. There are a lot of students there and ghetto people like me. They hook you up with the fries over there cuz they know people are hungry and hurting if they got to go to McDonald's for lunch. Not like this Macy's where people can buy Hotel sheets for $300. I may shop there but if I'm paying for my value meal, I better be getting a full carton of french fries.

Ahhh the price of convenience food."
852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2015-10-10,2.0,"I don't expect much from McDonalds. In terms of food, what you see is what you get, and this McDonalds was no different. This location has the typical fast food (burgers, fries, chicken sandwiches, kids meals), and it was all average. However in the span of 8 minutes two different people came up to me while I was eating with another person at my table solicitations us for money. I understand this comes with the territory in NYC, but at an eat-in establishment I think this is totally unacceptable. The blame should not rest solely on the establishment, but also the employees. I say this because there was an employee 6 feet away (standing like a statue) both instances. She saw and heard the whole thing but did nothing. This to me is not acceptable. If you want to get hassled and bothered while trying to grab a quick bite to eat go to a street truck and at least you can accept the fact you might get solicited."
852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2009-04-17,3.0,"So I come here the other day with my nephew.  He's four.  And like every nephew in the world, he wants a Happy Meal.  And since I'm the greatest uncle in the world, I must comply.

""Uncle Tony, I want pancakes.  Can I get pancakes?""

""But I thought you wanted a Happy Meal?""

""I want both.""

Luckily I got there at the perfect time.  10:55.  I can order pancakes and a Happy Meal together in one trip.

So we split a meal.  He eats about one and a half syrup-slathered pancakes before declaring he's full.  I scarf down the rest.  And on the way out, we pick up a Chicken McNugget Happy Meal, toy in tote, to go.

Once we get home, it's nuggets, fries, a box of apple juice, and half an hour of playing with his toy until he passes out.

Mission accomplished."
852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2012-11-21,3.0,There are really two things you ever expect from Mcdonald's.  Cheap lunch and noisy kids. This location did not disappoint on either fronts.  But their apple pie is pretty good plus my lunch was free so there's that.
852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2012-12-04,1.0,Staff that takes orders in my instance was that they could not understand English.  Very disappointing.  Undersized for a McD so it is tight during busy times.  There is no play area.

Because it was so hot in there people actually stood there with the door opened while somebody was sitting there eating, but then again that tells a lot about the people who sit there, before I do that I would sit on the freaking floor and eat."

852,mcdonalds-new-york-129,2007-02-04,2.0,"I literally stumbled upon this little eatery late one night as I was heading home in the wrong direction.  Their menu is quite diverse, and I must say, their prices were reasonable considering this is New York. Another perk is they provide a visual accompanyment for most of their menu items.  Upon a quick evalution of the menu, I settled upon the ""Chicken Selects"".  These are prime cuts of chicken, deep fried to perfection.  They also have a unique option of combining your entree with a side and a drink for a reduced price.  When this option was presented to me, I jumped on it.  I chose ""french fries"" as my side dish. I later learned is the only side dish available, but that's fine as the french fries were unbelievable.  In fact the entire meal, at the time, was the best thing I had ever tasted.  My rum and Coke did taste a little watered down, so I'm suspicious as to how much rum they actually put in there, if any.  A few suggestions for the McDonald's staff...hey, at least you have your health!  These people were the most miserable bunch I had ever seen.  So in terms of waitstaff friendliness, they receive zero stars.  I also had to clear my own table, something I've never heard of in the restaurant biz.  And it was terribly difficult to capture the attention of the waitstaff to get my check...but they must have realized my frustration and gave me my meal on the house.  (I remembered later that I pre-paid for my meal)  Regardless, I only left a 10% tip on the table, and the waiter (he may not have been a waiter, as I reflect on the evening...) grabbed the tip before I left the restaurant, something, I find, as very rude."
853,7-eleven-new-york-37,2014-02-18,3.0,"Sometimes, 7 Eleven feels like 7 Eleven. Other times, it feels weird. This is a weird one, with a store design that puts the checkout counter nearly down the middle of the store, with a big opening to the registers if you're filling up a coffee. It lacks an open designated coffee bar area, and the canisters are packed on the counter. 

It's a small store but it was clean, and the staff was nice."

THOSE ARE THE ONLY WINGS THEY EVER HAVE !!!!That is nonsense, they've given me those wings before many times.

The problem at this store is that a few of the employees & 1 of the managers is very combative. I sent a complaint to 7-Eleven Corporate, I await their response. It's not about the wings, it's about not thinking you don't have to honor your agreements and can get away with it. This all occurred after 6pm, Saturday April 13, 2019."
853,7-eleven-new-york-37,2016-03-31,3.0,Once again it's Thursday and I'm volunteering nearby. I saw they had a sign posted outside advertising a chicken sandwich for $ 1.99. I asked to see how big they were. I ordered 2 after seeing the size. They were already in their foil wrapper in the heating component so there was barely any wait. When i opened one I could see it was a piece of boneless breaded and fried chicken with some pickle slices and some sort of mustard sauce. It tasted decent. You could taste the mustard and the pickles complemented the mustard.

My guess is they just don't like counting change at the end of their shift and if you're over, you just keep it..."
853,7-eleven-new-york-37,2014-07-19,3.0,This 7-11 near 23rd (and another Sevs right up 8th) isn't a bad option if you need something late night.
853,7-eleven-new-york-37,2013-04-13,5.0,"I just want to say how great the people are who work here. They are very nice and care about their customers.

7-11 always has those addicting craving foods like donuts, slurpees, and their weird pizza.

But kudos to 7-11 corporate for adding some healthy/fresh salads, apples, and one healthy sandwich to their rack. Please add more. You have a massage school around the corner--a lot of the students are health-conscious.

Thank you for being the best 7-11 (close runner, up, W 42nd St.)"
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2009-07-08,2.0,"No cinnamon sugar donuts and they didn't hand over our breakfast sandwich, so we didn't realize it wasn't in our bag until after we left the store.  However, they did end up giving us the sandwich with no drama, so no one had to get hurt.

Very good coffee, but the food was sub-par."
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2020-01-12,1.0,"Worked here back in 08. I can't believe they're still around. They fired me for going to the doctor, but the manager was able to make bi-weekly trips to Pakistan. Go figure."
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2019-01-08,1.0,"This place use to be good.  They have rapidly declined.  Today (01/08/19) I went in ordered a large hot latte and a medium.  No sugar or foam in either latte.  When they gave me the large...it did not feel full. When I checked it was 1/2 filled with foam.  Then the douchebag argued with me when I told him about it so I tossed them both out and left the store.

I don't like to argue with people, but I had paid for it!  It should be the way I wanted it!

Never going there again!
DD on 31st and 9th Avenue has always been good to me.  I'm only going there from today on!"
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2018-05-12,1.0,"One of the worst locations I've been to. I rarely come to DD for donuts, I usually stop by any DD location mostly for their terrible coffees if I'm in a rush. 

This location is just dirty and always had bums and crackheads hanging out here especially at night."
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2019-04-01,1.0,"I am NEVER returning to this Dunkin' every again. My friends and I came here on a Monday night after we were all craving ice cream. They closed at 11:30, yet when we arrived at 10:45 we were told to ""hurry up and order because we close in 10 minutes."" Secondly the hygiene was beneath par. The work associates did not have on any gloves, and coughed without covering their mouths."
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2016-04-17,1.0,"Rude workers, and dry doughnuts.

Being from Seattle, Dunkin is an exciting thing since they say it fuels the east coast. We came in on our way to the Staten Island Ferry. When we entered, we took a look at the doughnut options, chose, and walked up to the counter to order. The workers were middle aged Indian men who were totally rude to my wife and I. It seemed like they were in some sort of fight and as such had no patients left for paying customers. 

I got a Boston Creme and my wife got a cronut. Her cronut was painfully dry, as if a croissant had been left out for a week, cut, and dipped in icing. It was clear that the doughnuts were not made at the store, and probably not even made the same day we were there. 

An overall horrible experience. I prefer Krispy Kreme to Dunkin hands down."

Told the guy whoever works on cashier same thing and he let me use the restroom the. I found out there no toilet paper so I ask them if they can send me some toilet paper ,guess what , the guy with mustache was so mad about it and yell said something which I don't understand .......so I come out ask that mustache guy what did he said to me before what he mad for , also want to speak with there manager or boss ....they said there no manager or boss ....what a horrible place !!!"

854,dunkin-new-york-56,2015-11-28,1.0,"To this day no one has done anything about this! 

Poor customer service! I really needed to use the rest room and the manager told me the reason why we do not allow customers to use the rest room before they order is because customers do not order anything and leave after they use the rest room! As a manager of a cafe I would never allow my employees to say such a thing to a possible customer. I ordered my grilled cheese with bacon but I almost did not make it to the rest room. If your going to deny rest room access to people try to have a legitimate reason for it. I felt poorly treated and nothing was done to make up for it! I will visit back to see if this odd policy was taken care of! If not I will take a further step to make sure this does not happen to a person that will react as I would!"
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2017-08-22,1.0,This is the worst Dunkin' Donuts ever! Every time you come in there's the stank face black guy who looks like he hates his job and then there's the Indian staff who talk to each other and don't care about service! There could be 4 people behind the counter and you're the only person in line and you still wait for someone to say how can I help you! It's just a crappy environment and I swear this is the last time I come to this one...and I'm a loyal customer but enough is enough!

I was in there again today.  The ice cream was all mislabeled as it was a week ago.  I brought it to their attention again.  They really don't give a damn and have zero concept of customer service.  I regularly see people coming in here to beg and the staff does nothing to deter them.  Minimum wage is about all these folks deserve..."
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2015-12-05,1.0,This store treat you like a criminal. You have to pay before you can use the restroom. This is crazy. And the workers here are very unsanitary. Use caution please
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2016-09-07,1.0,"Worst customer service DD ever.  I will never go back. No one ahead of me, 2 workers looked right at me and didnt take my order.  I had to wait for a 3rd person.  Seems like no one wants to work at this place.  This is the last time I will go here.  There are plenty of DD all over the city.  I will walk farther and patronize the others."

854,dunkin-new-york-56,2011-07-22,1.0,"This is the worst Dunkin Donuts ... actually the worst place PERIOD!! The staff have no idea that they even sell coffee let alone donuts, how they are still in business is beyond me! I often have to tell them my order multiple times while they stare up at the menu as if I just ordered a steak or something else unusual! For example today I ordered a double expresso and received 2 coffees, and on another occasion ordered 1 order of hash browns and literally got 1 hash brown, not an order but just 1!!! I work across the street and sometimes I just want a nice iced coffee but the whole ordeal of trying to order something so simple is sometimes not worth the aggravation! 

Only go here if u desperate, have patients, are too lazy to walk to the next block to go to Starbucks, or in a mood to be amused by their antics! Otherwise RUN!!!!!!!!"
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2013-10-03,2.0,"This DD is also a Baskin Robbins and I redeemed my DD free medium drink coupon here for a medium pumpkin iced coffee (they didn't have the coolatta according to the rude dude who was mistreating his female colleague). I don't understand the iced coffee think, it's more like ice and a smidge of coffee here, with maybe 4oz of liquid, 3.9 of which was diluted coffee and .1 oz of an artificial pumpkin syrup blast at the bottom. I was disappointed at my experience having paid nothing so could imagine the frustration otherwise."
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2009-02-09,2.0,"This DD location is located right around the corner from the Clearview Chelsey Cinema where I frequent Rocky Horror. Normally when I have some time to kill this location is pretty good to hit up for my coffee fix. 

The unfortunate thing is how dirty this place normally is. I tried using the bathroom there once and never will again. The people are usually pretty rude too.

The only reason this location didn't get 1 starsis because they do have a Baskin Robins inside too, which helps kill 2 birds with one stone, and they do have good coffee."
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2014-09-01,1.0,"This is the worst Dunkin donuts I've been to as well. I don't normally leave reviews but the the owner or manager is on the phone speaking loudly or chatting with the staff loudly about her personal life. I've been in here a few times and I guess it's my bad luck that every time I come in she's here and so loud. It makes waiting on line painful to the ears and if you wanted to sit and eat here, you better bring good quality headphones to tune her out!"
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2010-07-07,1.0,"So my boyfriend who splits his time between NY and Nola was in town and really wanted to try Dunkin' Donuts near our house..tried a shake and 6 donuts Monday night, both of which were abysmally poor, but he had seen that Tuesdays had 2 for 1 milkshakes so wanted to come back the very next day (with full knowledge that we would NEVER order another awful, stale donut here again).

I grew up on Dunkin' Donuts every weekend, as the only breakfast I would eat as a child (aka only on weekends, with Dunkin Donuts around, was I actually enticed to eat breakfast), so it's somewhat tragic to me that the quality and selection of donuts here is so poor, but regardless, was willing to walk back in the record breaking heat with my boyfriend shortly prior to closing on Tuesday (he left the next day, so we figured what the hell, one more try, plus a deal = worth walking in 100 degree heat at nighttime).

We walk over with our dogs at about 11:15 (they close at 11:30), and they still have their signs outside about lattes, etc. so my boyfriend goes in while I wait outside with the dogs to get 2 milkshakes.

The middle eastern owners (I have nothing against middle easterners, however my boyfriend had adamantly claimed that this was part of the reason behind the stinginess in quality for the prior days poor donuts) refused to make a shake as it ""takes too long.""  Odd, given you shove some ice cream in a blender, it doesn't strike me as rocket science, nor a particularly laborious process.

He's quite annoyed, as they have no problem serving soft serve ice cream to the couple that comes into the establishment after him, and repeatedly asked them why they would not accept his money in payment for ""goods.""  Being a law school grad, I did find this terminology and situation mildly amusing, but completely understand his frustration.

After he comes outside, I say ok, well we walked all the F here in 100 degree weather and i've now been sweating profusely outside for 10 minutes, so I'll get the nasty caramel latte advertised on the sign sitting on the sidewalk next to me (outside the establishment).  He goes back in and they also refuse to make that.

He leaves screaming he will never return, how can they refuse to accept payment for goods, blah blah..but essentially yes, there are plenty of ghetto ass places in this particular intersection of Manhattan, but to say that 1) quality, 2) customer service and 3) cleanliness are all well beyond lacking at this establishment would be to put it mildly.

Due to the hard as rock donuts and nearly nonexistent selection in the first place is reason enough to steer clear.  Being dragged back for a deal that was in fact not even offered, and then being verbally abused by rude staff (if you could call them that) guarantees that we won't return, despite living in the neighborhood and being lifetime customers of the chain itself."
854,dunkin-new-york-56,2010-03-11,3.0,"You can't go wrong with a D&D coffee.  Love the iced coffee with coconut syrup and some milk!  My other favorites are the glazed donuts, flatbread egg whites sandwich and the bagels are not that bad either."
855,starbucks-new-york-530,2019-12-18,3.0,"This location has great hours but it has very high traffic. The high traffic makes it hard to keep clean. There isn't a moment at this Starbucks where you won't find an old cup stain on the table or napkin on the floor. 

But this place does have plenty of free samples. There is at least 1 crumb of everything somewhere in the store. Ok I'm doin too much but you get my point. 

Sit here
Enjoy your latte
The food and drinks still taste dope

The staff does a great job at getting you your drink in a timely fashion. There will be 15 ppl ahead of you and will still get your drink in 3-6 minutes. 

Come here, wipe down the counter, sit here and enjoy"
855,starbucks-new-york-530,2019-06-30,1.0,"I went back and fourth about posting this review, I've spoken to numerous people at Starbucks but I still feel offended, hurt and I don't want anyone else to have the experience I've had. 

I went into this location and ordered a standard drink. I stated my name for the order. 

The service I received afterwards was absolutely unprofessional. When my drink was ready the barista glanced at the name on the cup and started to laugh. When they handed me the drink I asked what the joke was. When I looked at the cup, I was embarrassed!

My name is Tatyana, my cup read Thotia. Now this would probably look like Starbucks penchant name misspelling. However, ""THOT"" has become a pretty mainstream offensive slur for women. If it was a simple error, the baristas wouldn't have laughed at my expense while preparing the drink. They would've called over the manager when I'd asked for one after viewing my cup. No one would've implied that I was interested in the barista while I was visibly upset. 

I have had a handful of conversations with folks from Starbucks and none of them has apologized or properly addressed the humiliation I felt in that moment. It really sucks to be treated horribly in an establishment whose company's recently shut for sensitivity training. It's apparent this training was NOT effective."
855,starbucks-new-york-530,2018-07-23,3.0,"Meh, it's a Starbucks in crappy Penn Station.

Make sure you have enough time to get your drink before your train arrives. The staff here is kinda slow.

Yet, it is roomy with plenty of seating. Yet, be prepared to deal with many people just hogging seats with no purchases as they wait for their trains. Also, there are no outlets here so don't even think about plugging in your phone or computer to charge up and be a wifi hog.

At least the option to have a Starbucks drink to bring on your train is there."
855,starbucks-new-york-530,2018-03-04,2.0,"Yelpers can never get enough Starbucks reviews so here goes mine. The good news: this is a bigger, roomier Starbucks compared the the older smaller Starbucks in Penn Station. The bad news: it's just as filthy as the old Starbucks. I ordered a Nitro coffee since there was a huge poster behind the cashier promoting Nitro coffee. When I went to pick it up I was told we don't make Nitro coffee, you are getting a cold brew, whether you like it or not. OK I added the ""whether you like it or not"" but that was kind of the attitude. The coffee was fine but not what I ordered."

I had already waited on a line and my train was here. I said to her that I just wanted ice cubes. She still refused. So I threw it out and told her I wouldn't be back."
855,starbucks-new-york-530,2018-11-27,1.0,"Don't go here, people work here are rude
Music was too loud and I had to go outside to take phone calls and when I did the staff told me to not leave my luggage unattended and I was only about 7 feet away at the entry to the Starbucks in Penn Station by the A C E lines. I've told the women can you please turn it down and she told me no when they can. That's rude when I ask for a green tea with no sweeter, no milk, no whip cream and she does ahead and adds the sweeter to mu drink and when I caught her on camera and told me she didn't not. So, I've asked her what was this then and she said on the to give it a sweet taste and I told her that is sweeter. This is why I wish I was back in Japanese because they add sweeter in everything here in the states. Sugar is bad period and is the most addictive issue in America

Why do these people don't listen? I don't know but they also later that night spill milk all over my luggage and I have it on IG and it has over 225 views so far. I've never received an apology. This is why i don't want to never go to a Starbucks in the state again or least my friend want to visit one but I am not purchasing a thing from Starbucks."
855,starbucks-new-york-530,2018-06-13,1.0,"This is the Starbucks next to the 1-2-3 line inside PennStation next to Wasabi. I really wanted to like this place because it's roomier and newer but it's a hot mess. There's one girl that works there that literally burst out at me and said UGH to my face when I was placing an order because i changed my order. I let that slide. 

The last few times I've placed a mobile order, they weren't even ready...i waited 20 minutes from the time of my order to get a coffee and had to request to make my mobile order because they lost it or gave it away or it's sitting somewhere waiting to be made because they have such a backlog. They are really disorganized and clearly being mismanaged because they can't handle the crowd.

This morning as a bunch of us were all waiting for our mobile orders (one guy grumbled he placed his order from Long Island and still didn't have it). An older gentleman asked for a free coupon because he had waited more than 10 minutes and the barista happily obliged. What about the rest of us who were waiting?! No apologies from any of the staff as we were all left waiting and no offer to provide free coupons for all of us who were waiting. I guess those that ask shall receive....that's a lousy approach to customer service.

What's worse is that I literally saw them give someone else's drink to another customer because she ordered an iced chai and they found a hot chai and the girl said I'll take it. Is that why my drinks were never ready by the time I arrived after placing my mobile order a good 10 minutes before i get to the store?! Do they just give people's drinks away?!!

I gave this place a shot but I'm done."
855,starbucks-new-york-530,2019-03-07,1.0,"They are slower than any other Starbucks I have been to in New York in a place where they need to be fast. I have also had my order wrong on three occasions. I wish there were other options. You need more then 10 minutes before your train comes

Staff team up and talk back to their customers instead of trying to accomdate their needs. I really wonder who trains them. Especially, because of the manager (Daisha), I would NEVER visit this location ever again. 

Side note: customers, please be careful when you pick up a mug in a box. It tends to come out of the box very easily. Staff members will not care if you get hurt but will make sure you pay for it."

When asked if more registers would open up, 1 employee actually rolled her eyes and commented to her colleague, ""gee, some crazy people""...

855,starbucks-new-york-530,2018-05-06,1.0,Bad planning of the store. Exit gives an impression of the entrance and if you are not familiar with the place then you would have to check which one of the lines is the order line. Lady who took my order did not write my name correctly even after i spelled my name to her. She was too concentrated on taking as many orders as possible than concentrating on what i saying. I like the other Starbucks place thats just couple feet away.
855,starbucks-new-york-530,2018-02-21,3.0,"I come to this Starbucks almost every day and some experiences are better than others. If I go during prime time, around 8:45am, the quality of my drink decreases. I usually get a Grande Iced Vanilla Chai Latte or a Grande Iced Passion Tango Tea. Both great Starbucks drinks if made correctly. When the employees are rushing, they sometimes add way too much milk to the Chai and I hate the taste. When I order hot drinks like the Vanilla Blonde Latte, sometimes it tastes just like hot milk. They need to tone it down with the milk. However, I must say that the employees try their best considering the large lines and impatient, grumpy customers. Either way I will still continue to come to this location out of convenience, but I am not always satisfied with the product. Overall, I give 3 stars."

I asked for a iced latte with sugar free caramel syrup and skim milk and they put way too much syrup in and it tasted gross to be honest. I asked if they could add some more coffee to lessen the taste of the sweetener, but that could not even salvage my $6 drink. The guy was not nice about it and went to his coworker and made a face and pointed at me..no joke. Then I asked for a new coffee because I literally paid $6 and wanted just black coffee and a little skim milk. He pours a half cup of whole milk... not what I asked for. Then I literally just asked to pour my own milk over black coffee and it still was gross. Threw it out after a few sips. Tremendous waste of money and horrible service. Do not go."

Compared to many other things at Brookfield Place and even within Le District, the pricing here is very affordable. I paid $3.50 for an iced latte that was strong, smooth, and well made.

Had to throw my drink out since I wasn't able to drink it and since they wouldn't correct it or refund me, they essentially stole my money, these people are negligent thieves!"
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2016-08-28,5.0,"Popped into Le district for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised by the coffee! The cold brew is good and strong and absolutely hits the spot. Service was quick and no nonsense which was nice- that means less time waiting in line! A medium will run you $3.50 plus tax and a large will run you $4 plus tax. As a newbie to the city, I think it is a little pricy but I've seen far worse!

There were some little sandwiches and pastries that were on display- I'll have to give those a try next time. Overall, delicious coffee and fast service. Will definitely be coming back!"
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2017-11-10,1.0,Good tasting chai but ordered a large and it was only filled halfway and the rest with foam. Easy one star as it's 37 degrees and I am delighted with a half-filled hot beverage that I paid full price for. Never again.
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2017-11-29,2.0,"This place is really erratic. The regular coffee and lattes are pretty good, rich dark and strong. Pumpkin spice coffee was a pleasant surprise too. But the gingerbread latte tasted sour and terrible. Pastries are average for the price. And the service, as other Yelpers have noted, can be downright rude. I've been here 5 times, and had horrible, inattentive and inaccurate service twice. So 3 out of 5 isn't bad for a jump shooter but not great for a coffee bar. I'd go here in a rush or inclement weather, but you can do better for coffee."
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2017-12-12,1.0,"I got a medium size bowl of soup from Le District and it was the worst soup I ever had. Way too salty ~~ so I went up to the cashier to tell him the soup is too salty and I can't have it, I'd like to switch for a different one, but cashier looked at me and said: "" but you almost had half of it"", then he ignored me and moved on to the next customer. I did not waste my time and it was not worth a fight over a bowl of soup, so I just trash the soup. I will never go back to this place again, period. Lesson learned. What really bothered me is not the fact that the food was bad, it was really the bad service and employee's attitude."
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2017-09-03,1.0,Horrible service !!! They couldn't care less about doing their job because they are too busy entertaining each other . I come to le district to shop and eat at their various restaurants within their space and I am usually happy but I will definitely go elsewhere in the building for coffee .
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2016-07-01,4.0,"Bold and strong, but well brewed, quality iced coffee (roughly $3.5 for a large).  Very fast service making it a prime grab-and-go type spot.  Easy to get to as well even during peak Le District hours (directly opposite the macaroon section of Le District).  

All in all, an excellent additional to Brookfield place."
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2017-09-16,1.0,"Very poor service - three people behind the register, two customers. One barista is making drinks and working the register, the other two employees are mindlessly chatting about hair color. Left."
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2018-05-07,2.0,"Great food but the employees are terrible! I just bought few small chocolate covered desserts and the lady just threw them into a paper bag instead of a box, so all the chocolate pretty much stuck to the bag and it was just a mess. If you are going to serve good and expensive food, just hire people who can at least pretend they can do their job. Are you not paying them?"
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2017-01-15,4.0,"We couldn't turn down the special of a coffee and three chouquettes for $5. Though it somehow ended up being $4.49 for a coffee and seven chouquettes! I had no idea what the little pastries were, but apparently they're a special French pastry. And delicious - not too sweet. I'm not a huge coffee connoisseur, but the coffee seemed fine as well. :) ."
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2018-01-04,5.0,My favorite tasting espresso hands down. Coffee is average but the espresso is TDF. I get an iced americano almost daily and it's always perfect. I almost never need to use milk because of the roundness in the flavor. The lines get long but still better than SB!
857,coffee-at-le-district-new-york,2016-11-15,5.0,"Excellent coffee and much more importantly, excellent service.  Unlike their coffee neighbors Joe and the Juice and Epicure Boulud, both in the nearby Oculus, they get you your coffee without a lot of extra steps.

860,mademoiselle-new-york-2,2019-12-18,5.0,"Mademoiselle has two counters at The Deco, one is a French Café to the left of the entrance with an assortment of baked good like croissants, cookies, and loafs. They also have coffee from Brooklyn roaster Parlor, and teas.

They get some of their items from suppliers but they also bake right there in the shop and the aroma of the croissants from the oven was driving me up the wall.  

On the right side of the entrance the other Mademoiselle counter sells the more of the lunch items like Salads, Tartines and Croquet Madame.

I was generous with my Stars because I was Mademoiselle first customer."
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2019-04-16,2.0,"Came here on a Saturday morning and it was crowded, slow and dirty.  There were three separate lines and I lucked out and got in one where the cashier wasn't debating something with a customer (that was happening in another line and everyone waiting there was not happy).

The place was a mess with paper everywhere and spilled coffee all over the place...just didn't have a tidy feel to it.  Coffee was okay.

The reason for only two stars is that they said they don't take the Dunkin app so I can't get points for my coffee.  The odd thing is that they have the same scanners I've seen at other Dunkins.

Would avoid in the future."
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2019-09-06,1.0,"Literally the worst Dunkin' around. Only good thing is that it's convenient but it's not worth it. They don't accept any reward member perks, and every time I've gotten coffee here, they ruin it with too much cream despite me asking for a specific amount like I do at other locations. Had to throw out my coffee it was so bad. They're also disorganized and rude. I'm a Dunkin person...but where's there a Starbucks nearby?"
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2019-08-30,1.0,"Location is too convenient, right by the 7th Ave entrance and NJ transit. Their food and coffee is the same as any other Dunkin. But do not go here if you are in a rush to catch your train! Even if there is no line, the service is dreadfully slow, and the staff is terrible. I came here on a Fri evening, and there was only one other customer who was already being helped by a cashier. Another woman comes from the back, so I stepped up to the 2nd register thinking she could take my order. Instead, she barely acknowledges me and rings up the other customer. So one lady is waiting for the customer to select 6 donuts while the other is waiting for said customer to finish her selections to pay. After 5 min of this, I walked out without ordering, and they were only on donut 3 of 6."
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2019-11-26,1.0,You can't order on the app or pay using the app. So dumb. I went over to Starbucks and they let you do all of the app things. I don't get why this DD won't get with the basic times.
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2019-11-11,1.0,"Horrible service. The cashier, a darker toned Indian man was incredibly rude for no reason. Don't come here!"
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2019-08-25,1.0,"This is right where the line up is for Amtrak trains so convenience has tricked me into buying coffee here 3x. Each time something is wrong- no flavor, lacking coffee taste, last time the amount of sugar could make the straw stand up. And they don't accept the Dunkin' app or credit your account. Waste of money. I won't be tricked again."
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2019-02-27,1.0,"I ordered a medium salted caramel hot chocolate and a sausage and and cheese on an everything bagel. The woman who checked me out hands me my cup and I notice the weight of the cup did not feel like it was full, so I open the cup and sure enough she handed me a 1/2 pull medium cup of salted caramel not chocolate. I mean I paid for a full cup so I asked her to put more in it please and she gave me an attitude as if I was wrong for asking her for more. I did pay for it! It's not like I'm getting it for free. Finally she fills it and hands it to me and I say thank you. I've never had this issue before but I was really annoyed by it."
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2017-03-19,3.0,"I haven't had donuts in a while since I'm paranoid about getting cavities so I can't comment about that. I don't drink coffee so I can't comment on that either. However, I love the sandwiches at Dunkin Donuts. Dunkin Donuts currently has a promotion where you can get two bacon, egg, and cheese croissants for $5. I'm addicted to the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant. I love the fluffy and buttery taste of the croissant as well as the delectable bacon, egg, and cheese. If I was just rating the sandwich then it would be a 5. 

Since Dunkin Donuts thinks that people only go there to buy donuts and coffee, they're usually unprepared when someone orders a sandwich. They have to make it from scratch and it takes quite a while. And obviously, during rush hour, the lines are long. This is definitely not to place to go if you're rushing to catch the train. 

Another pet peeve is that there's no seating. You basically have to meander around Penn Station looking for a place to sit. Sometimes you can sit in the LIRR waiting room without being harassed. Other times, they ask you for a ticket. There's plenty of seating at the NJ Transit waiting area, but lots of ""undesirables"" congregate there. 

Notwithstanding the two caveats, I'm going to come back here until they end the two for $5 promotion"
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2014-12-09,2.0,"Slow service in a crowded underground location. This DD is in Penn Station near one of the big staircases. While the coffee was good, it was a long wait to place the order and then to get the coffee. Disappointing."
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2015-01-25,3.0,"It's a Dunkys in an incredibly busy train station. Every time I went to them, they filled my order correctly and in a timely manner. If it is rush hour expect to wait a while just due to the sheer volume of customers. I can see how they might start to run out of some varieties of doughnuts as the morning/evening goes by, esp if their delivery gets caught in traffic.

They do seem to have prepared for the crush of people, I've never seen a Dunkys with numbered and roped purchasing lines before. They do take the DD card, someone had reviewed earlier that they didn't take the DD Perks. They accepted my card and I received points for the purchase, so it seems that they now participate.  All in all it is pretty much what you would expect. So no complaints from me."
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2017-08-29,5.0,"the staff here is amazing!
not only is this location always clean and fully stocked, but the people who work here are on top of their game! as their service is top notch... no matter what time of day or night.
i once in a delirious stupor left my ridiculous looking cell phone on their counter and the D&D team kept it safe till I got a very rude fedex driver to pick it up...they went to extra mile to coordinate the mailing/shipping of the device with me so it would all go smoothly (unlike the completely unhelpful fedex agents)...i cannot recommend this place enough...100000X STARS"
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2015-09-16,3.0,"5:07am - I ordered a small coffee, glazed donut, and hash browns.

The highlight of my meal was the ketchup packet, and that was Heinz. 

The donut was notably doughy, making a solid pastry item. Served room temperature.

Coffee was hot like hot water.

Hash browns crispy at the edges and soft at the faces. They came herbed and spiced, which is noteworthy.

Service was fast and efficient.

Go Dunkin! - 5:09am"
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2014-08-18,1.0,Seriously the worst Dunkin' Donuts I've been to. Line is ridiculously long and service is slow and confused. Took me 15 minutes total to get an iced tea. Everyone waiting at the counter was complaining about the system as well.
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2016-03-03,5.0,"I was inspired to write this review because of Melita who works at the Dunkin Donuts in Penn Station (closest one to Duane Reade).  The other Dunkin Donuts in penn station I have no complaints about but this particular one goes far and beyond with services to their customers. Melita not only is effecient in making sure I get my drink the way I want it, but she also produces a pleasurable atmosphere for her team. This is by preferred Dunkin Donuts thanks to Melita and her coworkers!!"
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2015-09-02,1.0,"A couple of the staff are actually quality people who do their jobs well which likely means they're not long for this shithole and that they will inevitably be replaced by the more standard DD employee who simply could not care less that their shop is in a train station and that most people are probably trying to catch a train.    Aside from the couple of standouts, there's just a general lack of work ethic here.   The shift leaders stand by watching the one employee at the register while the line of customers grows.   I wonder what it might take for the shift leader to open a second register and expedite the line.   I can tell you that it's not 8 people waiting.   

And they used to charge 27 cents for a large water and then boom now it's 75 cents.   What's that about?   Starbucks--and there are two nearby where I will start going instead of this dump--gives water away for free.    And Starbucks has a system that maximizes efficiencies and prioritizes customer experience.   No wonder Starbucks is a major company and dunkin donuts is a major loser."
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2018-08-08,1.0,"this was the second dunkin' donuts my sister & i tried because the first one had a really small selection of donuts. the location is terrible, but it's the best thing about it. our cashier was rude and short with us, and she straight up threw the change at my sister after we paid. they also got her drink order wrong. not even a difficult order either; she asked for a small lemonade and they gave her half tea and half lemonade. one staff member was understanding when she wanted a refund, which earns a single star. extremely underwhelming service for mediocre food."
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2016-02-17,1.0,"Ehh what a dump.  Poor service, incorrect coffee and stale food.  Not even in a rush stop here, hold your hunger for the trash can next to the stairwell outside."

The two men that are there are incredibly rude! One will continue to write or sweep or whatever he is doing even if your there for 10 mins! Most people are trying to catch a train!! Tonight there's a new girl to night shift, 'I can hear you' I guess that means 'may I help you' please retrain these bozos and get people who actually want to work!! Totally disgusted ! Wish the other DD in station was open nights."
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2014-08-08,1.0,If I could give zero stars I would. I counted 16 people behind the counter and it takes me 15 minutes to get a coffee and a bagel. Worst run Dunkin' I've experienced. The sentiment was felt with others in line as well.
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2015-01-10,1.0,All of the employees are rude and the lines are long. It is in Penn station so people are going to stop in but that is no excuse for their attitudes. The coffee was pretty good but definitely need better customer service.
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2008-09-25,1.0,"i ask for a bagel and veggie cream cheese, but to make sure, i asked them, ""do you have veggie cream cheese?"" she says ""yes"". i hear her call back the order.

en route to LI, i figured i didn't have time to eat, i'd eat on the train.... i get on the train only to find out that it was regular cream cheese. BAH! i HATE regular cream cheese!"
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2008-09-09,2.0,This is one of the worst Dunkin Donuts that I've ever been to.  The service here is so slow.  Half the times the line is so long that i don't even bother. But once or twice I've gone away just because I needed the caffeine fix.  The only other option in this area in Starbucks.  And sometimes I'm cheap and just don't want to spend 5 bucks for a cup of coffee.
861,dunkin-new-york-62,2009-05-18,1.0,"People who don't understand English (okay, I know it's hard to avoid that in NYC). Orders are consistently gotten wrong - come here if you want to have your coffee all the ways you DON'T like it.  Items sneakily omitted from their sandwiches.  Coffee that is weak and tastes like water from old rust pipes.  ""Mistakes"" in counting out your change.  Someone needs to clue these people in that not everyone coming out of Penn Station is a tourist they will never see again. I reccomend the following alternatives: go down to the Penn Station Amtrak level and try Krispy Kreme or either of two Zarro's; down to LIRR level for a whole slew of places, including two Starbucks; or up to 7th Avenue for another Dunkin Donuts and a few delis. Don't waste your money here."

My train leaves in 5 minutes and I need a giant cup of coffee so I can be alert enough for the next four hours back to Boston to bang out some work n my trusty laptop.

Enter the convenience, competence and efficiency of Primo Cappucino in Penn Station. Located a hop, skip and a jump away from the tracking board, I was able to monitor my train's track number announcement while getting an iced latte. 

With three  minutes to go, I was on my way to to the train, latte and bottle water in hand. A smile on my face, too. The counter gal was really friendly and made our order with the quickness. Large latte, large cappucino and a large bottle water: $14. I paid the price of convenience. I am okay with that!"

862,primo-cappucino-new-york,2015-04-28,3.0,"Fine by me.   Was only looking for cold water.  They had it for a reasonable price and an added bonus in Penn Station?    Somewhere to sit down.    Yeah, while everyone else is in that giant purgatory of people standing and looking up to see when the train arrives (don't those have GPS by now?!), somewhere to sit and friendly crew."
862,primo-cappucino-new-york,2016-03-01,5.0,"Fresh & delicious ready-made sandwiches and wraps, great freshly brewed coffee, sweet and gooey dessert bars, and super-friendly staff.

862,primo-cappucino-new-york,2008-09-23,1.0,"Oh, for shame!

I ask for a small cappuccino.  $4.50---good thing they take cards because I was not prepared!  Smallest beverage option starts at $4.50?  Of course everybody is running late so we all bite the bullet.

Beverage comes to me 30 seconds later, three times the size of a normal cappuccino which might make some customers happy (somehow thinking this is a bargain)...but its basically regular drip coffee with a thin layer of milk bubbles on top.  

Wheres the creamy foam?  Or even some crappy airy foam?  And what about that sexy balance, the proportion of shot to milk?  At least the flavor of the coffee was not bitter (needed no sugar).  

They have misrepresented a classic coffee creation and I am unforgiving."
862,primo-cappucino-new-york,2010-03-20,2.0,"This little place inside Penn Station has detiriorated somewhat in the last few years. I used to like stopping in while waiting for a train to enjoy a nice coffee and a baked goodie while reading the paper. It was a pretty cool place with a nice low key seating area in the back with armchairs and sidetables. I liked the kitschy pictures on the walls that were of people in the 1950's enjoying coffee.

That was then, this is now. I stopped by today to have a smoothie. The mango smoothie I got was pretty good. My problem with this place isn't the food, although it is disappointing they don't actually make anything there other than coffee drinks and smoothies. I think they used to.

They never have but one person working and they never seem to be busy. As I sat for a little bit today, I figured out why. It looks run down and worn. The cushy armchairs and old and ripped, the tables were dirty, and the carpet looked decades removed from a good cleaning. The place looks like the owner doesn't care about the appearance. To me that's sad and ridiculous, considering the amount of foot traffic in Penn Station.

There are plenty of places inside Penn to get coffee and baked goods. Hot & Crusty and Le Bon Pain are pretty good for that, but their seating areas are boring and tiny. Primo's used to be unique and inviting. It seems as if they simply gave up.

My suggestion, spruce the place up. Get some new furniture. Patch the holes in the walls, get some fresh paint. Keep the kitshy pictures, I love those. But remake it to feel like the ambiance of those pictures. Hire some part time people to make it look inviting. Having one person by themselves behind the counter but nobody cleaning the eating areas, is just stupid.

I bet they could increase their sales alot if they simply invested in a fresh look, some different and unique food items, and some cheer in the place. Until they do, I will miss the way it was when it was nice."
862,primo-cappucino-new-york,2015-09-09,1.0,"Great for a candy bar or a soft drink. Despite their name, Primo Cappuccino, they don't know how to make cappuccinos at all. I ordered one, assuming it would be better than say Dunkin Donuts; however, not only was it terrible, but it was also lukewarm at best! Again, great for a candy bar or soft drinks, unacceptable for just about anything else."
862,primo-cappucino-new-york,2010-01-16,3.0,Meh.  It's OK.  You can grab a cappucino here on the way to work from  Penn Station - but it's just OK and way too expensive.  There are better coffee spots nearby.  The deli next door has better food - that's for sure!
862,primo-cappucino-new-york,2010-07-27,4.0,Got to Penn station so early that Dunkin Donuts wasn't even open yet.  But this place was.  They have bagel w/ cream cheese & coffee for $2.95!  They also had great selection of pastries & fresh fruit.
864,7-eleven-new-york-39,2014-07-29,3.0,"Love the fact that I have a 7-Eleven across the street from my office. Very convenient, and a cheaper alternative to buy soda or water than the corner deli. Also great to grab beers for late night work sessions, or pick up a bag of chips when you need an afternoon pick-me-up.

One thing I find very odd is that they have a REALLY small selection of lottery tickets..like MAYBE 8 different ones to choose from. Not like they don't have room, but they're never stocked.  Strange!  Most other 7-Eleven stores I've been to seem to be bursting at the seams with a variety of tickets.

Also, the line here always seems to be long, and they are a bit slow."
864,7-eleven-new-york-39,2013-01-03,3.0,"Even though it's 30 degrees out it's always time for a Slurpee!

It's nice to have this 7-Eleven a few blocks away from where I work. Nothing like grabbing a good tasting hot cup of coffee in the afternoon and using one of the many flavored creamers they offer. Even better is getting an iced cold Fanta Grape Slurpee! I craved one after lunch today and it hit the spot! Brain Freeze!

As with many of the these 7-Elevens they are loaded with all kinds of snacks, pastries, refrigerated drinks, sandwiches, big bite hot dogs, and other gut busting goodies to grab on the run. Not sure if I would ever sacrifice my stomach for their hot foods though.

The store itself is bright, clean, and well organized. Plenty of products on the shelves including some toiletries and light housewares if needed.

Wishful thinking! It came to almost $2.00 overpriced in my book. And when I asked the clerk to 86 the order, he got upset. Which means they have an attitude problem here too. No clear prices, Overpricing, bad attitudes, means I'm NOT going to this location ever again!"

Every time I go there I have to say the same phrase ""extra large coffee light with milk and caramel flavoring"" about 5 times before the cashier finally realizes what I am saying.

 After they finally comprehend my order it takes another 10 minutes for the workers to successfully make the coffee and give it to me. 

This process has been repeated every weekday for the past 2 weeks. I've gone during other times of the day and the experience has been the same. 

This is the only coffee place on my block and the sh*t service has prompted me to buy my own coffee maker."

Some of These Yelp Review on Here Are totally Ridiculous. Let's be Real It's a Dunkin' Donuts And You're Just a Customer, Not a Professional Reviewer. If It's Good ill go back if its bad not a chance. Just Check Your Orders Before You Leave and you wont have a problem."
867,dunkin-donut-new-york-4,2015-08-13,4.0,"This Dunkin' Donuts is my go to DD as it's literally 2 stores from my work.  The staff, for the most part, is great! They always remember my order and usually have it ready before I even order.

Their food and drinks are standard as it is a franchise.  The space is pretty decent sized with bar-like seating against the wall.  There are also a few tables and with couches in the middle.
I wouldn't camp out in this Dunkin' Donuts to do work for a long period of time however, as there is no bathroom for the customers.

My only complaint and the reason I rated this 4 starts instead of 5 is that during rush hours they are a little slow and sometimes do get your order wrong."
867,dunkin-donut-new-york-4,2015-01-30,1.0,"Last month I would have given this store a 5 star review.

The staff is /fantastic/.  They go out of their way to get everything right and they obviously care about the customers very much. I just wish the owner cared about the employees.  

I asked where their ""tip cup"" was last month and they told me that the owner took it away because they did not have enough surveys submitted.  Are you kidding me? Surveys? Shouldn't he be thinking about pennies instead of surveys?

And today I found out that one of my favorite people, the manager, left due to absurd hours.

I think I might be finding a new cap place."

867,dunkin-donut-new-york-4,2014-10-22,3.0,"I was so excited when this Dunkin' Donuts opened because it is RIGHT across the street from my office.  This is a small location but it has a great seating area with comfortable sofa-like chairs.  When this store is crowded service tends to be pretty slow so I avoid going between 8:30-9AM when people are heading into work.  I'll typically wait until 10AM or later to grab a coffee.  I've experienced a few instances when my order was forgotten about so I definitely recommend holding onto your receipt when waiting for your coffee/tea or food.  I will say that the workers at this location are very friendly and pleasant and they apologize profusely when service is slow or an order is forgotten about.  For this reason, and for the close proximity to my job, I will continue to be a customer and I hope this Dunkin' Donuts sticks around!"

871,jakes-the-knick-new-york,2016-05-17,4.0,"First of all, I always appreciate courteous hotel doormen. The Knick has a great team. The hotel entrance is soothing, and Jake's immediately charmed me with its meringue shaped pastry domes. The quiche was light, with a rich and buttery crust. Remember this, I love butter. The iced coffee was strong and smooth. The design uniquely partners space and intimacy, amidst warm shades of gray. It was just what we needed to rest and recharge."
871,jakes-the-knick-new-york,2016-08-18,1.0,"Jake's lists cold brew as an option. I ordered a large and returned it after seeing the barista dispense hot coffee over ice, serving me a diluted cup of their regular drip when I just paid $5 for what's listed as cold brew.  The barista said that's how they make it and that she gave me more ice than usual because their cold brew was still hot. She kindly ended up refunding me."
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-12-21,4.0,"A cute cafe inside the mall.  The toasts are fantastic! You order at the counter and them food comes to your table.  It's a pretty small place,  but we were able to snag a table. 

We got the banana almond butter toast and grilled cheese toadtie. A little bit of sweet and savory.  It was delicious! Highly recommend.  Can't wait to go back and try more things.  I also appreciated there were calories listed and options were relatively healthy."
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2020-02-05,3.0,"We came all the way to this location of Bluestone not realizing it was inside the mall. WIth that said, if you are a local, there is a street-level location (with windows) literally 1 block away. Definitely recommend hitting that location instead.

The Good: The food and coffee here are good. You can't go wrong with the Avocado Toast (be sure to add a poached egg), the Breakfast Bowl, and the Green Skillet (although it is a bit small compared to all of their other dishes)... oh and their regular brewed coffee is tasty.

The Not-So-Good: It's crowded inside (with a ton of tourists visiting Hudson Yards). In fact, I had my laptop with me that day expecting to do some work.    Previously mentioned is the fact that this location has no windows (because it is inside a mall). That makes it feel a bit claustrophobic inside. And, lastly, the cafe has very few regular tables and only mostly bar-style seating. [i did see that the tables did have electric plugs, which would have been nice had it not been too crowded to work there for a bit.]

Also notable is the staff who were friendly and knowledgeable about Bluestone's offerings. However, since it was crowded on my visit, they were sometimes a bit slow."
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2020-01-01,2.0,"The two stars are more of a relative score than an absolute rating; relative to other bluestone lanes. A 2.5 might be more accurate, but no option, so alas...

I'm a big fan of the bluestone cafs. They're my go-to if i want a milky coffee. This particular bluestone, however, is always a bit of a sh*t show. The space itself is lovely and i like the double usage of the window shelf for both inside and outside seating. But the production line always has some sort of hiccup or bottleneck - i've always (today was my 5th visit) had to wait a slightly incongruous amount of time for the coffees to be made. Case in point, this afternoon was not particularly busy, there were about 4 other customers waiting to the side for their coffee orders and yet it took 12 minutes before my 3 coffees came out.

I ordered a flat white with 2% which is my standard order in this and most other aussie coffee places (wether genuine aussie or fake antipodean). The finished product was fairly anaemic although credit where credit's due the latte art was spot on - which is fairly indicative of a lot of NY food and beverage - style over substance. Not sure which barista pulled the shot(s) for this but either the espresso wasn't dialled in correctly or the ratio was off. 

Our group had 2 strollers to we found a spot to perch outside on the window ledge so as to be out of the way. There was lots of debris left from the previous customers which isn't a problem at all but the way in which it was cleared away and cleaned ended up resembling a shell game of 3 cups in order for us to avoid having out cups either taken away before we'd started to drink them or having them knocked over by the wiping. At one point the waitress picked up my coffee lid that i had momentarily removed to stir my coffee and moved it so she could move a napkin. Again, not a big deal and a lot of this sounds like nitpicking but it just made us feel like somehow us being there was an annoyance. Later on when coffees were being brought to two girls sitting inside and sharing the ledge rather than bring it to them from inside the waitress came outside and leaned over us to put the coffees down on the inside ledge. Didn't make any sense. If you want us to bugger off because we'd been sitting there for about 20 minutes, it's cool, just tell us we're adults :)

Notwithstanding all of the above, if the coffee was good i'd make it my regular spot when in hudson yards (which is most weekends at the mo). If the coffee is good enough a waiter/ress could probably slap me upside the head and it wouldn't put me off... but it wasn't."
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2020-02-25,4.0,Another spot I found for Avocado toast which happens to be my favorite choice. I stopped by the Hudson Yards and stop at this spot for some tea. I did not expect a menu but there it was. It was pretty good and my husband also enjoyed his cup of coffee. It wasn't crowded maybe due to the time of day. If you stop by to do some retail shopping you may want to give it a try
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-05-23,3.0,"3 stars for the friendly staff and chill atmosphere. I had never been to a Bluestone Lane cafe before, but the barista was quite patient as I fumbled my way through the menu. My friend and I ordered an Aussie iced latte (gotta try it, right?) and a flat white so I could fight my way through some afternoon jet lag on the way back from Europe.

I'm wondering what kind of beans they use because the coffee was pretty weak. I do recognize that both items that we ordered leaned heavily on the milky side, but you should definitely still be able to taste and smell the coffee in a brewed drink. The Aussie iced latte was a little icey - I'd much rather prefer the affogato at Blue Bottle (stronger brew and better quality ice cream). The flat white was meh - I've had better.

Weirdly enough the menu prices don't reflect the actual register charge (most are 50 cents under the true cost) so just double check your payment before you hand over your card. Alternative milks are extra, but if you want to add them yourself at the self-service counter, that's free."
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-06-16,4.0,"While going to visit the Vessel right outside this mall, I stopped by Bluestone Lane for a coffee/caffeine fix at around 1pm-ish on a Saturday. It was fairly empty at the time (however, this is not the case around 2-4pm). The store itself is fairly spacious and so simple, yet modern. There is seating at proper tables inside or by the stools outside or inside the large window area. It's a good place to eat/drink, sit & catch up with friends. 

AUSSIE ICED LATTE
My friend introduced me to their Aussie Iced Latte. I got it for the first time yesterday... and I'm sold! If you like black coffee or hot drinks, this might not be the one for you. But if you like your coffee light & sweet & cold for the summer (for any season, really) like me, then this is it! The small size is $5.25, but it's the size of a typical medium cup elsewhere. It was the perfect blend of iced coffee, milk & espresso with an addition of vanilla ice cream! 

I think I found my new favorite coffee...!"
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2020-02-12,2.0,"Terrible customer service. 
I came in to do work relax and have coffee. A associate approached me and said"" I've been here for too long and that it gets busy."" Basically that I need to leave. I could understand if the line was out the door but it was half empty with no one waiting. I thought she was very rude with her approach. And it made me uncomfortable and not wanting to come back. You shouldn't do that."
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-10-30,3.0,"Coffee was good. Temperature wise it was too hot! But it's better than being luke warm.

The Cashier added a tip to my transaction (potentially by accident) while I was paying. I was ordering a takeaway drink so was confused if this was her intention. Didn't seem to happen to the customers behind me. 

Anyway Good coffee place, far less crowded compared to blue bottle. Probably due to no one knowing how to find it. But happy there are options for coffee here. Interior and decor is nice which far more seating options. Even if you are by yourself."
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-09-04,2.0,"My friends and I were walking around Hudson Yards and decided to stop by for a drink. The decor of the cafe had a rustic feeling to it.

I ordered an iced chocolate drink. They made it with whole milk and chocolate syrup and sprinkled some cocoa powder on top of the drink. The drink was alright. I thought they would use real chocolate. It wasn't what I expected."
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-07-28,1.0,"Overpriced for what?! 

I stopped in here for breakfast while visiting Hudson Yards with my boyfriend and paid $33.00 for 2 mediocre avocado toasts and cappuccinos. The cashier who took my order and rang me up seemed to be miserable that she had to go into work that day. 

It is a very cute location but just peek in while walking by because stepping foot in there is a waste of time."
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-05-12,5.0,"First time trying bluestone lane, got the Aussie iced Latte...omg, so good. It's like affogato with ice cream in it except the coffee is not as strong but it's still good."

It's not huge but there is an area for dine in and then they have a to go line. I was able to get seated right away which was nice. My waitress/hostess was pleasant and I ordered the Winter Salad, as is. I will say I was hoping for the beets to be a little more pickled but they were still pretty good. There was A LOT of beets, pecans, and raisins. Few tomatoes in my salad and a decent amount of goat cheese and cucumbers. The poached egg on top was really good. Amazing flavor and cooked perfectly. The dressing was okay, didn't have as much of an apple cider kick as I would have liked so I ordered a side of balsamic vinaigrette. The balsamic vinaigrette is super creamy and really good! I got an iced tea as well, which was okay. Not the black one but the spring one maybe is the name? Kinda bland but I don't like to add sugar to my tea, so at least it wasn't sweet. Definitely would be back! I'm pretty sure they are CARD ONLY! Just a heads up!"

-1 star for oat milk add on that is listed as 0.75 but the register charges $1. 

+Two stars for a decent Capp but blue bottle would've fixed the payment issue immediately. 

For the same capp, blue bottle wins, esp since there's no add-on for oat."

Friendly staff and clean environment. The employee at the cashier had a lot of patience while my friend downloaded the app and linked his card for his order! Wait time is super efficient and before we knew it, we were sat down to start out mini break! Make sure you stop in here then go next door for a bit of sweets!"
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-12-10,1.0,"This location recently changed their setup. They are now full service or takeout only. Somewhere in the process of this change, their food has gone horribly downhill. Beware. 

Just picked up the saddest $23 the world has ever seen. The egg, supposed to be poached, was so well done the yolk was chalky. The portion is a joke. How in the hell do they get away with these prices? It also took them 20 minutes to throw this sad salad together.

The only reason I come here [sometimes] is out of desperation because I work in the building and the options are slim to none. Safe to say I will not be returning for anything other than coffee in the future. 

Get it together, Bluestone."

They take time to explain and answer all questions that you have. There is seating inside but not a ton.  A big fan of their cold brew and iced lattes. 

The only downside for the cold drinks is they have paper straws that do not taste very good and you feel like you're drinking out of a paper straw so bring your own straw and you're much happier!"

872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-05-24,3.0,"Australian coffee chain newly opened on the third floor of Hudson Yards. For $21 and change (card only) I got an almond milk cappuccino and a kale Caesar salad. The coffee was creamy but overly milky - could barely taste the coffee - and the salad (baby kale, grape tomatoes, shaved parm, egg poached in EVOO) was fresh and nicely done albeit small. 

To summarize, typical Australian cafe experience - good food and drinks, high prices, instagrammy aesthetic. Won't be a regular part of my routine but nice new addition to the neighborhood"
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-07-09,2.0,"I'm a huge fan of other Bluestone locations but this one just seems to miss the mark. I work in Hudson Yards and have been to this Bluestone location about ten times since it's opened. If you're just grabbing a cup of coffee or an espresso drink it's fine but otherwise this location really falls short. Every time I've order lunch here the wait times have been around half an hour (after ordering) which is definitely not on par with the other fast-casual spots within Hudson Yards. 

Above all I highly recommend that you don't waste your money buying an iced tea from this location. This morning I stopped by to grab an iced tea and banana bread before a big three hour meeting. I ordered a black iced tea and when I got my beverage it was essentially a $4 cup of iced water. It looked like they had steeped a tea bag in cold water for a minute, which did nothing in the ways of actually brewing the tea. When I asked my barista if this was the correct beverage/how that usually made their iced teas he told me he knew that it obviously wasn't how an iced tea should be made and when he had brought this up to the store's management they had told him to shut up about it. Luckily my barista was nice enough to give me and iced coffee as a replacement but I still can't believe that they're charging $4 for what's essentially a cup of water. (For the record - this is definitely not how I've seen iced teas made at other Bluestone locations.) To top off my most recent experience my cashier completely forgot about my banana bread immediately after I ordered it and I had to finally ask for it after 5 minutes of waiting. (It was prior to 9am and it was pretty empty since most of the rest of the mall hadn't opened yet)

It's a shame this location isn't on par with other Bluestone locations because it's such a beautiful spot in a great location within the mall. That being said I think today was the last chance I'll be giving this Bluestone Lane location."
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-03-22,5.0,"So delicious! We ordered the collective granola which has yogurt, fruit, granola and lemon curd. Absolutely fresh, healthy, and delicious on my goodness. And I ordered the Golden Latte which is a milky latte with tons of turmeric poured in. It tasted extremely wholesome and restorative and was not too sweet. Very nice experience and would definitely recommend for small parties as they don't have too many large tables!"
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-06-14,5.0,Still loving this place. I go almost every day and it still shocks me how consistently great this place is. Staff is beyond amazing and their food/drinks are equally good. Tons of Gluten Free options. Try the avacado toast. You will thank me!!
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-05-23,1.0,"Don't order any food unless you have time to waste. I waited over 20 minutes for an uncooked grain bowl with a single poached egg on top. It's also obvious that the egg, that was reportedly delaying my meal and only takes a few minutes to cook, would never have been made if I didn't go to the counter to ask about it. The place was not at all busy so there's no real excuse. I thought I could grab a quick bite here before a show but was sadly mistaken and had to rush through my meal. This was my first and last visit."

Their avotoasts are composed of freshly toasted, thick multigrain bread and the freshest avocados. They don't skimp out on the avocados either. I usually wouldn't spend money on avotoasts at restaurants or even other Bluestone cafes, but I'm never disappointed by my choice here. I hope the food quality remains the same, even as they attract more tourists and customers in the Hudson Yards area."

872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-07-18,4.0,"I'm fussy about my coffee and that always delivers here, but the service can be hit and miss. Some of the staff are really good - one is always smiley and helpful first thing in the morning, started recognizing me within a couple of visits and suggested I start using their loyalty app, and another had the initiative to detect my frustration and effectively let me jump the queue when a group in front of me were umming and ahhing about their breakfast order. Unfortunately others are kind of useless at this stuff, or still half asleep during the morning shift. 

There are also some inconsistent attitudes among staff about whether they can honor a HY employee discount - not sure the staff has received clear instructions about that.

Hopefully just teething issues!"
872,bluestone-lane-new-york-28,2019-06-07,4.0,So yummy:)) I got the breakthrough board and it was a solid 8/10-- a little too much avocado for my personal preference.

They're possibly the nicest people there as my 1st experience was with a female who wasnt friendly at all :/. The prices are a bit high especially for an avocado toast but my obsession with their Beet Latte keeps me coming back for more. They also provide a discount if you work in Hudson yards so that's a great incentive.  I work next door so I'll keep returning. Some of the employees dont make the items the same so that's something to be wary about as you must check before you leave."

The mall kiosks say the location opens at 7am so I went more out of my way to go to Bluestone Lane, passing Blue Bottle, Bouchon, Queensyard, etc. to get coffee and breakfast. When I get there at 8:23 there were two employees and I asked if they were open and he said yes. As I proceeded to pick up items to buy, the lady that was working started arguing that the store wasn't opened. When informed her that the kiosks said they were, she snapped back saying the hours changed. She was very unpleasant and rude, and kept saying ""this store is closed."" I asked when they opened and she said 8:30am... I was there at 8:23 am. So I left the items I was going to purchase and went to Blue Bottle instead. With so much competition in coffee shops in Hudson Yards, it might be best not to overlook customer service."

My boyfriend and I went to this place for the second time tonight.  The first time we went, the service was just mediocre, as were the drinks, and the experience was fine but probably not good enough for the neighborhood.  Tonight though, the attitude of the staff really put a bad end to our nice night.  

It took forever to order even though I was the only person standing in there because the staff were talking amongst themselves.  Then they completely forgot my drink in the blender, made no eye contact, and made no real attempt to apologize after asking about about my drink that was just sitting in there.  I hate that feeling of being held hostage after I have already paid.  I will never go back there again."

874,dunkin-new-york-133,2017-09-26,3.0,"I mean, yeah, this place is a mad house. But I would expect nothing less from a location that consistently has hundreds of people pouring in.

For such massive amounts of customers this location always has, the service is shockingly really quick. I never wait more than 5 minutes for food and coffee. And you can get one of their five or six deals that has a bagel/muffin/2 donuts/etc with hashbrowns and a coffee for literally $5. A steal. And their ""medium"" coffee is basically the size of a large at most places so that's a win. Also, the pumpkin munchkins are delicious, as are their hashbrowns. 

Sure, the employees are less than enthusiastic about being there most of the time and it might not be *the* cleanest DD out there, but I get my order quickly and am out in a heartbeat. I'll take that any day, especially when I'm running to catch a train."

Anyone who plans to stop at this Dunkin Donuts, don't go there.

On the bright side, the food was superb and reasonably priced.

I love Dunkin donuts and was so excited when I found one right on my way to work...the first time I went here my coffee was beyond terrible. The coffee tasted old and there was not even a small hint of pumpkin. Old burnt coffee and cream...yuck.

The second time I ordered a small iced pumpkin coffee...3.04$? Is that a joke? Okay...so then I waited about 5 minutes only for a confused guy who could barely speak English to ask me what I got. A pumpkin iced coffee, cream and liquid sugar. 

Him- vanilla?
Me- no I want pumpkin
Him- no pumpkin. You get vanilla
Me- no. Do you have caramel?
Him- we have French vanilla coffee! Asbshakansbshsb
Me- I don't know what the f*ck you are saying and I am late for work, just get me a coffee with cream and liquid sugar!!
Him- iced coffee?
Me- Jesus Christ are you serious?

So when I finally got my coffee, it had no flavor and tons of regular sugar clumped in the bottom.

1. Learn English 
2. Learn to make coffee, this has been multiple times
3. All the pastries and bagels look nasty and old. I've had this problem with a DD in Harlem, by the looks of the staff I am guessing it has the same management.
4. Your prices are outrageous. Are you kidding me?

This place needs to be shut down. Or burnt down. Whichever works."
874,dunkin-new-york-133,2018-09-10,3.0,"This Dunkin Donuts is fast and efficient. I always order a Medium Iced Caramel Latte with Almond Milk. I appreciate that it always comes out the same way and tastes the same. Consistency is key when it comes to coffee spots. I love Dunkin Donuts because it is much more affordable than Starbucks and it has more reasonably sized portions. You really get your bang for your buck here. I now understand why America runs on Dunkin, because I definitely run on Dunkin ‍ I also enjoy their Donuts and Bacon, Egg and Cheese Wake Up Wraps. It isn't always fresh, but it is edible if you are really hungry. The only issue I have with this particular Dunkin Donuts location is that it is in Penn Station, which any food place in Penn Station automatically grosses me out, but I do my best to overlook that. I will continue to come to this Dunkin Donuts out of convenience, even though I am aware there are better locations in the world. Overall, I give 3 stars."

I love dunkin donuts coffee, way more than Starbucks and just a smidgen more than Timmy Hortons.  So they open up this DD in Penn Station, and I'm thinking ""self, this is great, you can mix it up in the coffee department in the morning, hooray!""

My first experience here is most likely going to be my last.  I'm on line with some friends waiting to hop on NJT (don't ask) and the computers go down.

Hey, I get that, sometimes there are technical difficulties that aren't in the control of the people working there.  You would think, since there are a few other Dunkin donuts in the terminal, that the employees would direct traffic to another place - or figure out a work around while trying to fix the machines.

Negative.  The line is exponentially growing.  I'm next.  My order is simple: Two Medium Iced Coffees, skim and sugar, and whatever weird vitamin water my friend dropped on the counter in front of me.

1. The girl legit looked right past us and yelled ""is anyone ordering hot or cold coffee?""  I'm confused, is there other coffee they may be ordering?  Am I not standing directly in front of you, waiting to get coffee?  Wait, yes I am.  Some fella 4 people deep yells ""I am!"", walks up, places his order.  Now, the locals are getting restless.

2.  I attempt to regain control and say ""May I order?"" and she goes ""didn't you already do that?"" and walked away.

alright, lady, we're about to have a problem, cause I'm getting pissy

3. She finally takes my order and tries to ring it up.  Now, remember, the machines are KIND of working, so she rings things up and it comes to $3.85 for my friend.  I hand her a $5.  She looks at me confused, and turns to the person next to her and says ""do you have a calculator"".  At this point, I'm completely incapable of concealing my disgust and comment that had I known I was going to be here for a half an hour, I would have gone to a more capable coffee stand.

I really wanted to like you, DD, you should have a test before hiring people.  Like, a simple mathematical test."

In the Dunkin Donuts in suburbia, there usually are only 2-3 people running it at a time.  Usually, no problems.  Here, there were maybe 5 or 6 people and they still couldn't get anything right.  My friend ordered a breakfast sandwich which they gave to someone else, and a coffee that they gave her the wrong size of.  I ordered a bagel not toasted, not buttered (as we both had a train to catch) and they both toasted and buttered it.  Further, everyone else on line seemed to also be having similar issues with their orders.  

Before taking our orders, the cashiers were having personal conversations which is not necessarily a big deal, unless your store happens to be in the middle of a train station and your customers are trying to make a train.  OH WAIT, they are.

Again, only reviewing this because I hope that the franchisee who opened this one can see how horrible his/her staff is."

Small menu but has all the options you're looking for without the extra frills of flavored syrups, etc. Their drinks have two options - medium or large, large being 16 oz. Their oat milk latte is delicious - great balance of espresso and milk where it doesn't just taste like a cup of milk. 

Best thing was the SERVICE. The barista was super kind/friendly and when I asked for less ice in my drink, she even asked if there was enough ice for me.

It's just too expensive. $5 for breakfast and its not even filling. The coffee was not even that good. Tasted off... I asked for less ice, my cup was half full of ice. So what's regular ice? The whole cup? There's more ice than actual coffee then. Even more of a rip.

I told him you don't close till 11pm.  He stated he's not making my order cause he just cleaned up.  So then I asked for my money back and he couldn't do that either.  I asked for the manager and he said he's the only employee there and can't open the register.  
So I asked him that I truly have to leave without my food and money?  He just shrugged.  
I don't boast this but I work EMS and it was a very busy evening.  All I wanted was to eat a little

Update:   I called the store directly and the manager (tashea....forgive me if i misspelled her name) knew who I was and was very apologetic.

It gets overwhelming because I lost count on how many Starbucks locations that I been to, that either they forgot to add it or just hoped I wouldn't notice. 

Whether I order it through the mobile app or in person, I always have to take the coffee back and have them add it because let's be serious! Starbucks coffee is not cheap! 

So I want my moneys worth on every penny!

So now that I discovered how good their latte and pistachio cakes are and this location is clean and friendly and obviously new, I see myself being a regular. So far I've been here twice in like a week and a half. Next time(s) will try their tiramisu and bagel sandwiches. Because their bagels are what really they're supposed to be known for.

I recommend using the mobile app to quickly pick up and go without waiting in line. 

This Dunkin shop generally has deals like 12 donuts for 6.99 so ask and maybe they might have a promotion going on. 

Seating space inside is a bit limited and you might have to find another spot if you have more then 3/4 people and you plan on eating inside. 

Baskin flavors are awesome and the ice cream has been fresh during the 4-5 times I've eaten there."

It was free and I was in the neighborhood so I figured why not? The cone was glued to the paper and was practically a rock. This is the hardest cone I ever had to bite through. As for the ice cream, I can't say much about it because I know all flavors have the common vanilla base so it predominates.

888,dunkin-donuts-baskin-robbins-new-york-17,2013-07-21,3.0,"Since this chain just celebrated the opening of their 500th location in NYC, you'd think each location would step up their game.

The challenge with a combo donut/ice cream shop is that Baskin Robbins can't offer all 31 flavors all the time.  So if your favorite isn't everyone else's, you may be out of luck.

On Tuesdays, it's buy one sundae, get one free.  My wife doesn't want a sundae, just a cone, so you'd think that would be a win-win for the business owner.

The first time we visited this location, they didn't have my wife's flavor (Pistachio Almond).  I'm a lot less choosy and can always find a new favorite.  I told the counterperson my proposal - one sundae and one cone - with the cone being free and they were very accommodating.

The sundae I chose was a two-scoop and this person was VERY generous with the ice cream.  Like too much ice cream (if that's possible.)  They were also generous with my wife's cone.  All in all, a great experience.

Our second and third visits were terrible, though.  Both times, the manager helped us.  The first time I explained that I wanted to take advantage of the special but just one sundae and one cone, with the cone being free.  He didn't want to do it.  I had to explain the cone is less than what a sundae would be.  He said, ""Ok, but you get kiddie scoops instead of regular scoops.""  

I had to ask him to show me both scoops and then told him I wanted the regular scoops and he did it.  Do I really have to work this hard to be served?  I felt he had a bit of an attitude but didn't care.

The next week we visited the newest BR/DD on 42nd between 8th and 9th.  They were terrific (separate review to follow.)

The following week, I went into this store again (482 9th) and saw they were carrying my wife's favorite.  So we both went in.  Same manager served us.  My wife asked him to put on gloves as she was getting a cone.  He refused.  He said, ""The cone has paper on it, you're fine.""  She asked him again.  He said no.  She asked him again and he complied.

Needless to say, we like our ice cream served without a side of confrontation, so no matter what flavors other stores have, we'll take our business to a different location than this one."

So when I walked in to pick up my order, it was PACKED! It's a pretty small Starbucks and the door had to be kept opened cause it was super crowded.To my surprise, my name was being called and I was like, oh wow that was fast. Also, there were TONS of drinks waiting to be picked up. So I'm wondering if people know to just go up and ask for their order?? I can't imagine that they wouldn't know lol.

This has been the most organized Starbucks I've ever been to. They actually have a little station where they label each section from A to Z. Also when picking up breakfast, DID YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SRIRACHA PACKETS?! UM, game changer! Just ask and see if they have it!

I've mobile ordered at this Starbucks maaaaany times and I have to say, the wait time is always around 5 mins or less! I order right when I get off the train and by the time I get there, it's just about ready. 

Anyways, I really want to give props to their morning crew tho, forreal. The two people who are handling the mobile orders have always been nice to me and are usually smiling. I've worked in the food industry and when you have a rush for a couple hours, IT IS NOT EASY! Everyone is doing their best in pumping out orders and you can clearly see that everyone is doing something! Being in NY where everyone is always in a rush, people only think about themselves. I've just learned to appreciate the hard work because I know what it's like to be on the service end. 

Also, they have been the most consistent Starbucks I've been to because the one on 43rd & Broadway (which is literally right downstairs from work) is just SO inconsistent! Specifically talking about their pumpkin cream cold brew which I had ordered there like 10+ times. I didn't even know it was topped off with cinnamon until I came to this location (43rd & 6th Ave). Even though it's a little farther than the one downstairs, it's worth the trip haha."
893,starbucks-new-york-546,2019-09-28,2.0,"This review is more about the service and organization than the actual coffee.  The coffee is typical Starbucks coffee.

I go here a few times a week since it's the closest coffee place to where I work.  I go around peak coffee time I'm assuming (between 8:30 and 9:15 am) and the line is usually long, but moves quickly.  The problem comes when after you put in an order and are waiting.  It's very unorganized as you have a herd of people hovered around the pick-up spots.  The workers there also sometimes neglect to repeat the names on the orders, meaning your drink just ends up waiting there.  I also think they can make it more efficient when it comes to making the drinks.  There's no reason why it needs to take over 5 minutes to get a black iced coffee.  Dunkin Donuts at the same time of the day can get me an iced coffee in under 1 minute when it's just as crowded.

They need to have the people who make the plain hot coffees also make the plain iced coffees.  There's no reason that the iced coffee has to be made by the baristas who make all the other crazy drinks.

I also had an order made incorrectly once where they put regular milk instead of almond milk in my drink.  Not a fun thing to discover when you're lactose intolerant.  That being said, they did replace my drink.

Unless you work extremely close to this Starbucks, I'd recommend going to a different one (perhaps a bigger one as this one is on the smaller side) so it's not organized as well as it could be."

Maybe it's because my order is always correct, or that the baristas are always quick and accurate. Maybe it's because for NY standards, it's a large and clean area. Or that the layout is structured in a methodical way with space for waiting customers that aren't stepping on each other's feet. All I know is that this a wonderfully hidden Starbucks. It is far better than the other 3 Starbucks that are all within a block of this one. 

This Starbucks (corner of 6th and W 43rd) doesn't show up on google maps, and from the street it's marked discreetly, which may be why it's a little known gem with no reviews yet. I will keep going here without hesitation."

They started out so well, luring me in with their blueberry scones and motor diesel java. Then. . . . 

The cups began to leak.

So what, right?  A little cup leakage never killed anyone. ""I'll survive."" I thought. Then. . .

The prices went up from already extravagant askings. So what, right? It's not like I'm disgusted by my ATM receipt on a daily basis - eh hem.

Then. . .

They hired workers that consistently could not make a normal cup of coffee. It's coffee people!  Brew. Pour. Ring - repeat.

The final straw was the prices going up again. It's a shame, really.

If you ever go, say hello to Cassie - she's the one redeeming quality of this fall from grace."

Her math skills are so poor that her manager had to help her make change. A customer asked for napkins and she wouldn't hand them to him - she made him walk in front of the person she was ringing upto pull them from right in front of her. She doesn't acknowledge what you say - she rolls her eyes and slow rolls her way around the store. 

The coffee is not bad, but the pastries look like they're stale (it was 2 pm when I went) and the prices for non-coffee items are ridiculous. The seating is awkward and dirty, and what's with the paid internet stalls that nobody uses? 

I can't wait for the Starbucks to open two shops down."

Right now I'm sipping a terribly diluted ice coffee from Casa Java that tastes more like vaguely bitter murky water than coffee. Not that I have high hopes or iced coffee anywhere anyway. Their hot coffee is about the same as their iced version. When passing through Port Authority and you need a caffine fix, just suck it up and go without because Casa ""Java"" isn't worth it."

The woman who took my order wasn't friendly at all. 

I can't believe this drink is so bad. I had a feeling the drink was going to be terrible I should have tried it in store. You can visibly see there is little to no coffee in here. I am DISGUSTED.


Just stopped by Dunkin and girl at the register just caught a nasty attitude with me. My drink was already being made, I PAID and she was getting my donut.

The server was nice.  

The SMALL area where you fix your coffee was a bit dirty and only a few ""real"" sugar packets were left.

I'm not an iced coffee drinker but, I came inside anyway. The cashier was polite. They did have a leak in the ceiling and it was dripping in the middle of the shop. They appeared to be cleaning it up. 

 I ordered the seasonal Dulce de leche latte with oat milk. I was shocked that the oat milk/ coconut milk was an additional $1.00. Which is more than what Starbucks cost for non-dairy milk. Unfortunately, the latte was subpar in taste. I could only taste the oat milk. Dulce de leche has a distinct taste and flavor. I did not receive any of that taste in this latte. I truly feel like I wasted $6.  

They do serve breakfast foods and pastries. I am not sure if there doughnuts are from Dough but, they do look alike.

He took a moment looking at the coins before putting them away and giving me back $2. I asked for a receipt. Again the staff hesitated. I asked a second time before the staff reluctantly gave me the receipt. I looked at the receipt as I walked towards the door and saw that the total was $8.13, and that the staff entered that I gave him $10.13 to generate the $2 change. I looked at him but was completely ignored by him. I wasn't about to confront him over 17 cents but COME ON, he totally knew what he was doing. 17 cents is not a big deal, but I don't like it when a store takes advantage of their customers as part of their business practice.

I'm taking off one star because they didn't have any forks. Come on! I'm eating a salad. 

I highly recommend the Quinoa  Salad. With tax it's $10.07 and comes with a Sourdough Roll. I didn't care for the Roll at all. Doughy with a tough crust.

I brought an out of town guest to see the Salinger exhibit and thought it would be nice to have coffee and a pastry before queuing up. Showed up around 3:45, perfect coffee hour and was told there was no coffee left, just tea. The only pastries were one black and white cookie and some kind of twisty thing with sesame seeds. Asked the counter person how long before fresh coffee would be available and he responded with an extremely impatient tone that the wait was 40 minutes. As if I was inconveniencing him by inquiring! Settled for tea and the last cookie. Tables were filthy. Service abominable. How do you call yourself a cafe and not have coffee and pastries during the holiday season and hold a concession in a landmark attraction in NYC with a hugely popular exhibition on view? Amateurish and sloppy. Fail. Sorry Amy's, used to frequent your spot on 9th but the quality has really gone down there as well. Bought some croissants a few months ago and they were mushy like boxed, not flaky. Get it together or please get out of the NYPL and let someone who cares have the concession.

He repeated her order back to her and literally confirmed a plain bagel. Then we waited and waited and waited, the lady who ordered before us started to get angry and asked where her order was. The guy told her that he was sorry he charged her for croissants when they actually didn't have any, if she could just have her bacon egg and cheese on a plain bagel instead. The lady lost her temper, and said she needed to leave so to just give her the order on a plain bagel so she could get out of there. We were still waiting for our plain bagel for about 10 minutes at this point too, but I didn't wanted to get involved, I thought ""let him take care of her she's angry and then we'll get our bagel so we can leave too."" The lady before us got her order on a plain bagel and she stormed off. Then he hands us a closed bag and says here's your order, so we leave with it. A block away my daughter opens it to find an everything bagel. So we think ""okay this is just a mistake let's go back and get your plain bagel."" When we get there he says that he had to give the last plain bagel to the angry lady, so we need to just take the everything bagel. This is where I now started to get angry. I said no that's not right because we ordered something, he confirmed it and then we waited so long to just get something else. He said the lady ordered before you so she gets the plain bagel. Which is so illogical because she never ordered a plain bagel to begin with, she wanted her order on a croissant, he messed up and should have owned up to it, not given away the bagel we payed for. This is absurd, he wasted so much of our time. He said that he couldn't refund us without the receipt, then made us fish through the trash to find our receipt to prove that we had in fact order a plain bagel to get refunded. While we were literally looking through garbage he accused my daughter of lying about her order on top of that, saying she said she wanted an everything bagel, which is ridiculous because she would never eat an everything bagel. I just wanted my money back so I literally looked through the trash to find my receipt, which I did and he refunded me $2.69 and had this attitude of ""there, now get out."" 

I would have left it at that, but now I am going to make sure that his superior hear of this. He wasted so much of our time and making me look through the trash was disgusting on his part."

While going up to the second floor, on the landing between the first and second floor, there is a cafe! So cool to see a coffee bar inside UO. I was in the mood for a cup of coffee, and ordered a small soy latte. The guy behind the counter was really nice and helpful. He told me that this is a new coffee bar and it has been at this location for about a month. He also stated that UO is trying to move in the direction of having a store, gallery and coffee shop all rolled into one. Seems like a lot of businesses moving in this direction these days. One stop shop for everything! 

They source their coffee from Kickapoo Coffee Roasters based out of Wisconsin. They also have some pastries on hand from Balthazar Bakery. The coffee was well-made, no burnt taste. I am getting better now and identifying good coffee, I guess it just takes practise. 

My only gripe about this coffee bar is that there is no seating. So you just get your coffee and wander around the store. You could always sit under the stairs in the store, but it just isn't the same. 

Right now, this is the only coffee bar open inside UO, but they are planning to open more coffee bars inside other UOs in the city. Keep your eyes peeled."
914,jacks-stir-brew-coffee-new-york-16,2019-03-17,4.0,"We were wandering around Hudson Yards shops before climbing the Vessel.  It was a cold windy day, and I needed to perk up.  I was thinking, ""A hot chocolate, coffee, or espresso would be nice right about now.""

We walked by several places where I could have had a typical coffee or latte, but I passed.  Then, we came across Jack's Stir Brew Coffee with a large sign, ""Jack's Barista's Choice: Mayan Mocha,"" which was described as a classic latte infused with cocoa, nutmeg, and cayenne!  Reading the sign alone perked me up, and I asked the representative to tell me more.  She told me that the default is to make it with oat milk.  I wanted to try it exactly how it is normally served.  My curiosity was peaked; it sounded like exactly what I needed.

The barista, who seemed to take real care to make each drink, made my Mayan Mocha look beautiful, and it hit the right spot for a cold day.  It was as you might expect:  a cross between a frothy latte and light hot chocolate (not the very thick rich kind) with the cayenne leaving a mild burn in the back of the throat.  It was mildly sweet.  Two problems:  1) The 10 oz serving was gone in less than 5 minutes because it was so wonderful, and went down too easily as it was light/frothy and not very hot; and 2) It was pricy at ~$9 (including tax and small tip).  Thankfully, we don't live near one of the Jack's Stir Brew Coffee locations since I would be frequently tempted and my bank account could suffer.

Well done drinks, nicely presented, friendly and efficient staff."

A large Mountie - a maple cinnamon mocha - had little of either flavor and wasn't worth the $7 price tag. Should have stuck to a simple americano.

Boo hoo. There's a Blue Bottle outlet here at the Hudson Yards shops which I didn't visit, but since I'm from the Bay Area where it's based, I can vouch for how dependable it is. Should have gone there instead of trying someplace new."

I was at the grand opening of Hudson Yards and was familiar with Jack's as they have 10 locations in New York City and Eastern Long Island. This is a great space and I was drawn in by everything it has to offer. Besides the outstanding customer service and attention to detail the coffee, tea and vegan baked goods are PHENOMENAL!! Any location I've been to is clean and has a friendly staff so they are consistent. 

Jack's offers high quality organic, shade grown coffee and you can purchase the coffee beans by the pound to take home and continue to enjoy the experience. Jack himself was on hand to meet and greet the customers and you can see his passion for the business. The owner really cares and looks like he will  do what it takes to support his employees and customers. It's great to support a locally owned business and not an 800 pound Gorilla in the business like Starbuck's. 

Their prices are very fair and more importantly they offer a very healthy alternative with vegan products.You can even get oatmeal and all kinds of delicious add ons like bananas and honey.  You can taste the quality and freshness of everything they have. I would highly recommend you try any of their locations if you can't make Hudson Yards. They have near by locations in Chelsea, the Seaport, the Upper East Side and lower Manhattan like the West Village and Meatpacking district."

Liked the donut so came back here just two days later (Friday at 7:10pm).  There were two female employees just chit chatting so I asked if they still had the 50% baked goods after 7p.  She said ""not at this location"" with an attitude and then resumed her conversation with a friend or coworker.  Service: 0 stars.  Will not be back until they improve their staff and attitude.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 4-stars
Tried their apple cider donut - very good.  Prices on baked goods chopped 50% after 7p - so $2 for the donut was worth it.  Don't think I'd drop the normal price of $4.15 for it"

Not sure why they would that here. Its rarely busy enough in this location to treat returning customers like this. 

I was skipped by this lady wearing a KISS t-shirt. Not even in uniform. I looked at the man she was helping, then just was going to wait because I'm not a rude racist person like Jack's employs. Then another lady came to ask if I had been helped so at least we know not everyone here is racist.

I'm surprised that you guys would let an employee wear a rock concert t shirt and work your cash registers, let alone hire a racist person that blatantly skips someone at the front of the line like they are below them and they can't take their order.

Edit: I want to also say the barista making my drinks apologized for her coworkers racist actions. She said it was wrong and sorry. Very nice of her. But the girl with the KISS t-shrit...you are a terrible human being."

941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-04-26,5.0,"I've always loved The Jeffrey for craft beers and bar snacks. Tonight I was hoping to order burgers and the French onion Mac n cheese. Mac n cheese was sadly not listed on Seamless or Grubhub. We called and they added it to their online menu for availability. They later called us to apologize for a delay because they needed to get ingredients from the store to make to fresh. When our food was delivered (25 minutes earlier than estimated!) the Jeffrey staff member hand delivered our order, again apologizing for the delay. This customer service during COVID times (not to mention in the pouring rain) was outstanding. Glad to support a local UES business and look forward to being back soon! Thank you to the staff at the Jeffrey!"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-05-13,5.0,"I had my birthday party here with about ~30-40 people on the back patio back in September. The whole day was so easy and chill, exactly how I wanted it to be. People came and went, everyone had their own tab, the server was amazing. Highly recommend this place for a relaxed, outdoor space to hang during the day for a drink. Huge beer selection, food was super yummy, and the staff was seriously amazing. Such an unforgettable day!

My guess is there is an NYC regulation about this, but the only thing missing is music outside :)"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-03-14,4.0,"Neighborhood bar with a huge selection of beers on draft, delicious food, and a bottomless brunch. 

There are two entrances, both with bars, and their is table seating in a main dining room as well, however all of the seating is on high-too stools. It looks like they are in the process of creating a patio in the back as well. 

I came with lunch with my dad and I got a cheddar pretzel and a roast beef sandwich with chips. It was all very delicious

941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-02-12,3.0,"As the name suggests, their selection of craft beers is excellent. And many are local. Win-win. Came in to enjoy a draft after work with a couple of old friends. The place was packed but we managed to grab three seats at the bar. The restaurant is U-shaped so if you don't see anything right away, keep walking toward the back and you might get lucky. 

The prices for pours are comparable to others in the area. The service at the bar can be slow because it is quite a long distance from end to end for the bartenders to travel. 

We had some snacks, as well. The highlight was the French onion Mac and cheese they had on special that day. It was served in a ~very~ shallow skillet, and topped with thick slices of baguette. There was more bread than Mac, but the flavors were delicious. We also enjoyed the rosemary seasoned potato chips and the pickle jar. Don't make our mistake in assuming we would be getting a jar of pickled cucumbers, but rather be prepared for a jar of mostly pickled cauliflower. 

Would return if I am in the area and need a dimly lit spot for a beer date or hang out but might not go out of my way to come back."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-02-09,4.0,"Really great spot if you are looking to try some craft beer! They have a wide variety of beers and they are constantly changing, even throughout the night. At one point they passed out new menus to everyone as they replaced the tapped kegs with brand new beers. I really enjoyed the sours that they have and cant wait to be back to try some more!

We also had some food here, not the best but I was more here for the beer anyways. The tacos are ok, the chili pretty good and the roast beef sandwich not bad. I enjoyed the chips to munch on as we drank!"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-05-26,2.0,"Stopped after work a while back when there were limited options around and a short period of time to find somewhere to stop. Super crowded inside which made for a poor experience. The outdoor space is really nice, but I don't know if it was the amount of folks, or what, but we were very poorly attended by our waitress. I might be back in a pinch, but low odds on that."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-02-11,4.0,"Cool spot located next to the Queensboro Bridge approach that felt like it had been there forever.

I tried a few beers off their extensive draught list, saison, stout and Belgian style strong ale, and really enjoyed them all. Nearly everything they offer is relatively local so you could potentially track down the brewery if you really enjoyed a pour, which I did. 

Staff was friendly and a good portion of the beers were $5 for happy hour which made it a fun and inexpensive stop.

They did have what looked to be an interesting food menu which I'd try next time along with their cocktails."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-09-15,4.0,"Tried the Logsdon (#21) and Thiriez (#29) based on my tastes for Delirium Tremens and Duvel. Not a big fan, so the server recommended Allagash. It's a can so couldn't try it but she was so confident I would like it so I gave it a try. She was right!! SO AMAZINGLY delicious!! 
I decided to go out on a limb and ordered the Flying Dog. Pretty good as well. Darker beer but very tasty.
To eat I had the burger. Most expensively disappointing burger I've ever had. Worth $5 not, not even. But it was worth $14 -_-. So that was a bummer. Plain burger with plain American cheese. I asked if I could have it medium rare but the server says it comes only cooked one way. Basically it came out well done. I got the trifle chips. Decent. So overall that's definitely a minus one star for food.
Service was fantastic!!
I'll be back for sure"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-06-26,4.0,"Holy Beer Bible Batman!  Our only mistake might have been visiting the Jeffrey the day prior to race day instead of following it.  They had a heavy list of numerous beers of all types and flavors.  Further, they had a solid cocktail list as well, which I tested with my order of the 'Not so Sweet' (well, it was called something along those lines).  Every drink, beer or cocktail, came with reasonable pricetags (some even non-NYC like!).

While enjoying my drink, we grabbed some small bites as well.  The pickle plate was a good portion for two to share.  I didn't love the Red Beet deviled eggs, but that is more related to my preferences as the dish is creative and heavy on the beet taste (vs deviled egg taste).

Service was solid.  We had a large group and they kept up.  We also had some beer questions and the bartender REALLY knew what she was talking about (as opposed to just pushing a certain beer or two).  I'll be back in future visits to NYC.  You should swing by as well."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-05-27,2.0,"I was excited to check this place out but sadly, it turned out to be a dud. The first time we were treated like a nuisance when trying to find a table. We gave it another shot and I wish we hadn't.

The service both times by the same female server was poor at best. She had a total attitude and acted inconvenienced by just about everything. She has the complete opposite personality of someone who should work in customer service. She's also the same person who made the first experience poor, too.

We ordered drinks and some chips and salsa. The guacamole was an additional $3 and it was a tiny amount. We all had to laugh at the small amount for $3, please see picture.

I asked for the check and signed the merchant copy. Before I could put a cash tip (which was undeserved), she took the check from beneath my elbows. What the hell? You're supposed to ask if it's ready or ask if you can take it. Don't invade my personal space.

You lost out on your tip and customers."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-10-14,3.0,"Drinks:
- lots of craft beers to choose from, and a good variety with a lot if styles I like
- I liked the saisons, the wheat and the hazy IPA
- the price for a flight and pints seemed high
- there's a ""cocktail lab"" where you can either sit and just get drinks or where they whip up speciality cocktails for seating in the rest of the joint

Food:
- they have bacon wrapped dates (!!), which are my fave. These come with a legit piece of Applewood bacon wrapped around each. Unfortunately the date and cheese inside are tiny. Suggestion to take these to the next level: use a bigger date and, hence, more cheese,  place them on a small bed of arugula, and drizzle it all in balsamic reduction.
- the potato leak soup, which was a generous portion size, came with cheddar toast that was basically a mini grilled cheese; perfect for dipping
- truffle oil is drizzled in the soup, and used for a number of other dishes on the menu - yum!
- the dressing on the side salad was delicious, but unfortunately the salad was swimming in it
- food was also a bit pricey

Venue:
- lots of places to sit and different rooms, including a beer garden
- beer garden closes early on week nights
- was a bit confusing on the seating and service approach because there's no one watching the front doors (there are two) and you can only see two narrow bars from the front

Service:
- minimally attentive waitress; she was very nice but spent half of the evening tucked into her little server booth staring at her phone"

The vibe was good. We had a super friendly but chill bartender. The place was packed. They had this weird movie Elizabeth playing that kept us entertained at time. Overall, looking forward to visiting this place again. 

There was a separate entrance for craft beers a craft cocktails, which was cool. Solid 4 stars"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-02-04,4.0,"One of our friend celebrated his birthday at that beer place. I didn't spent for a long time but all in all the experiences that I had was okay.

they have a big selection and the environment was nice . The only thing that I didn't like about air circulation of inside. it needs more air in order to wave the smell of the food. 

As a beer I had pilsener. It was great as my beginner experiences. I also had a chance to have Tater tots. the taste of the food was good, but a bit crunchy overcooked. 

Hopefully until next time I would update my review and give them a five stars 

Thank you The Jeffrey Craft Beer & Bites"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2019-07-24,4.0,"I used to live pretty close to this place and having been here for the first time only a year ago, I was surprised I hadn't been here more often!  It's an excellent place to stop by for after-work drinks and their selection of various craft beers along with some quality wines and excellent cocktails is top-notch!  They have a cute interior and the bar was pretty packed the day we went.  That being said, there was a patio in the back that though it wasn't open at the time, seemed like a cool place to hang out on a summer night. 

I usually go with a rosé (because #RoséAllDay, obvi) or a cider but would definitely come back to sample some more things from the menu.  My greatest complaint with bars/pubs sometimes is that the quality of the light fare/snacks is often lacking but that's definitely not the case with the Jeffrey.  At a work happy-hour a few months ago, I shared pretzels with a friend and the dips are on point!  Though they have some other quality snack options, the true reason to hit up the Jeffrey is the alcohol, of course. 

Though I live a little farther away now, I'll definitely be stopping back!"
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2020-04-22,4.0,"This is a neighborhood gem. The burgers are delicious, on the smaller side IMO, but packed with great flavor.

The staff are very friendly and really on top of their game.

There is a great back yard space when the weather cooperates.  Inside can get a bit cramped, especially near the first bar."
941,the-jeffrey-craft-beer-and-bites-new-york,2018-12-30,4.0,"Comfortable and homey bar with great drinks and casual food.

Ambiance.  So many interesting details that come together creating a cozy neighborhood vibe.  The industrial looking piping and overhead lamps with faucet handles at the ceilings were the cool detail I noticed the recent visit.  Two bars and seating in the back with community table and tables for 4.  TVs at the bar and in the back played a football game.

Food and drinks.

They have a large selection of beers, but the bartenders also make a fantastic cocktail. I am very particular about my drinks, and my mezcal, and they make an incredible mezcal old fashioned.  

Very good Casual food with the highlight of yesterday's being the truffle flavored wings.  Caution  - very hot! I (and my stomach) would prefer a little less hot especially since the spicy hot took from the really tasty truffle flavor after the first wing. But still very good. Chili while also very good - was so hot in temp that I had to wait about 20 minutes to eat it. Friend also enjoyed the burger. 

Service.  Our server while friendly, seemed to be the only one working and could have used some support as it was hard to get his attention as he waited on all the tables in the back area. 

Recommend as a casual cozy feeling spot to meet with friends for drinks and casual food."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2020-03-01,5.0,"Matto is $2 for everything you buy, which at first seemed like such a joke in NYC, I walked past it, scoffing, every morning.  But it's no joke.  That $2.00 promise includes iced coffee, sandwiches, hot chocolate, large cookies, larger waters, and anything else the shop is offering.  And honestly?  For $2.00 in NYC I'd be happy to munch on a day old corpse, because it would be a steal.       
                
But Matto doesn't offer corpse so I've switched to coming every morning, before work, getting their large iced coffee (which completely beats places that charge twice as much, like Gregory's & Birch & the bane of coffee lover's existence, Starbucks), a muffin (I suggest blueberry but for $2.00, I'd be happy eating road-kill flavor), a giant water, a stuffed foccaccia (spinach is my fav).  That said, if you go wrong (and with their business model, they don't offer nearly as much as some of the nearby places but you'll also cut your morning spend in, at least, half), it's $2.00 down the drain.  

TLDR:  It's $2.00, people.  If you don't like it, you'll make yourself like it because it's $2.00, folks, and actually the food (though limited) is great."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-08-02,4.0,"Dummy me thinking that the Matto I spotted on West 40th street was the only one in the city, I only learn this when passing another one at 46th street, and then searching on Yelp turned up 13 more of them, are they selling franchise with no money down or something?  Their store has a logo sign that looks just like the zero Tarot card , the FOOL card, was I now being mocked too?

Matto is Crazy in Italian I guess that's what the owner was told when he came up with the $2 for everything idea.   And it is crazy when you think stores are paying 20, 30, and 50 thousand a month in midtown so how are you supposed to make any money?

Well time to try them, and they got your usual list of espresso coffee and then some I rarely see, a 'Red Eye'  which is espresso mix with  an other coffee  like drip and a Cortado which should be boiled milk and espresso and not foamy.   
My mother used to make it perfectly, I don't try to do it myself anymore because my milk would boil over and make a mess on the stove. And then the secret to not getting the milk skim on top 9f your coffee is to blow while your are poring the boiled milk in.

They have a decent number of muffins , cakes, cookies that are good for $2 and so was the coffee I had , but I do Starbucks Venti these days so I had to get another coffee after I got to the office because the coffee cups are small.

I must say I was impressed with Matto and $2 doesn't mean you get cheap and tasteless."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-11-19,5.0,"Can't be their prices.$2 for everything. Any coffee drink, pastries, the kombucha, it's all $2. The coffee is delicious. I haven't tried the pastries yet. The hot chocolate also looked good. I plan to get hot chocolate the next time I'm in Manhattan."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-05-06,5.0,"Matto Espresso is such a lovely little cafe across from work. I was mind blown by how everything only cost $2 each, coffee and pastries alike. I was so surprised that my total bill came out to be less than $6 lol.

I ordered a cafe latte and an almond croissant for breakfast. The latte was made to order, tasted great, but is smaller in size. I really liked the almond croissant after it was heated up. The entire pastry was sweet, flaky, and buttery with delicious sweet fillings on the inside. 

Overall, I was impressed with Matto Espresso! Definitely one of the top spots to grab cheap but quality coffee and breakfast in Midtown East."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-05-17,5.0,"Bottom line: $2 for every item. This is not a gimmick! And the food is actually good! 

Today I got the multigrain croissant with egg - they heated it up for me but the egg wasn't completely warm. I didn't mind because I was in a rush but if you want it to hot you may want to ask them to toast it for longer.

In the past I've ordered the spinach Bureka (think of a spinach pie essentially) and that was great too. I am not sure how they keep their prices at McDonald's levels but the service is amazing and I hope they never change their business model! Love Matto!! 

Note: $4 credit card minimum"

I had the chocolate chip cookie which was ginormous and filled with huge chocolate chunks and got a taste of the coffee cake. Both were delicious and my wallet was super happy. Not to mention, the service is super friendly. 

Pro tip: ask them to warm your pastry - makes it even more delicious on a cold day!"
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-11-07,5.0,"MATTO is BY-FAR my favorite grab-n-go place around. I usually just get their chai latte when one of my colleagues does a coffee run and had never visited the store myself. Every one at work has been raving about this place and the fact that everything is just $2 excluding tax. I finally decided to come check out this place myself. I asked for the Nutella shell after the amazing things my colleagues had to say about it. The guy directly put into into a bag, so make sure to mention you'd like it ""toasted"" if you would. He was then toasting it for me when I pulled out my card and I was told - minimum $4 for card. I then noticed the sign that says that. I was going to get another Nutella shell, when the owner walks up "", and says: ""Just get one if you need only one"". We then chatted for a few about the store and I mentioned how amazing my colleagues and I think this place is. Not only is it great value for money, but great tasting too. Absolutely delighted with the variety of items in this store and the hospitality. Most definitely going back, with cash. ;) :)"

Coffees, juices, cakes sandwiches all 2$! (Without tax so roughly 2.17$ an item).

Only negative is sometimes there's a queue (rush hour)."

945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2019-03-22,5.0,"I finally got a chance to come here and I am so happy I experienced this place. This morning I ordered a caramel latte with coconut milk and it was only $2. Can you believe they sell lattes for $2 in Manhattan!!! I could not believe this.

When I walked into this establishment I was greeted and immediately helped. I was told they offered several different non-dairy milk choices such as: almond, coconut, oat, and soy. You can get any of these milk choices for no additional cost. Which is wonderful when compared to other coffee/cafe shops. 

I also ordered a blueberry muffin that had some sort of crumb on top of it. It was delicious and moist but, I was disappointed that they could not heat up the muffin. It was a delicious muffin none the less. 

I will be back to try other options. This place will be one of my go-to places."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2018-10-01,4.0,"I previously wrote a review for Matto and gave it 2 stars. It's not that their food or service was terrible. To me, they just blend in with all the other coffee shops in NYC without leaving an impression. However, I do want to update my review. 

I still agree with my review that $2 for all items in the shop is very intriguing but it depends on the item you are purchasing. Drinks for $2 is a steal. A small half sandwich for $2 is not worth it. A small rice crispy treat for $2 is not worth it. And so on. 

What made me change my mind about Matto is because of two reasons:
1) Despite their small portions, their food and drinks are pretty tasty. I still love their chocolate chip cookie and they run out fast! I've been ordering their ice coffee and like all other coffee shops, it's pretty much average. Except, it's only $2 before tax. I really appreciate that they give a lot of choices for milk and sugar. Rather than giving the usual regular milk, sugar, and sugar syrup, Matto really encourages you to become creative. They have regular milk, skim milk, 2% milk, almond milk (in some locations only), soy milk, sugar, raw cane sugar, honey, agave, and so on. What's not to like about that?

2) Their staff service is amazing. Every time I come inside, the staff greets me with smiles. If I want a recommendation, they will really take into consideration my preferences. Although, not everyone gets my coffee order right. I always ask to fill the cup half way up with coffe so I could fill the rest with milk. They always put in too much and I have to tell them to pour some out. 

Overall, I think they deserve another star."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2017-10-31,5.0,"Review #700!  My biggest gripe about this place is not knowing they had other locations spread around Manhattan!  This is my first experience with Matto, having just recently opened up shop on 40th between Lex & Park.  We were drawn in by the ""EVERYTHING IS $2"" chalkboard so figured we'd venture in to explore what they could possibly be offering.  Famous Amos-sized cookies?  Bite-sized avocado toast sandwiches?  Three ounces of your favorite coffee?  Not at all!  

Matto serves up a selection of sandwiches, ranging from (our favorite) the veggie burger, to egg salad, to smoked salmon, and more.  The sandwiches are generous and ""thick,"" but half-size - they make for a perfect snack or small lunch if you're not starving for a full on deli hero.  For drinks, they offer any sized hot or iced coffee, along with espresso-based concoctions like cappuccinos and lattes, all for...yup, $2.  In fact, looking up and down the line, there's really nothing I could find that doesn't seem ""worth"" more than the price tag here.  Everything we've had has been good and doesn't feel at all like they cut corners to keep their prices low.   

Note that aside from a small counter ledge, there's really no place to eat inside, but there's a big expanse of steps across the street, and you're also just a few blocks from Bryant Park.  Also, for those interested, this place is not stroller or wheelchair friendly - you have to descend about 3-4 steps once you go inside."
945,matto-espresso-new-york-15,2017-09-16,5.0,"Yes it true $2 per item   ( Actually $2.18 with taxes , get your loose change ready & click helpful (lol) )

Its really Close to Grand Central Station & Blink Grand Central.  When I 1st came across this place and I saw the sign said Everything was $2 , I did not believe it and asked their workers to confirm. 

 I told my co-workers how can they operate a Manhattan store front on $2 per item.   We tried the banana bread (decent) , Organic OJ ( okay taste ) , Ice tea (good size and good ) and croissant omelet sandwich.  I saw their Muffin and Cookie which I plan to try near future.

See my photos of their $2 drinks session - 1L Water at $2 is a hard fine in the City.  Their ice tea was delicious and organic.

I would rate their food on same scale as Starbucks.   To be honest the pastries and food I tried so far are 3.5 to 4 stars, but for $2.18 after taxes and friendly service and cleanliness, they deserve the 1.5 stars more. 

P.S. : They close early at 6pm and check if open on weekends ( I think they are closed on weekend)   Unfortunately they don't have a seating area."

I'm pretty sure it's $2 each but the guy was kind enough to give me 2. But they turned out to be extremely dry, crumbly and old tasting.  It was way too sweet for me I couldn't finish one. I did see a vegan almond butter cookie that also looked good. 

Don't get the vegan donut! I will try other items next time."

It's about a block away from my job and I love going there for my morning coffee and a sandwich, and for $4 in Midtown that's quite a steal. My only complaint is that they're closed on weekends and now that I only work weekends I'm devastated having to go next door to Starbucks and end up paying $8-$10 for something I could get at Matto for way less!

Their lattes are my favorite and I love that adding flavor doesn't cost more. Their espresso is pristine and tastes incredible every single time. I love the choices for skyrr or some fruit, or even juices in the fridge for something to grab real quick.

It is not right on an avenue and feels a bit more secluded like you won't bump into or be interrupted by someone from your office every few minutes.  There is not a ton of seating, but they do have small, 2 person tables and I always seem to be able to find a place to park myself."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-03-04,2.0,"Ordered a caramel latte with oat milk. Tasted like I was drinking warm oat milk with honey. No hints of any coffee/espresso in my drink. The oat milk was only slightly above room temperature.

When I initially ordered my drink the staff moreorless said, ""This isn't Starbucks."" Not sure why they had to say that."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2020-01-19,4.0,I'm always on the lookout for a good sweet treat near work and the cookies at Macchiato hit the spot! The chocolate chip and triple chocolate were delicious! I'll definitely be back for the cookies when I need an afternoon pick-me-up.
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-04-25,4.0,The sandwich was excellent and tasted very fresh. The cappuccino was good but I think next time I would try there signature. The cappuccino was lacking some flavor. I'm definitely coming back.
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-12-07,4.0,"If you want to find a modern little place full of men and women sipping coffee on their lunch hour plus a good cup of Joe stop by Macchiato. They have very creative drinks; cold and hot that are filled with coffee or espresso to give you that extra boost you need in the day to continue your routine or sightseeing. The shop has few sit down tAbles, a bench to look out the front window and standing high tops. Enjoy!!!"
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-09-18,5.0,"Macchiato Espresso Bar is conveniently located on the same street as my hotel and also on my way to work. I decided to grab a latte and some breakfast. The barista and cashier were both super friendly and nice early in the morning!

I ordered a latte with 2% milk along with a garlic bagel (cream cheese on the side). Wow, I was super impressed with the quality of the latte because it was so good! The hot beverage was rich and creamy from the steamed milk. I felt instantly caffeinated but without the jitters. 

Garlic bagel was absolutely delicious. There's not a ton of baked garlic bits stuck onto the bagel, but I can definitely taste the garlic flavor. It went so well with the cream cheese that I was blown away. My first fresh NY bagel experience was a success!

Overall, Macchiato Espresso Bar is probably my favorite place to pickup coffee in NY. I will definitely come back if I ever visit the city again."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-04-16,4.0,"Lovely espresso bar in the heart of Midtown East, adjacent to Grand Central. Macchiato Espresso Bar offers a great cup of coffee, attentive service and cozy nook to escape your bustling surrounding. 

Prices are steep but standard for NYC. 

Solid cup of coffee and they even steamed my almond milk! Pastries also looked tasty but I did not get around to trying one."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-08-01,4.0,"Praise tha' LORD for a coffee joint with SEATING. Starbucks has steered away from this, thus making this local spot very appealing. Especially when you need to have a quick meeting or need to rest your feet. Seats are usually always filled, but turnover is quick (fuck you laptop hogs that sit hours on end with an empty cappuccino mug). 

Selection of coffee options are very good, they offer pastries, as well as food menu items! All things done right. 

Keep it up, M!"
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-12-18,4.0,Cute little place with solid coffee. Friendly staff and reasonably quick service. Sitting areas were filled but standing tables were available. Would certainly recommend.
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-10-03,5.0,"Awesome coffee bar in a great location. I'm not a Starbucks fan so I was so happy to find this place. They have a great tasting cup of coffee, friendly, fast service and their food is even great! I would definitely recommend stopping in and checking it out!"
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-08-09,2.0,I just walked out when they rang me up for my medium latte and it was SEVEN dollars before tax or tip.  There are at least five other gourmet coffee shops within a one block radius.  The prices here are out of control.
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-03-15,5.0,"Excellent latte with pecan maple danish delicious
Excellent cappuccino with apple danish was incredible."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-11-06,1.0,"I have seen this cafe for many years as I pass by. The cafe is sleek and exuded fine quality cafe vibe. 

As soon as I walk in today it felt like an unclean bodega down any block in nyc. I still wanted to try the coffee. 

Got a small iced mocha. With tip it was around $7. Quite pricy compared to other good options. 

The coffee has no body and lacks flavor. No taste of coffee beans being roasted nicely. I had to throw away the coffee because it was so bad! 

They would be well served if they changed their coffee beans quickly. 

Such a shame that for a great looking cafe it lacks good quality coffee."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-06-06,2.0,"If you want a watery Cafe Americano, ear-splitting Euro-trash tunes, and oddly peppered by suits - this is the place."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2017-09-13,5.0,"Legit BEST ESPRESSO EVER! I stumbled upon this place bc I was desperately trying to avoid going to Starbucks around the corner, and was beyond pleasantly surprised.

Their cold brew just can't be beat. I only needed one cup of cold brew and I was good for the whole day. It's a strong cup but doesn't leave you jittery.

The pastries are all baked on site and look great. It seemed like everyone was buying the food from there, although I wasn't in the mood to eat.

Will come back here for coffee and pastry, and will bring a friend next time! Awesome vibes, too!!"
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2019-03-26,4.0,Nice trendy little coffee shop.  Moderately priced but very clean.  Not better then Starbucks or Pret though
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2015-06-14,4.0,"Excellent coffee for an afternoon caffeine fix! I love the simplicity of the decor and it makes it so easy for me to forget about stress at work during my stay. 

Gooey Chocolate Chip Cookie and the Cappuccino are my go-to combo here. The cookie was super soft and the chocolate chip is melted on the inside. It is the best, if you can get it just fresh out of the oven. I love the chewy texture and just the right about of sweet to help lift up my energy. Cappuccino is my favorite coffee of choice anywhere. Its espresso, hot milk, and foam milk had the perfect proportion here at Macchiato. My sweet treat and my coffee is a perfect balance of bittersweetness. I personally prefer my coffee hot but iced versions are just as good for any summer day! I would like to see Macchiato work on their latte art, it is quite boring on the eyes. 

For those who work in the immediate area, you know that the coffee competition is heated around here. I am proud to say that Macchiato earns one of the top spots on my list. Skip your office's coffee from the pot or Keurig and treat yourself! You deserve it!"
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2016-08-17,4.0,"I got a delicious hazelnut iced coffee here as well as a chocolate almond croissant.

Large space, actually, and everyone working there is very friendly."
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-10-20,5.0,Fortunately I work next door to Macchiato because I want to get lunch there 5 days a week.  Amazing customer service!  They gave me a $20 gift card because I complained about my sandwich!  They also put a complementary chocolate cookie (delicious by the way) in the bag with my replacement sandwich. The people who work there are so friendly and nice.  I've tried 4 of the sandwiches and the Caesar Salad -- everything is my favorite -- it's hard to choose.
949,macchiato-espresso-bar-new-york,2018-08-06,4.0,"One of my favorite places to get espresso and cappuccino. If you like good quality coffee drinks and work in the grand central area, you won't be disappointed. Quality is exceptional. Great pastries and lunch items as well. Cafe is small so it's not ideal for groups."
