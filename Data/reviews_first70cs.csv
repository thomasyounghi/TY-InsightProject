0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-05-22,5.0,"I absolutely LOVE these donuts favorite is the Vanilla bean, VALRHONA CHOCOLATE and creme brûlée these are all yeast donuts they are light, airy and delicious. Love them. They just reopened for pick up and I was on it!!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-03-21,5.0,"I. LOVE. DOUGHNUT. PLANT. A trip to NYC would not be complete without a visit to Doughnut Plant, lugging back almost all the yeast doughnuts they have available. 

I always start by entering the shop, bamboozled for choices because just EVERYTHING sounds delicious. Do I get the Sourdough Strawberry or the Passionfruit? Vanilla? Have it filled? Save yourself the difficult decision and just get them all like me. Hehe. Their creme brulee dough seed is also amazing- if only it was larger. 

Love all their doughnuts because the texture is great, has a nice weight to it but is still fluffy but not too dense. The flavors are also super unique, and look at how pretty they are! I would get so fat eating doughnuts every day if I lived closer. Highly recommend their doughnuts!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-04-16,4.0,"Doughnut Plant is a solid doughnut spot, they evidently use quality ingredients (this is no dunkin donuts honey!!), however I rarely feel like the doughnuts are super fresh. 

Personally I prefer a very classic doughnut spot with an old school vibe, doughnut plant is doing a little extra with the seasonal products etc. which is sometimes what you want. Great to bring to the office or to someones house!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-03-22,3.0,"I had read reviews about Doughnut Plant and what is the hype all about?Planning to make pitstop at Kossar's to get a bialy, but this place was right in front of me while crossing the street. Never deny your sweet tooth.

This was my first visit. Had no idea what kind of donuts they had. Yes, I looked at the board and looked all around.There was only one customer in front of me. Two staff there. One at cash register and other staff was boxing up doughnuts.

There were no doughnuts in the display area. 

No worries. I asked customer standing at a distance what she was getting and recommendations. Then I asked staff what was popular, etc... I pointed to stuff at the rack and asked what was in it- was there filling, creme,etc...

So I bought a couple donuts to try. Something with nuts, one that looked pink and had blueberry at first thought it was Red Velvet.

Cappuccino is the really good here. They charged you extra for Macadamia milk, should let customers know. 

Took home doughnuts to share with the kids.

Your doughnuts are too sweet. Not like Krispy Kreme nor Black Label Donuts. Not my cup of tea.

This is my experience with Doughnut Planet. Yours maybe different. Not orgasmic here. Food should pop and be sinfully luscious when it comes to desserts."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-02-01,5.0,"I love donuts and this place didn't disappoint. 

I wish we would have come earlier because we went around 2pm and they had run out of a lot of flavors, which is to be expected. 

We tried the peanut butter banana cream, Crème Brulee, coconut cream, and black sesame came. 

The peanut butter banana cream was my favorite followed by the coconut cream. Both were filled even though there was a hole in the middle. I'm not a big fan of coconut but it was really good. The base donut was fantastic. 

I really liked the black sesame cake donut too. I don't really like cake donuts, but the black sesame flavor was delicious (they were out of the yeast version of this one). The Crème Brulee was also good, but was kind of boring and very small. 

I would definitely come back here. It's exactly what I want in a donut shop."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-02-01,4.0,"First time trying Doughnut Plant and I can see why many people are a fan of this shop. You have many options to choose from: Cake, Yeast, Filled, and more! I got their Carrot Cake (cake), Apple Cinnamon (cake), Peanut Butter and Concord Grape Doughseed (filled), Pumpkin & Spiced Pepitas (yeast), and Orange Sourdoughnut.  I personally like the yeast doughnut compared to the other ones. Although I do have to say that their Peanut Butter & Concord filled donut was out of this world! 

Overall, I would recommend the yeast ones as they're nice, fluffy, and oh so soft. They have many flavors to choose from but if you're after the more popular ones like the Rose one, be sure to get there early as they can run out. I was so sad to see that the Rose doughnut was sold out when I went during the afternoon."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-03-18,4.0,"Delicious albeit expensive. Great for a treat. Rich favors and solid cake like consistency, these doughnuts definitely hit the spot. I got these delivered, as I tried them during the corona quarantine times, so I can't comment on the store or displays. Tried a bunch of flavors, all delicious, the basic vanilla is a great glazed donut tho. My rating- Definitely worth trying but too expensive for what you're getting to buy for the whole office."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-11-22,5.0,"My god these are good. My friend and I got a blackout and a tres leches to split. Both were completely delicious. The tres leches is less sweet than you expect but still sweet and perfect. The blackout is just perfect, decadent without being too much. 

The guy helping us out was also great, just super pleasant. 

Highly recommend!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-03-14,5.0,"My friend and I were looking for coffee around our hotel, and it was our first day in New York for a trip. Luckily we found this place.

It was a short 9-minute walk from our hotel so we decided to venture.

The location is in high foot traffic area (but it's in NY, so what area isn't? Lol) adjacent to other eateries and specialty shops like a BBQ joint a and pickle shop.

The space is small but just the right size for seating. We walked up to the counter and didn't know how to order, but we told the young lady working that it was our first time. She was soooo nice!! She explained what the best sellers were and what they tasted like. We chose the creme brulee (best seller) and the tres leche (another top seller). We also ordered a latte w/oat milk and an americano.

I think we should have started w the creme brulee first and then eaten the tres leches, because it lacked something else in my opinion. The tres leches donut was not only a filled donut, it was the right balance between dense and light. The oat milk latte pairs so great with the donuts! Highly recommend.

We're already thinking of going back and buying some to take home."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-02-25,5.0,"Love love love these doughnuts. The Brooklyn blackout is my favorite with the coffee cake coming in at a close second. They always have specials and have their customers in mind. Order ahead or go in day of! 

We always make sure to add these doughnuts to any fun/special occasion."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-01-17,5.0,"Doughnut Plant is my favorite donut shop, since the moment I bit into the wild blueberry donut and savored the coconut cream dream. Before that moment, I can say,
I really never had a donut. Why, you ask? Because all the donuts I have had in my life cannot compare to the beautiful taste of a Donut Plant donut. Each savory treat is delicately prepared with unique and natural ingredients. The peanut butter and jam donut might have a humble name but by its taste and appearance it's no ordinary beauty. A bit chewy yet soft, with a light frosting and delicious filling. It's paradise in my mouth. Ahh, next time I'm getting a whole box for the week. I can't wait for my next treat!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-01-26,3.0,"I was in need of a mental-health treat so I decided to swing by for a pick-me-up.  I snagged two donuts (for now and later) and a cold brew.  I asked for recommendations and wound up with a vanilla yeast donut, and a tres leches cake donut.  The vanilla yeast was a little disappointing - a lot of the icing had stuck to the paper, leaving a donut that was, well, just a regular old donut.  I didn't get a lot of vanilla flavor, but the donut itself was light and airy--but nothing worth writing home about.  The coffee had a really nice flavor, but it didn't give me the bump of wakefulness I usually get from a cup of coffee--and it felt very small for the high price tag.  

The tres leches donut had great flavor, but the texture inside was super inconsistent -- some parts of the donut had a cake-pop texture, others had a more traditional cake-like feel.  My other minor gripe is that when I swung in, the store was really busy, and I couldn't pop over to look at the actual donuts without losing my place in line, and the menu board kept switching over to a non-menu screen, which made it hard to figure out what to order. 

I might come back if I was in the neighborhood, if only to try the filled donuts I hadn't seen on the menu, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-08-09,4.0,"The blueberry is a flavor bomb!  Their coconut cream square doughnut (how do they make it square?!) has a perfectly flavored creamy center inside a fluffy doughnut.
  
The rose doughflower was my least favorite.  I didn't really taste the rose and the doughnut was actually pretty dense.  

I've had the creme brulee doughnut in the past and that was awesome too!

A little pricey, but worth it for not the run-of-the-mill doughnuts."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-06-01,1.0,Over priced.  Too boo gee for the times.  Go there two times and two times was ignored.   Typical of the community.
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-01-13,3.0,"Got the black sesame yeast donut and was disappointed--the sesame didn't come through, and it felt just like eating a glazed donut. Wish the flavor profile was stronger. Next time I hope to try their peanut butter filled ones or the sesame cake donut."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-08-06,5.0,"Just my favorite doughnut of all of New York and quite possibly the world. I love these doughnuts even better than dough doughnuts. 

These doughnuts are the best because they are perfectly dense, not too airy and full of flavor. What I also like is that they are not too big, they clearly spend time and effort putting flavor into their doughnut. The Brooklyn Blackout Is one of the best doughnuts. It's chocolate on chocolate on chocolate. I don't usually like chocolate doughnuts or cake and I loved this doughnut."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-05-30,2.0,"This was our first New York doughnut experience, and we picked the Doughnut Plant because of their ""doughnut firsts"" claims. We arrived on mothers day, which was pouring rain, and not as packed as I thought it would be for a holiday.

We started with the orange blossom cashew doughnut, which was lumpy and too sweet. Then we had the peanut butter and jelly doughnut which honestly was nothing special. After those two flops, we opted to get back to the counter and order backups, the crème brulee and the hazelnut stuffed doughnuts. These two were slightly better than the first two, but we really weren't that impressed overall.

Prices are high, but they do claim to have the world's first crème brulee doughnut and the world's first square filled doughnut, so I guess that earns them the right to charge what they want. Service was super slow, but relatively friendly, and there was onsite seating and various beverage options. If I were to return to NY for doughnuts, I'd pass Doughnut Plant and head directly to The Doughnut Project."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-06-02,4.0,"How do they get the filling into these square donuts without a trace of an opening ?
Superb, typically priced and better than most places that we've tried. Coconut creme filled Square is ample to share or split into 1/4's. I love this little strip mall that is one of the few in NYC that  are one level only with so much air space above that I wonder who the landlord is and how it has not been redeveloped. 1/2 the size of the Flatiron store."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-05-27,5.0,"The donuts are Absolutely Delicious !!! The staff is very polite and courteous, and the shop is clean. They have an Assortment of donuts that's just Wonderful, I bought 2 dozen assorted donuts. Which family and friends Enjoyed. Very fresh and the flavor esp. The Chocolate is Outstanding. Great place for Coffee and Donuts !!! You won't be disappointed. Highly recommend A+++++"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-05-24,5.0,"For one doughnut is spelt correctly for a change But this place was a nice place to stop for something quick to eat, the staff was respectful and the service was fast!! My new favorite doughnut spit!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-03-11,5.0,"I'm not a HUGE donut person, nor do I like ""fancy"" donuts.  If i'm craving a donut I'll get a standard bar donut with chocolate frosting and a coffee and pretend i'm a cop... I digress.

If a donut shop has great ratings, i'll dabble.  Based on the reviews, I got the blackout donut expecting to eat half and to save the other half for later.  Standard me.  I literally gobbled that shit down before I could even get a picture.

So there.  I loved it."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-02-25,5.0,This place is heaven!!!! Love love love!!! Yummy! Thank you for these awesome donuts we can't wait to come back next time we are in town
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-10-22,3.0,"Wasn't terribly impressed by the Doughnut plant, but they do a lot of things right.

First off, the donuts here are pretty expensive. Compared to some of the other places like Dunkin or Krispe Kreme, the donuts here are definitely priced at a premium. But are they actually at a premium in terms of taste? Probably, but not at the price their currently offered.

I ordered the banana, the blueberry, and two jams. I didn't realize it beforehand, but the jams are actually peanut butter and jam/jelly donuts, so the donut is actually quite heavy.

Review from 2016."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-03-18,5.0,"I don't like donuts! Yes, you heard correctly, I don't care for them. Never did. Doughnut Plant changed my mind. It's the only doughnut I will eat when I'm in New York City. Located in several locations around the city, the shops are tiny with lines usually out the door. With many amazing flavors to choose from, some of the doughnuts come in yeast or cake form. I always choose the yeast form for it's pillowy soft, airy texture. The cream inside is just the perfect amount. I hate it when I bite into a donut that has too much cream. Honestly, I don't need those extra calories.

I tend to make a lot of noise when I enjoy eating something. So much so that a guy on line asked, that good, huh? Oh yeah, I nodded. He asked what flavor I was having and I said, coconut cream, it's my fave, you gotta try it. He smiled and said, I just might, enjoy the rest of your donut. Yes, I highly recommend the coconut cream or the peanut butter and banana cream in yeast form. What makes their coconut cream so good? They crack open fresh coconuts everyday. I promise you, you'll never go back to Dunkin Donuts ever again!

Here are just a few other flavors I have tried that I love:
- Carrot Cake
- Creme Brûlée
- Chocolate Hazelnut
- Brooklyn Blackout
- Manhattan Cream

They offer fresh roasted coffee as well. Doughnut Plant, please make my wish come true by opening one in New Jersey. Check out their web-site for all the amazing flavors available."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-06-10,5.0,"Cute shop! There are pillows all over the walls shaped like donuts. 

There are probably about 20 different donuts to choose from (some jelly-filled, some not, some glazed, etc.) 

After talking to one of the cashiers I opted for the tres leches donut, which is a glazed donut infused with milk. Very very good! They also had s refreshing blackberry lemonade available. Will definitely go back!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-12-04,4.0,"First time at the store - way too many options! I came on a full stomach so I split one donut - the filled creme brûlée! But dang after the first bite, I wish I wasn't sharing cuz it was so good. The dough itself was so chewy and soft -- A+ . The only thing it's kinda small for $4. 

Will go back to try more flavors!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-09-30,5.0,"I've been coming here for all my doughnut needs the last three years. I have yet to be disappointed. This last Sunday, I tried the peanut butter banana creme doughnut and my eyes rolled back as I bit into it... It's really that good. 

The peanuts were crunchy on the outside, with a soft layer of thick creamy peanut butter. On the inside, the banana creme kind just melts out when you bite into the center. Perfect amount of sweetness. Solid 10/10, very solid. Can't say the same about all their other flavors though. Be adventurous at your own risk. 

Recommendation: walk down the block to the sister coffee shop Roasting Plant and grab a coffee there after. Thank me later"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-02-27,5.0,"BEST DONUT PLACE EVER! I have written at least 14 donut reviews and not one has topped doughnut plant! Honestly it is just that good. From the flavors to the texture of the dough. AMAZING!

First off, their yeast donuts are off the charts. Chewy, soft and airy on the inside. A great bite with whatever flavor you choose.

As for the flavor, it just hits the spot. They have classics as well as unique flavors, of which typically sell out quickly. They are so good at flavoring the donut. If it is supposed to be PB and banana, it tastes like PB and banana. The icing isn't crumbly and annoying like other shops I've been to. Perfect balance of sweetness to dough to whatever stuffing they jam into that beautiful donut.

LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-11-13,4.0,"Everyone knows that donut plant has phenomenal donuts. The carrot cake donut is actually my favorite donut of all time. But I did not know that you can also get custom lettered donuts from donut plant! This is honestly such a fantastic way to celebrate something special for an event or occasion. High quality donuts all around, super special flavors, and even customizable options!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-10-06,4.0,"How can I go to New York and not get doughnuts?? The doughnuts at Doughnut Plant sounded so creative and delectable. I honestly had the hardest time deciding which doughnuts to try. The one doughnut I really wanted was their peanut butter and jam doughnut with blackberry jam. Unfortunately, the gentleman right in front of me took the last one. 

I settled on the Brooklyn blackout and tres leches doughnuts. Both of the doughnuts were cake doughnuts, though they were not as soft as I would prefer my cake doughnuts to be.The Brooklyn blackout was by far my favorite. It tasted more like a chocolate cake rather than a doughnut and I was totally for it! There is a chocolate pudding filling that reminded me of a molten lava cake. If you love chocolate, this doughnut is for you! 

The tres leches doughnut was definitely good as well. The doughnut was filled with just a touch of sweet cream and the bottom was soaked in syrup. It is sweet, but not overly sweet.
Overall, these doughnuts are a great option for someone who wants a delicious, unique doughnut!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-08-11,4.0,"Tried the famous black and white doughnut. Not only is the frosting 2 colored, the cake doughnut is also half black half white and boths sides are delicious. The service was quick and the restaurant is clean."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-09-12,5.0,The iced latte was perfect and the donuts are moist and delicious. The Brooklyn black out and tres leche are my favorite.
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-09-25,5.0,If you're a true New Yorker then you understand the love of donuts. There are so many places to choose from but by far doughnut plant has made it into my top 3. The perfect sweet treat to pair with your coffee or tea would be the Valrhona chocolate donut. This donut is a chocolate lovers dream it is literally drenched in chocolate both top and bottom and pairs really well with some iced coffee with creamer/milk (no need for any added sugar). The cinnamon bun doughnut was really refreshing with notes of fresh cinnamon and perhaps even a hint of nutmeg. Totally amazing when warm and you'll be licking that sugar frosting off of your fingers.
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-08-11,5.0,"I remember coming here years ago as a high school student and loving their donuts. They are still one of my favorite donut shops in New York, but now I think they are a tad bit too sweet. Their selection of flavors are always great and I find the staff here to be welcoming. They also serve coffee and have WiFi so this could be a great place to study/work, but do note that there is no restroom. Small place but can seat about 8 guests."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-01-04,5.0,"A billion years ago, well lets be serious around 15 years ago I first tried Donut Plant. Growing up in SoCA donuts are a part of our culture. Well it was true in the 70s-90s at least. When I heard someone came up with a tres leches donut I was on my vespa and on my way to Donut Plant. The taste was no less than amazing and I have returned many times since that first bite. Give it a try and I bet you will be back."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-02-26,4.0,"Nice selection of flavors and textures, coffee is decent service can waver from great to shit and they run out of certain flavors pretty quick in my experiences. 
Can't help but go back whenever I'm walking past"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-09-05,3.0,"summary - * would give this a 3.5 * 
got off the flight and had to make a stop at a bagel shop and a donut place! i have been eyeing the doughnut plant because so many influencers come here! i knew we wanted to try the creme brulee doughseed today and it did not disappointed. 

food & price -
for $4, it is a bit expensive for something that was finished in four bites, BUT it is one of the more expensive donuts on the menu. the other ones range from $3 something to over $5. this was one of the smaller ones that was a bit more pricey. 

the donut itself:
since i ate it at night, the freshness was gone but we torched it ourselves to try to heat it back up. surprisingly, the filling wasn't too sweet. the outside was a bit burnt because we tried to re-melt everything which isn't their fault. we will be coming back to try other flavors but i am sure it tastes a lot more fresh in the morning!! 

overall for the shop, the time, and the donut, we would rate it a 3.5 !! there was seating areas. however there was only one girl working so it went kinda slow. will be coming back to try other flavors to give it more reviews based on flavors and prices!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-02-01,5.0,"Arguably the best doughnut shop in NYC. Yep, I think it's better than DARE I SAY IT: Dough (which I don't really get the hype besides their hibiscus donut hahaha). Their cake donuts are seriously sooo good. I love how they always have so many flavor options. I need to try all of them one day. I love the tres leches and the matcha cake donuts. Their creme brûlée doughseed is also amazing. This location is pretty small but somehow works out. They provide free water but no restroom. Staff is friendly.

Definitely give any of their three locations a visit when in NYC!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-05-30,3.0,"Review for Williamsburg location - This used to be a small business bakery and coffee shop and now Doughnut Plant is here. Great more hyper gentrification. The donuts are good but not great and are very overpriced. The coffee is also overpriced. Also, they don't provide free water to customers which is really annoying. I've had better doughnuts else where that DIDNT cost so much."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-12-06,5.0,"Literally the only place I'll get a chai latte. Not too sweet, but sooo frickin good. The tres leches doughnut is fireee too"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-08-25,5.0,"Had the vegan chocolate doughnut, very good! The doughnut itself was very spongy & the frosting was remarkable. I've had other doughnuts from this place at a different location and the carrot cake one was my favorite. Overall this place does not disappoint!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-01-06,5.0,"Omg! I don't like donuts because of them being oily, super sweet and heavy BUT this was one of the most insane donuts i've ever had. I tried the triple chocolate, dulce de leche, creamy coconut and creme brulee. All of them, were perfect texture, good amount of filling/topping, not greasy (that means fried at the correct temperature) and very innovative. The chocolate one was a more cakey donut and was amazing. The creme brulee was a smaller donut and was my favorite. I am still not convinced if I love donuts but if you do, you have to try it!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-02-04,3.0,"I hear a lot about and see posts of this place. Did it live up to it's hype? I'd say it's close but I've only been here once and had only 1 donut.

Place is pretty spacious inside; although the table I sat at was pretty dirty. Has 2 corner L seating spots made of stone and 2 small circle tables at each spot. They have a small little counter for trash, water, napkins, and other misc. items.

They have a small display with the donuts that they offer. And it's nice to see a rack behind the counter of the fresh donuts being made. Service was nice and saw them help a lady refill the container of free water for her.

The donut I ordered was good. Would like to go back and taste their other donuts to have a better review but I'd say donuts prices are a bit expensive as I can go to my local dunkins and get just as good a donut for less. BUT that's just my opinion"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-01-23,5.0,"Deliciousness served here! Eat in store with a cup of joe if possible. The lady working was great, making suggestions and even ice water upon request. Do not miss this place."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-08-21,5.0,"All I can say is WOW. These donuts were so much better than anticipated. I saw the reviews online so we walked to find this little shop. 

The environment was so welcoming and warm! There are 4-5 tables and bench seating. The amount of different kinds of donuts was the best part. If you're in the mood for a traditional yeast donut, they have you covered. I personally recommend the cake donuts! 

We ordered 4 different kinds (a bit overkill yes, but when in New York, why not?) We got hazelnut/Nutella, wild blueberry, peach, and peanut banana creme filled. 

Every donut was fantastic! Great flavors, fresh, none were dry or overly sweet. The wild blueberry was BY far our favorite.  I'd order a dozen next time. 

If you're in New York looking for great donuts you better check this place out. Everything was wonderful! We will be back on our next visit to the city."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-07-08,4.0,"I have to pass this spot on my way to and from the subway and it's really hard to resist the temptation...

These are probably my favorite doughnuts of all time. They come in awesome flavors, they aren't overly sweet, the yeast donuts are fluffy, and the cake doughnuts make a wonderful once in a while treat. My go-to staples are the banana yeast and the coffee cake (which has bits of delicious cream on the inside). 

However, I have had flavors that lacked a bit of kick to them. I appreciate that the flavors here don't assault your palate like they might at some other donut shops, but I've had a few where it was so subtle that one donut was a bit indistinguishable from another. E.g., got an orange blossom (seasonal) and a vanilla donut once, and the orange flavor of the former was so slight that the two donuts tasted much the same, except that one had a mildly bitter aftertaste. To be fair, just a touch of flavor might be what you want sometimes, but for around $4 a pop it can feel underwhelming.

Favorite ever was a matcha creme filled donut (see photo). Not sure if it was a seasonal donut or once a week flavor but I wish it was served every single day."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-01-20,5.0,"Doughnut plant is a lovely donut shop with a very friendly and helpful staff.

0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-04-05,3.0,"Doughnuts are good, not great. The worst part is the service - not one seems to know where to stand to order and then you get an attitude when you do order."

The donuts here are heaven sent and we lovingly refer to them as ""crack donuts"" because  whenever we're in the area we can't have just one. Today we opted for a dozen because-well just because! You don't need a reason to enjoy these. The black and white, tres leches, Brooklyn blackout... you know what, just go and try them all."

Not only were your employees nice to look at, they were friendly & helpful to someone who couldn't choose which kinda donut she wanted. I'll be back, I'm sure about that. The music was also giving off good vibes for a nice evening.

They offered me the seasonal flavor of cranberry (AMAZING.. similar to their wild blueberry) which was paired with a latte since it was pretty chilly outside! FAIR WARNING: hot liquid, sip with caution or your mouth will be burned. I also got the Brooklyn blackout for the plane! iDk how they kept their donuts so soft & fluffy but they did, even when it was smushed inside my backpack. I enjoyed every second of every bite lol my sister ordered a dozen other flavors that she particularly liked, however she didn't wanna share with me *facepalm*

Guess I'll just have to make sure I return to try their other donuts!! Especially those square ones, what a funky shape."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2018-11-16,5.0,"Was in NYC for the weekend and as a donut  fiend I had to try out this place. Came here around 11 and it was pretty empty but a huge line formed behind me so I guess the crowds come and go in waves. 

We got the creme brûlée donut (apparently they are the first to make this donut) and the coconut cream donut, which is a unique square donut that's filled (apparently the first to do this as well). 

The joint was a lot smaller than I expected- only like four tables and it seems like mostly a grab and go kinda place but luckily we were able to get a seat. I was most excited for the creme brûlée and I thought it was good but not the best filled donut I've had - I was disappointed with the amount of creme which left me wishing there was more. Perhaps it was just that one happened to have less creme who knows. 

The five stars, however, is for the coconut cream donut that literally took me out of orbit and back. Holy cow the flavor profile on that thing was crazy. Admittedly,
I am super weak for coconut flavored things so maybe some bias there but the coconut glaze on both sides perfectly complemented the sweet, but not too sweet cream on the inside. This was all pillowed in by the fluffiest yeast dough you've ever tasted and obviously the chewiness of coconut adds another texture element. Easily best donut I've ever had and I don't have to hesitate to think about it. 

It seems like their most popular flavors are their creme brûlée, coconut cream, Brooklyn blackout, and tres leches so I'll have to come back to try the latter two. Will definitely be returning to this spot."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-04-04,4.0,Pistachio donut was amazing. One of the best donut spots. A little pricey though. I'll be back
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2020-03-12,2.0,"Great donuts but terrible service. Came today at about 9am. The African American lady cashier with short hair looked at me and didnt say anything so I as a customer walked up and ready to place an order. Then she said I am in the middle of an order with an attitude. The pwrson which was far from front of the cashier was on his phone and you as the cashier could of said please wait or say something rather look and leave the other customers hanging. Not only did she not greet her customer and had an attitude, she kept talking to her colleague in front of me saying she wasn't wrong. I decided to pay anyway and walked out. Really dont need a donut with an attitude early in the morning."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2018-10-23,4.0,"Sometimes cake donuts can be kinda dry but the ones here were super moist and yummy

There weren't many flavors left when we got there but I got to try the matcha and blueberry. Both were good but I really liked the matcha flavor one"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2018-08-21,5.0,"This is my another 'must visit' place when I am in NY.  I usually stop by in the afternoon and there's a line.  But I went there in late morning this time, then there was no line...no one!  

Anyhow two friendly ladies asked me what I wanted.  I normally get creme brûlée & tres leche, but decided to have something else.  As per their recommendations, I picked raspberry, then...tres leche again...lol.  

Their service is always friendly!"
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-02-22,2.0,"I am honestly surprised that Doughnut Plant is rated so highly. 
Maybe I went on a REALLY bad day because I bought several flavors and the best one was just OK. 

The two better tasting ones were the carrot cake and the coconut cream and like I mentioned they were still only OK. 
Red velvet-which I was really excited about because well.. I LOVE red velvet.. was probably the worse one. It was really bitter tasting and I couldn't even take a second bite out of it. 
A close second to being the worst one was the creme brûlée dough seed! I was excited about these as well (hence the reason I got two) but these were just as bitter! Pretty bad ! 
The chocolate hazelnut dough seed was also a big disappointment .. I'm pretty big on chocolate hazelnut as well.. and this was just not good at all. Again, bitter-tasting.. like the creme brûlée and the red velvet. 

I wasn't the only one with this opinion either.. I brought the donuts home to my family and they all agreed. 
My grandpa who is huge on sweets.. donuts specifically, said that they were bitter and left a lingering and unpleasant aftertaste. 
My mom and cousin agreed as well. 
A good portion of the donuts were left untouched. 

The fact that there are over 3000 reviews with such a high rating really baffles me and leads me to believe that maybe I did visit them on an off day and get a bad batch (October 2018) 
I'm a bit curious to taste them again and see if there's any difference. 
I understand that everyone has their own different taste and preference.. but again these ratings are HIGH .. yet 5 different people tasted them that day and all agreed that they were not the best."
0,doughnut-plant-new-york-6,2019-09-01,5.0,"Came in to this experience expecting less quality than what I got. These donuts blew me away. I know good donuts, and this place definitely exceeded expectations. If you're in the area, you simply must pay this spot a visit. Get the coconut creme. You will not be disappointed"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-03-14,5.0,"I can't believe I have never left a review for this place considering the amount of times I stop by here. And all the times I have been here not once has anyone been rude to me. I always make sure to get a latter art so maybe the taro or red velvet or matcha to be honest I like them all, just the cuteness of it makes me love it. Understandable that many people don't wanna pay $4-5 for such small cups of latte but it is definitely based on preference 
Second -- the bingsoo here is so so good  the one I get the most has to be the mango cheesecake it literally has lives of cheesecakes and has condensed milk and all that good stuff - it's very sweet Incase u don't like that 
I really don't think it's a miss if you come here ! They have individual and large bingsoos-- I get individual b/c I don't like sharing the goodness ...."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-04-21,4.0,"Walked all the way across town to get my cute, non caffeinated ube latte and I was not disappointed! Super duper cute. 

The seating area is a little odd and empty but that could have been because it was a Sunday afternoon. Service is okay, not outstanding but not terrible and plenty of other choices on the menu. 

Also ordered an Americano and quickly discovered why one should stick to cute latte art drinks hence the 4 star review. Overall a good experience and worth going back to."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-03-05,4.0,"Definitely a beautiful cup of coffee. It was a bit small for $5 though that was so simply made. The design on the top was pretty cute though!

Their cream special basically consists of a base coffee or tea (cold only) with a cream topping of Matcha, Thai tea, Thai coffee, taro, etc.

I got the Thai coffee with the that tea cream. It was very tasty, but I wish there was more!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-06-09,4.0,"I first came to sweet moment when my friend took me one summer and that turned into multiples trips a month that single summer. when school started, me and my friends still constantly visit sweet moment. Their desserts are ideal and consist of many different flavors. I'm sure anyone can find a flavor that suits their taste. I also find sweet moment a great place for my studies. I really like the environment it provides and I feel like i can focus on my homework more as well. Their drinks also have an aesthetic vibe and I constantly find myself taking pictures of the drinks. Overall, if you want a place to study or eat desserts, I would recommend sweet moment. However, someday it is really crowded and is hard to find some seat once in a while. Extra : all the workers are also super friendly!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-02-26,3.0,"Okay so this place has by far has the best latte art I have ever seen, seriously in my entire life- well in person googling latte art doesn't count! 

It is unbelievable to me what they can do to decorate your coffee a definite must visit, especially great for a date day or a girls brunch!

So because the latte art is a definite plus it is only fare that I list my cons for this place:

1) Customer service not super great- I definitely felt that my questions, excuse me my 1 question I asked, about a menu item was an irritant to her.

2) It's located in china town! Super cool if you're walking or taking the subway but a nightmare if you are driving and trying to find a parking spot that doesn't cost a million dollars per hour.

3) No free WiFi on the weekends! 

4) The building is small and the tables are small not a great place for a large group. 

5) Prices aren't that great! Only $5 for the cute lattes but it's the size of a sample cup. 

All in all I would definitely come back to this place. Despite all the cons have the cool variety of coffee flavors mixed with amazing art is worth the struggle to get over there."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-01-24,5.0,"Such a cute dessert shop in Chinatown, NY! It's a large spot so you're able to invite your friends to hangout; however, I've seen a couple of people treat it as a cafe and do their homework there. There are outlets in the back of the shop to charge laptop/phone. 

There's a large teddy bear and bench in the front of the store for cute instagramable photos! 

We got a cold milk tea with matcha whipped cream cream art, matcha cheesecake, melon bingsso and a nutella banana waffle. 

The cream art could be made either hot or cold. There are several whipped cream flavors such as, matcha, chocolate, red velvet or taro ($5). They offer numerous flavors of bingsso such as, chocolate oreo, mango cheesecake, strawberry, matcha cheesecake, black sesame red bean, tiramisu, melon and watermelon ($7). The waffles also come in other flavors such as,avocado ($12), fried egg and ham ($11),  fruits ($11), Nutella and banana ($9), matcha and strawberry ($10) and ice cream deluxe ($15)."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,"My first thought when I came here was that it was purely a place for instagram photos. After trying the desserts, my view of this place completely changed. I ordered both the large size of mango cheesecake bingsoo as well as the earl grey pudding. The bingsoo consisted of a tall pile of light and fluffy milk shaved ice topped with mango syrup, chucks of fresh mangos, ice cream and pieces of cheesecake on the side. This dessert is the perfect size to share and can easily be shared among 3-4 people. They are also nice enough to offer plastic sharing containers. I love that the desserts are not too sweet, which is perfect for my taste buds but they give you a side of condense milk to pour on top of the shaved ice as a option for those who have a bigger sweet tooth. 

I am normally not one to order pudding at a dessert shop but somehow decided to get it that day. The earl grey flavor is subtle and the texture of the pudding is very interesting and enjoyable. I was pretty impressed by everything I got here."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-01-31,4.0,"After dinner my friends and I decided to get dessert. The only dessert spot close to us and was open at the time was Sweet moment, and since I had this on my to try list in NY I had to come. 

We walk in and it's a fairly spacious spot, to the right of us had a birthday celebration going on for a BTS member by a few fans. That was cool. We were looking through the menu and my friend suggested that we try the matcha black sesame shaved ice. We had 4 people so we ordered the large matcha black sesame and a small melon shaved ice. 

Oh man, now when I say that the desserts here are super aesthetic, they are SUPER aesthetic. I automatically whipped my phone out with a flick of the wrist as a reflex without even realizing it. 

The matcha black sesame shaved ice came in a mountain and plopped on top  was matcha ice cream. The shaved ice was smooth and didn't taste like normal shaved ice, where the texture tasted coarse, it was legit smooth. The house made black sesame syrup/sauce complimented the matcha so well and it just created a see-saw on my palatte, everything just seemed to balance out. 

The small melon shaved ice came in a plastic cup, but still looked and tasted delicious. There were honeydew melon balls scattered all over the shaved ice and also had melon ice cream as well, similar to the melona ice cream bars. The honeydew ice cream and shaved ice was so fragrant that it kind of just made me want to make an air freshener of the scent and put it in my car. My friend even said that this was now her top spot for dessert/shaved ice in New York. I highly recommend this spot for a nice and quiet sit down dessert spot with a group of friends or even for a date!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-03-06,5.0,"I came here for the Latte art! This had been popping up in my IG feed for quite some time so I knew I had to make it at some point.  After somehow ending up on canal street I knew my opportunity had come.  I was surprised at how spacious the place is, considering its NYC.  They have various versions of latte art that you can choose from but I chose Thai tea since I love it and the adorable sample on display fully convinced me.  It was good but I think its safe to say that had it not been for the latte art, I could of easily gone somewhere else.  I also noticed a lot of people ordering the shaved ice cream but those were huge, you definitely need a group to share that.  I would definitely stop by again to try their other latte art... I mean treats!."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-05-28,5.0,"Sweet Moment is a great desert and drink spot that is very cozy and is a nice place to enjoy something sweet while getting work done. There is so much seating despite not being a very big desert spot, but is very roomie. The service there is really great, they made the ice cream way faster than expected, they had a huge arrangement of ice cream choices (traditional flavors and experimental flavors). I highly recommend coming here."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-12-01,5.0,"Came here to treat me and my Yelp friend to desserts. I really wanted an insta worthy latte pic tbh. Lol. 
I went for the red velvet latte and my friend went for the matcha latte. Just as a note, the drinks are served cold (they have to be in order for the art to show). It's not ice cold but it's cold. Since it was kind of stuffy and humid inside, I felt it was appropriate. 
Another must try is their fruit toast. It's a lot, so be careful as it might be hard to finish. The toast was nice and warm. Highly recommend."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,"Such a cute shop with so many choices. I wish I had come here for brunch! Their waffles look so delicious (sweet and savory) and the art on their lattes is adorable. There's lots of seating and a restroom inside. My group of 6 shared a mango bingsoo tower and it was very tasty. Sweet, light, and refreshing, it was the perfect midday treat. I will definitely come back here for more bingsoo and to try the waffles."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-10-14,5.0,"Better late than never. Can't believe I actually forgot to write up a review on this sweet, sweet haven in NYC!

I visited this place during my last stop to New York. If I remember correctly, this place was located in sort of a cross-section of Chinatown/Little Italy. Anyway, I HAD to do a late review (than never) because this was seriously one of the best desserts I've ever had IN MY LIFE...EPIC, you can say (just check out the pic)!

O-M-G...no words even! As amazing as it looked, it tasted even better!!

This place had such an INCREDIBLE menu of Never-Seen desserts. Truly one of the best dessert places I've ever encountered!

Thank you for this heavenly treat...I'll never forget it!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-11-07,4.0,"I really like this cafe - modern, yet cozy with a decent amount of seating for people to get some work done (free wifi only provided on weekdays). 

I got their signature taro cream with coffee. While the art was really cute, the drink portion was pretty tiny and I felt it tasted like melted ice cream - crazy sweet! So I was a bit bummed on the drink, but I suppose you are paying for the art primarily.

The tiramisu shaved ice was wonderful though. It had the delicious coffee and chocolate flavor to it. I'm not usually a big fan of shaved ice, but I devoured it! I really recommend the tiramisu shaved ice - a must!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-10-10,5.0,"So I've been starting this place for about two years on Instagram. I was definitely kicking myself because I found about this place a month after I got back from New York and I knew that the next time I was back in New York that I was finally going to check them out. 

I finally got to try them out and oh my it was good. There's actually two photos I took of our matcha lattes because the guys making the drinks were competing to see who latte art came out the best for our matcha lattes. It was hard to decided because they both came out amazing. As soon as I finished my matcha latte I went and order a taro latte which is made with cold milk. Even though I was full from my first drink and I wasn't sure if I liked taro, I was determined to get myself a latte with a couple little animal design on it. It was so worth it."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-12-01,5.0,"One of the most picturesque dessert cafes between Chinatown and Little Italy, Sweet Moment is the place to be if you are looking for some creative desserts and a fun place to hang out with friends. The staff is super friendly and the prices are somewhat affordable. Their desserts are all very expertly made and look almost too pretty to eat! This place is especially known for its Bingsoo, a popular Korean shaved ice dessert with various toppings on it. We got the matcha cheesecake Bingsoo which was AMAZING (see picture). Get a big size if you are with friends and family and are looking to share. Overall, an amazing place to chill after a full day of exploring Chinatown and Little Italy!

Overall: 
Dessert: 10/10
Service: 9/10
Price: 8/10
Environment: 10/10"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-02-14,4.0,"First time here and I ordered the caramel shaved ice. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of it. I was sharing it with two other people and it was more than enough. 
The actual shaved ice was good but not amazing. I liked the mochi and cheesecake bits but I just wish the caramel shaved ice had more caramel, especially in the middle 
The ambiance is aesthetic and chill. Great place to go with friends after dinner. 
Overall I wasnt amazed but I would want to come here one more time to try their melon shaved ice or something else, maybe one of their cute drinks."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-09-06,5.0,"Best korean shaved ice!
Their flavor taste super fresh, not like some place has artificial taste.
And the way they present there shaved ice is super cute. Good spot to hang with couple of friend.
I tried most all their flavor, and everything taste amazing! 
I like mango cheesecake and matcha sesame and melon most so far!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-02-28,5.0,"The space is pretty large, clean, and very cute inside! For those people who love to post on social media there are two good backdrops for pictures. 

The baristas were friendly. I got a Black coffee. It was good quality coffee! Great for groups."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-08-18,5.0,"Omg this place is honestly one of the cutest dessert places in Chinatown. Look how cute the drinks are!! But I honestly don't recommend because it comes in a tiny cup and the drinks were just okay - cute for the ig though. 

What was a true top seller here for us was the melon parfait. OMG it is truly heaven in a cup. It was big enough for my boyfriend and I to share and every bite just melted in your mouth. If you are a huge honeydew fan you must get this! (Reminds me of Melona actually). 

You have to come and try this! There is enough seating so you could do some work here or just hang out with friends. If it weren't so far, I honestly would be here every day.

Ambience: 5/5
Desserts: 4/5"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-05-23,5.0,This is my go to dessert spot. One of my favorite!! My friends and I love it here. We always come for their bingsoo. The environment is very nice and staffs are very friendly. You can easily get some work done here while enjoying your dessert or a cup of coffee. Sweet moment also has really cute designs on their lattes.
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-02-11,5.0,"Really cute cafe hidden on hustling bustling Mott street. They sell variety of latte like red velvet, tiramisu, black sesame, green tea. They also have bubbly drinks, bubble teas, fruit teas, etc. Foodwise, korean style bingsoos, waffles and also they have cake slices and banana pudding to pick up as well. 

The area is surprisingly big and quiet. A great place to catch up over decent coffee and desserts. Friendly staff as well. Would love to be back for shaved ice and waffles next time."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-02-17,5.0,"If you love shaked ice, go to sweet moment! We specifically came here for the bingsoo (shaved ice dessert with condensed milk). They have a whole menu on which bingsoo you want: mango, ube, watermelon...) so many options. We ordered the mango bingsoo tower. It was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. The ice was shaved so thinly you didn't have to hurt your teeth crunching on the ice & the condensed milk was a good balance to add some sweetness."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-08-17,5.0,"The seats are a little uncomfortable but that doesn't stop me from giving this place 5 stars! First, thank you, thank you for making MILK TEA cream art. I don't drink coffee so I always had FOMO whenever I saw latte art. But with milk tea as the base here, it's a different story. 

There's plenty of flavors for the milk tea. I chose Thai milk tea and the taste was so unique! When I think of milk tea, I automatically think of a warm drink or a cold drink with a lot of ice. So I was surprised that the milk tea was cold with no ice! What in the world lol. The cream art made the consistency of the top layer kind of thick so that was interesting too. The Thai milk teas I've tried are usually very sweet, but that was not the case for the one here which I thought was great. I would definitely want to try the other flavors because not only is the concept pretty dope but it also tasted great! 

Their bingsoos on a plate are HUGE. You can honestly share it with 4 people and still be very full from it. I tried the Matcha and Cheesecake bingsoo (Milk Shaved Ice, Matcha Sauce, Red Bean, Rice Cake, Cheesecake pieces, Greentea icecream, White Chocolate) on a plate. The ice was made to perfection: soft and creamy. The whole combination was better than I thought."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-02-11,3.0,Nice place for a cup of latte and desserts. It's a good lounge spot with groups of friends.
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-07-02,4.0,"Cute latte art and yummy bingsoo - with everything being picture worthy??? This place practically screamed my name as I was researching for places to visit during my NY trip. 

Stopped by on a chilly afternoon and was surprised to see how spacious and cozy it was inside. There are a good amount of tables, perfect for catching up with work or friends. I really like the diversity of the customers, you have the millennials who are taking 347943238 pictures (current me) and the chinese grandmas from the neighborhood (future me). 

Moving on to the food/drinks: 
- Creamart Lattes: the cutest drinks ever... I am a sucker for cute animals and lattes. The cute art only comes in the cold drink. If you order a ""___whatever flavor__ latte"", it will come hot by default and have no cute animals on it. How do I know? because it happened to me, and I ordered and paid for another drink just so I could try it. No regrets. I got the taro flavor and enjoyed it very much. 

- Mango Cheesecake Bingsoo: Not the best I've had, but it was still pretty good! The shave ice was denser than I would prefer, but the mangoes and the cheesecake bites were excellent toppings!

Overall, I am super impressed with this cafe. The taste lives up to the aesthetics. If I lived in NYC, this would be my go-to coffee shop!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-01-23,5.0,"Sweet Moment is another really cute dessert café in NYC. Located in Chinatown, this place is usually really busy, so coming here with large groups may be an issue. The space is rather tight and can be difficult to manuever through. HOWEVER, the desserts are totally worth it! My dessert was simply towering and had so many flavors and textures with little goodies of all kinds hidden within. They had real fruit, mochi, shortbread, a thin wafer layer, and more! The $18 price tag did initially scare me (this place ain't cheap), but I left satisfied. This is a cute date spot. Would recommend!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-08-08,5.0,"tldr: good bingsu, good drinks, good atmosphere

This place is everything you expect out of a dessert place. The desserts are good, the atmosphere is cute and calm, and the service is great. The following is what we got

Mango Cheesecake Shaved Ice: 5/5, the ice was very milky, but a little hard on the inside. In all it's very sweet and the mango contrasts well with the sourness. Don't get this if you dont like sweet things! The mochi and the cheesecake that came with were pretty standard.

Thai tea: 4/5, it comes with a really cute face drawn on top of the sea foam. It wasnt very sweet, which I liked, but if you do keep that in mind.

All in all a great place. A little nitpick would be that the lighting could be better."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-08-04,5.0,"One word - BINGSOO.
I get the mango cheesecake pretty much religiously every time. They make cute art on the Late and other fancy drinks lol
I'd recommend trying different types of bingsoo and their various types of coffee; chill and work here or hangout with your friends."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-09-20,4.0,"Honestly came here just for the latte art. 

We got the matcha and red velvet which, surprisingly, were pretty good. They're really pricey though at ~$5 each for a small cup but I guess that's what you have to pay to get that instagram shot. Super cute for sure but wouldn't come back for it.

Also grabbed the banana pudding which was super tasty - highly recommend!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-12-31,3.0,"Cute lattes, but be advised that they're cold! Not what I wanted, but anything for a cute picture, right?"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-05-31,5.0,"This is my favorite bingsoo place in Chinatown. I freaking love how aesthetic-pleasing this Cafe is. It is so pretty and is great for Instagram photos. I love coming here alone and with my friends. Their drink designs is so freaking cute! They draw these adorable designs on the drinks, they were so cute that I didn't want to drink it. However, a favorite of mine has to be the watermelon bingsoo (they'll definitely have this in the summer, but other times, I don't think they sell it). I love coming here on a hot summer day and just devour the bingsoo. Their mango and cheesecake bingsoo is really good as well."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-08-30,4.0,"Sweet moment is a fun place to hangout and grab some dessert! All the desserts are so pretty and tasty too! Definitely recommend getting the larger size as oppose to the small if you want a ""instagram- able"" pic.
The only downside is that it can get pricey if you try several flavors!

1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-01-05,3.0,"Finally got a chance to try this place and unfortunately was left disappointed. 

I was unsure what to order so I asked the guy behind the counter for a suggestion. He said the black sesame latte was great and full of black sesame flavor. Perfect! I LOVE black sesame anything and love when it's extra flavorful. Unfortunately, the latte was just very underwhelming, too milky and with only a hint of black sesame flavor :(

I'll give this spot another chance someday but will try something else."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-01-20,5.0,Good place to drink a cup of tea or indulge in XXX dessert because the bingsoo here or Korean shaved ice is amazeballs. I tried the mango and cheesecake bingsoo and i was just like wow this is good. The mango is chunky and sweet. Plus there's a lot of mango pieces! It also has cereal on it too so you can get that crunch with the sweet shaved ice. They also put mini cheesecake bites! I mean the size of that is enormous and I needed another person to help me finish it before it starts melting. The interior is a cute cafe with outlets available on the bottom for people that wanted to do some work or charge their phones. They have one bathroom with a heavy duty door where the key is near the front.
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-06-30,5.0,"Milk shaved ice cream! That is the one thing you should try from here. I never liked shaved ice till I tried it here. I went with melon milk shaved ice. It had real melon, shaved ice and other goodies like gummy pieces and wafer stick. Overall that was the best shaved ice I ever had.

I also tried the taro latte. Surprisingly it was only available in cold version. And it was not sweet. It was ok. It had a nice art drawn on top. But I would say you can skip this."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-01-09,3.0,The desserts and lattes are aesthetically pleasing but way overpriced. I ordered a matcha latte which is cold by the way is roughly 4 oz for $5.50 but the cute latte art kind of makes up for it. The also have a photo album of their menu of desserts so that makes it easier to order. I want to note that not all beverages come with latte art. My friend got earl gray tea with milk and it just came in a regular to go cup. I'm guessing whatever is on the latte art menu is the only choices. I'll come back some other time to try out their desserts.
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2020-01-01,4.0,"One of my favorite places for dessert in Manhattan. They have a variety of bingsoos which I've been very satisfied with. My personal favorite is their matcha and cheesecake bingsoo. The cheesecakes are in tiny, bite sized chunks that I was wary about at first but actually made the bingsoo infinitely tastier. They are also well-known for their special drinks that have cute, cream-made designs.

The space itself is great for small group gatherings. Cozy, and moderately/dimly-lit. I take my 8-year-old-nephew here for dessert when we have dinner in Chinatown and he loves it so I guess kid-approved, too!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-04-30,5.0,"Lately, I've been skeptical about ""Instagrammable"" desserts. I've had many desserts that looked good, but didn't taste so good. This is one of the few places where the desserts look as good as they taste.

Taro Creamart- Yes, it's a small cup, but I think it's worth it. They ask if you want milk tea or coffee, I asked for milk tea. The artwork was so adorable, and it tasted good too. I'm usually not a fan of strong taro taste, but this was light and tasty. Don't forget to stir in the cream before drinking! ($5)

Melon Shaved Ice- Wow, this was one of the best desserts I've ever had. It was a very generous portion size. I love that it was the perfect amount of sweetness, not too sweet. The shaved ice was so delicate and smooth with a light honeydew taste. While eating it, I found some nice surprises, like jelly and mochi. The honeydew balls were a bit too cold for my sensitive teeth, but they were perfectly ripe. ($8)

This place is not just for looks!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-05-08,5.0,"After seeing a buzzfeed video of this location, I had to just go there and try it myself. When you first walk in there's a bench and the name of the store, perfect for photos. Do know that this location is all about cute photo worthy items. That's we did for a good thirty mins. 

We ordered their cream art drinks. Those are a cold drink with a milk foam top. Depending on what color the milk foam is it is the flavor. I got the matcha drink with a milk tea base. They have some really cute drawings on top of it. 

To share we ordered a large bing soo. We got the watermelon one. It is a seasonal order, as long as the watermelon is in season it will be available. They serve these type of dessert, with shaved ice, a layer of mochi and jelly, watermelon balls, and cotton candy ice cream.

Very refreshing and I can see why it gets so busy here during the weekend. If possible I recommend coming here during the week."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-05-31,4.0,"Came to this place late at night on memorial day weekend not long before they closed.
The inside has a rustic look, which in my opinion doesn't work with this kind of establishment and their layout of seating. The rustic look kinda makes the place look a bit dirty. The overall inside space is big but again the front seating area is crowded and weird. The seating in the back is better and a bit more comfortable as it's a cushioned couch.

I initially wanted to get the watermelon bingso but it was unfortunately out. The next best option to me was the melon bingso. The pricing for it I felt mixed cause it was $19 and didn't know exactly what I was getting. This is a novelty dessert.

My friend and I waited a few minutes for this thing to be made. When they called our name, I picked up melon bingso and was pretty amazed at how well they put this thing together. At the top is a macaroon stuck in a scoop of bubblegum ice cream, balls of melon around the shaved ice mixed with ice cream and jellies, with a small plastic cup of condensed milk. The melon bingso tasted great and was more than enough to easily feed 3-4 people but finished it between my friend and I."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-07-22,5.0,"Bookmarked this place for a while and was finally able to come!!

Cute cafe got a respite from the heat, seems like a good place to catch up and regain your strength with cold treats.

Melon bingsoo
$8 for small - balls of honeydew on top of honeydew ice cream shaved ice with jellies in the middle. 
Sadly the honeydew was not cold not sweet, but eating it with the shaved ice (or the vanilla ice cream on top!) solves the problem. The shaved ice cream was So. Good. It was shaved so finely it was like fresh snow, oh so refreshing when outside feels over 100 degrees. 
The jellies provide a different texture that is welcome.

Would come back to try the green tea and mango flavors!!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-07-22,3.0,"Came here for the adorable latte art. Service was not rude but not very friendly either. There's a bathroom for customers and you need to ask for the key. 

I got the waffle with avocado, tomatoes, and mustard. It originally comes with ham but I got it without meat. It was ok. Pretty simple. 

I also got the latte art obviously. Here's how it works. You choose a base of either milk tea or coffee. Then a cream option on top, either chocolate, red velvet, Thai tea, I think some sort of green tea, and one more option. Then they use chocolate syrup to hand paint the adorable picture on top. I got the Thai milk tea option. First of all, note that it's cold. Second of all, I did not like the flavor very much. Presumably my issue was with the Thai tea topping. Maybe the other toppings are better. 

So in conclusion, taste wise I wouldn't come back but if somebody wants a cute tea or coffee then it's a good spot."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-05-06,4.0,"Wanted to see what all the hype was about so I stopped by here when I was close-by. Inside is a nice, small and cozy space bustling with customers. I barely managed to find a seat and then went up to order one of the famous latte art drinks. Unfortunately, they didn't have non-dairy options so I ended up just getting a regular taro latte with almond milk. It was nice and sweet and I was able to get some work done.

If you're looking for a quiet place to study though, this isn't the place. It's a good place to come with friends to grab a latte and catch up though! :)"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-11-25,4.0,"This place is adorable. It is very roomy and easy to find a good spot to sit and chat. The place was quiet so it was easy to talk. The latte was super cute and the taste was good, but the only thing was how small the size of the latte was for the price"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-10-14,3.0,"Came here for dessert the other day. Nestled in the heart of Chinatown it's a good spot for sweets and catching up with friends. There is a good variety of desserts and snacks from bingsoo to other sweets like waffles etc. 

Pricepoint is on the high side. 
$8 for a cup of bingsoo which is really not all bingsoo but rather bingsoo mixed with ice cream and all the bells and whistles. $16 for the large. 
I don't mind the price but you don't quite get what you're paying for. I have no problem paying $16 for a really good bingsoo which I have in the past but I prefer for it to be just bingsoo without the ice cream and stuff. It takes away from the original. concept of the bingsoo. 

Strawberry Bingsoo. Average. I've definitely had way better. Minus the ice cream. On the sweeter side. 

Chocolate Oreo Bingsoo. Better than I expected. There was decent mishmash of textures going on there. Between Oreo bits and brownie bits. Not super sweet which I did take note of. 

Texture was decent snow. But not enough snow for what I'm paying. It's mixed with ice cream which is a whole other experience altogether. I prefer if I'm ordering bingsoo to just get bingsoo and not a fusion of other stuff esp ice cream. 

Service was friendly but run by kids who are often chatting behind the curtains."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-06-17,5.0,"A rare instance where an Instagram worthy shop has food that might be more delicious than it is beautiful. Sweet Moment has beautiful modern rustic decor with variations of couches, stools, and high chairs, making it seem very open and spacious. It is a bit dark due to the dim lighting and dark wood colours, which may make it seem dirty, as other reviewers had mentioned, but I can confirm that it is fairly clean. Fair warning that everything is pricey, but it's good quality and also in Manhattan.

Bingsoo shaved ice should be your primary goal coming here. The ice is unlike traditional shaved ices where it is only composed of water, and also unlike the shaved cream of Snowdays where ice cream blocks are shaved. Instead, it's a creamy ice made of milk and sugar that's slightly most compactable and melts in your mouth quickly. Something that can easily stand alone without other ingredients.

The mango cheesecake is sure to please with fresh mangoes(can't vouch for times when mango is out of season, though). The cheesecake takes form in little chopped bits on the side, which seemed like an afterthought because it didn't contribute much to the overall dish, but more is better, so I won't complain.

The watermelon and melon bingsoos are good, but I feel like the fruit takes up real estate so that you have less ice, but if fruit is what you want, that's what you get. Sweet Potato with Taro bingsoo is a hit or miss, depending if you're a fan of the ube/sweet potato craze. If it's not something that you like or have experienced before, the flavour may not be for you.

Skip the iced -ade's (ex. mango-ade, lemonade). It's just syrup+seltzer, which is in no way worth $5. 

For the pictures, large bingsoo are what you want to go for - the smaller size is served in a plastic cup with much less flair. Or grab a cup of cream art drink(Choco, Matcha, Red Velvet, Taro, or Thai) in your choice of coffee or milk tea."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-04-05,5.0,"I was just in NYC for the weekend and all I wanted was shaved ice Taiwanese style. My bf was probably fed up with me but this was our third shaved iced place. It was also my favorite. I can't exactly say this is Taiwanese style but it was delicious. We ordered the large purple potato shaved ice and it was probably too much for both of us. It was very pretty and instagram-able much like the whole restaurant. There were layers of sweet potato shaved ice and a milky one between it. I initially didn't think it was shaved ice because it was so soft and smooth. There was a nice crunch layer of sweet potato chips which added a nice texture to the dish. Lastly it was topped with mint and sweet potato purée. It was a straight potato purée and I loved it. The dish wasn't too sweet and was served with condensed milk to make it sweeter. 

They have other cute drinks but I would come back for shaved ice. It's not cheap but what's cheap in nyc?"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-11-07,3.0,"This dessert spot is located near Little Italy, and offers quite a variety of sweets. It was a little late for us, and we just had a really big meal so we decided to get one small dessert to share. We got their small red bean bingsoo for $8, and found it to be quite expensive for what we paid for. It had ice, red bean, mochi, a waffle crisp, and some corn flakes for texture. It also had blueberries, which I found strange because I didn't think it enhanced the dessert, and thought it didn't mix well with the rest of the flavors. I didn't leave loving this dessert. Perhaps next time, I'll try a different flavor or a different dessert all together."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-10-18,4.0,"I am so stunned by my amazing experience, here!

This dessert spot piqued my interest after stumbling upon their adorable, cold cream art drinks in which I ordered the chocolate cream art. It tasted delectably delicious and so momentously different from other dessert drinks I have tried; I would totally come back just for this!

My friends tried out the bingsoo, in which it was tasty, but not mind-blowing compared to other bingsoo we have had from other places. However, the aesthetic and unique menu items are unmatchable in comparison to a copious amount of neighboring dessert shops. Additionally, the interior lighting was a bit dark, but the busy + bustling atmosphere made it more comfortable. Overall, this is such a cute place to take pictures at and to enjoy irrevocably flavorful dessert in! Highly recommend!!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-05-24,4.0,"I had no idea that Caffe Bene had closed and was now Sweet Moment. My mom told me about it after she had visited with some friends for a post-dinner treat. She also picked me up a chicken avocado salad waffle one night and I thought it was super tasty. The chicken was very juicy and I really liked that they mashed the avocado into the salad instead of just layering some sliced avocado on top. 

I finally stepped in to try one of their cute lattes on a Tuesday afternoon. I had their Thai tea cold latte and it was SO cute!! Very Instagramable! It was pretty good, very thick and creamy. 

I am knocking off one star for the lackluster service at the counter. Barista was not very friendly when he came over to take our order. He seemed annoyed that we were there - forcing him to stop chatting with his friends who were hanging out by the other end of the counter. There was another barista who actually made our drinks and she was much nicer."
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-11-05,5.0,"I'm surprised at how good this place was!!! Trust the good reviews, their shaved ice was delicious, especially the black sesame one. It came with red bean, cereal flakes and mochi. The ambience of the shop was very chill and laid back. They had many tables for people who come by for coffee and to work, and provided water. Price range was definitely acceptable for how delicious it was!!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-11-23,5.0,"One of my two favorite places to go for treats! I got the Melon Bingsoo, OMG!! Not only is it instagram worthy, but it was the perfect mix of creamy shaved ice and fresh honeydew melon [honeydew is my favorite fruit when it comes to asian treats]. It was perfect, not too sweet and includes lychee and mixed fruit jelly. In addition to Bingsoo, they also serve waffles and lattes. Below, you can see my taro flavored cream art. It's served cold, not your conventional drink, but adorable in presentation and delicious!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-03-10,3.0,"Not sure why reviews are so good. This place has nothing special, just overpriced everything. $8 for a cup of mango ""cheesecake"" which was not bad but was not good either. The salmon and avocado waffle was not tasty at all. They put the tiny piece of salmon on the huge waffle. No, thank you. I would not come back. Also place is pretty dirty, not a pleasant place to spend time. I think there are way better places around for the same price. 
In my cheesecake there was mostly shaved ice which is way too expensive for shaved ice. Also the wait is very long. They take forever to call you for food. For those money and you have to bring food to your table and drop dirty plates. I understand McDonalds does it, they have $1 menu. They are cheap place. This place have to have person cleaning tables and removing dirty plates. Overpriced!"
1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-02-25,4.0,"Dude their tiramisu bingsoo was so bomb I could not. The perfect amount of ice and cream and brownie + tiramisu YAAAS MY HEART!!

Some seating in back.

MANGO & CHEESECAKE ($16): We got the entire plate as you can see in some of these photos here on Yelp. What's in it? Milk Shaved Ice, Fresh Mango, Rice Cake, Cereal, Vanilla Ice Cream, Cheese Cake, Condensed Milk. The best part? The condensed milk puts everything together so well. 

Is it worth $16? I wish this was around $12 but I guess that's NYC for ya."

1,sweet-moment-new-york,2019-05-01,4.0,"A cafe with nice ambience. Pretty lights and decor all around. A good place to study in or to hang with friends. 
They have a variety of bingsoo and waffles to choose from, as well as latte flavors. 

You can change the sweetness levels on the latte. I got half sugar on the black sesame, which I thought was perfect. Not too sweet, nor too bland. 

I also got the Nutella strawberry waffle, which came with chocolate ice cream but you are free to change the flavor to vanilla, strawberry, and green tea. It was a lil too sweet for me, but I mean, that's kinda expected of a dessert. The waffle was really soft and easy to cut into. I just wish the strawberry was served cold, as it was pretty warm. Also came with small chocolate curls and bite sized brownies, and topped with Nutella. 

The restroom by the back is kept pretty clean, and has a full length mirror for those who need em. 
The WiFi can be quite slow and is only available Mon-Thurs."

There was condensed milk to pour over it with little squares of cheesecakes on the bottom. Topped with a scope of vanilla ice cream, bits of mango and mochi were in between two cylindrical shaped halves of cheesecake flavored shave ice. Would definitely come back to try the other flavors."
2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2020-04-29,5.0,"One or two of Kam Hing's tze bao dan gou (literally ""paper-wrapped cakes"" in Cantonese) accompanied by a cup of hot tea is an almost perfect way to start my day. I've frequented this place for the past few years and seen them move from their tiny, cramped little hole in the wall to their current, larger storefront right across the street.

These might not be the largest or best wrapped sponge cakes ever, but they're usually pretty moist and fluffy. Most importantly for me, Kam Hing's the only place I know that makes different flavors. Some are tastier and more true to their flavors (cappuccino, butterscotch, mint chocolate chip, green tea, Butterfinger) than others (strawberry, coconut) but they're all still pretty great at the end of the day.

I can't go back to eating the original ones now that Kam Hing has spoiled me with options."
2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2020-01-02,5.0,"Hands down the BEST sponge cakes in my life! 
Love love LOVEEEEE these sponge cakes. It tastes absolutely. amazing.

Prices have been increasing over the years as i remember it used to be 75cents per sponge cake. Now it is $1 per sponge cake. (Note: Talking about the original flavored sponge cakes) I usually buy a box (which has 12 sponge cakes) of the original flavor for $12. They have different flavors but I haven't tried them yet.

The sponge cakes are sweet and always hit the spot for me. They are moist and fluffy and it always leave me with such a happy feeling after I devour one. I always need to resist myself from eating more because do you know how many calories is in one sponge cake?!? (Honestly I have no idea but I can imagine ... it's a lot!)

I never sat down to eat there but the place is small and usually busy with people walking in and out. Will definitely come back to try their other flavors and even their drinks!"
2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2019-11-23,4.0,"I tried the original sponge cake ($1) and coconut sponge cake ($1.25) in small size for both. I was surprised at how soft and moist it was. The original sponge cake was eggy and felt like it would go perfect with a cup of coffee or milk. The coconut sponge cake was slightly sweeter and had generous bits of coconut pieces which I enjoyed a lot. With such an extremely affordable price, the quality of the sponge cake was superb 

I was really sad because we came around 6pm and most of the flavors were gone already even though it closes at 8pm. I wanted to try their green tea flavor but it was already sold out :( I recommend getting here earlier before all the popular flavors are gone. 

This place feels like a hole in the hall kind of place and it's pretty small with around 4-5 tables inside. I would definitely make a trip here next time to try their green tea and other flavors!

P.S. cash only"

(They have iced Vietnamese style coffee here, which I love, although I usually ask them to go light on the condensed milk.) I wasn't particularly hungry the first time I came in, but when I saw that all the seated customers were eating sponge cakes, I tried one and was hooked.

As a few people have mentioned, the flavors are very mild, but I like that about them. (The green tea and chocolate chip are my favorites.) I appreciate that the Chinese sponge cakes are lighter, less sickly sweet, and less greasy than most American and European baked goods. 

These are also literally the perfect thing to bring to the office for meetings/parties/general sharing- cheap, delicious, and easy to transport."

I saw people walking out with boxes of cake though so I continued to investigate. Hidden inside this unassumingly office building was an open area that first seemed like a cafeteria with benches of people eating lunch bento boxes. Then in the very back, it looked like a deli. There was a man standing behind the counter that was not Asian but I saw him speak Chinese to a customer. It is here that the sponge cakes were sold. There is original and different specialty flavors every day. The day I went there was green tea and chocolate chip. I thought the cakes were good but nothing spectacular."

The coconut flavored one had the dough mix a little sweeter and topped off with toasted coconut pieces for a little crunch and flavor that was pleasant.

The green tea sponge cake ($1.25 each) was both fluffy and moist, and it had a good amount of green tea flavor. The regular sponge cakes ($1 each) had a similarly wonderful texture. They were slightly less cakey than the green tea one, which made sense as, based on my experience, matcha makes baked goods a bit denser.

I took off a star because while I do think that the sponge cakes lived up to the sign outside, which proclaimed ""Best Sponge Cake In Town,"" they were smaller than standard sponge cakes.

In terms of the interior, there were anthropomorphized sponge cake cartoons on the wall and sassy signs that made Kam Hing a cute and interesting shop. However, the tables had some food on them and the bathroom was kind of gross."

However, you can probably skip the other items on the menu though as we also got the century egg congee and the steamed rice noodles which were both quite flavourless. 

The guy at the counter was nice and there was constantly customers coming through the door."
2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2019-03-29,5.0,"I've only been here for the sponge cake, and I don't see a reason to get anything else. I'm not really opposed to trying new things, but the sign outside says best sponge cakes in town, and nowhere else has given me any reason to doubt this claim yet. For less than a dollar, you can get a sponge cake that reminds me of your best memories of going to Chinatown (and waiting for your parents to finish grocery shopping...) and feeling that moment of true happiness when you get sponge cake from the bakery whose name you don't really know, but your mom does, which is good enough when you're a little kid. If you're still reading this but don't feel like you can relate to this oddly specific nostalgia, then great, come here to make new memories! 

Either way, come here and leave feeling a sense of comfort that these sponge cakes may stay in the dollar range even when every other price on the dollar menu gets eroded by inflation."

Look. I'm the biggest Chinese bakery fan. I could have it for breakfast, snacks, and dessert. 

But I am pretty confused by the hype over these sponge cakes. 

For $0.85 / $1.25 (plain / flavored), obviously this sponge cake is a good deal. But do you want to know how good a deal it is, or how good it actually is? I'm pretty sure the latter. Anyways, most of the Asian bakery in the area is super cheap. Price shouldn't much of a reason to sway you.

To me, Chinese bakery is a game of textures. Buns are delicate and pillowy. Cakes/rolls are soft yet slightly dense. These are the characteristics that come to mind when I think of Chinese bakery. Sponge cake should smooth and bouncy. Unfortunately this sponge cake tastes like a deflated, bready cake. I'm not sure what type of cake, but definitely not a sponge cake.

Was it good? BRUH. It's a loaf with chocolate chips. Of course it was good. But below my expectations, especially considering the reviews and articles. If you want something better, I'd get some cheap cakes from nearby spots like Fay Da or Tai Pan."

Green tea sponge cake was good, but my last choice."
2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2019-07-26,5.0,"My earliest memories of this shop was with my grandmother.  This was my weekend treat she would get for me after tutoring class.  Born in the mid 80's, I have been a fan of their ""boat cake"" since the original location across the street.  

I order the same combo... milk tea and original sponge cake just as my grandmother would order for me growing up.  In the recent years since their new location, they have added onto their menu additional flavors and food options.  But my number remains their original... it's not only a amazing combo, but brings warm memories my grandmother and I shared.

My family has moved away from New York, but we would still purchase boxes of these and either drive or fly them across States for the family whenever we have a chance to.

I just tried their honeydew flavor.  Melona honeydew in a spongecake form... yes please."

This hole in the wall coffee shop is just the most perfect and nice break from a busy day in the city. Do not expect anything fancy, it's super simple. When we arrive, they have a large TV showing an NFL game, tables with chairs and booth seating filled with people, and a small line to order the cakes.

There were multiple flavors to choose from and I decided to choose the matcha and original flavor. You can't go wrong with just a simple, vanilla flavored cake. They were both delicious and so easy to eat! THESE WERE THE BEST SPONGE CAKES I'VE EVER HAD! I can't wait to be back!!"

2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2018-10-21,5.0,"Overall - Truly the best sponge cakes in NYC

What I got - The sponge cake...all of them

Taste - I dont know how they do it but these sponge cakes come out full of flavor, soft, and plenty moist. I really couldn't imagine how these could be any better. They have many different flavors each better than the next. Chocolate chip, coconut, and plain. I've had the season pumpkin spice that was probably my favorite.

Value - Insanely cheap. 0.85c for the regular and $1.25 for the flavors. 

Service - Fast and friendly

Atmosphere - Hole in the wall, quiet and full of locals

Facility - tables with enough to fit maybe 15 people but most will likely take it to go.

Need to know - $15 credit card minimum

Would I come back - Yes

Would I go out of my way - Yes

Additional info - Although one is probably enough for breakfast I find that two is the perfect amount with a cup of coffee. 

The only regret I had after coming here is that now all other sponge cakes pale in comparison."

I was here for their sponge cake since both Yelp and my friend's mom agreed that they had the best in NYC.  It took 9 minutes for me to get from  my spot at the end of the line just inside the double door to having sponge cakes in hand.

They really were sponge cakes in hand as they fit the palm of my hand like a muffin top.  Those I've had before in Boston were taller, maybe 2-3x larger, so that was my comparison.  These were 75 cents each for the original flavor.

We sampled one immediately while it was still slightly warm and found it light and though well baked, it seemed rather custardy as we chewed.

The next day, my mom agreed with our assessment that it was somehow custardy, while my dad sensed some added flavor that he didn't appreciate.

Seems there's another new location now at 81 Bayard St where their sponge cakes are also available, though a bit less straight from the oven."

My friend told me a really interesting back story about how the owner got the recipe haha not sure if it is true. But the cakes are so yummy! Soft, not too sweet and extremely affordable. Whenever I come here I try to get a bunch to eat like almost 10; unfortunately you can't leave it for more than like 2 days or else it gets stale. They're my favorite cakes in Manhattan even though their size is more like a small fat eclair. They are cash only and the shop is kind of hole-in-the-wall-y or a little kitschy/vintage but their cake turnover is very fast and sometimes they sell out of the original =(. I have also tried some other flavors, I didn't like mint or coconut as much but I remember some of them are very faint (pandan? Strawberry?). I do think original is the best."

I'm not a fan of the famous coconut Tarts at all but the little doughy bread with the chocolate chips in it is wonderful. Really underrated actually. 

So it's all about the little sponge cake desserts. A lot of people said oh it's just like Wonder Bread well no it's really not. Maybe you don't have very developed taste buds, but the stuff is actually unique and delicious and made with a lot of love. 

The lovely young man who was friendly AF recommended that I try the legendary chocolate chip. There are many different flavors, but the chocolate chip is really the way to go. Definitely one of my favorite little secret treats in Chinatown and extremely unique. If there were 6 available, it would get 6 Stars. Hipsters need not apply.

I'm not sure if them getting 4-and-a-half stars ""Hing""-es on my rating, but in my opinion, this place should have 1,000 5-star reviews."

I stumbled in bleary-eyed at 6am after arriving in New York on an overnight bus and was greeted by two options: sponge cake and black coffee. I took both for a grand total of 1.70. I just need to shout out the guy working the front for being so friendly and patient so early in the morning.

Many more breakfast options are available as the bakery/cafe shifts into gear and as Chinatown roars to life. I sat in the cafe for a while and watched nurses, doctors, policemen, and old Cantonese guys roll through here, in that order. 

The coffee is your typical diner fare: black, bitter, no ""taste notes"" to mention unless ""time-to-get-yo-ass-up"" counts.
The sponge cake holds up to their Best in Chinatown claim. A crispy outside and a ridiculously moist interior as if some sort of heavenly elixir was mixed into the dough. 10/10 would recommend and will be back to try the rest of their offerings."

I'm happy to say that although they have expanded throughout the years, the sponge cakes remain affordable and their quality and flavor hasn't changed except for the additions of new flavors.

PS. Be sure to buy a few when you're here cause you won't be able to stop yourself after eating just one!"

2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2018-08-15,5.0,"Your trip through NYC Chinatown is not complete unless you make a stop at Kam Hing to try the sponge cakes.  There is rarely a wait, the sponge cakes are some of the cheapest munchies in the city, and you simply won't be disappointed. 

Based on the small sign hanging denoting the location hanging above the door, I suspect Kam Hing has been here for decades, as the food blog articles alone go back nearly a decade singing its praises.  Kam Hing prides itself on having the ""best sponge cakes in town,"" which is no exaggeration.  Don't be intimidated by the location; it is on the bottom floor of an office building.  Just walk straight through the door and past the elevator on your left and you'll be standing in Kam Hing.  

The interior is sparsely decorated with kitschy signs reminiscent of those sold by the street vendors on the sidewalk, such as ""complaint button (with a mouse trap hanging below)""; ""This isn't Berger King, you get it my way or no way,""; and ""We Don't Call 911,"" above a picture of a revolver (I don't know about this one...).  Otherwise, there are folding tables and chairs for your to sit and enjoy your coffee and sponge cake. 

The sponge cakes themselves are simply amazing at $.85 (plain) and $1.25 (flavored) a piece.  Moist, egg-y, fluffy, and not too sweet, the cakes are reminiscent of angel food cake.   I usually grab one of each flavor that is available, with my favorite being the matcha, which does not have the bitterness occasionally associated with other green tea products.  Be sure to get there somewhat earlier in the day, as they'll sell out of the crowd favorites by the afternoon. 

Other desserts and pastries are available, though I have not tried many.  I got a box of the almond cookies, which were comparably cheap, but they did not stand out compared to their legendary cakes."

We got a hot milk tea and original sponge cake, and brought maple and cappuccino flavors to go for my mom. My friend and I luckily got the sponge cake warm and fresh because it was just baked. We ate a huge meal previously but I just gobbled the sponge cake in less than 5 minutes. It was beautifully warm, also moist and fluffy on the inside but lightly crisp on the outside. It was light to eat which was perfect on my already full stomach. I absolutely love this place now and my mom wants more. Only cons I guess was that the tea wasn't sweet for my tastes and it could be cramped here, but I freaking love these sponge cakes so it's okay. Looking forward to coming back."
2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2018-07-24,5.0,"Hands down the best sponge cake you'll bite into NYC. 75 cents for the original flavor, and 1.25 for other flavors. Most flavors tend to run out by evening time, however the original tastes the best IMO and is the cheapest.

Flavor rankings:
1. coconut - toasty and goes great with coffee
2. original - IT'S SO FLUFFY I CAN DIE.
3. chocolate - generous amts of chocolate that are still soft and semi-melted when you bite into it
4. matcha - my usual favorite flavor, however the fluffiness of the cake is lost in this sponge cake. not sure if the matcha messed too much with the recipe.

15 dollar credit card min, and you know you're in the right spot when you see all the asian grannies and gramps lounging around enjoying their cakes!"

She said she has been coming to this particular bakery for this since the beginning of time, and it is the best shop for this. I never knew what I was missing! This is amazing! There aren't even words to describe how they have made something so humble as a sponge cake into a thing of wonder! I must come back!"
2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2017-08-19,4.0,"Kam Hing has the BEST sponge cakes!!....and believe me, they are not ""just"" any sponge cake.  I know, I know, what's the big deal about ""sponge cake"", right?!?!  Well, you're going to have to just go there and try them yourself!  They are so eggy, light and silky smooth....and TASTY!!  You simply can't just have one...treat yourself and have at least two!  :)   These are so good that my relatives from California always makes sure to reserve two dozen of them to take home with them.  I used to go to the old location, which was a tiny tiny place.  They have moved to a bizarre location across the street with actual tables where you can sit. (The other place was more of a takeout place with not a lot of places to sit and enjoy).  The new location is not quite so obvious, so when you go, make sure to copy down their address...they're kinda on the ground level of an office building. 

The original sponge cake remains my absolute favorite.  However, they've expanded and have different flavors now:  green tea, chocolate chip, butterscotch, carmel...the list goes on and on.  When I went there the other night, it was around 7pm, and they ran out of the original flavor!!!!  (Hence, only 4 stars!)  DAMN!!!!  I was drooling for them.  Well, we opted to try their choc chip and butterscotch.  I was really weary about the butterscotch because I generally don't like overly sweet desserts.  Well....the butterscotch was actually not TOO sweet and it had the light airy texture I like in the original flavor.  The choc chip was good but had a much more dense texture.  Still good, but in a different way.  

So while we were there, we saw a fresh batch of almond cookies come right out of the oven....well, we have so self-control and just HAD TO try them! hahaha....it did NOT disappoint....it was sooooo good!   What a treat!

Btw, prices vary.  The original sponge cake is 75 cents, while the flavored ones are $1.25; and the big almond cookie is 75 cents.

I'll have to make a point to go earlier next time, so that I can get there before they run out of the original sponge cakes.  Also, if you know you're going to show up late, you can call ahead and reserve some to guarantee that they will be there waiting for you.  Staff at Kam Hing is super nice and friendly!  The guy that helped us (sorry, didn't get his name), just reminded me of ""family"".   Cool!!"
2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2017-09-27,4.0,"This place is still my favorite for a couple of sponge cakes whenever I'm in the area. This little shop is VERY casual and Chinese. What I mean by that is since it's family owned, you will see their kids' toys and a table or two on the side where they put their belongings. At times, it's a super loud environment with kids yelling and playing and grandparents chatting away. I usually just grab and go (real fast). 

Besides the sponge cakes, I have not tried anything else but they have a lot of coffee selections and they also sell fish balls - good for quick lunch. 

The sponge cakes are $1 each, $1.25 for flavored ones. I would stick with the original because sometimes the other flavor takes a bit away the fluffiness. For example, the coconut actually has coconut pieces so the texture is not as good. However, green tea flavored is worth a try."

Not only are the sponge cakes delicious AND cheap, the people who work there are really nice, especially the man who I think is a manager (he is Spanish speaking). I put in a lot of big orders for events, and they're always so pleasant and accommodating. Plus it's very convenient that they take credit card (some places in Chinatown still don't, even for large orders).

I like these sponge cakes better than traditional Hong Kong-style ones, which I find are mostly air and can be a little dry. These are denser and moister, almost like a custard. The original and green tea flavors are very good, but the coconut doesn't taste much like coconut. I'd say green tea is my favorite."

Their original sponge cake is 75 cent (only!) . It is a less sweet, more substantial version of an angel food cake. Pairs especially well with a milk tea or coffee.

I came here on a Sunday afternoon and had to wait in line for 10 minutes before I can get my hands on their famous sponge cakes, While in line, I was able to peek into their kitchen where I saw their bakers moving trays of freshly baked sponge cakes.

The only downfall is that they're tiny.. but still very cheap!"
2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,2019-11-07,4.0,"This shop is still my go-to for coffee and sponge cakes. Prices are about the same as other coffee shops, but everything have gotten more expensive so it's expected.

The original spongecakes are still the best, it's more moist and fluffier than the flavored ones. Not sure if it's bc of the turnaround rate or the measurements in the ingredients differ. It's different compared to other Chinese sponge cakes, which probably use more yeast or has more air in the dough which makes it less dense and lighter. I like both versions, this one is inbetween a really light spongecake and a cake. 

I still like to get the flavored ones. They're not intense and concentrated as other American alternatives, but I think that it suits customers with a lighter pallette profile. They're less sweet, definitely less butter/oil/lard in them. I like the cappucino flavored spongecakes best, although I don't see them have that often. 

Also recently they installed a hot food buffet/lunch box station. 3 food with rice for $6. Probably amongst the cheapest around the area.

The food is affordable ofc aren't the best compared to actual restaurants in each respective dish, but they offer big portions of food for the price. You can split the meal for 2 meals depending if you're watching your calories or budget.

they have americanized staple Chinese food flavors that Americans like in one station, like sesame chicken, general tso's chicken, fried pork chops etc. and more traditional Chinese dishes in another station such as stewed pigs feet, soysauce chicken, fried whole fish, black bean fish, stir fried vegetables etc. I like both the Americanized and traditional Chinese dishes.

They sometimes change up a few of the traditional dishes, while the Americanized Chinese station is usually the same since those are popular 

Some of my own favorite dishes like curry chicken with potatoes which I think has a deeper taste compared to other csntonese style curry, sweet and sour fish that's sweet but has a deeper taste compared to similar versions, and fish with pumpkin which I think is interesting but I didn't get to try. These dishes aren't made often so I hope they bring these three dishes back more. 

They aren't the healthiest as most dishes have a good amount of oil, nor is it the best version of the Chinese dishes compared to other more expensive restaurants. If you are on a budget you can spend $6 for 2 meals and the food is pretty good for the price."

I was surprised to see that the Chinese workers there were not only really fluent in English, but also talking to each other in English! There is a huge flat screen TV in the eating area as well as a lot of chairs. There are a few game machines, but they are all not plugged in. 

This seems to be the place that all locals know about. I saw a business man all suited up come in and buying a spongecake and coffee to quickly scarf down. Boy, i've been missing out all these years! The spongecake was so light and fluffy. Not too sweet. Milk tea here is also very good. 

It was a little stuffy in here because the air conditioning wasn't on. But maybe that's just to make customers not linger around too long. The food here was great!"

Kam Hing is yet another gem of Chinatown! I know this place is not as ""hidden"" as other spots but I think stopping by is a must if you're in the area and want a sweet, light snack. I stopped by the Kam Hing on Baxter street and it's a little secluded, but a good location to get away from notorious crowds. You're greeted with a sign that says ""best sponge cakes in New York"" and hope for the best that the sign is true. 

I went in on a Thursday evening and there was no wait, not sure what it'd be like during other times of day. They had run out of green tea, so I purchased two originals, one butterscotch, and one coffee sponge cake. The total came out to $4.20

I've tried the original so far and it was so delightful! There was a perfect combination of fluff and density, where the top part of the cake was so soft and light while the lower part had more substance. The weather in New York had been very temperamental so I was a little on edge, but consuming my sponge cake, delectable piece by delectable piece, put me at ease. This is definitely a spot I'll be taking friends who are visiting as well as returning multiple times in the future whenever I get that subtle sugar craving."

Returned here to try the rice rolls. Shared a small with a friend and it was a good amount (especially because it didn't taste too good so we didn't want to eat a lot of it anyway). Got the rice rolls with fish balls. Not freshly made but the fish balls were fine. The noodles/rice rolls were hard and there was barely enough sauce to cover half of the dish so it was bland and tasteless. I would ask for extra if you do end up trying it!

I saw one of the workers putting his hand in the trash can without gloves and without washing his hands after. Thinking of eating food served by people who do not follow proper hygiene rules grosses me out. Of course, it is Chinatown so it's probably not the worst tbh (ignorance is bliss)"

But man, are those spongecakes good. They're good and they cost only 1 buck (an extra 25 cents if you order one with flavor)! The spongecakes are very fluffy and moist and it was really good. If you can, I recommend eating it at the place instead of taking it out because its even better when the sponge cake is kind of hot and steam is coming out of it. 10/10"

The spongecake was just like how I remembered it from the East Bay Chinese Chinatown bakeries that I used to go to as a child. Kam Hing's are smaller, but just as fluffy and perfectly not-too-sweet (I don't have a sweet tooth but I do appreciate the occasional pastry). My only complaint about the spongecake was that the pastry paper was stuck to the cake so sometimes I'd find myself accidentally eating a piece of paper. I'm not sure if there is anyway to avoid this though in the baking process.

I also ordered the shrimp rice noodles, which were made fresh and had a springy texture. Wasn't a fan of the sesame peanut sauce (next time, I'd just get soy sauce if that's an option). 

The Ovaltine was great, a little powdery towards the bottom but otherwise, just how I like it: smooth, chocolaty, creamy. 

I loved the coffee. I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but for $0.85 a cup, what a treat. All I can describe is that it's got a ""full-body"", whatever that means. It's robust and does the job!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-05-27,5.0,"Outback steak house was the only Aussie restaurant that I knew until I found out this place. Ruby's is one of best brunch place in Manhattan. It is a cozzy place that is located on murberry street, and there is quite a line if you get there by noon. 
I visited there once a month (pre Covid 19) and had a lot of dishes from frequent visits. My best picks are Bronte burger and shrimp pasta featured by their sweet OJ. The burger is quite juicy served on Chiabata bread that is quite different from Shake Shack and Five Guys. The caveat is the sauce on the patties; strawberry jam and well blended with bun, patties, and cheese.  The Shrimp pasta is the bomb that shrimp does not have unpleasant smell and pasta sauce does not have any greasy taste. 
Overall, this place is as good as Friedmans and Sarrabeth and good for weekend brunch with colleagues or companions. I recommend Ruby's!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-05-04,5.0,"Amazing burgers! Do get the Bronte or Whaleys burger. Not your typical sesame or brioche bun; they use panini bread as their bun. A bit on the pricey side (Bronte: ~$16, Whaleys: ~$17) but once you bite into the burger, I guarantee you'll think ""Wow, worTH iT."" Quarantine Takeout Tip: order online on their website, and it'll take 20-25 min."

This is usually my go to spot to catch up quickly with my friend and we always order the truffle fries. If you don't order the fries did you really go to Ruby's ?

It's a very relaxed vibe and Australian inspired menu. I normally get the fried chicken sandwich but opted for a lighter dinner. My second go to is the chicken avocado salad. The salad is very refreshing with apples, walnuts and edible flowers.

Everything on the menu looks mouthwatering and I changed my mind 3 or 4 times before landing on the Blueys which was just the most delicious chicken sandwich I've had in a long time. I finished every bite. My boyfriend got the burger (not sure which one) and said it tasted more like meatloaf, but in a really good way. We were looking for something on the more affordable side and we unexpectedly found it here! He ordered fries with his and I stole more than he ate himself. The aolie they serve with the fries was so delicious, I actually put a bit on my chicken sandwich. 

The place is small and will feel pretty cramped if you go around a busy time, so you've been warned. They also don't have back to the chairs so if the coat racks are full you may end up wearing or holding all of your stuff like us, but it wouldn't keep me from coming back at all. The food was just that amazing. I've known about theri Murray Hill location for awhile but am so happy to have found out about this spot too! On my next visit, I'll be tackling the crab linguini..."

3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-03-06,5.0,"Took my bf here for his birthday and we were both very happy with the food! Ordered the bronte burger, ruby's ragu and shrimp pasta. We liked the pastas the best but the burger which was like a panini though because of the bread, everything was ON POINT! Ragu was flavorful and good amount of beef, noodles just right. The shrimp pasta was not as creamy which is good because neither of us like heavy like alfredo type pasta so it was just the right amount, tasted that garlic. Yes yes yes. Bronte was actually cooked medium rare like i asked since many places will make it medium so i tell them medium rare just in case. 

Place is pretty damn small, our table was close with another party which was fine. Wait time wasn't bad at 6pm but i know there was a line. Food came out fairly quickly and we scarffffed it down in 30min it was so good. We were scared 3 dishes would be too much but we were actually content. Can't wait to come again and try some other dishes out"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-25,5.0,"I LOVEEEE Ruby's!!!! Best sandwiches EVER! I came here for dinner on a Wednesday night around 7PM-8PM. The wait was around 20 minutes. The place is pretty small. 

I ordered the shrimp pasta and Bronte burgers with a side of fries. The shrimp pasta was creamy and delicious! There was a hint of spice to it as well. The flavors blended together very well. There were a good amount of shrimp on the dish and was it quite large. The burger was to die forrr! A must try. The side of fries had a truffle aioli dip. I love truffle fries! Try the burger with the truffle aioli. You will not regret it!"

It's a beautiful image, isn't it? Why imagine it when you can have it. I can't recommend Ruby's Cafe enough. Sure the line is long, but it is worth the wait.

Great thing with eating with friends is that you get to try more of the menu. To share, we got truffle fries which I highly recommend. Our orders included the shrimp pasta, lamb ragu, and crab linguine. Each dish had ample servings of their respective protein. Perfect bites each time. They were all delicious!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-01-07,5.0,"Came here on a Saturday around 3PM with a friend, and we had about a 30-45 minute wait. The food was amazing, and worth the wait!

I ordered the Chicken Avocado salad, my friend got the Green Eggs Bowl and we split some fries. Tip: they serve brunch until 4PM - something that we were both happy about! My salad tasted fresh and the presentation was beautiful - there were edible flowers that decorated the top. There was a surprisingly large amount of chicken and avocado on my salad, considering that most places skimp on the meat and avocado in salads. My friend said her eggs were cooked perfectly and she also enjoyed her meal. The fries were really good too. The portion was large, and each fry was crispy. The truffle aoili that came with it made us want to keep eating. 

This was actually one of the more affordable places that we visited during our stay, with both of our entrees coming out to be about $12-13. The only con that came to mind was the fact that the restaurant itself is a bit small. With both my friend and I carrying large jackets and shopping bags, it did feel a little cramped.

I can't recommend this place enough! The food is delicious, flavorful, and fresh."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-14,4.0,"Ooof, it is worth the wait. We were a table of four, and a friend who lived nearby put their name down. The wait took around 2 and a half hours. We were originally placed near the door, but it was really cold so we asked to wait for a table near the back. The place is really tiny, but because it was cold, the table placement made a difference.

We ordered the Ruby's ragu, crab linguine, brussel sprouts, shrimp pasta, and burger with sweet potatoes and truffle mayo. I can only attest to the first three dishes. The brussel sprouts were fried and exactly what you would want for lunch. The crab linguine was spicier than anticipated, and it was good, but my ruby's ragu was way better than the crab linguine and I wish I had more. Apparently when this place opened, their portions were larger and their waits were definitely not as along. I would try one of their other locations."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-01,5.0,"Really enjoyed our meal here at Ruby's for lunch! Their infamous truffle fries truly lived up to the hype. I would recommend ordering a side of this for the table to share. I really enjoyed the ragu pasta and shrimp spaghetti. The ragu had a lot of meat, the burrata was an excellent addition and it just tasted super comforting. The shrimp spaghetti had a good portion of shrimp and I love the garlic kick that comes in the flavor. The crab linguine was just okay to me, it tasted on the saltier side. 

The line is fairly long so I would recommend coming prepared for at least an hour ish wait especially if it's on a weekend. It's a super cute Aussie cafe and worth checking out!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-10-16,4.0,"Just went to Ruby's for the first time, and, as it reads here next to the four-star rating, ""Yay! I'm a fan.""

I went on a weekday at around 12:15pm, and we got a table no problem; within 15 minutes, there was a line out the door. On a weekday. In Soho. That speaks to how popular Ruby's is!

We both had salads -- mine was the Chicken Avocado salad, which was so fresh and delicious. It even looked pretty -- edible flowers on the top. Our server was delightful; didn't rush us at all, even when the line started forming. They have two spaces in Soho next to each other, so don't be discouraged by any interior photos that show it to be small; there are more seats than you think.

Definitely plan to return here to try other dishes!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-04,4.0,"I came in around 5:30pm with my cousin for a drink and a snack. We both had their Ruby's Spritz and split an order of sauteed brussel sprouts to nibble on. 

Service was friendly, if a bit absent-minded - they didn't bring a spoon for my cousin's tea with honey or plates for us to share the sprouts. They were very nice though, so it was fine. 

The sprouts were so good - flavorful with a slight char. 

I really appreciated that they use paper straws!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-10-12,4.0,"Have heard many people go to Ruby's and also have walked by many times! The place gives me strong trendy Cali vibes with a nice classy touch of NY. I was pleasantly surprised that on a Friday afternoon I only had to wait a few minutes for a table of 2. 

The interior really contributes to a laid back vibe - this makes a lot of sense since it's Australian 

Ordered the pesto pasta with chicken ($4 for added chicken isn't always fun) and really liked it! The textures were all on point (I like my pasta more al dente) and the flavor of the pesto was strong without feeling overpowering 

One star off mainly because it's not the most stand out food you'll get in the city and because prices are so so, for instance my friend got the beyond burger for $14 and it didn't come with any sides or additions"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-11-02,4.0,"This cute Aussie cafe boasts some great food with a warm ambiance.

5 visits and counting, and my trusty bronte burger never disappoints!!! It ventures slightly outside the norm with its ciabatta buns and sweet chili sauce, which I'm all for. The fries are also the really good kind with the crunchy little fried bits, you could eat them completely plain just fine. But with their diviiiiine truffle aioli which I don't recommend you leave the restaurant without trying, why would you?

What keeps this location from a solid 5 stars is the disconnect between the staff and customers. It seemed that for every step of the meal, we reentered a long cycle of waving and waiting.

All in all, one of my favorite casual dining spots in the city :-)"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-10-27,4.0,"Came here for the first time on a Saturday night; had to wait about 30 minutes but it went by pretty quickly. The layout of this restaurant is quite interesting. There are 2 sections of the restaurant but they're not connected on the inside - you have to go outside to go to the other part of the restaurant. Besides that, cute and trendy spot with cozy seating. 

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with truffle fries which were delicious! I was pleasantly surprised by this spot. I will say though, that service was kind of slow which might have to do with the fact that the waiter/waitress were also handling take out orders. Despite that, I will definitely come back to try their brunch that everyone else is raving about!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-08-29,4.0,"Great food. Great price. I ordered the chicken avocado which came with apple slices, which I thought was very unique and fun. But the entire salad--which came with a decent amount of chicken AND avocado, came to a total of only $13.50! The salad was really good and totally worth it. I'm definitely coming back to get another salad from here. 
My siblings ordered two sandwiches--the bronte burger and the Whaley. Both had a good amount of meat, again, for it's cheap price. But I will say the bottom bun for the Whaley was so soggy and unpleasant, I believe, came from the sauce. So that wasn't too enjoyable. 
But seriously, Ruby's Cafe was way better than I expected. Give this place a try if you want casual dining for really cheap prices. 

Food and Prices: 8/10

Still need to wait 15mins for tables
And I orders shrimp pasta and fries.

Shrimp pasta: it's pretty salty, but got lots of flavor in the sauce. Very creamy, garlic taste. And there are 6 big , fat, fresh shrimp in the pasta.

Fries: very crispy outside, and it already got flavor so you can eat it alone. Or dip with the truffle aioli.  Pretty heavy but taste good.

Their dish tend to be on salty side. The girl beside me, she was chatting with me. She said her sandwich is very salty too."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-01-27,4.0,The wait time was very long and wish they offered the ability to just add yourself to the waitlist since that's essentially what they do aNyways once you arrive. The pastas were both very well done. We ordered the Creamy Chicken Pasta and the crab spaghetti which had a really nice kick to it. The spaghetti certainly tasted much more fusion with the garnish and the spice aspect. The pasta portions were also much more appropriately sized for individuals whereas the burgers looked much larger.
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-18,5.0,The food here is just SO good.  Do yourself a favor and try the banana bread with the passionfruit butter.  Or the coffee granola.  It's busy literally all the time but genuinely worth the wait.  And I'm like the most impatient person ever.  Only thing I dislike here is the fact that they have paper straws.
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-11,5.0,"My friend really wanted to go to Rubirosa's pizza a few doors down.....didn't make a reservation. What was the wait time, you ask? Four HOURS. But ya know what, this turned out to be the hugest blessing in disguise because we took ourselves over to Ruby's Cafe and put our name down (this one had a solid, typical 40 minute wait we deemed totally doable). 

After grabbing a few drinks at a bar nearby, we were summoned via text to Ruby's, where we were greeted at the door by a cute, nice server, and then led to a sweet lil table in the annex dining area. 

There's something for everyone on this menu. It's a cute and trendy restaurant that isn't so painfully trendy that you feel like a do*che going. I was on a big veggie burger kick, so that's what I went with. And it. did. not. disappoint. But being the don't-wanna-say-I'm-trendy-but-I'm-trendy person I am, I order alllll the truffle fries. And then proceeded to eat aaaaalllllllllll the truffle fries. (If you don't get the hint of my excitement here: they were really great, and so was the burger.) And I was in wine mode from my wait-time wine, so I ordered a glass of that too. 

The bill? Ended up being around $26 a person. I was baffled! Couldn't believe my eyes! What a great price for a fantastic meal!!! 

Ruby's ------ I will see you soon."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-01-07,5.0,"So good that we came here TWICE because we wanted to share this place with other friends. 

The place is pretty small, pretty typical of a NY restaurant since theres high cost for the real estate you get. This means that there will usually be a wait at your brunch times (which is when we came). 

I really like the pasta here so we got that and we got a sandwich to share. One friend got a salmon salad (shame). 

The pasta is cooked well and the flavor is not too rich with some acidity from the tomato sauce to balance it. The sandwich is super nice to dip into the sauce of the pasta you get. We love a life hack!!!!! 

The service is good and the price range is not too bad. 


I would recommend this place."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-07-05,4.0,"Ugh I almost want to give five stars but I can't because as a restaurant overall some things need to improved. FIRSTLY, why is the music so loud!!! How can we enjoy our meal and talk to one each other? That was a major turn off. Another turnoff was that I was taken off the waitlist when our table was first ready but my other friend wasn't there yet so I had to add my name to the wait list again. So not fair because two of us was already there. The two restaurants are very small so no wonder a 25 minute wait.

The food, however, was plate licking worthy. Everything was so delicious I couldn't even believe it. I got the shrimp and avocado salad and it was so filling and delicious. But the heroes were definitely the sweet potatoes fries. The chili sauce and toppings are so amazing. The drinks were delicious as well.

We really want to come back here so please lower the volume of the music! I am even ok with the wait time of 25 minutes."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-09,5.0,"Came by with a friend for a quick bite to eat during a week night. The interior is small and cozy and there were already many people seated when we walked in - we got seated right away. 

I originally wanted to order the spicy Italian sausage pasta but after seeing all the yelp reviews raving about the shrimp spaghetti, I ended up getting the shrimp spaghetti and I'm so glad I did! It wasn't overly creamy, salty, or greasy feeling. It was creamy enough and such a simple yet delicious dish. Very flavorful and the noodles were perfectly cooked, al dente. The price was average priced and what I was expecting for a restaurant in the area it was. The location of this shop is easy to get to - it's pretty close to the spring street subway stop on the 6.  

My friend got the crispy green bowl, which was delicious as well. We shared a side of truffle fries which were perfectly salted, crispy, and sooo flavorful with the truffle dipping sauce. Highly recommend this place for a quick bite to eat - I can imagine this place being busy on weekends."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-03,5.0,"The Classic Cheeseburger is one of the best burgers I have had in a very long time!

I have eaten at Ruby's a couple of time before, and I would order the Bronte burger every time. It is very unique and nothing i've ever had before. However, its taste overall is something that I couldn't see myself eating very often. In simpler terms, I got tired of the taste.

The Classic Burger features all that you'd expect from a your typical American burger from Shake Shack or In N Out. Ruby's burger patty is super juicy and they have a ""special"" sauce to die for. I was so glad that I decided on this burger because I strongly believe it ranks up there on my list!

Ruby's is a very popular spot in SoHo that is worth the wait. One thing to note: they may have fixed this, but they  did not have a winter vestibule installed when I last went (early November). I never took off my jacket!

Nevertheless, Ruby's has one of the best burgers ever!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-05-30,3.0,"After reading reviews and seeing how crowded this spot was, I expected this to be a great brunch spot. I came on a Sunday afternoon and there was a 30 min wait for 2 people. You can leave your number and they text you once your table is ready or there are little benches outside for you to wait at.

The place itself is really cute but also super small and the tables are so close to each other! I can hear the convos next to me. 

The food was mediocre. My bf got the 'Big Breakfast' and it was honestly nothing special so I don't recommend getting that, especially for the price ($15+). I got the Whaley's burger which comes with pineapple and fried egg. It was not bad, but the burger wasn't juicy and the bread didn't really fit the burger well especially since they cut it diagonally. So, the toppings kept sliding out as I tried to eat it. However, I did like the fries a lot and the dipping sauce that comes with it.

The service was meh- it was hard to get the attention of the waiters most of the time."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-09,4.0,Happened to be in the neighborhood Sunday afternoon and saw the reviews of this place. There was a little line but my husband and I were able to get seated right away. Glad we did. The food is really fresh and not heavy. Good variety and flavors. The crab linguine was a bit spicy but I didn't mind as I like heat. Glad we finished with the ricotta hot cakes. The butter compote was a great addition and the ricotta was a thick a creamy hidden pocket inside. I need to learn how to make it at home!
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-05,3.0,"Food (7/10): I got the Shrimp Pasta, which was absolutely stunning. I was pleased to find a decent amount of shrimp, and the sauce and seasoning was light with the kick of the chili flakes being just what the dish needed. The portion was good as well, given the $16 price tag. Their sangria was also delicious, but for $9, it was smaller than I was hoping.

Atmosphere (6/10): Ruby's Cafe had a somewhat hole-in-the-wall vibe and was super cute, quaint, and homey. The tables were pretty close, but I think it suited the vibe and atmosphere nicely. It was dimly lit, and the sound level was manageable as well.

Service (6/10): The wait staff was not overly attentive (they could have come by perhaps a fewwww more times to check in). 

Overall, we had a lovely time and after a long day of touring the city, this was the perfect place to end our night."

3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-10-29,4.0,"Ruby's Cafe is a solid brunch option for me whenever I am in the area. My friend introduced this place to me way back and I still find myself coming back. The place itself is a bit small, but it is well light and all the people working there are super friendly. There has always been a line whenever I came, even when I came on a weekday for brunch, and usually the wait has been around 30 minutes so it's not too bad if you plan ahead. 

They have a variety of different items on the menu and I believe that everyone can find something! They have egg options, burgers and pastas available. Personally, my favorite is the fried chicken burger with a side of fries. If you were to get anything, YOU MUST GET THE FRIES. They are absolutely delicious and perfectly fried so that each piece is super crispy and yummy. Their creamy chicken pasta is also pretty good. It is really well flavored! My friends love their Bronte which is one of their burger options and it's def their choice whenever they come here. 

Overall, I def will be coming back here for brunch especially when it gets warmer (so the wait outside isn't as cold!)."

If you come on a satuday or sunday you might have to wait 30 but its totally worth it ....i mean even the yogurt (all but it with essence of coffee ) is good .

Whatever you do don't forget the banana bread and butter its off the hook!

Ruby's if you turned your music down so we could hear ourselves think i would have given you 5 stars ."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-10-06,5.0,"My friend recommended this place after one of his friends took him here. I've never actually had Australian food, so I wasn't sure what kind of cuisine I'd be trying. I was only familiar with vegemite and I heard it's terrible lol
We ordered the shrimp pasta and the green eggs bowl, which the waitress recommended. I loved LOVED the shrimp pasta. The shrimps were tender and seasoned perfectly, the sauce was light and creamy, and the arugula and the chili oil was such an interesting flavor combination. The green eggs bowl was also good but it felt like something that could be easily recreated at home. It was scrambled eggs topped with all sorts of greens; kale, spinach, avocado, and peas, with salsa verde and a bit of olive oil, I think, on top. We were surprised how full we were and were each a bit sad because we wanted to also try the banana bread with passion fruit butter. I love me some banana bread and it's hard to ignore something as unique as passion fruit butter, so I'll try that next time I'm in the area"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-09-05,5.0,"(September 2019) ahhh! another favorite Australian restaurant! Ruby's is indeed another gem in NYC. I came in on a Thursday afternoon and there was a line but the wait was short. We ordered the shrimp pasta $16, bronte burger with truffle fries $16.50, brussel sprout $6, and fresh grapefruit $6. Everything was amazing, shrimp was crunchy and fresh; bronte burger's beef was cooked medium, flavorful (bread was a bit soggy but still delicious); brussel sprout is as good as it can get; grapefruit is fresh and naturally unsweetened! happy music, homey place, good food, servers = high recommendation!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-04-04,5.0,"I had heard so many things about this place, I couldn't leave New York without trying it. 

I went here for a friend date on a weekday around noon time. We were told the wait would be around 15 minutes, so we decided to wait outside since space is limited (this would be my only complaint about this place). 10 minutes later, we were seated in a table near the entrance.

The interior is very cute with a homie feeling and amazing smells wafting from left and right. We ordered the shrimp pasta and the Bronte burger and both left me feeling like I was floating on clouds. The shrimp pasta was one of the best I've ever had, and it didn't feel too greasy or overwhelming. The Bronte burger is more like a pressed panini than a burger, so it wasn't meat heavy at all. 

TIP: It comes with fries but if you don't really care about getting a little less portions wise, ask for truffle fries instead of the regular ones. SO GOOD.

I recommend this to anyone who wants to have brunch in the SOHO area before embarking on a shopping spree :)"

I had a party of three, including myself. I didn't mind the wait, just be aware that the wait is long! 
The place was small and cozy, but somehow the staffs seemed so uncaring and inattentive. My friend had to ask for the staff about 3 times before someone came over to even take our order. 
The food was absolutely amazing!! I was stunned by how flavorful the food was. My friends and I absolutely loved it. I would say this place is somewhat pricey. I didn't think the hot chocolate was worth $4, for a small cup."

We waited 15min for a table around 5:30pm on a Saturday... the location is small but we were glad we got a seated eventually. We ordered the shrimp pasta and the bronte burger. The burger was delicious- it wasn't cooked MR as requested but the sweet chili/mayo combo was killer!!! The bread added a great crunch and I would highly recommend you try this!!! 

The pasta was not good at all- it was oily, loaded with garlic and more pepper flakes than the average person who likes spicy can handle! It was pretty inedible but I shared my burger and I'm glad it was big enough to split. The truffle fries and aioli were good! We didn't try any drinks or anything else and were out of there in under an hour. I did like that each table has a water vase. I needed all the water after that pasta dish!!

I wish I saw this earlier... consider this your warning!! Shrimp pasta was VERY spicy!!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-08-20,5.0,"Ordered the shrimp salad for a team lunch through their website. It said that our orders were ready at 1:23PM, but when I got there late at 1:40PM, it still wasn't ready. Also, my coworker ordered a salad, but it was missing eggs. She ended up calling them and getting replacement eggs!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-10-10,3.0,"I came here with a girlfriend last night for dinner. We didn't have a reservation, so we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. 

The interior of the restaurant is nice and intimate, there were a lot of people on dates. Unfortunately, though, we were seated right next to the door which was uncomfortable because it was so cold outside.

The service was just ok: no one came over to ask us how our food was or if I wanted another glass of wine. The food was good though, I really liked the chicken and avocado salad I ordered. Though I will say, it wasn't a ton of food, especially considering the price.

I liked how they had both healthy options like salads, and not-so-healthy options like pasta."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-29,5.0,"Before I came to Ruby, I thought Ruby was serving some small portion vegetarian food that got hyped on Instagram. However, the food is actually delish and satisfying! We order chicken avocado salad, shrimp pasta, and Bronte burger. I am amazed. It's anything but mediocre! I've already put Ruby's on the to-do list of my next trip to NYC."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-01-25,4.0,"This place gets jam packed for lunch. It usually has a wait but it is worth it. Service is quick and you can hear the people's conversations next to you. Don't come if you want a quiet lunch or privacy. Other than that it is a good experience. 

As for the food, The farro salad was delicious and light. I ordered it with avocado and it added just the right flavor and texture to the dish. We ordered the sweet potato fries which were good and came with a nice sauce on top. Sweet potato fries are hard to mess up but these stood out as better than average. We just wish there was more of it. My guest got the rag bol which is pretty much spaghetti bolognese. The sauce looked a little runny and the dish looked oversauced but my guest liked it.

Although, it is kind of tight in here it is expected in nyc. You have to get lucky to come without a wait but if you do it is worth it."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-29,4.0,"I love their food! They have delicious brunch food. The restaurant has limited space so every time I go, there was a wait :(

Their avo toast and ricotta hotcakes was average not really special. The ricotta on the top was a nice twist though. It seemed like a better substitute than butter. Their brussel sprouts were so delicious! It was a bit crispy in the outside, and juicy in the inside. The creamy chicken pasta is the best menu I think. The sauce is delicious and the seasoning is perfect!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-03-21,5.0,"I understand the hype after experiencing my first lunch here. Luckily, we were only a party of two and didn't have to wait for a table. It was still quite packed, however, because the restaurant's pretty small. I can definitely imagine a long line on the weekends. 

Honestly, EVERYTHING looked so good on the menu. Both my friend and I had trouble deciding between a bowl, salad, pasta, and sandwich. In the end, I ordered a crispy rice bowl and my friend got the chicken avocado salad. The bowl exceeded my expectations!! It was so flavorful, and all the varying textures worked. I was initially afraid of the rice being too hard and inedible, but that wasn't the case at all! It was perfectly crispy and the halloumi cheese was a great touch to the dish. Perfect portion too. 

I'll definitely be back to try their pasta because they looked BOMB. I was envious of the nearby tables with their amazing looking pasta dishes. This is a perfect spot because there are options for everyone - healthy & nonhealthy."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-08-03,5.0,"What a bright and cute restaurant! I'm not too familiar with Australian cuisine, but if this is what it is, then I'm on fully board. From the things I have tried so far, I'm convinced that all of their menu items must be delicious. Ruby's is not like those ""aesthetic"" restaurants that have pretty looking foods that taste average. Their food is A+. The bronte burger has that perfect combination of sweet and savory. The truffle fries are super crunchy and well seasoned. Finally, all the pastas are great, especially the rag bol and shrimp spaghetti. The portions are pretty generous too. I never had to wait too long, but I can imagine it can get busy on a weekend brunch. All in all, you can't really go wrong with Ruby's!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-01-16,5.0,"Ruby's Cafe is a reason why I need to visit Australia pronto! Their ambiance and food is amazing. Although there is a bit of a wait time (because of their tight space), it is totally worth it.

I would definitely recommend their crispy grain bowl and sweet potato fries with sour cream and sweet chili. Everything is super presentable and photo worthy!

Service can seem a little rushed since they're so busy but definitely give a visit! They also reposted my insta pic so I feel connected to them in a different way hahaha :) Love this place!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-10-20,5.0,"The ragu here is good, but the chocolate cake is just excellent! 
It's such a stunning dish! The mixture of chipotle larva and the ice cream really gives a wonderful texture of this dessert and the (chestnuts?) in the ice cream adds a crunchy flavor into it.
The lamb ragu is also good, and has a real flavor and smell of lamb! 
Highly recommend it! The only problem is no reservation and very long time of waiting"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-26,5.0,"Great little spot for casual dinner. The pasta was served fast, it tasted fresh and delicious. The sauce had very rich flavor. I enjoyed my Bloody Mary. It tasted good although it didn't look like they have an actual bar. Can't wait to come here again to try appetizers. The staff is friendly and attentive."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2018-12-29,4.0,"Great food, not go great service. 

Came here a few days before New Years for brunch & thankfully there was no wait! The interior was really cute and aesthetic, perfect soho feel. 3/4 of my friends, including me, got the EGG SANDWICH. it's a bit on the pricier end but the flavor was yummy! Packed with lots of different layers of flavor, given that it was a bit messy to eat with hands. My other friend got the BIG BREAKFAST, which was also on the pricier end for not a really filling plate. It looked like a platter of English breakfast; the mushrooms were very delicious! 

What took away from the experience, however, was the rude service. Almost all of the servers gave us an attitude while we asked questions about the menu and check, even when it was about my friend's allergy. We were trying to split the check per item as they miscommunicated that we could, so we misunderstood. And the server gave us a very rude and belittling attitude, as if we were stupid, as though it was not our fault for misunderstanding miscommunicated information. If any worse, the ranking would've dropped to a 3, as the service already took away the potential 5 stars. 

tldr;
food 4.5/5
service 3/5
interior 5/5"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-08-06,4.0,"Cute cafe with fast and friendly service! I ordered the Sweet Corn & Bacon Cous Cous with Smoked Salmon. It was surprisingly very filling, and everything tasted very fresh and delicious. The corn and bacon bits are such a great combo. The egg is really runny, which was wonderful to mix in with the Cous Cous. Overall, great experience! I'd come again."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-06-11,4.0,"Cute little brunch place in Nolita. As you can see by the reviews, this place gets PACKED. We got here around 4pm on a Saturday and it was still over 30min wait. 

We got the shrimp pasta, pesto pasta, and side of fries with truffle aioli. Omg definitely get the fries! That aioli is everythinggg. 

Everyone recommended the shrimp pasta, but in my opinion pesto pasta was better!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2018-12-28,4.0,"Update: service is bad but food is good. 
I LOVE the Ruby's bronte burger and will drive 4 hours to this place just for a burger. I'm happy to see that they expanded to the shop next door, adding more seating than before. 

Food came out quick for both delivery and dine in. Burger itself was wonderful, juicy, and flavorful. The truffle dip added a fun dimension of flavor too. The burger is $13, with a $3 charge for fries with the burger. If you get the $6 fries side, it comes with both the truffle and aioli sauces. In the past, I was given the aioli sauce even with my $3 fries, but this time I did not. I was disappointed because that sauce really improves the flavor of both the burger and fries, but it's not worth an extra $3 just for sauce. 

Service is extremely inattentive and aloof. There were 2 waitresses for 5 small tables, and I still had trouble flagging down someone for more water. The waitresses weren't looking around the room. They weren't particularly friendly, and looked above our heads while talking as if we weren't really there (this is the first time I've ever seen a waitress do something like this). When boxing food to go, one of my companions asked the waitress to box up her platter of Brussels sprouts, but the waitress ended up throwing them away. We didn't find out until we had left the city, but there was more than half of the dish's volume left. She was extremely bothered that her $6 side was tossed despite specific instructions otherwise. 

Despite the shortcomings, this place still makes the best burger I've ever had."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-07-20,4.0,I really enjoyed the vibe of this restaurant but I found the food and drink to be lacking. The gnocchi alla Norma had a good sauce but the gnocchi had an under cooked texture that was very dense. I got the blended margarita and thought it had a strange taste almost reminiscent of sprite. Overall a good experience.
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-07-15,5.0,"Every time I think of Ruby's I think of their Bronte Burger and fries. I always tell myself to try something new, but how can I order anything other than the Bronte Burger? It's delicious and juicy and EVERYTHING! Every bite of the burger is flavorful. The fries are also a must when you come to Ruby's. It's perfect, crispy and very flavorful! 

The only down side about going to Ruby's is the wait. No matter what time of the day I went, I still had to wait about 20-30 minutes to get a table. However, don't let the wait turn you away because it's worth it."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-07-11,4.0,"This spot is very cute but very small. They have additional seating next door but the seats are crammed in pretty tight. However, it is very well-lit and super cozy, which is definitely a perk.

My friend and I both ordered the crispy rice bowl with avocado. The rice is, as advertised, crispy as heck. It felt like crunching hard candy at some points. But the flavors were unique and fun and the bowl was overall very enjoyable. 

Our waiter was very friendly as well! Definitely a great spot to try some unique food."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-01-11,5.0,"I came here with 4 other friends (total 5 ppl) and waited for quite a bit bc it's a rlly popular spot apparently (and there are no reservations). The wait wasn't too bad but obviously we were getting a bit antsy bc we were all starting to get hangry.

However, when we finally got seated, we were excited-- the place was very cute and romantic, the food looked so good and the service wasn't bad either. We decided to get 5 dishes and share family-style. 

We go the pesto pasta, shrimp spaghetti, some type of salad and 2 other sandwiches. And I have to say THEY WERE BOMB!!!! My friends and I met up to catch up but we ended up straight eating hahaha.

Overall, we all agreed that we must all come here again with our other special friends :) HIGHLY recommend- even despite the wait time & the so"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2018-11-21,3.0,"Ruby's is a neat little spot, blocks away from Soho. The restaurant is actually split into two areas, both with separate entrances, so you might end up on either side. Note that all parties must be present in order to be seated. 

The lemonades and juices they had were good but a tad overpriced. $7 for a watermelon juice? I could actually get more for the buck at a juice bar. 

We had the crispy chicken burger and the spicy sausage pasta and both were pretty good. None of it hit it out of the park, but it wasn't terrible either. The pasta comes out covered in a pile of Parmesan, a fair warning to my lactose friends. 

The restaurant can get pretty packed and busy. The tables are very close to each other, so be prepared to get cozy next to your neighbors. It can also get pretty loud, depending on the night.

It's a cool spot to try if you're in the neighborhood, but it's nothing spectacular."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2020-04-05,5.0,"Love Ruby's, great quality food at an affordable price! Expect to wait during peak times but you can put your name in and they will text you when your table is ready. 

Highly recommend the Ragu Pasta, one of my favorite pasta's in the city. Super rich and flavorful.

Plates are great for sharing! Go with friends and split a few things."

It was tiny tho hole in the wall with a bit coin atm if I remember correctly. The kitchen was in the damn basement and the food came thru a hole in the ground. It qas good. Now... Wow it's grownssss upp.expanded. Mult locations. Is the food still good tho?

Duh. Stl damn good. Looks pretty too. Had the Whaley and shrimp salad. Also had fries with truffle aioli and the Brussel sprouts. All gobbled up and cleaned up. Im a monnnstaaaaaa. Nah my friend ate some too. She's no monsta tho. She's a normal eater. And aussie. She liked it. (this place is very aussie if u cudnt tl from the menu and decor and everything basically lots of cute refs everywhere.). So if an aussie likes it it makes it legit right? I dunno. No idea. Actusl questikn.  Dm me.

So anyway, decently priced tables are kinda close togwther and it's loud. But watever. Ure there to have fun and catch up and enjoy meal. This isn't the library or some snotty social club. Levae new york if that's all u like. Please. Do us all a favor. Thanks. See pics. Salivate."
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2018-12-09,4.0,"Cute little brunch spot in Nolita! Came here for a nice Saturday afternoon brunch and had an overall good experience. Like most NYC restaurants though, be warned this place is quite tiny (leading to some strategic maneuvering required to walk around). That being said, I was pretty impressed as to how short the wait was on a Saturday afternoon. 

Ambiance and atmosphere are great! I actually didn't realize the place was focused on Australia/Australian-inspired cuisine until I heard our waitress speak with her awesome accent. My cousin ordered the Shrimp Pasta and some Sweet Potato Fries, and I went ahead and went with the Bacon and Corn Cous Cous with added Avocado and Chicken, with an Americano (they don't have regular House Coffee). 


The Shrimp Pasta is SO good. I couldn't help myself from stealing bites off my cousin's plate (highly recommend ordering this). His Sweet Potato fries were slightly soggy when they came, but overall good taste.

I love cous cous, and I thought the Bacon and Corn Cous Cous was overall tasty, but to be honest I probably wouldn't order it again. It was REALLY salty. I think the Bacon and Chicken together were the causes of this (so maybe don't add additional proteins) or the bacon itself was too much. I was depending on my avocado by the end of the dish to get me through the saltiness, so something to keep in mind. I think the dish is delicious, just need to find some adjustments to the high salt profile (knocking off a star for this, also because our waitress forgot our order two times and had to come around and ask, although this wasn't a huge deal and she was really sweet).

Would love to come back and try other items on the menu!"
3,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-05,4.0,"I've been here twice, once years ago and one more time very recently. I remember this place used to be this hole in the wall that not too many knew about and it's become one of the go-to spots in the area for a good reason."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-04-29,5.0,"Russ and Daughters is my favorite place in NYC for lox and bagels. They have a few locations where they sell their bagel sandwiches, but I like the Russ and Daughters Cafe on Orchard because it's a sit down place where you can just take your time and relax with a cup of coffee or a drink. 

They have an extensive menu, but I always order the lox and bagels and nothing else. I don't even have to look at the menu because this is where I get my lox and bagel fix in the city. I also like the DIY style of their lox and bagel because you can pick and choose what you want to put on it and how much cream cheese you want to add. 

If you have some time to sit down and enjoy breakfast one morning, head over to Russ and Daughters Cafe for their lox and bagel!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-04-06,5.0,"The wait was SUPER LONG!! We were able to go around and explore the area before our table was ready. I really love the idea how all the ingredients come in a board and you build the bagel the way you like it! I think the experience and the food was amazing!! Though the price was more than if you went to a local cafe for a tasty bagel. 

The bagel was soo delicious! It was a fun experience building the bagel as you wish! 

I would definitely recommend for the experience and the taste! It is worth the wait!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-03-23,5.0,"LOVE!!! I love bagels but have a hard time finding something good because I don't eat dairy, but Russ & Daughters had a great dairy-free tofu cream cheese option. I got an everything bagel with tofu cream cheese, lox, and capers. It was EXCELLENT! The bagel was very fresh - soft and chewy at the same time and very light. The smoked salmon was also amazing - potentially the best smoked salmon I have ever had. Not too salty, very thin, and melts in your mouth. Perfect taste and texture. 

Everyone else loved their food as well. Price was a bit steep, but for the quality well worth it. I'm looking forward to trying the bagel shop - instead of being deconstructed, the bagels are already made. The prices are a bit lower there too.

It was packed on weekday lunch, which is understandable seeing as it was delicious. Thank you for a great meal!!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-03-23,4.0,"My first R+D experience was at the deli back in 2016 and I absolutely loved it. I had no idea they had a cafe, so when my friends and I made our way to the city, I knew this had to be on the menu. 

I got the classic, which is basically a deconstructed bagel sandwich with Lox cream cheese tomato and capers. I also got a mushroom soup and shared some latkes with the table. 

Personally I like the deli better as the bagel comes already made. I found that while the presentation makes for a good picture, the taste is just better when it's already made for you. The mushroom barley soup was good, but nothing special. I will say the latkes here were really freaking good, and each order comes with more than enough for sharing. 

I think the price point is steep for this bagel, but am unsure what the deli costs are nowadays.

I still do prefer this over ess-a-bagel though (though many of my friends disagree)"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-03-05,5.0,"Always love bagel.
classic board- bagel, smoke salmon, cream cheese, onion, tomato, and capers.
You can make your own bagel!
Their smoke salmon is not too salty, so you taste of more salmon flavor more than salt. 
Everything balance so well together! 

I came here on weekday lunch so no wait needed. I heard  weekend is aLways packed."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-03-06,4.0,"Come hungry, but not too hungry because you'll have to wait over an hour to get seated! 

The presentation is the nicest part of this meal. The lox gets served on top of a small wooden board with the ingredients on top. 

You'll have to put the ingredients on a bagel, of course, which adds to the experience of the this place. 

-1 because we felt like one of the bussers had a major attitude. Seriously makes me feel no need to return for some time."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-03-21,4.0,"Thursday morning brunch at Russ & Daughter's was fabulous.   We were seated immediately in a corner booth in the back.  We ordered the smoke salmon platter and bread basket to share.   

Food was good.   Nothing mind blowing."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-02-22,4.0,"I've heard phenomenal things about this place, especially the smoked salmon, so I of course had to come and try it. Knew that their lines can get very long, so we decided to come early. We got there at 9 am on a Saturday, and the restaurant was already full. The wait wasn't too bad, though: only half an hour. We were able to hang out at a nearby Starbuck's while we waited for our text. 

Once in, we were seated at the bar. We ordered the classic board, which came with gaspe nova smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onion, and capers; as well as the potato latkes with apple sauce and sour cream, both to share. I was so excited to try the smoked salmon, and honestly, it didn't disappoint. The salmon was so wispy, with the perfect taste and texture. Wish there was more of it. I can see why they're famous for it! The cream cheese was light and airy. Normally I feel like cream cheese is too heavy, but I felt like I was eating a cloud. The platter comes with a choice of bagel, bialy, shissel rye, or pumpernickel, and we had ours with a bialy, which I tried for the first time. It was essentially a thinner, less dense bagel.

The latkes weren't a let down, either; complemented by the apple sauce and sour cream, they felt like a perfect combination. They had the right amount of crunch and texture. Perhaps my only complaint is that they erred on the heavier side, though that's to be expected of something fried.

I love the design of their menu, from the color scheme to the font choice. It's a cute Jewish diner and definitely worth the visit, though I'd come early to avoid the crowds."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-02-20,3.0,"I can't recommend this cafe.  It serves as more of a tourist spot and a relic of the famous brand than a place to eat regularly.  Before my meal, I had assumed that locals eat at Russ & Daughters all the time.

Some redeeming qualities were the charm of being served in a notable establishment, with the decor and history of being at Russ & Daughters.  If you are in to that sort of dining, you'll have that here.

The food portions are fairly small when you consider the $20 price tags on each selection.  This would be fine if the food was a step above competitors that serve bagels and salmon at $10.  But it's not.  At most the quality is equal.  At worst, you're getting half the quality for double the price.  If you normally get 4 slices of salmon elsewhere for one serving, you can expect to get only 2 here.

We ordered two selections from the menu.  The first was called the Shtetl, smoked sable w/ a bagel and cream cheese.  The second was the Lower Sunny Side, a breakfast plate of two latkes (hashbrowns), two overeasy eggs, and lox.  Our drinks were served in dirty glasses with debris floating on the surface.  It seems like this restaurant does not store their glasses overnight, and leaves them face up to collect dust and dirt before first use.

The less than friendly hostess didn't say much or offer any sort of greeting.  Our primary server was devoid of expression and seemed to want to be elsewhere.  The two other servers who stopped by to check on us were friendly.  We only saw our primary server when we placed our order, and to collect the check.

The best bagels are from small delis and hole in the wall places around New York.  But if you find yourself still wanting to try Russ & Daughters, the takeout deli on the main street comes out ahead of the cafe in terms of service and quality."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-01-18,5.0,"Stopped by this place after watching a Mark Wiens food vlog, and I knew it would be good. I ordered the smoked salmon on an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese.

They make it right in front  of you, and you wait in line by grabbing a ticket. It got there at around 10am and waited about 20 mins for my turn. The place was pretty packed. 

Overall the best bagel I've ever had in my life. The salmon melted in my mouth and had a buttery texture with the fresh taste of smoked salmon. The cream cheese was a great addition, and paired nicely with the salmon. The bagel was toasted perfectly and tasted fresh and had great texture. 

Solid 5 stars here and will be returning!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-12-27,5.0,"I've always seen Russ & Daughters floating around my Yelp feed but never really took the time to check it out and see what it was all about. Then, sometime last year my brother was telling me how great it was after visiting their original location. This intrigued me - and since my brothers and I had to go to the East Village to pick up some goods for Christmas Eve, we thought it would be a good idea to grab breakfast here at the cafe. 

The original R&D has been open for over 100 years, and is mostly a takeout spot serving a variety of Jewish cuisine. The Cafe opened in 2014 which serves the same fare but also provides table service. We arrived on Christmas Eve around 9am and were lucky enough to not wait more than 2 or so minutes for a table. The decor was perfect - it had a diner aesthetic with a mostly grey color scheme. Along the walls were banners with the names of different Jewish food along with jarred versions of them. 

The menu has a great selection of Jewish foods - apps, soups, salads, and more with emphasis on fish and other staples. Even though I'm not Jewish, my grandmother loved the food so I grew up eating matzo and blintzes - I was immediately brought back to my grandmother when looking over the menu. Anyway, we decided to order some potato latke, cheese blintzes, and three boards (one for each of us). The latke were great - they had a nice thickness to them and were served with salmon roe and creme fraiche which really complemented the latke. The blintzes were also great - the cheese had a nice flavor and again were complemented by fruit compote and sour cream. 

I decided to get the classic board - this contained smoked salmon, onion, tomato, capers, cream cheese to spread, and my choice of carb (I went with a pumpernickel bagel). While I'm not the biggest smoked salmon fan, I wanted the full R&D experience so I dove in. I had no regrets because the board was delicious - the salmon was tender, the bagel was soft and chewy, and the accents really made it a perfect meal - I was super impressed.

Service was great -all the food was served in a timely manner and all of the staff were very friendly. Overall, I had an awesome experience at R&D Cafe - they really are a premier spot for Jewish cuisine in Manhattan and I will definitely return for more of their offerings."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-01-08,4.0,"Will you be waiting a long time for a bagel? Yes. Will you be paying a lot for a bagel? Yes. But is it worth it to try one of NYC icons? Absolutely!

First time here, so went with the classic board. It's a little DIY board with plenty of nova lox, tomatoes, onions, capers and cream cheese! I chose a bialy and my friend got an everything bagel. Everything was just amazing quality!!! It's not an every day bagel spot, but definitely come in at least once!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-12-06,4.0,"I had wanted to go to Russ & Daughters for a while now, but the wait is usually so long and I didn't have time to wait. I finally had a day where I was able to wait out their expected 2 hour wait time.

We ordered the Pastrami Russ because of all the hype I've heard over the pastrami-cured salmon, but this was a bit underwhelming. Additionally, the dense pretzel roll may have detracted from the taste of the pastrami salmon.

On to the platter we got to share. There are three options, all of which sounded good, but we went for The Anne for what sounded like the most variety. The platters all come with cream cheese, red onion, tomato, capers, pickled veggies, and a bread/bagel basket. Not a fan of most of the pickled veggies or capers in general and the bread basket could have done with more bagels, but I'm happy with the cream cheese, red onion, and tomato accompaniments. On to the fish offerings - absolutely loved their private stock sturgeon (favorite from the board), always love sable, the New Zealand king smoked salmon is a classic staple, and the wild salmon Alaskan roe added bursts of salty flavor that paired well with others, but the smoked brook trout wasn't as big of a hit.

Now that I have specific items I know I love and specific items I'd rather steer clear of, I think the better option would be to visit their storefront down the block. The sit down is much less customizable, but a good way to be able to sit around and share a platter with others."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-12-07,4.0,"Finally made it here! Woke up early on a Saturday and made it right before it opened at 8am (in the past I have left when told to wait 2 hours, which is the norm for walk ins during regular brunch hours). My boyfriend and I ordered 

+ eggs benny (thought this had a bit too much spinach, which made it soggy. Would have liked less spinach, more salmon)

+ potato latkes with creme fraiche and fish roe (really enjoyed this! Latkes are crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the creme fraiche balances out the saltiness of the roe well)

We really enjoyed the coffee brew -- they also have free refills. I'd be interested in trying their bagels and desserts next time around."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-02-07,5.0,"Every time I go to New York I have plans to try a new place for brunch but somehow always end up at Russ & Daughters. I just can't quit you. I think we got there on Sunday at 9:30 but still had to wait 15 minutes for 2 people. And it was Superbowl  Sunday. I always get the Classic Board, and will switch between an everything bagel or the bialy. They don't have my favorite bagel but I love their Nova smoked salmon. It's sliced perfectly thin and is not overly salty. It's DELICIOUS. Definitely a New York staple."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-02-05,4.0,"Stopped by Russ & Daughters on a Sunday morning during my recent trip to New York. My friend and I got there at 11 am and was told there was an hour and twenty minute wait. There's a small waiting area inside for about 8 people to sit and wait but other than that most people were waiting outside. About 50 minutes later we were offered counter seats. 

Both my friend and I ordered the Classic Board which comes with a toasted bagel of your choice, smoked salmon, tomatoes, red onions, capers and cream cheese. I had never had a New York bagel before and the lox bagel here was delicious! We also ordered a bowl of the Matzo Ball Soup which they kindly offered to split for us. I didn't think the soup was that special so would skip it next time and try something else. 

Overall glad I tried Russ & Daughters but don't know if I'll be back for another $18 bagel with an hour wait anytime soon. Good to try though at least once!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-11-09,5.0,"This place has limited seating and make sure you are there at opening time. I was there at 8 so I was seated immediately. Within 20 min the place was fu and had a waiting time of 20-30 minutes. So make sure you come early if you want to be seated immediately. 

IMPORTANT: Google navigated me to the back of the building (Allen Street), but the place is on 127 Orchid Street. Just be careful. 

Coming to the food, I was intrigued by the name and history of it so went and tried. It was good food but kind of pricy. I had the classic with smoked salmon. I had to put the cream cheese and assemble it by myself which was difficult as I didn't know how to put them together and have a good bite without making a mess. May be worth trying once. The waitress was polite and attentive. I was seated at the bar though. 

They do not do takeout orders here. If you want to take something there is another location couple of blocks from this place. You should go there."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-09-18,5.0,"This was a must when I was planning my trip to NYC. I love bagels and smoked salmon so I had to stop by this place. There was no wait when my friend and I arrived and got seated right away. It didn't take long for us to decide what to order. 

Food:
-Classic board (Gaspe Smoked Nova Salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onion and capers). The smoked salmon was so yummy!! I love how they put the ingredients on the board and we got to assemble our own bagel. Such a fun experience!

-Whitefish Croquettes (smoked whitefish, potato w/ tartar sauce). Everyone needs to try these because they are amazing! They're crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. The tartar sauce gave a nice balance and added the perfect touch to this dish!

I wish they had this back in CA, craving for this as I type."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-01-24,5.0,"Omg I love everything salmon related and everything was SO good here! There was definitely a wait when we first arrived (and we didn't make a reservation) but it was definitely worth the 30 min wait! The menu form sweet things, to platters, to small dishes - we got the hot smoke/cold smoke small dish, the classic lox board with an everything bagel, and some latkes! The small dish was basically a smoked salmon dip that you ate with everything bagel chips and it was surprisingly SO good - the dip was amazing and everything bagel chips is definitely a must! The board is a classic and comes with some onions, tomatoes, capers, creamcheese, and like 4 slices of salmon! I wish it came with more salmon but overall, the quality was so good! I loved the latkes as well and the applesauce paired SO well with it! It's definitely pricey but I think it's worth trying!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-08-23,5.0,"After my bagel fail the previous day at the original Russ & Daughters, I had to redeem myself. I could have went back there, but I also kinda didn't trust myself either LOL. Anyways, the Cafe existed, so I figured I would try this instead because I knew they would make things way easier for my noob self.

Kept it simple, ordered The Classic...this time with a proper everything bagel! I guess the right kinda bagel really does make a massive difference. Aside from that, the overall package was phenomenal. Bagel was the right amount of toast, salmon was flavorful, cream cheese was on point, and onions were fresh. I like how all the items were separated out, so I had the choice of how much I wanted to put on there. Of course, I stuffed the whole thing...was more of a burger than a bagel at that point. 

Service here is fantastic. Everyone is super welcoming and very helpful. Which is obviously helps when dealing with my noob self.

I guess I also got lucky on the wait, because there was none at all at 5 pm on a Saturday. Apparently, that is not the case most of the time.

A note on the interior. It's a throwback diner, so you feel like you're in the 1950s. I don't care that much for that kinda thing, but others do.

In any case, I felt like I got my redemption on bagels, which is all I wanted. Happy to come back here, they sure know how to make a proper bagel!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-08-20,4.0,"Looks like a classic diner when you walk in - counter seats and booth seats. I love that their windows allow so much natural light in. I also love the little doodles they have around the bathrooms. Servers here are super kind and were willing to answer all the questions I had, especially when I was half brain-dead and was having trouble formulating my questions in the easiest way to understand. 

You can't go wrong with the classic! I like that it's deconstructed so you can decide how much of each ingredient you want to put on your bagel. The bagel was toasted just right, where it was crunchy on the edges, but not too much in the middle. Cream cheese was nice and fluffy, tomatoes were fresh, and salmon was also very fresh. There was definitely a handful of other items on the menu that I would have loved to try. Hoping to come back soon to taste them!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-11-07,5.0,"Although I did not go to the original location (because I wanted to sit down and enjoy my meal; the original location is a ""grab-n-go""), we went to this location instead. 

Arrived just after 10:30am and although packed, the wait time was about 10 minutes so a plus that I didn't have to wait too long!

I am a huge fan of lox in general so I immediately went with the build your own lox and Everything bagel board. It is such a simple dish but worth every bite. The lox were fresh; the capers, tomato and cream cheese added good flavor. Only thing I wish I could have asked for was whether I could order a different type of cream cheese and not have the original, but either way, super delicious!

Whether or not there is a wait, if you're in the area, check it out. This is a known place and there's a reason for that."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-09-05,5.0,"Now I wanna try out their other location at Russ & daughters... this place is bomb!!!!

Interior--located in Little Italy (or super close to it), this place got the right vibe: laid back, classic diner, with subtle quiet music in the background. The interior is very modern, and they for a bar and bunch of booths. 

Service--excellent!! My friend arrived late and they let me wait at the bar and provided great services during my wait. When we were having a hard time deciding since my friend didn't want fish, the server offered great helps on suggestions :)

Food--dang, my first savory bagel experience and this place did the magic. The bagel was toasted just right, the cream cheese tasted so light yet flavorful, and the smoke salmon was freshhhhh. 

No wonder this place is always on travelers' ""NYC bucket list""!! I can't wait to be back!!!!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-07-08,5.0,"Russ & Daughters Cafe is one of my favorite spots in New York. I just love the atmosphere and the staff. Had a great time and can't wait to come back to try more things on their menu.

What to order - Definitely try the Classic - Gaspe nova smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onion, capers and served with a bagel, bialy, shissel rye or pumpernickel. I love salmon so if you do too, you'll have no regrets ordering this one. It is a bit pricey but it's NYC so I already expected to pay that much for a bagel with salmon. I will tell you guys that the smoked salmon was the best smoked salmon I've ever had."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-12-23,4.0,"True Jewish soul food! I can't believe living in NY all my life, as a MOTT (member of the tribe) I never heard of R & Ds. Having seen a piece on CBS Sunday Morning, we ventured here for a Hanukkah breakfast. Delish.

Once you get by the wait for a table,(OyVey! the wait) you get to enjoy some of the best of potato latkes, smoked salmon and herring in cream sauce. The latkes warm and crunchy offset with either sour cream or natural applesauce, a must. The smoked salmon on a plain bagel with cream cheese. I'll give it a 'Good, not great' and the herring in cream sauce, I'll do it again. But for the next visit, which there will be, we will be making other selections so as to try what look like other delicious items.

The service was great with no complaints. Our waiter was accommodating and attentive. 

Lastly, the atmosphere. Sitting amongst what seemed to be a step back in time, the 1940's or 50's (Before my time.) Kinda looked like it was setup to film a ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" scene.

Will definitely be returning but at an off peak time."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-06-15,5.0,"Easily one of my FAVORITE places in NYC. We arrived at 2pm on Saturday and the wait was an hour for 2 people. The waiter was informative and polite. The interior was very cute. 

- Smoked whitefish chowder soup: They were able to split it into two bowls for sharing which is appreciated. The soup had the most perfect creamy consistency. It was slightly sweet which went well with the salty smoked whitefish. There were plenty of bite sized vegetables. I do wish they offered more fish.

- Shtetl (smoked sable) platter: This was life changing! Do yourself a favor and try it instead of getting the usual lox. The sable was SO delicious and buttery. Paired with goat cream cheese, tomato, onion and capers on top of toasted sesame bagel....it's one of the best things I've had not kidding.

I CANNOT WAIT TO COME BACK AND TRY THE REST OF THE MENU!!!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-06-20,4.0,"Food: 4/5
Stopped by for dinner with a friend. We ordered the chopped salad, the mixed green salad with salmon and a side of smoked salmon. The mixed green salad came with a house vinaigrette and it was delicious! It had a very generous portion of salmon and capers! My friend enjoyed the chopped salad as well. The side of smoked salmon was very savory and not too salty. Four slices for $11. 

Service: 5/5
Our waitress was a delight. She recommended my salad and I was very satisfied. She was courteous, sweet and accommodating.

Very cute and charming little place in the lower east side. There's a bar in the front and seating throughout the back. Had a charming bistro/cafe feel. Seemed like a great place for brunch. 

Overall: 4/5
Great place to grab a bite. If you're craving lox or caviar, this place is the place to go!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-09-10,5.0,"I've been a frequent visitor for Russ & Daughters for 3 years and never been to this cafe. It's really popular!!

Came here on Tuesday around 11am, the wait for 2 was about 15-25 min, which was not too bad for us. We ordered eggs benny, chopped liver & lower sunny side. 

The chopped liver was fresh, and the amount was pretty good in terms of the price. (We didn't finish the liver with all the crackers) highly recommended if you are fan for this.

The eggs benny & lower sunny side are classics for brunch, the eggs were cooked just the way we like, and the lox were so fresh."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-11-25,4.0,"I've been wanting to try Russ & Daughter's for a while but never really wanted to come all the way out to the LES and wait for a bagel. This location is a sit-down cafe (I didn't even know there was a second location!) I finally got the chance to try it when we came here for a team lunch. They don't accept reservations and we were a large group (9). Luckily, we were seated pretty quickly when we came in at around 12:45 on a Tuesday. They don't have a table that large so we were split up into two tables.

I never had an egg cream before. I found out about it when watching Phil Rosenthal's show on Netflix, so I figured - what better time to try it? I asked the waiter which was their most popular one and he said it was the chocolate. It wasn't bad - it basically tasted like chocolate milk with seltzer (there is no egg or cream in it). For food, our table shared the Potato Latkes (with applesauce and sour cream). These were nice and crispy. Just make sure you eat them while they're hot. I preferred it with the sour cream as opposed to the applesauce. For my main, I went with the Classic (gaspe nova smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onion, capers). I figured I should start there, since I've never dined here before. I had an everything bagel, which could have been a bit more toasted but it was a pretty solid bagel overall. They use whipped cream cheese, which I like. The salmon was great as well.

I've heard great things about the pastrami-cured salmon (and I love the Trader Joe's version of it), so I think I'll try that next time!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-12-01,4.0,"This is a real treat and HIGHLY recommended. We had usually used their other store for takeout.

We got one of the last tables (845 AM) before the crowds and wait began.

Service was excellent and who could not like the food. The only downside vs. takeout from their other store is that there are only a few salmon types available (vs. a zillion).

Coffees (with free and frequent refills!). Entrees were various bagels with salmon, ""Lower Sunny Side"", and granola. You will not be disappointed.

Happy Hanukkah, and to all a good food coma!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-07-29,5.0,"Wow! This place is totally worth the hype!!!

I got the classic board which comes with cream cheese, lox, tomato, capers, red onions, and your choice of bread, bagel, or bialy. I had a pumpernickel bagel, because I can never turn down a pumpernickel bagel. The salmon literally melts in your mouth. If you are a fan of lox, this is definitely one of the best!

There are two Russ and Daughter's within blocks of each other. Make sure to come to the cafe if you're looking to dine in. The other location is just a deli with no seating inside. 

If you are visiting New York, this is a must!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-04-17,5.0,"The fact that I've yet to review Russ & Daughters Cafe is appalling. Shame on me!

Simply put, though this annex doesn't have the history of the small Houston outpost, it was a legend the moment they broke ground. The grocer comes to life in the form of a full-fledged restaurant that's as important to the fiber of Lower East Side as any cultural powerhouse that's made the neighborhood famous throughout the world. Whether it's breakfast, lunch, or an early dinner--this IS New York.

I find myself there mid-morning most often, and you're going to have to wait if you time your visit even slightly incorrectly. Once you're there, grab a board with any number of different seafood items, and don't sleep on the breads. The bagels get the most love, but the pumpernickel is a standout as well.  Also, the whitefish chowder is the perfect accompaniment for cold days in the city."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-12-29,4.0,"The longstanding deli on East Houston is amazing so a restaurant is exactly what was needed. 

The menu prices fluctuate anywhere between an inexpensive matzah ball soup to the delicacies of caviar by the ounce. Traditional jewish cuisine and quality fresh fish such as herring and lox. Not much one can say poorly about R&D. The food and menu is straight forward. 

The only small concern was when the kitchen kept over-toasting the bagel. Sent it back once and it still came back slightly burnt, so we didn't bother sending it back again. The burnt outer rim was just peeled off. Not the worst thing. Would still recommend coming here.

Not much to say about the service. I am indifferent about it. It was not poor, but there isn't much to remember about the wait staff either.

Be prepared for a wait especially on the weekends."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-03-07,5.0,"This place is off the hook. Very unique...... especially if you reside in Charlotte NC (even though we travel the country often). The Bloody Mary was excellent, only mistake I made is I should have ordered one while I waited my hour for our seats. Hot smoke cold smoke platter was simple but so damn good. The potato latkes with the salmon roe is worth the trip all by themselves. The roe is a must with the latkes. Don't skip them. We also had the Matzo ball soup. This is just Jewish chicken noodle soup but my Wife loves chicken noodle soup. So this was her pick and it was perfect. The matzo was light but yet didn't fall apart on you till you went in with your spoon. My wife and I make usually 1 trip a year to NYC so we try not to just keep repeating the same places but it's hard not to go here every time. It's definitely one of the top 5 or 10 places I recommend to friends who have never been to NYC as a must stop."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-02-21,4.0,"I've been to the deli before but last night was my first visit to the cafe.  Though Yelp indicates no reservations, I noticed on Google a link to Resy so I booked a table for 4.  We came by for the Potato Latkes, which did not disappoint.  The stand-alone order gives you 3.  I ended up with the Lower Sunny Side which was 2 sunnyside eggs, 2 potato latkes and some smoked salmon.  The eggs were eggs but both the latkes and smoked salmon were excellent.  I didn't try any beverages but they had a number of options including homemade sodas, egg creams (including one with whiskey), beers and wines.  The only item I don't like here are the bagels - I had one a while ago and it was small, not at all fluffy and lacked any of the great bagel flavor I expect in a New York bagel.  However, if potato latkes or smoked salmon you seek, then Russ and Daughters Cafe will not disappoint."

I went with my boyfriends family and so, I got to try a little bit of everything. I usually don't bring money up, but the prices do not reflect the quality or value of this place.

I have been eating from the grab and go for a while now. But the cafe? The cafe is delightful! 

Today I had the smoked whitefish chowder and shared the croquettes and potato latkes with the wild salmon roe and creme fraiche. I found the croquettes to be a bit pricey since there were only 3 bites. But honestly? Didn't care, the quality of the fish, really is that good! 

That was my evening today. Soon, I will be coming back for brunch. And even though I already know we will have to be up early, I'm certain it will be worth the effort."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-03-02,4.0,"This is definitely a place to go to in NY for lox.

I had the lox bagel plate, the borscht and matzo ball soup, the kippered salmon salad and the knisch.

I really enjoyed it!! The salmons, both the kippered and the lox, were the best part of the meal, so make sure to load up on salmon and other fishes when you come here.
The lox was glistening, it was so fresh and the flavor was so delicious. The kippered salmon was perfectly baked and had a very nice slightly pickled taste. I really enjoyed the dill and capers that were very present in the salad...very fresh!

The ambiance is very nice too. Dimly lit at dinner time and not too crowded because who goes for bagel and lox for dinner??"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-03-24,5.0,"I was planning my trip to New York and was all over Insider looking for the best places to eat and this restaurant popped up as the best smoked salmon bagel in NYC, so I knew this place had to be on my itinerary. 

I'm not from New York but I think this place is located in the Lower East Side. I had a bunch of stuff planned throughout the day, so this ended up being a dinner ""take-out"" type of deal, but it was still worth it. Upon walking in, I realized that this place is an actual restaurant and not your regular bagel shop. I had no idea that they also sold a bunch of other stuff, in my mind I thought it was strictly bagels. I asked the host what she recommends, and she automatically said ""The Classic"". It's basically a whatever type bagel you want, with smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomato, onion and capers. I had it with the everything bagel but had to have it to go, so I couldn't really sit down and I can't really review the service other than the hostess was super professional and helpful. 

When I got back and settled down, I finally got to try it and I was blown away by how good this tastes! It's absolutely delicious. The salmon was so fresh, the cream cheese was the perfect compliment and the capers gave it a perfect crunch! This is definitely a must try, even if it's an 18$ bagel."

4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-08-12,5.0,"I have been to the Russ & Daughters store where you order to take food out, but I had never had the time to wait to get into the Russ & Daughters cafe...until this past weekend!

If you are going to visit Russ & Daughters Cafe on a weekend, be prepared for a wait.  My girlfriend and I arrived around 11am on a Saturday and were told we would have a one hour wait.  We left our number and were put onto a list to receive a text once our table was ready.  Fortunately, if you're into walking around the city, especially a historical district, then killing that hour will not be a big deal.  A quick walk around, a visit to Economy Candy and then a quick run through Essex Market and an hour had already passed!

As if there were an alarm set at the restaurant, exactly an hour after I had put my name down I received a text saying they were ready for us.  Once you receive the text, you need to respond with a confirmation and your table is held for 10 minutes (so don't stray too far away). 

We wound up sitting at the bar, and I have no problem with that.  The bar seating was comfortable and there is something wonderfully old fashioned about sitting at a bar in a classic New York City styled eatery.  While Russ & Daughters Cafe is not the original location, it could certainly pass for it.  The lighting, shelves and signage are all modeled after the original store.  Mostly made up of white, black and silver colors (with some greys tossed in), you definitely get the feel of an establishment that was opened decades ago and then recently renovated.

Since we sat at the counter/bar, the bartender had to double as our waiter and she did a fantastic job.  She was very open to questions about the menu and she whipped up the drinks we ordered super quick.  Here's a rundown of what we had:

COFFEE SODA
Made from the soda machine at the bar, this drink uses a syrup made from Russ & Daughters' own roast.  This drink was absolutely delicious.  If you are a coffee fan, I would totally recommend it.

FERSHNIKIT EGG CREAM
Made from a combination of Kings County Distillery Chocolate Whiskey, Fox's U-Bet Chocolate Syrup, Milk and Seltzer, this drink was absolutely delicious and had just the right balance between sweetness and a hint of Whiskey flavor.

SOFT SCRAMBLED EGGS (W/PADDLEFISH CAVIAR)
This dish was a very decadent, which is exactly why we ordered it!  Go big or go home, right?  The eggs in this dish are scrambled, but instead of your typical chunks of egg, this was a custard-like dish of eggs with a line of caviar lined on top.  You would think this amount of caviar would not be enough, but in fact it was plenty!  The caviar's flavor was potent enough that there was enough to have the caviar flavor permeate very bite.  

The caviar was served with toasted challah bread.  I wound up spreading the eggs and caviar on slices of bread like it was some insanely expensive butter and it was fantastic.  Every bite was delicious with some crunch and chewiness all at the same time.  This is a very pricey dish ($75 when I ordered it) but it was worth trying at least once.

SHTETL
This dish comes with smoked sable, goat cream cheese, tomato, onion, capers and a bagel.  The sable was delicious.  Smooth, creamy and the smoked flavor was not overwhelming.  I really do recommend combining all the ingredients on the board for the most flavorful and satisfying bite.

CHOPPED LIVER
This is more of an appetizer than a main dish, but they do not skimp on the amount of chopped liver.  Several Matzo crackers are included along with pickled red onion.  Trust me when I say you want to combine all the ingredients into one bite for maximum satisfaction!  I was impressed by how the liver was not too heavy or gamey.  It also spread on the crackers perfectly without breaking them into bits.

I absolutely loved my first experience and Russ & Daughters cafe and I really look forward to another trip to try more deliciousness soon!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-01-12,5.0,"WOW literally the best bagels I've ever tried!! I got the caviar cream cheese that has scallions inside with capers, tomatoes, onions, and the Norwegian salmon. When you enter the restaurant it looks more like a deli and you have to grab a number first. Then they call your number and take your order! The guy that helped me was super friendly and he also let me sample some cream cheese. You can also sample different salmon but I already knew which one I wanted. There's also tea and coffee you can grab as well. Definitely recommend!!"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-11-03,4.0,"I came here for a leisurely lunch after a friend recommended it to me. Since I was by myself I easily got a spot on the counter but there was quite a bit of wait for parties of two and more so be prepared for that if you come. I ordered latkes and pastrami smoked salmon and tried the breakfast martini. Everything was pure indulgence! It was a fantastic solo lunch and I must come back! That said, I wish it were less expensive! With the menu prices I'm more inclined to purchase the goods at their store and have the meal at home. But it's certainly a great spot for a special brunch or lunch with good company."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-01-22,5.0,"I've been to the bagel shop (for lack of better terms) of Russ and Daughters one too many times. How can you not get the classic lox bagel for breakfast when you're in the area? Anyways, Russ and Daughters Cafe is a cozy place a couple blocks away that has a seating area while the ""deli"" does not. They also have a much more expansive menu, but me being me, I stuck with the bagel and lox and shared a platter of potato latkes with a friend. Luckily there is a more than adequate amount of everything, especially that delicious melt in your mouth lox- it's literally amazing. 

I'm not sure if it's from ACME or somewhere else but you got to try it if you like smoked fish. Since there's a lot going on, definitely eat each half of the bagel individually or else it'll spill out (as a witness of my friend's bagel lol). In regards to the potato latkes, they were definitely filling and super crispy as well. I'm not a fan of applesauce but that's why there's sour cream. I can definitely see myself coming back and will hopefully try the babka french toast as well."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-03-19,4.0,"Smoked herring wasn't too salty, matzo ball soup was clean and yummy, latkes were well portioned. Everything was delicious but nothing particularly memorable.

Came here on a rainy day and didnt have to wait at all. Service wasnt the best, but food came out quickly and it was easy to flag down a server for whatever we needed."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2020-02-25,5.0,"I ordered the classic board, was a good bagel with salmon and cream cheese. I got a nice spot on the bar and the bartender was a friendly guy. I was not in the mood for alcohol beverages but the cocktail list looked great."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-08-07,4.0,Very cute diner/cafe. It's a nice sit down experience compared to the deli on Houston. It's really high quality product and great service. The wait is insane though so recommend eating before / putting your name down and then going somewhere else for a drink in the meantime.
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-02-15,4.0,"I tried a bagel with smoked salmon in it. The smoked salmon pieces were really good. I usually don't eat cream cheese but it went well with the salmon. Unfortunately I'm just not a bagel person as bagels are too dense and hard for my taste.

It's quite pricey here, I spent a good $18 for my bagel.

We also tried the black and white cookie and that was really good! It was lemon-y and the chocolate was flavorful. The cookie was pricey too. $4 for one cookie!!!! It was like the size of my palm.

This place served a lot of different sweets as well and they all looked good. They serve by the pound.

You can also purchase their cream cheese and their smoked salmons by the pound as well"
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-07-27,5.0,"I've visited the Russ & daughters cafe at the Jewish museum, and the original spot on Houston - out of the three of them, this cafe is probably my favorite. I tried the potato latkes (which they don't have on the menu uptown) and classic board. Everything was delicious, and the service was great. I also recommend the babka French toast."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2018-12-11,5.0,"Y'all are crazy if you don't think this place has some of the best bagels and lox on the planet. They been doing it forever and the cafe is such a great addition to their little lox empire. Sure, the wait times can be ridiculous but, it's worth it people!

I normally get ""the classic"" board which is all the standard fix-ins for a lox sandwich and it never disappoints. On top of my wonderfully standard order, I got the matzo ball soup and the latkes because I was still in the window of Hanukah. They were super tasty and I'd definitely get the soup again...souper comforting, get it ;)

Thank you for existing Russ & daughters. You bring a tear to my eye every time :)"

Recommendations: If you want to splurge, you have to get the latkas. 

Would I come back?: Yes! 

Tips: Get there early to get a table or put your name down. On a first date? Get a seat at the bar to sit next to your date and have a more intimate talk. 

Review: Russ & Daughters is probably one of my favorite bagel shops, so I was very excited to get a chance to go to the cafe finally. We made a mistake on going on Memorial Day, which made the cafe packed and chaotic. Since it was closing at 3 (make sure to check for holiday times), there was a waitlist and wait for an hour for two people. They continued to take names and phone numbers until 2, where they would rudely turn people away. 

Once we were alerted for our table, it was another 15-minute wait until we were finally seated. However, once we were sitting, it was a fantastic experience. The cafe has a modern diner feel, with waiters wearing stylish white coats. The menu had a range of items to enjoy from challah toast to eggs benedict. However, the classic is a build your lox plate with your choice of bagel. FYI, your menu also serves as a food mat, which makes it all the better. The bagel was amazing as a Russ & Daughter's bagel should be and the option to make your lox bagel the way you want it was delicious."
4,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,2019-08-03,4.0,"Really top notch quality fish. Everything is fresh & scrumptious. You really can tell they've been doing this for a long time & perfected the process. My only gripe is with the check in process, the wait is long & a bit disorganized."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-05-17,5.0,"Favorite neighborhood pie company. Delicious sour cherry pie & coconut custard 9"" pies. Veggie quiche is also delicious. Friendly staff and so grateful they are open during COVID. Order online and put in time you want to pick up or get delivered."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-03-20,5.0,"Leaving signs on the sidewalks really works!! We walked by this place and the sign just grabbed our attention! We decided to go in and get a slice of pie!

The honey pudding pie was really good!! You can taste the honey and the creamy filling! The portion was a bit small for the price. We were so happy we stopped by. 

Would love to go back to try the other pies! Many options!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-04-25,4.0,"My favorites are the black bottom almond chess pie and the sour cherry pie. If you love marzipan and dark chocolate you will love the black bottom almond chess pie. I don't usually like fruit pies but the sour cherry pie is perfectly tart and well-balanced.

Other flavors that I've tried:

Salty chocolate chess: this one was decent but it was basically just a brownie with some pie crust

Chicken pot pie: pretty good, a little watery but didn't bother me much as the crust on top was still nice and flakey

Blueberry: not bad, very neutral tasting. I prefer the tartness in the sour cherry

Pecan pie: not good at all, pecan pie is usually one of my favorites but the texture was very odd and gelatinous and just not pleasant

Pie aside, customer service can be pretty hit or miss"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-02-29,4.0,"Cute tiny pie shop with an assortment of fresh vs. refrigerated flavors of pie. We tried the brown butter honey pecan, which I liked but my boyfriend was not impressed by. It was a little too sweet and I wish it had been served warm, but I liked the top crust-like nutty layer.

There is only room to seat about 4 people, so we ate standing. I'd recommend taking to go and heating up the pies on your own."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,"Petee's truly does great pie. They're located in the heart of LES in a shop with limited seating but a lot of dine in customers.

You can't go wrong with any of the pies. They have both gluten free and vegan options, so there's literally something for everyone. I visited on a Thursday night around 10pm and there were at least 10 flavors to choose from. We got the key lime meringue and a chocolate chess chocolate cream pie. Both were delicious - one tart and fruity and the other rich and chocolatey. A great combo to share!

I won't go anywhere else for my future pie needs. Try Petee's!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-02-19,4.0,"I think it's a really great pie, but I didnt think it was worth the cost of the pie, which was about $7 a slice...and that slice was awkwardly small. It's possible to eat the pie in three bites if you wanted to. The taste of the pie was great. The crust was perfect and the it was not ultra sweet, which helped emphasize the great flavor. 

It didn't seem busy enough to stay in business as we were the only customers in the store for a 15 minute span. If I were the owner of this place, I would consider adding additional products to span multiple price zones, which might increase foot traffic throughout the day."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-12-21,3.0,"Very intimate dessert spot, close proximity to JZM Subway station. Location is out of the way of the high traffic regions of the Bowery.

The location itself is quite small. It has seating for up 6 people inside. The selections were all mounted on a rack and to be honest, none of them really are staggering from a visual appeal. There are a few refrigerated options in a casing below, and even there it doesn't have much charm. 

The staff was friendly and was patient while I tried to make a decision. I opted for the Lavish Chocolate Cream($6.75/slice) and another selection from the Ice box. 

The chocolate cream was superior, the crust was very flakey and a good sign of fresh ingredients and proper fat ratio. The other Alice was quite forgettable. For $6+ a slice, the portions are alittle light for what you get. Not a very intriguing experience all in all, but I'm glad we made the trip"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-01-04,4.0,"Stopped by here for some pies and to wait for Attaboy while we got out of the cold and the pies were surprisingly quite delicious!

We got our pie a la mode and thought it was quite befitting of the pie. There are a few varieties when you go and I can only attest to the cherry pie which was delicious."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-12-23,4.0,"Solid, good.

Had this place before years ago, walked by one evening and thought could give them another try since I am a fan of pies.  

Had a slice of the Wild Maine Blueberry and a slice of Chocolate Cream.  Both were decent, enjoyable.  At $6 a slice, it's a bit pricey for what you're getting.  By no means super small, but you can get a whole pie at Trader Joes for $6.  I understand it's NYC, cost of doing business and such, but still hard to justify splurging like this.  Maybe if it was life-changing pie, I'd change my perspective.  I do appreciate a business willing to fill a certain void such as selling pies in the city, though.  I will say, I do prefer this place over Four & Twenty Blackbirds, a pie shop in Brooklyn that sells slices for almost $6.


FYI here is my own personal rating system

5=worth a trip, something you'll crave
4=worth getting but only if you're already in the area
3=only worth it if it's free/discounted, not worth paying full price
2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space
1=the place should shut down"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-10-27,5.0,"Love a good Petee pie. This place is tiny but full of heart. You walk in and instantly smell the butter and love. There's not a lot of seating, probably like 8 seats max, but I've never had a problem with getting a spot to sit. 

I'm not a huge pie person, but every so often I get extremely specific cravings for Petee's pies. There's a huge variety of flavors/types to choose from and the seasonal choices are great. I've never had a bad pie from here, but some of my favorites are the banana cream, coconut custard, and the almond chess. You can taste how fresh the ingredients are, especially with the fruit pies. The pie crust is buttery and flaky. Everything just goes together really well and I don't think you can go wrong with any slice.

They serve the pies on cute plates. You serve yourself water and put your plates away into the dish bin. Easy as pie. Highly recommend this place!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-09-22,1.0,"I was so excited to return after my last experience. I came on a Sunday afternoon and got a key lime pie. This was probably the WORSE key lime pie I ever had in my life. The consistency was watery. It wasn't as tart in flavor but very eggy. The cream on top tasted like it's been sitting in the fridge for a long time and the crust was stale. 

After a couple more bites in, I realized the pie might have gone rancid. I felt sick and too grossed out to finish."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-12-02,5.0,"I walked into this place quite by accident, but boy was I glad to have stopped in.

I walked by on a rainy day and saw a crowd lined up, so I decided to join them. As the door opened, I was greeted with the divine smell of pies.  As I walked in, I was welcomed by pies in all shapes and sizes. 

The place is small but has a wide range of pies they sell. You can buy a whole pie or a slice of pie.  

I decided to have a slice of pumpkin pie. The pie was delicious, and it was just made. The crust was perfectly baked, and the pumpkin seemed fresh.

I will definitely be coming back to get some more pie."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-09-08,5.0,"Interior--once i walked it, the smell of deliciousness caught me off guard!! Love it haha. There's not much seating area though since most of the place was taken up as the kitchen/bakery.

Service--service was great!! Very friendly staff and they tried their best to accommodate everyone's need even when they were busy.

Taste--definitely recommend the banana cream, so so tasty and not at all heavy. If you're a banana fan, this would be the perfect dessert. The cheesecake was alright, but since this place specializes in pie, I would just recommend getting pies. 

It's about $6 a piece which was a bit pricy to me, the slice wasn't too big, but a great experience to just chill with friends and grab something different for desserts rather than ice cream for once haha."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-05-07,5.0,"We dragged ourselves to Petee's after a huge lunch at Katz. I'm so glad we did. Undoubtedly the best banana cream pie I've ever had. Being southern, I like to think I've had my fair share of pie. The crust was buttery, perfect, and just the right thickness. Months later I'm still thinking about this pie."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-08-16,5.0,"Came here for late night dessert and it was great. The ladies working here are friendly and helpful. We asked a lot of questions and they answered them with warmth and great information.

We got a vegan peach pie, regular peach pie and banana cream pie. 

They were all great! Really worth a visit if you'd like some tasty dessert.

Their to-go fork is made of organic bamboo so that's awesome if you worry about the environment like I do and hate getting to-go silverware."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-12-12,5.0,"Why is pie so good? Every time I'm in the area I cannot resist going into Petee's for a slice. It smells like heaven inside.

Cherry Pie is my favorite, but I really feel like you can't go wrong with any of the choices. Just go with your eyes and your heart.

Great place for dessert after dinner. There's a small counter with about 4 seats that you can enjoy your pie on."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-01-11,5.0,"From the moment you walk in, you'd smell the fragrance of the baked pies. Immediately you'd want to have a slice of whatever that is up in the air. Petee's offer a good variety of flavors, enough for  the wide variety of different tastebuds and not too many for you to spent half an hour deciding. 

The pies were all delicious and the shop has a fair amount of room for two to sit down, chat and just enjoy your pies. Would definitely recommend if you're in the lower east side after you've finished your meal!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-11-18,4.0,"I came here to pick up a birthday pie slice and a couple to go. First impression was that it sounded great, but pretty expensive for slices of pie.

I ordered the pumpkin and apple pie with a cinnamon roll. The pies were a gift so I can't speak to them, although, the reviews I received raved about the slices. They looked incredible and the filling was a beautiful color. The cinnamon roll, after being heated, had a delectable gooey and sweet icing that complemented very well with the dough -- which was buttery and rich. A really great cinnamon roll and I would come back for that. 

Overall, a solid place for pie but be prepared to spend more than you might think. One star off because there aren't that many places to sit and enjoy and for prices."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-11-15,5.0,"Amazing pie and good customer service. 

You can buy pie slices or full pies. I love their seasonal pies (pumpkin!). Slices are approximately $6. Flavors are spot-on and they are not too sweet. 

I personally love the Black Bottom Almond Chess (and all their chess pies) and the pumpkin pie. The workers are also great at describing flavors to you and giving you recommendations."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-04-24,4.0,"I am not a big pie person, I usually veer towards cakes, cupcakes, and cookies, but I've heard good things about Petee's Pie Company. So I tried a slice of the Banana Cream Pie and the NY Sour Cherry Pie and both were really good! Sweet but not overly sweet and it's so light that it's so easy to consume the whole slice in one sitting!

I definitely have to go back and try different slices - and get more of the Banana Cream and Sour Cherry!

Also, it's a small venue so there isn't much seating. But the seating available is windowsill so you can relax and people watch while you enjoy some delicious pie! Or you can get your slices/pies to go."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-05-17,1.0,"I had Petee's Pie twice: I ordered one time and I had take out at the shop. My order had a problem twice the two times I ordered. Don't get me wrong. The pies are delicious but is it upsetting when I receive my order only to find it is not correct. 

The first time I ordered, one of my pie slices were hilariously small. I ordered two chocolate pies. One of the slices was normal sized but the other must have been the last piece left over because it was the appropriate size for a doll. 

The second time I ordered from the window at the store. Not only did the lady get my order wrong, she threw me an attitude while I was paying for the order... even as I was tipping her for her service. Really?! Their pies are good but I'm not sure it is enough to make up for their blunders and bad attitude!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-02-18,5.0,"After all these years, Petee's continues to set the standard by which all pie shops should be measured. With their use of premium ingredients and amazing varieties (e.g., fruit pies, nut pies, gluten-free, etc), there is a choice for everyone. The smell of freshly baked pies upon entry is worth the trip in and of itself. As a fan of the fruit pies, I find it impossible to resist their Local Apple or Wild Maine Blueberry. With the perfect crust and blend of flavors in every bite, you can't go wrong with ANY version. There were several occasions where I entered with the intention of purchasing a slice yet left with a whole pie.  Petee's is an establishment that is worthy of being called a destination visit.  If you happen to live in the area, that is just ""whipped cream on the pie""!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-02-28,5.0,While strolling the streets of NY I wanted something sweet and delicious. Found this place and I'm a big fan of coconut custard pie! This pie is truly delicious! Hit the spot! The freshness and buttery crust is on point!
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-12-02,1.0,"Overhyped and not worth the $$.

I came here on a freezing night after dinner with friends, one of my friends was raving about Petee and even thought it was cold out. There was a line. The interior was small, not ideal with a big group. I recommend grabbing and going if you must try this place.

So, in the end I paid too much for a slice of apple pie, the filling was watery and the flavors were underwhelming. I've honestly had better apple pie from Target. I could have gotten a whole pie for that price. 

I'll be passing next time."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-05-18,5.0,"My favorite pie is pecan pie and although they had it, I decided to be adventurous and try something new.  I am pleasantly surprised. I went with the banana cream pie. It's fluffy, it's not too sweet, its crumbly, it's creamy, it's everything it should be. It taste kinda like banana pudding. 

Honestly, $6 a slice is quite steep for just a slice of pie but it's a delicious slice so I guess NYC can charge this outrageous price.

It's a tiny location, no bathroom and they do accept cards. Go here whenever you're in the lower east side."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-05-15,3.0,"Meh, wasn't impressed. I'd give it a solid 3.5. 
The pies tasted okay--we ordered 3 slices, one blue berry, one apple, and one blackberry currant. They all had distinct flavors, but nothing that wowed me. I'm from the south, and I guess I expect different. The pies tasted a bit too sweet, and reminded me of a sugary jam with thicker consistency...personally not a fan. Also the filling to crust ratio was off for my liking (too much filling for the crust). But plus points for being open until midnight and for having buttery flaky crust."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-05-03,4.0,"Me and my friends were craving a blueberry pie so we decided to check this spot out because of its high ratings. 

Walking into this shop was a experience! The smell of the fresh pies was so good and got me craving all the slices they had on display. The service was amazing and we were in and out of the store super quick. 

The blueberry pie itself was good, especially the crust. It is not the best I have had but we definitely enjoyed it. The portions was perfect too, not too much crust or blueberries, the perfect balance. I definitely want to come back here and try their other pies, especially the salty chocolate chess pie."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-03-09,4.0,"This was such a great find! I finally went to get some pot pies last night. The moment I went in it already smelled heavenly. The person who took my order was nice. I was even properly instructed of the reheating. I did not know that they have a Brooklyn location that has pork pot pies which I would love to try. I ordered two chicken pot pies for me and my better half. Their chicken pot pie is quite different from what I tried in the past where it was on the creamy side. Regardless, it was delicious. I also bought a slice of their lavish chocolate cream pie. Wow, the chocolate cream pie was amazing and I usually just get the one from Wegman's. I appreciate the freshness of the crust and other ingredients. I definitely want to have more of their chocolate cream pie. I hope to come back!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-09-27,1.0,"Tonight I strolled in after nearly walking about excited to get a slice of pie. 
I ordered a slice of Wild Blueberry Pie, and had the counter person put it to go. I was pleasant even if the person was slow to attend to me. He went to the back and was chatting w/a co-worker and placed the slice on a box to go. It was over $6.50 for the slice. Pricey! 
So, long story short, I got home and as I opened the box I found the smallest slice I d ever seen. 
To say the least I was really disappointed to pay so much for so little and w/slow service to boot. 
I'll
Never go here again nor would I recommend you do so. 
Too pricey and for too little. Better to go to While Foods to get a whole pie for the slice of two here at this far overrated place."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-12-04,3.0,I had the apple pie with ice cream. The pie was about average and the portion was very small for the price ($10). I thought the crust was a little salty. The pie shop was very busy and lots of people were picking up their orders to take out. There's a small counter section to sit and eat but there are only about 4 or 5 seats.
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-11-21,4.0,"Petee's is such a lovely and well-designed bakery that has an open layout that, whenever the counter is free, lets you sit and appreciate a moment of peace amidst the busy New York hustle and even better -- with a slice of pie.

I will say that the Banana Cream was a big disappointment given all the positive reviews about it. I am from the South where a banana cream can be done like no other, but I think that this pie simply did not deliver. I have some high praises to sing for the Salty Chocolate Chess though. That is a GREAT pie. What a beautiful balance of salt and sweetness. They even have them in mini sizes which I had purchased for my friend as a gift, but it definitely did not make it to her apartment. 

Definitely worth a try. With such a wide variety of flavors, you are sure to find something that stands out."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-11-09,3.0,Wasn't too impressed with the pies. They were a little dry and tasted old.  pieces were too small for what they charge them for. We got the whiskey walnut and pecan pie.
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-05-07,3.0,"Meh. Loved the service but for the price, you get hardly anything. My apple pie was the tiniest piece known to man. Loved the crust though. Nice and soft and flaky. Add homemade ice cream that was really good.  He warmed up the pie for me too, which I loved. 
The mini lemon pie wasn't my favorite but the hubs loved it. The sour NY cherry was really good too. 
Wouldn't go back but fun to try."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-03-06,5.0,Coconut custard was a terrible choice. The lightness of the cream filling paired with the crisped to perfection sweet coconut topping and edges is a recipe for complete disaster
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-09-14,4.0,"my experience - 
right when you walk in, you can tell it is a very tiny pie shop and there is not much room to sit. to be honest, it can maybe fit up to 10 people. there are many options and you can see what they have left and what their seasonal flavors are. i knew i wanted the salted chocolate chess pie and the almond chess pie, but they sold out of the almond one. i decided to try their seasonal flavor, jersey peach. there was only one person working the cashier so it went a bit slow, but there is also not much room for there to be more than two people working at a time. 

price - 
$6 per slice
$13.06 w/ tax

salted chocolate chess pie slice - 
this slice had a harder crust, much richer, dense 
very strong chocoalte flaovr almond brownie-like 
personally, i preferred the taste of this pie but the crust of the other one. 

jersey peach pie slice - 
canned peach, flaky crust. but i wouldn't get it again. i think the peach flavor was too artificial. i really enough pastry puff crusts and this was definitely flakier and more buttery. 

i am definitely not a pie person, but this was delicious!! for the price and the size of the slice, it is a bit excessive but if you are splitting it with someone it isnt too bad. for someone who loves cakes and sweets, this was something different but worth trying. we were lucky that there was no line but im glad i was able to give it a try"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-09-23,4.0,"My boyfriend used to live next door to this place so I always walked past it, but never tried it until recently. If you LOVE pies, then definitely try this out. While I typically enjoy pies, they're usually not my first-pick when it comes to dessert. That being said, this place was still amazing! You can order by the slice or you can pick up a whole pie. They have a bunch of different flavors, depending on their availability and season. We got 2 slices to go - pecan and blueberry. Both were really good, but I liked the blueberry way more. Something about the fruitiness and the pie crust just made it really memorable. The pecan (while still really good), wasn't my favorite - but my boyfriend really liked this one. Overall - really good. Definitely try if you love pies!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-04-16,1.0,"Rudest customer service ever!! 
I called to see if they were able to make a pie, I was told they only carry them in the fall, fair, but when I asked if they could make one now, they said no and hung up. Seriously, WTF? Especially in this time when people are stuck at home and trying to find comfort in the little things, it's great to know Peetee's is rude with the worst customer service. Thanks for nothing!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-12-26,5.0,Best Key Lime Pie. Ever. Better than the ones in the Keys. The coconut in the crust and the meringue definitely made this pie stand out! I must come back for the other goodies this place has to offer.
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-01-18,4.0,"the perfect ""PIE"" sign outside was too adorable, especially since Nat and I were hopelessly turned around after getting out from the subway. The place is TINY with only 5 stools but you can either stand at the counter (which is what we did) or take it to go! We got both our orders to go since I knew I would not be finishing these treats and they packaged it up so cutely. 

I got the chocolate chess pie and NY sour cherry while Natalie got the blueberry with maple whipped cream. All three were so tasty! I love chess pie in all forms and the chocolate did not disappoint. Next time, I'll have to try the almond one.

My only gripe is that the slices are pricey for the size but this is a very, ahem, American way of thinking so I still highly recommend for a once in awhile treat :)"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2018-12-30,5.0,"PERFECT PIE PLACE MAKES PERFECT TASTING PIE!

I'm shocked that someone called this place mediocre. When you enter, you are greeted by the warm smells of a delicious assortment of pie. I ordered the honey pecan bourbon pie a la mode, and my friend ordered the sweet potato pie.

The sweet potato pie was good, but the honey pecan bourbon! This is the thing dreams are made of! Each bite gave me power and strength to continue eating the next piece until there was no more pie left! The cashier was also really nice to us, and she gave us an oatmeal cookie.

Great pie, great customer service, what more can you ask for?"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-09-05,5.0,"ALL of the pies are amazing here but if I had to choose one pie that's my favorite, it's gotta be the chocolate chess pie. So flaky and sweet but not too rich. 

I've tried their apple pie, blueberry pie and many others - you cannot go wrong with any choice. Add a scoop of ice cream for added yummyness. I added their goat cheese ice cream once to the pie, and it was sooo good. 

I highly recommend this place!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-09-02,5.0,"Years ago, I saw Petee's on a list of best pies in New York, and they've never disappointed me. I always get a slice of one of their fruit pies (most recently the Maine blueberry) with vanilla ice cream, which is heavenly. The slices here are pretty expensive - $6, plus $3 extra if you want ice cream, but still worth it. My favorite pie in the city."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-07-20,5.0,"This place is very small (3 or 4 seats by the window), but it serves up amazing pie! I ordered the banana cream pie; it was fresh, creamy with perfectly flakey crust. On the price side, it's a bit much for a slice ($6 or $7), but I could definitely see myself shelling out money for multiple servings. This is probably one of my favorite dessert spots.   

Taste: 5/5
Portions: 4/5
Price: 4/5
Atmosphere: 2/5
Service: 5/5"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-01-05,5.0,"Tried the lemon meringue (my fav), blueberry, cherry, and apple pies. All of them were excellent and fresh! Super friendly service as well."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-06-30,5.0,"My partner and I came here as a last resort when all the ice cream places we stopped by had closed for the night, and I'll have to say that we lucked out!

The second you step on, you're greeted by the delicious smell of warm buttery pie crusts and right in front of the door lay the pies. There are refrigerated ones and ones that sit on a rack, all of which look amazing! It was actually pretty difficult for us to choose just one flavor to go for. But we chose the banana cream pie at the end and it was food heaven. The cream on top has just a hint of sweetness to it and there are sprinkles of salt here and there. The banana layer is sweet, fresh, and cold (perfect for a summer night). The crust (which is always my favorite layer) was absolutely fantastic! It was buttery and flakey, but not so flakey that it's impossible to pick up with a fork. It's the perfect level of flakiness. 

They also offer maple cream and ice cream (as extras for the pies), and there are drinks for when you're feeling thirsty (for more pie).

It's actually bizarre that I've never been here before, given that I live in the neighborhood, but I'm definitely going to be coming back for more in the future!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-12-02,2.0,"I was in the mood for pie and since I was in the area, I stopped in on a Saturday night, around 6pm. There weren't a lot of pies on display and the ones that were on display didn't seem appetizing. While my friend and I were Yelping other dessert spots close by, I overheard the employee tell a customer they had just about every pie available in the back. We decided to order 2 whole pies to bring home and then a slice to stay. The total for 2 coconut custard pies and a slice of banana cream pie was $79! The banana cream pie was good, it wasn't amazing and pretty much standard in comparison to ones I have had in the past. I noticed a lot of pre-orders on the side waiting to be picked up, I took this as a good sign. Coconut custard is my favorite type of pie. I have had low end versions from the supermarket to bakeries to restaurants. This coconut custard pie was the worst one I have ever had. It tasted like a steamed egg (that's the best way to describe it). It was so bland and disgusting. For $35, I expected a good tasting pie. My friend said hers was gross as well. Maybe we both got a bad pie but it definitely was NOT worth it. I have had better pies for $8."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2018-11-16,4.0,"Late night pie! LES has all the late night yummies and Petee's is one (Empanada mama also super close by!). 

There's a great range of flavors but honestly, the level of delicousness is uneven. For the ~$6/slice price you really feel it if you don't get a good piece. What's great? Any nut-based pie like the brown butter pecan or whiskey walnut. Golden, warm, sugary, wonderful. What's good? Anything with chocolate like the chocolate chess. That topped with the maple whipped cream is a delight. The whipped cream is thick and flavorful. What's not so good? The fruit pies - especially when not super warm. I tried the sour cherry and found the flavor to be quite bland and not too different than store bought fruit pies. 

Next time I'll make sure to go ""nuts"" when I go to Petees."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-04-18,5.0,"I am not a pie expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I do know for a fact that this tiny shop deserves to be recognized. Why? Because they specialize in something that I usually don't want and now I tell people I know to go try.

With a selection of about 15 pie flavors changing with the season, broken up into four categories, I have enjoyed every piece of pie so far. What I have tried includes the Banana Cream (favorite), Whiskey Pecan, Key Lime, Almond Chess, Granny Smith Apple, and more. Never a disappointment, often a pleasant surprise, just close your eyes and pick one.

One key aspect why I love their pies is that they are not sugary sweet like in most diners or dessert shops. They have a fantastic balance no matter what flavor you choose. All winners! There are a few counter seats by the window in this little shop and the service is very friendly. Go check it out!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2018-10-12,5.0,"Stopped in here last weekend with a friend who was dying to try their ""slice cream"" which is a mix of a piece of pie of your choice with their ice cream. She ordered the blueberry pie and I was fortunate enough to sneak a bite and it was truly delicious. The blueberries were so fresh and the ice cream was really creamy. 

Since I'm GF they did have gluten-free pumpkin pie which I definitely was happy about, and I'd be curious to see if I could try one of their chess pies because it's made with cornmeal, but I'd need to find out more details. 

There's not very much seating inside this location and on a warmer day, it was definitely tough to stand inside for while because the place was warm from cooking all the delicious pies. 

If I get the opportunity to return, I definitely will be!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-06-22,4.0,"It's pretty hard to find pie that isn't ridiculously sweet where the sugar overpowers everything else. Petee's Pies really hits the mark with their pies! We tried the strawberry rhubarb and it was amazing! Perfect balance of sweet and tart from the strawberry and rhubarb, and the crust is so flaky and buttery. Definitely a must try if you like pie"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-06-22,3.0,"3.5 stars. I'm not really a fan of pies or desserts in general and I definitely think $6 a slice is really expensive for the portion. It's literally the smallest slice I've ever been given at a bakery or restaurant. It's also not the best pie, but the crust is flakey, buttery and beats any pie you'll ever find at your local supermarket. Again it's $6 for a tiny slice...
The filling is really just okay, perhaps it's just really simple. The pecan one was a little too sweet for me. I got the blueberry one which was better suited for my taste since it wasn't too sugary.  Maybe I haven't found the perfect pie for me.
If you're really into pies, I guess you'll enjoy it. It's a nice homemade pie, just kinda pricey."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-12-24,5.0,"So happy Petee's had tons of pies for walk-ins. Saw Nikita and she's always so kind and friendly. Thank you, Nikita. 

Wish they had cheesecakes though especially during the holidays but picked up two pies instead, their banana cream pie and their pecan pie. Maybe in the future, we can have the option to order cheesecakes for pick up instead? Thank you. Your cheesecakes are the best and we really want our family get togetherness to try them too!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-11-22,2.0,I paid over 6 bucks for this tiny piece of pie! Hella overpriced and it wasn't even that good. Iv had so much better for half the price. Don't waste your time. I wouldn't come back.
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2020-02-18,5.0,Love the pies here. I got the coconut custard pie and chicken pot is well made and taste like its homemade!
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-03-19,3.0,"Good, but not great, pies - 3.5 stars rounded down because of price.

Both pies we tried, the salty chocolate chess and wild blueberry, weren't super flavorful and were even a little bland. We actually ordered another pie, the pecan, but received a second slice of the chocolate chess (sadly only realized when we got home). 

Overall, I would stop by again to try the Meyer lemon since it was sold out when we came, but otherwise would not return."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-02-14,5.0,"I love pie! I feel like there's not enough pie shops in Manhattan. I've been coming to Petees pies for years and buy my pies during special holidays. They make it such an easy ordeal compared to other bakeries I tried going to.

I've gotten pies for friends house parties, Christmas, thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, you name it. I love their online ordering system. They make it such a breeze. I can order whatever pie I want, pay online, and just schedule a pick up! It's great. 

Every time I've been here the people who work behind the counter are just so welcoming and nice. And the smell when you walk in is just delicious. They're open until midnight most nights so if you ever want a sweet treat after dinner petees is a great choice! 

My favorite pies are their apple or anything chess but I've had a good sample of most of their pies and they're all just so good!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-02-24,4.0,"I was pretty shocked when I found out Petee's Pie company was still open when I googled it at around 10:00 PM at night (this was last september). I guess the hipsters in the LES get pie cravings late at night once their finished once their drug induced degeneracy binges end late at night. This place closes at 1:00 AM.

Seeing this at the time, I walked over and found that surprisingly, there were still quite a few pies which hadn't sold out at 11:00 PM at night. 

I ordred one piece of apple pie, and one piece of the Maine blueberry (which was more like a crumble than a pie). The apple pie was very good, but I wouldn't say it was anything out of the ordinary. It was a solid piece of apple pie. The blueberry was a little better, but still not knocked out of the park quality.

Still, because of the great hours at this location, as well as the wide ranges of pies, I think they deserve a four star rating."
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-10-22,5.0,"Amazing pie. Amazing people. 

Tonight I sat and enjoyed 2 delicious slices of pie--almond chess and blueberry. Already worthy of 5 stars, Petee's went even more above and beyond my expectations. They are so incredibly kind, generous, and informative. I won't get into specifics but this is the kind of business I want to keep supporting. I will tell everyone I know who visits the city to go to Petee's if they are in the area. Thank you Petee's for being an example of how businesses should be run!"
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-09-15,3.0,One of the best banana cream pies ever. I got my order to go and took it to my hotel only to realize they did not give me a fork or napkins. I wasn't aware that these were things I had to ask for when ordering to go...it was a messy time eating the pie but the flavor was delicious.
5,petees-pie-company-new-york,2019-12-22,5.0,"If you want to satisfy that crave for pie, definitely a place to stuff your belly with a good piece of warm pie. I had sweet potato and my friend had banana cream pie, we were ""high"" on goodness!!!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,"Tea heaven is real. And it's in SoHo. We stumbled across Harney & Sons serendipitously (after trying to order tea online while in NYC, I realized there was a physical location nearby) and I'm so happy that we did as it was one of the highlights of our weekend getaway. Set in a warm room full of natural light, the tea tasting room features an impressive wall of tea for sampling and smelling. There were two teas already steeped for sampling and each guest is allowed one free sample of any tea that suits them. We tried Japanese whiskey and Dragon Pearl Jasmine tea. Both were excellent. I've been buying Harney & Sons for years, but I didn't realize quite how many teas they offered until we visited. 

There is also a small cafe in the back where you can order cups of tea, tea flights, and pastries. We got a couple of vanilla scones with clotted cream and strawberry preserves that were great. Bad scones can be really terrible, but there isn't much better than a good scone, and these were good!  I also got a flavored black tea flight which came with Caribe (a tropical tasting blend), Victorian Fog (an earl grey inspired vanilla tea), SoHo (vanilla, chocolate, and coconut), and the oldie but goodie, Hot Cinnamon Spice (a sweet cinnamon tea). It was fun to sample each of these teas. 

$45 and 24 oz of tea later, we left with some loose leaf teas that should keep my tea habit in check for a little while. I can't wait to come back and try some more teas!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2020-02-12,5.0,"Wonderful selection of teas from all over the world with a terrific and highly knowledgeable staff to help you decide as well as free tastings. 
They have the best teapots for brewing loose leaf tea and great canisters for gifts. 
A staple for me and my tea habit."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2020-01-29,3.0,"My bestie and I came here for a more affordable tea experience than your typical overpriced tea room.  

They have a great tea menu, so you can't go wrong with any of their selections.  Their food isn't so impressive.  I found the scones to be lackluster and on the rather dry side.  I've definitely had better macarons in Paris, but that's definitely the snob in me talking so I'll shut up now.

Come here for the tea.  That's all."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-12-08,5.0,"I've never had a bad experience here. Favorite tea brand, so many choices! I love how they always have daily samples to test out, and that you can choose one tea off the wall to try as well. Always brightens up my day.

Staff is super friendly and knowledgeable! Probably come here more then I should admit. I have too many tins cus I just keep buying more."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-08-30,5.0,"This store is grand. I felt like I was walking into a famous landmark building that once was a library. The wall of teas, look like it once was filled with books from long ago. They have a huge, I mean ""HUGE"" selection of teas here. I was so intrigued by how great this store looked and by everything they had in it. They had candles, teapots, teacups, honey, etc. I even saw some things that would make great gifts for a tea lover such as myself. (I hear they have a yearly tea club.) 

So you can sample the teas by looking at a list of their selections, you smell the tea blend you want, and if you like you can pay $2.00 to take home a week supply of that sample, up to five samples per visit. You get a free one with a yelp check-in. They also have some brewed samples that you can actually drink, as well. 

They have a small cafe in the back of the store where you can sit down and enjoy some of their tea, or speciality drinks hot or cold, along with some scones or pastries. You could get some work done on your laptop, read a great book, just think coffee shop environment, but a relaxing one with very lil noise. You can also buy packaged tea bags or sachets, or bottled ice teas, they have a whole variety of those too. If you are a tea lover like myself then you have to make a visit here. The prices are reasonable and with their variety of teas, you could never get bored. I will be back, believe that."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-10-09,5.0,"Tldr: great tea shop with huge selection, rotating sample teas and friendly staff

I love this store so much! I really enjoy dropping by after work and trying some new teas. They have a huge selection and oh my goodness I want that tea wall so much. 

Best part: they always have two sample teas and you get a free, freshly brewed cup of tea at the bar with any tea of your choosing! Also, don't forget to do a Yelp checkin and get a free sample to take home too!

The baristas are always super friendly and have helped suggest some great teas. My current favorite was one they suggested! (White peach: very delicate tea with strong peach aroma) I tried a cup at the tea bar and immediately got 4 oz. to take home.

The actual cafe is also nice. The tea flights seem interesting! The shop also has lot of other tea related goods like mugs, strainers, pots and tea related gifts, trinkets and gift sets."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-12-13,5.0,"The selection is big and the staff  is very helpful. If you love tea or know someone who does, this store is a great place to load up on some loose leaf tins.   

I got my mom White Peach and Pear tea but the Venetian tiramisu sure was tempting. 

Tins start around $8.  They also have a few mugs and other supplies, but the focus is tea.   Go check it out."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-06-27,5.0,"I adore this place! Harney & Sons is available  in many places but this particular store stole my heart. The selection is teas is fit for a true tea lover-- there are soooo many options to pick from!

The walls are adorned with different loose leaf teas and beautiful cannisters. I love getting the iced winter white earl grey tea. It's pretty fairly priced for the quality and quantity of tea you're getting. Highly recommend stopping in on this place rather than buying at a high-end grocery store or online-- the in person experience is really worth it!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-12-09,5.0,"I was in SoHo and wanted to check out Harney & Sons. After reading a few reviews, I knew this would be the best place for fine tea! You walk in and there's a plethora of loose tea options on the wall. I arrived and tested a few of them, all were delicious. The person working behind the counter knew a lot about the different types of tea. I informed them that I wanted a green tea and they offered many different options with explanations oh the different types they have (some with different hints of spices, etc). I had a great experience and will be back the next time I'm in SoHo. This tea shop also sells many tea products such as tea cups, kettles, apparel and different types of tea that are already pre-packaged and ready to be brewed!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-06-06,5.0,"I am enchanted by this place. I love stopping by this place whenever I visit NYC. The vast tea collection behind the counter is stunning if you're a fellow tea lover. Or even if you're a non-tea lover. They have three sets of tea samples on the counter. Take advantage of this offer! If the samples on the counter don't appeal to you, no worries - the staff can recommend tea according to your taste preferences. Through this tasting, I discovered other teas than matcha. This store introduced me to the world of tea.

They have adorable gifts in the store. I love how Harney & Sons carries Voluspa candles. It's one of my favorite candle companies. I got a cute, fancy gift tea set for my colleague. He loves it and still uses the box to store many other things. Apart from the extravagant vibe the store exudes, they have quirky gifts and cards for close friends and family.

This place has a little café spot within the store. It's a tight spot - enough to knock over your neighbor's food - but at least you can sit down and relax from the bustling streets of NYC and enjoy a cup of tea. The rosé macarons are one of the most popular snacks from this place."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-11-12,5.0,This is a very unique tea/coffee shop. The interior is spacious and very relaxed with a wall full of tea tins. They offer tea flights (very aesthetic) and also sell cute ceramic sets in store. Spend time talking to the staff and find your perfect tea! I also got a cup of the crosscut nitro coffee which was a much needed pick me up. Would come back for the tea flights.
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,"I came here after perusing the area and exploring. I stumbled in and was immediately welcomed and felt so comforted by the wonderful aroma of teas. There are a couple of cafes within the building as it is huge, where customers could purchase teas. There's a very large selection and variety of teas to select from, which is fabulous. 

There was a tea sampling and I tried the hot apple cider, the pumpkin spice, and the spiced plum. All of which were delicious, my favorite (surprisingly), was the hot apple cider. Usually I'm a sucker for pumpkin spice, but the apple was so great that it absolutely took the cake. The tea here is super high quality and pair very nicely with pastries and snacks.

The staff was also super helpful and let me have a bit of a running commentary about the teas I was trying, which I appreciated.

Overall, a great, fun experience, and I will be back to explore more of the teas!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-11-13,4.0,"Nice tea brand selling all sorts of teas at affordable price ranges. The packages are lovely, and would do well for people giving any of the teas as a gift. They offer free tastings for people interested in buying certain teas, and also give out free samples. Highly recommended."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-04-23,4.0,"I love Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice tea so had to give a visit. I can't believe I never noticed this location before! I was able to receive a free tea sample with my Yelp Check-In and my mom and I fell in love with Paris (fruity black tea with vanilla and caramel flavors, and a hint of lemony Bergamot).

It's a great location to explore different flavors and see their various offerings. They have seating in the back if you'd like to chill and talk for a bit (not the most aesthetically pleasing of spaces, however). I would definitely visit again to discover my next favorite tea before I purchase from their website. I usually buy their tea online because they always have such great promo codes & free shipping!"

One star for the small, univiting cafe area in the back of the store. Uncomfortable seating, stale baked goods, and spacey staff (who forgot to bring our food after serving the tea).

For a company with such high quality, surprised this is their brick and mortar outlet in the city."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-04-11,3.0,"Giant tea store serving many varieties of teas to go along with a strong pastry selection. Thursday afternoon and still available seating at the back of the establishment.

Opted for the Chai Tea Latte ($4.50) and the set of chive scones ($7). The scones are definitely more expensive than I thought they would be, but are considered some of the best in the city. Quickly got the chai first, creamy and strong. Scones come out shortly after, served with a strong mustard. Buttery with only a hint of chive - the mustard didn't really pair well with either the pastries or the chai. 

Fine spot if you like tea - though not a lot of seating."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-08-12,5.0,We order the jasmine tea and it was $8.70 for the tea set. The tea are organic and reasonably priced here. Love the atmosphere and very welcoming.
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-11-21,5.0,"Every time we go over to one of our friend's house, they offer us Harney & Sons cinnamon tea with added cinnamon.  Ever since we have been a fan and it just happens that cinnamon tea is the majority favorite.

On my mother-daughter trip, we decided to take a break from walking to grab tea and sweets here.  Upon entering, they have the teas to purchase on the right and tea tasting area on the left.  We had missed the tea tasting section but should check it out since they give you a free tasting so that you can check out the flavor before actually purchasing a whole cups worth.  Added bonus, if you check in on yelp, they give you a free sample for you to take home.  

In the back, they have the cafe where you check out your souvenirs, drinks, and sweets.  I got the cinnamon tea as usual and based on yelp review, vanilla scones.  I love scones but not all scones are delicious.  The ones here were, however.  It was smaller than what I'm used to but has the best creamy, flaky consistency.  I liked the jam that came along and finished it seconds.  

So yeah, this was the perfect resting spot. And it has a clean bathroom to use as well."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-06-28,5.0,"The guy who helped me was very patient on explaining the teas they have and told me the popular ones are (including but no limited to) Paris, Soho, Dragon pearl jasmine green tea. They all smell so nice and I love the Soho one since its aroma is very chocolatey. Totally made for chocolate lovers! I bought the popular ones and they are great!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2020-01-29,5.0,"This is a hidden gem. It is a wonderful place to try new teas, even if you're well versed in tea. It's also a great place for someone to introduce themselves to tea. They offer high quality cups for a very affordable price. It's a calm ambiance which suits the tea experience. After you're done drinking you can also explore the variety of tea goods and products they have for sale. Buying a full tea tin may be on the expensive side, but you for sure try a high grade tea at an affordable price at the cafe. I will be coming back!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2020-01-23,5.0,Love the tea hear and a great little place in the back to meet for tea and scones (the cranberry are my favorite.)
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-06-06,4.0,"Amazing tea selection and a great place to try samples! Check in on Yelp to get a take-home sample of any tea of your choice, as well. My favorite is the Blueberry Green Tea. There's a small cafe area in the back that serves scones, desserts and lattes. Seating gets slightly crowded on the weekend, however, and there's a bit of a wait if you order food and/or drinks. Unfortunately they no longer serve afternoon tea sets, either - but at the end of the day, the extensive tea selection makes up for the lacking cafe!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-10-27,4.0,"I'll round up the rating because their hot cinnamon spice tea is amazing, but I was a little let down by the famed vanilla scones ($7.63 total - they make you buy two which is annoying). Clotted cream and jam was nice. Overall they were good bordering on great. 3.5 stars."

You can try their teas of the day and also pick one from the menu that you'd like to try! Their current ""teas of the day"" were chocolate, rose, and Valentine blend (a blend of the chocolate + rose) when I went. I also tried a cup of their Venetian Tiramisu and took home a sample of that!

Harney & Son's is like a little oasis (with a ginormous wall of tea *-*) in the middle of NY. There's even a little cafe at the back where you can enjoy your tea and some baked goods! (I haven't tried the baked goods yet, but maybe the next time I'm there! *-*)


I love their sign at the front that says, ""Teatime is anytime,"" and wholeheartedly agree, but it's even better in the winter! :]

P.S. If you check in on facebook or yelp, you can get a free take-home sample of your choice of tea!"

There's this small cafe corner inside the huge tea store! 
The drink is good yet it's just that the environment is a little bit too crowded. 
Abt the tea store itself----Love the variety of teas that were shown and bought a lot as gifts to bring back home. Can't wait to try some interesting new flavors! The chocolate, honey straws, etc are also cute"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-11-24,5.0,"Stopped by while in the area to look at the assortment of tea blends. Cute tea related items (mugs, lots, cups, coasters, candles, matches) on sale as well. I also loved that I was able to step up to the counter to smell the teas on request. Staff was super knowledgeable about the blends. Would definitely recommend coming here to pick up some gifts for people."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2020-02-16,1.0,"Came here on a Sunday. This review is for the cafe in the back.
They did not have the green tea flights.
They did not have vanilla scones. Those were the two things we wanted to order. I don't understand how a tea house runs out of these things.

The girl who served us the tea was not close to friendly. I politely asked for some water and ice. She understood what I said but just turned away and ignored what I said . I get it working in the food/ service industry is hard and demanding we have all been there. But a little common courtesy or just a clear response would of been nice. Definitely did not feel welcomed and would not return.

Tea was good though."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-08-16,5.0,This place is great. Came here and had kal. Dude killed it. Super friendly and helpful. We picked up a ton of new teas and loved every second of it.
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-04-09,3.0,"Stumbled upon this SoHo tea shop and since I'm a tea lover, I popped in to check out their teas. I was thrilled to see that they had an actual place to sit and have scones and tea, so I got a table. 

The menu was good with all sorts of little finger food type goodies like roasted nuts, canapes, cheeses, and bakery fresh scones that sounded super yummy. The selection of teas was fantastic and organized by varietal and origin, including oolong, white, blends and more. You could have your tea served either hot or iced. I chose a hot coconut green tea while hubby went with their most popular flavored black tea, Paris, on ice. I ordered scones too but we were so disappointed because they were sold out of EVERY scone on the menu. Boo! I am docking them two stars just for that because a tea shop on a Saturday afternoon ought to bake plenty of scones (that has to be the most popular tea time ever). High tea without scones? Ain't nobody got time for that! 

I cannot comment on the snacks since I didn't order any, but the teas were perfectly brewed to the appropriate strength and the flavors were good. A small pot of tea is $6 and a large pot is $8, where one small glass of iced tea will set you back $3. I think it's a bit pricey for what you get but it's a lovely place to drop in for a quick tea break. 

The store is great too, with all sorts of loose teas as well as tea-themed gifts. I picked up an adorable tea towel with mice on it and a tea flavored lip balm that I adore. The loose tea I bought is good but the tea leaves aren't very big (it looks more like the inferior ground tea that you'd find in a lower quality tea bag). It tastes delicious, but I'm not impressed with the quality of the leaves in relation to the price of the tea. I have to use a lot of tea leaves when I brew at home and I always get those yucky little black floaties at the bottom from the tiny grounds seeping through. That's a sign of tea that shouldn't be on the top shelf."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-02-09,5.0,"The atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. 
The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable.

I love this tea shop!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-01-17,5.0,"Favorite place to buy teas! They'll let you sample two when you get there. The teas are actually really affordable when you buy them loose leaf. A couple of ounces can make 20-40 cups and depending on which you choose can be around $5. 

A huge selection, and really aesthetically pleasing. Great place to buy gifts too."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-06-22,5.0,"Wowwww!! The scones are one of the best I had in New York. It was as good as the ones in London. The cheddar and chive scones (comes with honey mustard sauce which I didn't like) was delicious and savory, but the winner was the vanilla scone with clotted cream and strawberry jam. That clotted cream and strawberry jam was to die for!  I would keep coming here just to eat that scone w/ the clotted cream and strawberry with tea! 

There were so many selections of teas to choose from. The staff recommended a black tea that we added milk and sugar too and it was delicious.

Staff was super friendly and nice! Highly recommended!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2020-02-10,5.0,Love this place def go here! Best loose leaf teas in the city and staff is  very  knowledgeable on them all!!
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-03-27,5.0,"Harney & Sons SoHo has some of the most knowledgeable tea enthusiastics I've ever met.  I love to just stare at their wall of teas while trying to read all of the different names, and then someone breaks me out of my trance, ""Would you like a scone with your tea?  What would you like to sample today?""  Nothing warms my heart more!

Checking in on Yelp, you get a free sample of tea to bring home a brew for you and your friends, if you're willing to share that is.  This place is great to bring a friend and do a tea tasting and nibble on scones as you try to navigate from black teas to lighter, more herbal teas.  Let it linger in your mouth and breathe deep; this is a purchasing experience!  

Care about the aroma?   
Care about the proper brewing temperatures?
Care about what pot or cup you should serve it in?

Just walk around!  This whole place is your one stop shop for the tea lover or lovers in your life.  From cute cat cups to tiled coasters, you will have a hard time walking out of here with your arms swinging."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-07-21,4.0,Harney and sons has an extensive amount of teas from around the world. In this shop there are endless amount of teas listed in their menu with the tea name on the left side and taste of the tea on the right side. I smelled the scent of mountain tea from japan it had a pleasant refreshing fruity scent in its raw stage. Once it got brewed the smell didn't match the taste. The taste was mostly as described spinach like instead of both starfruit and spinach mentioned in the menu. Slightly on the bitter side. My mom told the barista that I didn't like my tea but the guy barista did not ask to change it for us. My mom's drink as well didn't taste great (forgot the name though). The reason I am still giving it four stars is because there are host of other varieties to try and location was beautiful. I would give Harney and Sons another try but it won't be high on my list when I am visiting from out of state.

I highly highly recommend the hot cinnamon spice tea. It's their #1 bestseller for a reason! And don't forget to check in on Yelp for a sample (it's a pretty generous one)."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-12-12,3.0,"Harney & Sons has some of my favorite tea and I love the selection of loose leaf, bag, and fun tea accessories. This review is looking at the tea room specifically.

I've visited the SoHo location tea room many times, but this was my first time since their renovations and I was very disappointed. A whole new counter has been built to provide take out service. While aesthetically it is a beautiful space it is very reminiscent of going to a Starbucks. The tea room is now a casual cafe. You wait and watch other customers until they get up and leave. Once seated you are now the fish in the fishbowl being watched. There is less seating and no table service. The relaxing environment of the more formal tea room has been abandoned for the fast moving, New York Starbucks structure. If I wanted a quick in and out cup of tea I don't think of Harney's. I very much enjoyed spending time sipping tea and eating scones in a traditional tea room. I'll still go to Harney's to buy my favorite teas, but prefer Alice's Tea Cup for the traditional tea experience."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-04-04,5.0,"I nearly only drink Harney & Sons tea, it is the best of the best. I've even taken road trips up to their warehouse store in Millerton, NY. I'm a devoted customer for life. So many different types of teas to choose from, and the sales associates know every single one of them down to the notes, region, and brewing time and temperature. It's an excellent place to buy gifts or just to get something special for yourself from time to time. I especially love that they have special blends that are custom made for certain occasions, like Eight at the Fort. I could spend hours and hundreds of dollars here. The customer service is excellent, super friendly in addition to being knowledgeable. Whenever I'm in SoHo I have to stop by here, it's one of my happy places in the city. So tranquil, so sophisticated, and simply put, just magical."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2020-01-20,5.0,I recently stumbled upon Harney and Sons in Soho. Its heaven for tea lovers. They have walls covered with any type of tea you can imagine. They even have a cute little cafe at the back. I cant wait to finish all the tea I have at home so I can come here and buy more.
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-04-03,4.0,"I drink coffee more often than tea, but I had a good experience at Harney & Sons. For a long time I have been looking for the kind of tea that taste like orange and goes incredibly well with chocolate, and I found it easy to consult the staff here. It's also nice that I am allowed to try one kind of tea per visit, and after that the staff is still willing to show and let us smell the tea leaves for other kinds of tea."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-12-02,5.0,"Amazing place to try and buy tea, tea accoutrements and in store tea products and hot tea.

If you check in on Yelp, you get a free tea tasting. Basically they offer you a taste of 2 teas they have freshly brewed - usually something popular and/or seasonal. Your third tea can be anything (yes! Anything!) From their loose leaf tea menu. They have an extensive list - from green to black to fruit and flowers. I tried a pu'er because I've also read about them but wasn't sure I wanted to commit to buying. It was fishy and earthy and a very unusual experience. My friend got the lavender tea and loved it - it was also a beautiful hue.

We ended the tasting and walked over to the cafe. You can get any of their teas brewed in house as well as a few bites. I loved their scones - served with 1 savory and 1 sweet plus jam and clotted cream. Went so well with the hot tea.

Overall lovely experience!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-05-16,5.0,"Probably my favorite tea store in Manhattan! I met someone off Twitter here for tea and scones and fell in love with the staff, store, and, of course, tea! (And scones.) 

The aesthetic is just a great place to meet anyone. There's high ceilings and it's very pretty and well-decorated and open and welcoming. 

$6 for a small pot of tea was worth it for the service and it was brewed to perfection! The vanilla scone with cream and jam was just the right amount of crumbly and crunchy. 

They have a large array of teas to purchase on the wall and you can try one for free! The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. I try to come back each time I'm in SoHo around Broome."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-10-16,4.0,"What an adorable little find tucked in SoHo. Came here on a whim. My husband and I were perusing the streets of Soho, when we had a sudden craving to seek shelter and stay warm. Naturally so, we looked for a place to catch some hot tea on a cold visit to NY, and we found so much more than we were expecting at this little place!

The savory scones that I never knew I needed until this place! Mmm. They come warmed up...hot and buttery. GET IT. While the tea selection went on for days, only my husband ordered a hot matcha latte. He said it was strong on matcha (in a good way)!

It seemed like the things to get there were the cute little tea pots / samplers. Everyone ordered it! However, we'll have to go back there now that we know! 

Definitely a busy and little place, so you might have to wait a bit and be aggressive to snag a table."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2017-12-07,5.0,"Pricing - $$

Atmosphere - Casual, nice place for a friends meet up, or day date. There is a mini area where you can sit & sip tea while you catch up with a friend or want some alone time. There is also an option to enjoy a tea tasting as well.

Tea - I always rave about Harney and Sons tea! It's phenomenal. There are soooo many options to choose from to suit your taste. The customer service was also fabulous. Whether you love or like tea, I highly recommend visiting!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-08-27,4.0,"Harney & Sons is one of my favorite tea shops in the city. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and always recommends new tea that I love. The tea studio is quite elegant, and the high ceilings and beautifully uniform wall of tea lends a sophisticated touch. The back area is equally chic and feels wonderfully cozy and private, in large part due to the dim lighting and shelves that act as dividers. 

I used to come often after school for their vanilla scones and I still recommend them to everyone who is willing to listen. They used to have this amazing earl grey ice cream that was perfectly balanced and so so creamy. I'm not sure if they still offer it but I would definitely recommend it if it's available."

Definitely a great place to come to try out some teas!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2020-01-06,5.0,"A must-visit stop for anyone rolling by. While the selection of teas may not cater to absolute purists in favor of sheng/shou pu-erh, there is an excellent selection of fine oolongs to try in the western brewing style.

6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2017-09-01,5.0,"Located at Broome Street in Soho, this cute tea spot is a must-visit for tea lovers. They have a wide range of teas from around the world, as well as cute cups, mugs, pots, etc. 

Towards the back of the store, there is a mini dine-in cafe. You can bring your cup of tea from tasting to the back room to pair with whatever food(s) you are planning to order. They have two different types of tea displays out for tasting each day, but you can request whatever tea you want off the wall for tasting. However they only allow one tasting a day, and the remainder are for you to sniff as a deciding factor...but one of the associates said starting next month they will have multiple tastings. 

Two of my all time favorites right now is Uva Highlands and Royal Wedding. Uva Highlands is a black tea from Sri Lanka. It is the strongest tasting black tea so far but not the strongest in caffeine content however great for instant fall allergy relief. Royal Wedding is a beautifully flavored White Tea with a hint of coconut, vanilla, almond and rose petals. Royal Wedding actually has more caffeine than Uva Highlands.

Price wise, it is cheaper to order by the oz. in the bag than the tin, even though the quantities and qualities are the same. 

Check in for a free sample to take home."

6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2019-11-19,5.0,Excellent experience. The guy helping us was very good and patient letting us try a couple of tea types. We ended up buying some and the prices were reasonable. I would go back

6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-09-23,2.0,"Stopped by Harney & Sons for tea and scones yesterday, and was very disappointed to see the place look so different.

The once-cute seating area in the back is now semi self-serve, with fake flowers, terribly scuffed tables, and filthy floors. 

Prices are high ($7.50 for a pot of tea is absurd in this type of ambiance) and the scones are tiny and unsatisfying. 

The store itself is still really nice, and staff is friendly enough, but the tea area is more like a Starbucks now. We won't be returning."
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2017-08-16,5.0,"Since I visited Harney & Sons two years ago with my sister, I have become a big fan of this place and their tea. It is a good place to get some tasty teas for us, and also gifts for others. 

The interior remains unchanged since 2015, still really nice, open space. It has so many selections of great varieties of teas, it is fun to look around the store.

The great thing about this place is that they have a small lounge space where you can enjoy their teas and also some sweets as well. We decided to have some tea and sweets before we shop.

We order their Small Pot of Tea which is indicated as ""2 servings"" but it has a bit more than 2 servings in my opinion. They have a great selection of teas of all kinds. We also ordered their Summer Special item, Cherry Scones. They were really nice and tasty, perfect little afternoon tea time. 

Once we were finished with little R&R, we looked around the shop. They do have so many cute items there! They have all sorts of items that are of course related to tea, and some other items that are not really related to tea. Regardless, they are all interesting and adorable.

And here is a secret - the best way to get tea sample is through Yelp. Use the Yelp app and check in at Harney & Sons for a FREE sample of tea of your choice! I don't know how long they are going to have this offer, so make sure to check it on the app first.

We bough several tins of teas on this day for gifts. Everyone loves getting these teas... It is good to spread the joy of yummy tea!"
6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2017-12-01,4.0,"Have frequented this tea shop on several occasions, the last time it was their anniversary event which was unexpectedly crowded.
 
Love the vast selection in teas as well as tea sets, tea pots and other necessary tea accessories needed when you are a tea connesuire.
 
The space is very roomy with high ceilings, to feature all the beautiful ensembles of accessories one can find in this shop.  They also make tea and other mixes in the back section of the shop.
 
It's nice to walk in and find a varied selection of teas available for tastings prior to purchasing.
 
Of all the tea shops in the city, this is by far my favorite.  If you have not been, you should definitely check them out."

6,harney-and-sons-soho-new-york,2018-10-07,4.0,"Delicious scones and many teas to choose from! The front of the store sells freshly packaged tea, boxes of tea, teapots, and much more. The back of the store has a few tables that sells drinks and pastries. You can try any type of hot tea for $3.50. 

We tried oolong pomegranate, Formosa and a green tea. The Formosa was just okay- couldn't really taste the toasted Walnut and carrot flavors. The tea is on the lighter side. But you must have their scones- their pumpkin scones (two for $7) were delicious and only available on the weekends."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-06-04,5.0,"I ordered this as a Uber eat delivery during quarantine and I have to say the desserts came perfect. All the desserts were spot on. 

I ordered the matcha lava cake that was a delectable blend of chocolate and green tea. In the lava cake, there was a gooey warm chocolate filling and the ice cream complemented the cake perfectly. We also ordered chocolate chip cookies which were huge and soft and gooey. They were amazing. We also got (I don't remember the name) a dessert that had cornflakes and was flakey. It was delicious. I could eat that everyday. 

I can't wait to try this place in person but for delivery it was amazing."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-05-08,5.0,I really like the harvest and the choco lava desserts. They even deliver during lockdown.
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-04-03,5.0,"The Spot is always my go-to place for dessert. They have a more limited menu for takeout only options due to covid. My favorite, cookie camp is not on the takeout menu, however, honey waffle & cream is a close second. I ordered them for my husbands birthday. The manager Mark went over & beyond by adding an extra pint of ice cream to my order. Really awesome place & don't forget to add 2 cookies for $6 to your order."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-04-06,4.0,"Spot is a NYC specialty, and ended up being one of my first stops in the city. The space is small, but the all white walls and seating scheme gave the space a minimalist, hip vibe. The desserts are very cute too!

My friend and I ordered 2 desserts to share: the Matcha Lava Cake and the Harvest. The matcha lava cake was a delectable blend of chocolate and green tea. In the lava cake, there was virtually no matcha, just a rich, gooey warm chocolate filling, letting the chocolate dictate the cake's flavor. This was perfect, as the ice cream was all matcha, and complemented the thick, warm cake with a cool, nuanced taste.

The Harvest was a flavorful blend of earl grey milk tea with a cheese top, paired with raspberry sorbet. We had fun pouring the milk tea into this plant, ""watering"" the dessert with bergamot and black tea. Here, the tart balances well with the dessert's sweetness, and you get a little bit of everything: cheesecake, milk tea, fruit, aesthetics.

Delicious desserts. Only complaint would be that they're a tad pricey for the amount you get, but it's New York, and it's quality dessert, so no major issue here.

Final Verdict:
Desserts: 5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Overall: 4.5/5"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-04-04,4.0,"On my first trip to New York 2 years ago, my boyfriend and I wanted to try Spot Dessert, but it was so crowded with long lines each time we came here, we ended up not trying this place out. When I came again to New York on my own, on my last evening in New York, I decided to stop by here and FINALLY try it.

As a single patron, I got seated rather quickly. Coming here was SO WORTH IT. I got the Matcha Lava Cake! Dark chocolate with matcha ganache and green tea ice cream. My taste buds were in Heaven! I love that the lava cake had a slight crispiness to its edges, but the cake was overally still moist and rich and warm and fresh. The matcha ganache oozed out deliciously. So decadent! I loved the mix of rich chocolate with matcha, two of my favorite flavors! 

Man, if I wasn't watching out for my macros (and I already cheated hard and fast all day), I would have ordered more desserts to try.

Customer service was FANTASTIC as well! They were attentive and polite without being overbearing, and ordering and paying was super easy. I really want to come back here with my boyfriend, and ideally a group of friends, in the future!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-04-03,5.0,"Out of 7 items ordered, I liked every single one of them. That's five stars right there.

7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-02-22,5.0,"Although I've been to Spot plenty of times prior. It never hurts to stop in again. I think the thing that amazes me the most is the service and how kind, patient and courteous the staff is.

7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-05-28,5.0,I asked what the most popular desserts were and ordered two of them- the harvest and the golden toast.

7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-01-27,5.0,"I love love Spots and would always try to take a trip here whenever I'm back in the city. Yes, the desserts are pretty pricey but you can definitely share with 1 to 2 other individuals.

I first fell in love with this place when I ordered their Golden Toast. It also comes with sliced strawberries, condensed milk ice cream, and whipped cream. It sounds like an odd combo but it totally works! I loved it so much that I honestly haven't tried anything else. 

Seating is limited so I recommend joining the Waitlist on Yelp!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-01-22,5.0,"The amount of money I've ever spent at Spot is probably in the hundreds lol. I always come here with my crew or take new people to this more-than-just Instagrammable desserts spot. 

Along with presentation, the desserts taste amazing as well. Each dessert is not too sweet and very well balanced. Each dessert is a good portion size and at ~10$ a dessert, I think it's very well worth it and cheaper than other desserts available at fancy restaurants. My favorite is the matcha lava cake :)

There's long waits on the weekends so be prepared for that."

Due to its online popularity, you might encounter: long lines, general basic-ness all around, lots of AZNs/yappies, too many phones at one table, and wait staff who are 100% done with aforementioned bullshit."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-16,5.0,"Spot Dessert Bar has some hits and misses with their dessert. I tried a bunch of items on their menu such as The Harvest, Golden Toast, Matcha Lava, and Coffee Mountain (all priced at $11.95 with the recent price hike). Honestly I wasn't a huge fan initially, but my friends really like the place so I kept coming back for their sakes. I've grown to be more fond of this dessert spot. 

I personally find The Harvest to be the cutest thing on their menu and you pour earl gray milk tea into the editable ""dirt"" which is oreo crumbs over cheesecake. I wasn't too particularly impressed other than the appearance, especially since the raspberry sorbet was too sour. I also found their matcha lava to be okay, but I'm really feeling their golden toast and coffee mountain. I've also tried their ice creams and milk teas, which are quite standard. 

Also, this St. Mark location has a bathroom but can be busier than their other location which is literally down the block. If there's a wait for this, I'd recommend checking out their other location."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-03-06,4.0,"Went here with a group of three and took bar seats, delicious desserts! Lots of variety and interesting desserts. The matcha lava cake was delicious and not bitter whatsoever which was my concern, and my friends loved their desserts too. There should be a skillet holder though for the customer to not burn themself on. The Thai iced tea was also too sweet, which was unnecessary for a traditional Thai iced tea. Great place and date spot though."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-03,3.0,"Hmm, I believe there are a few factors why I wasn't completely impressed with Spot, and here's some of them:

1) My bf and I just came from a large dinner and we weren't that hungry, but this was on our go-to list for NYC, so we made ourselves come.
2) We had an amazing and more interesting lava cake from Kitsby a few days prior, and this one sorta pales in comparison. We ordered the Chocolate Green Tea Lava Cake here, and don't get me wrong, it was still very good, but that was the only item we tried.
3) The place was small, tight, loud, and very casual. I always had the impression it would be a little more upscale, probably because the desserts looked fancy, but I was wrong.
4) There were larger parties hanging out, taking their time, sharing desserts, drinking boba, while my bf and I were just order, eat, leave. So maybe this is more of a group place vs. a date place.

Overall, the experience was okay. I'd consider coming back, but maybe to a different bigger location."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-01-06,5.0,"Spot Dessert Bar truly does desserts right! They're classics are incredible, Golden Toast among my favorite. However, their seasonal desserts are also fantastic. I love going to Spot with friends and trying everything. 

Although the location is small, the wait is never too long. Desserts are reasonably priced and very photogenic. Overall, a fun spot to stop by after any meal."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-01-05,5.0,"Spot Dessert Bar has tasty desserts that definitely hit the spot! I recently came to Spot for dessert with a group of friends and shared a matcha lava cake and the coffee mountain. The matcha lava was a spot-on lava cake with a great filling to cake ratio, and I liked that the matcha within was only sprinkled on top of the dark chocolate filling rather than mixed in, as you could actually taste it separately this way. The accompanying scoop of matcha ice cream had a strong green tea flavor and was great!

The coffee mountain was also delicious, although it was on the sweeter side. I liked the different textures (especially the crisp cookie) and levels of creaminess throughout the dessert.

The two desserts contrasted each other nicely, and we really enjoyed them! They are pretty large dishes, and I'd recommend trying a couple to share."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-03-12,5.0,"I've been coming here ever since high school, so for over almost 5 years now! It's a go-to dessert place in the East Village. Whenever I'm craving something sweet in the area, Spot is always my first choice. 

Some of my favs are the harvest (obviously - who doesn't love a cheesecake that looks like a plant!), the golden toast, and the cookie camp (probably my most loved). I love that you can order a dessert based on almost any flavor you're craving - of course there are the more basic flavors like chocolate or caramel, but you can also try unique flavors like matcha or yuzu!

If you plan on visiting, just keep in mind that if you're coming on a Thursday-Sunday you'll probably have to wait to get in. There's usually a 15-30 minute wait depending on how busy it is. But it's certainly worth the wait in my opinion - the desserts are heavenly!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-02-21,4.0,"I came here with my bestfriend and daughter to try out the dessert.

The staff: They seemed very friendly, nice, and pleasant to deal with. They were very patient with us and guided us with suggestions.

Milky puff: My daughter liked this and said that it was very delicious.

Golden Toast: The buttered toast with condensed milk was very unique. It was a little sweet when you dip it in the condensed milk but not too sweet.

Overall: I would love to come back to try out some other desserts to see how they taste. Also, the menu items make a wonderful Instagram picture."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-26,4.0,"Super great dessert spot!

Husband had the skillet cookie, and I had the golden toast. Both were tremendous. The portions are a good size. Another couple could have shared one, but we don't share dessert. 

The golden toast is really interesting. It's crisp on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. It reminds me of a Chinese donut. The honey on the bottom is really stellar. The ice cream it comes with is super creamy. Overall the dessert is sweet but not overpowering. 

Husband LOVES skillet cookies. He wasn't hungry when we came, but I forced him to come with me. He said it might be the best skillet cookie he ever had. 

Service was friendly and attentive. 

My only 2 complaints. It's almost $4 for plain hot tea - just a tea bag and water. Seems crazy over priced. 

The bathroom is weird. There's only one, and it was dirty when we came. Really dirty. Weirdly dirty. Almost like they wanted it to look dirty like that's the vibe they were going for? But that's not the vibe of the restaurant. It was weird. 

Definitely try this place our next time you have a sweet tooth."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-22,5.0,"Came here for my sisters birthday for Instagram-able post dinner desserts. 

They have two locations on the same street - one is full sized and the other is just a small extension that can seat about 6 parties of varying sizes. Coming from the direction of the NQR station the first location that will come up on your left is the smaller extension which we went to. Once you arrive you can join their waitlist on an iPad that's posted in the front of the restaurant OR you can join the waitlist in advanced on Yelp. It took about 15-20 minutes for our party of 5 to be seated after joining the waitlist.

We tried a bunch of different items: 

Golden Toast: This was the table favorite. The honey roast is the perfect combination of crispy and soft. The warmth of the honey cake combined with the cold vanilla ice cream is another perfect contrast. Finally, the fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Definitely my favorite! 

Matcha Lava: I didn't personally eat this because I'm not a huge fan of matcha, but my sisters loved it. ""Rich, but not too sweet"" according to my mom. Definitely a great dessert for the eyes!

Cookie Camp: We weren't a huge fan of this one - it's delicious for a few bites but it quickly becomes way too much too fast. It's super sweet from the brown sugar coating and the chocolate syrup. 

Bubble Tea: The Matcha Latte flavor was great - probably the best rendition I've ever had. The matcha wasn't too strong and it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. The boba was AMAZING. Super soft and fresh. The Taro flavor was pretty disappointing - it tasted like cereal flavored milk (Trix or Fruity Pebbles) and definitely not Taro. 

Matcha Sunday Special: This was amazing. Pictures speak for themselves! 

Cookies: We got these to go but they felt soft in the bag!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-10-25,4.0,"I was hesitant to go inside because it seemed like a small place (which it was) and seats seemed limited (which they were) but nevertheless, she persisted. Thankfully there were bar seats open for my friend and I. Cute, quaint and cozy. Staff is attentive and friendly, which goes a long way.

Ended up getting the Matcha Lava and a cup of mint tea. If you are a fan of the flavor of matcha, you MUST try the Matcha Lava cake. From the ice cream to the cake to the matcha/chocolate filling on the inside -- this is a devilishly good dessert. 

Take note that this location does not have a restroom, which left my friend and I wandering around the area searching for one."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-17,4.0,"Dessert that is off the beaten path. No the most extensive menu but they do have things you won't easily find on a typical menu. 

My favorite was the Matcha Lava. If you like that Molten chocolate dessert from TGIF? with ice cream, this is very similar. So warm and yummy. Def will get this next time.

We also had the Coffee Mountain- it was okay. It was least fave of the 3 we tried.

Then the butterscotch one. This was the 2nd favorite.

They serve an assortment of teas and coffee drinks as well. I had the Matcha Latte with almond milk. Friends had coffee and also bubble tea type of drink.

Space isn't aplenty and they do try to turn over the tables pretty fast. So don't finish your dessert and then try to linger for another 40mins chit chatting. Please get up so others can dine...unless no one is waiting.

We did have to wait about 5mins before being seated."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-02-18,5.0,"Came here with my girlfriend at noon on a Sunday and there was no wait time, but there might be a wait in the afternoon. 

Environment - The place is small, clean and intimate, perfect for enjoying dessert with someone. 5/5

Service - The server was extremely nice, made sure that we had everything we needed and that we were comfortable. As she presented the desserts (which looked amazing), she would tell us what's in each one and how best to eat it, which made the experience a lot more enjoyable. 5/5

Food - First of all, the presentation was beautiful. I ordered the Harvest, and it was so creative how they made it like a plant with the milk tea to ""water"" it. My girlfriend's Golden Toast looked amazing as well. The taste was delicate and not too sweet, and the portion sizes are just right too. Every ingredient was fresh and had just the right texture. 5/5

Overall this place was the perfect dessert place for me. It made me want to come back immediately and try everything on their menu. The server especially heightened our enjoyment. I give it the highest of recommends."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-02-11,3.0,"I came here Sunday night and they told me there was a wait but if I wanted to go 5 stores down to their other location I could ... so we did that. They sat us down and the service was quick. I ordered the main dirt pop dessert which consisted of cream, strawberry , blueberry , and Oreo crust on top. It also had some creamy cake mix in the middle of the pot . It was pretty good . My friend got the chocolate matcha lava cake . The filling was soooooo goood. I also tried the cookie cake and ice cream. The chocolate hazlenut cookies were bomb! I feel bad that my friend da chocolate lava cake took really long to come out so by the time we were done eating , hers finally came . The service wasn't bad but it wasn't great . I would probably order this to go next time. The vibe and music was good over all. It's a really tiny inside though!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-14,5.0,"Amazing. Just... amazing. No other word sums up my experience here better than that. 

I am addicted to sugar and desserts so I was very excited to try this place with two other friends. We came on a Monday night and there was plenty of seating available. The ambiance was nice and cozy inside. Everything on their menu looked so good and I wanted to try it all so badly... after a few difficult minutes, we decided to order the Milky Puff and the Matcha Lava.

These desserts were so delicious that eating them improved my quality of life. I'm not exaggerating. I was thoroughly blown away by the decadence and taste of both. The Milky Puff had an impeccable blend of richness from the warm puff pastry that paired so well with the sweet toppings. I couldn't stop eating it. The Matcha Lava was also delightful. I was very impressed by the flavor of the matcha ganache and the chocolate cake was incredibly moist and warm. I still remember the sheer bliss I felt eating these. 

A beautiful experience. I love this place and I already can't wait to come back and try their other desserts / inhale their entire menu."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-11,4.0,"Awesome and unique desserts! This place utilizes a lot of Asian flavors like sesame, matcha, and more.My friend and I ordered the seasonal pear sorbet dessert with a crisped pear, almond cake, and a cream sauce, as well as the matcha lava cake with a side of matcha ice cream.
Over the two, I prefer the lava cake. The cake itself was warm, indulgent, and gooey, with a chocolate and matcha lava center. It paired well with the refreshing ice cream to offset its decadence.
The pear sorbet was also good, however wasn't a huge fan of how the sorbet fit in with the rest of the dish. A scoop of vanilla ice cream may have been better. The almond cake was delicious  and moist."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-10-22,5.0,"Ever since I saw this place on friends snap,I've been dying to try it. And I finally did!

It was a great experience. I love MATCHA desserts, and this place has an amazingly hot, creamy matcha lava cake with matcha ice cream. Aesthetic is super pleasing on all items as well! The other two are the harvest pots and brick toast. The harvest pot was pretty plain by itself, but if you paid extra for their raspberry sorbet it's a little better but not my favorite. The brick toast has lightly sweetened thick toast so if you're a fan of something light but still fruity delicious, go for it! The ice cream pairs well with the fluffy warm toast on any day in New York! The service there is always warm and welcoming, no matter how busy they get. Not pictured is their molten matcha chocolate cookie that I've also tried, and requested for it to be warmed up. It didn't taste super fresh, homemade feeling but I'm sure if it was served fresh it would've been amazing :) 

Another time I went in the past was for their seasonal Vietnamese coffee sundae, I forgot to take a picture of it but that thing was humongous and super coffee-sweet delicious. If you're a fan of strong coffee but still pleasant sugary taste, it is DEF a go to!!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-03-06,5.0,"This place is always packed so I'd recommend making an online reservation prior to coming here. We came here on a Thursday night and waited about 15 minutes before being seated. I got the yuzu eskimo, which consists of frozen Japanese cream bar, slices of fresh strawberry, and chocolate sauce. The cream bars are tart, which pairs nicely with the sweet chocolate on the side. The strawberries add a refreshing finish."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-02-17,4.0,"Been to Spot Dessert quite a few times and to various locations as well; my favorites are still probably the OG ones:
The Harvest - I love the chocolate crumbles, the cake layers and the raspberry sorbet 
Golden Toast - Honey + Butter + Thick Toast with whipped cream, condensed milk ice cream, and strawberries...how could you possibly go wrong?

I've enjoyed seeing them expand their menu from dessert tapas and macarons to various kinds of drinks and cookies. For the cookies ($3.95), I've tried:
Matcha Lava - dark chocolate part still too sweet while the matcha surprisingly contains a hint of bitterness (I know matcha is supposed to, but I'd be hard pressed to find that at many places that have matcha desserts). I'm not a fan though; I would like a balance of flavors.
Oreo Chocolate Chip - the good is that this is really packed with Oreo and chocolate chip. The bad is that it's exactly as it sounds--really sweet--but I liked the Oreo texture in the cookie. I wish there were just...more cookie, so that you're not munching on chocolate flavor for most of the time.
Caramel Miso - I loved this so much! The caramel does get a bit messy beware. If you're not usually a fan of caramel flavor, probably don't get this one? (didn't feel like it needed to be said, but my friend remarked how she wasn't a huge fan of caramel 2 bites in).

A few other things though...
About 4-5 years ago, each dessert tapa was $9.95, but now, they're $11.95. However, if you buy more than one, the prices are lower for each dessert, e.g. We got 3 tapas, which is $32.25. I had a 10% off coupon, but they said they can't layer discounts. ...didn't realize that multiple tapas sets counted as a ""discount""? I ended up staying with the $32.25 bc it's essentially the 10% discount lol.

At the end, I wish they would remind you to do the stamp card! I literally brought it, but forgot to at the end. That's 3 stamps gone to waste.... :("
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-03-06,4.0,"Really cozy and cute space for hangouts. We came late on a Sunday night and the place was half empty which was great. We got the Harvest, and with a lot of these Instagram foods, I thought it wouldn't be that tasty. To my surprise, it was quite delicious with all the layers of cake, cream, cookie crumbs, and sorbet. This is something I'd definitely recommend just trying once and having fun while at it. The total for this one dessert came out to be almost $15, which was definitely not worth it for such a small dessert, but I'm glad I got to experience it."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-09-15,4.0,"I've been to both this and the Flushing location. Personally I like the Flushing location more because this one is just a bit too cramped for my liking and also does not have a bathroom; however, since this place is closer to me I make due with what I have.

As stated before the location is tiny however it is thankfully not very crowded. I went for an after lunch dessert on Labor Day and there was only one other table filled. My friend and I decided to split a milky puff because we were still full from lunch. The underlying pastry was fresh and delicious and the ice cream was also wonderful which really mixed well with the corn flakes. However the honey comb white chocolate was pretty unremarkable but everything else in the composition was great.

All in all, definitely a nice place to grab a quick dessert after having a meal in st marks ."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-10-17,5.0,"I came here for dessert after having a light dinner that left me craving for something more. Lo and behold, I found just the place! Thank you Yelp for not misguiding a starving soul. All the choices here are sweet and savory. Literally every item has either ice cream, honey or chocolate on it.
 
I got the Milky Puff which was a thick and soft puff of bread with milk ice cream on top and a large piece of honeycomb on the side. The sweetness of the ice cream was complimented well with the thickness of the puff bread. The honeycomb can be eaten by itself, it's sweet enough as it is. The entire dish was just the right size with just the right levels of sweetness and thickness.

My brother got the Cookie Camp which is a huge baked chocolate cookie with milk ice cream on top. For those with a sweet-tooth, this dessert is definitely for you. The cookie is so thick and rich that it made my mouth feel dry but the ice cream washed it down perfectly. Every item on the menu had ingredients that worked well with each other.

This shop is small, but they have a yelp wait-list system (duh!) so be sure to nab a spot on this app before you show up!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-01-26,5.0,This place is delicious! Tucked away and small  but the desserts are  scrumptious and I have liked everything I have tried. The Oreo chocolate chip is also amazing. Heard good stuff about the drinks too  but haven't tried!
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-11-10,4.0,"Such a cute spot! The place is more spacious than it appears and the location is great - perfect if you're craving something sweet after dinner nearby. Staff is always so friendly. 

Spot has the most adorable selection of desserts, and they have a huge array of options depending on what you're feeling. The Golden Toast, Chestnut Butterscotch, and Cookie Camp are my favorites, but you can't go wrong with any! Everything is extremely sweet and rich - sharing is the way to go.

Their desserts are on the pricier side, but portions are big enough to split for the table. Highly recommend!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-01-18,4.0,"Went to Spot Dessert Bar tonight for the first time. It's a very small space with few seats so there was a wait to be seated. A very nice employee approached me and offered her assistance. She pointed out that certain items on the menu are seasonal and will be removed soon. I decided to go with a seasonal item. Everything on the menu looks delicious. The presentation is top notch too. The place looks clean & organized. They also offer beverages. I ordered a bubble tea. The tea was excellent but the tapioca bubbles were tough and chewy. I probably wouldn't return here for bubble tea, but I definitely would for the  desserts. Very nice selection! Great presentation."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-08-26,4.0,"My friends arrived here a bit after 8, and waited for ~20 minutes on a Wednesday night, so I think that's indicative of how popular it is. Spot is definitely not overhyped though; it has great ambience for being able to catch up with friends and just have a great dessert overall, while having delicious and innovative desserts that are all plated extremely nicely.

During this summer, they offered a seasonal special called the Mango Tango, which consisted of lightly toasted blocks of brick toast with mangos, coconut sorbet, and coconut rice. Being a huge fan of mango sticky rice at Thai restaurants, I had to try this, and I had no regrets. The warmness and denseness of the sticky rice combined with the light cold texture of the coconut sorbet was such a nice blend. The mangoes were also fresh and the brick toast was crunchy on the edges and fluffy inside. The one thing that takes a star off the review is the fact that the table-side plating was kind of awkward after our waiter dropped one of the brick toast bites and was slow and fumbling while scooping out the rice and sorbet.

Everything else on the menu looked so good, and overall, I'll definitely visit again when I come back to New York and try their other menu items."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-08-03,4.0,"absolutely do not drive here, there is going to be impossible to find parking in ST. Marks place. 

Here there is always a wait cause they are that good at deserts!

Once you finally get a table or whatever counter space you get a chance to achieve now you will go ahead and choose your dessert. 

The most popular is ""THE HARVEST"" I have had that one in another location and it is indeed pretty amazing, however if you have already done that one and are feeling adventurous here are the ones I had this more recent time and how I felt about them. 


KING OF FRUITS- this guy is made with DURIAN and banana cake, the crazy taste of the durian and the banana work so freaking well together is not even funny, this is a great choice for a fun taste dessert. 

MANGO TANGO- I have mixed feelings about this dessert, the presentation is fun and very well done, but to m that is all that was to this guy, the flavor was not there cause the presentation was so nice and scarce that I didn't feel that there were enough items to gather the taste.There was coconut sauce, nuts, bread, fruits but the amounts were not really enough to make up a taste. this one I would skip.

Some deserts here like the KING OF FRUITS are bit small so if you are planing on sharing you will need to get a couple of different ones so you can have enough. 

The place is a great experience, super worth the visit. it super pay to look at the reviews here."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-10-11,5.0,"Amazing place with very creative desserts.
We got two things - Chocolate lava cake with matcha ice cream(both of them together were so good) and Harvest( comes with Oreo ice cream and raspberries cream) would highly recommend former one.
Also if you are into K-pop you would love the decor with BTS and Black Pink posters!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-01-08,5.0,"Without a doubt a must dine at dessert spot in NYC. For a mere $10.95, you can feast on a dessert like the Matcha Lava - warm dark chocolate cake filled with matcha ganache served a side of matcha ice cream on a bed of graham cracker. The perfect balance if you ask me, well, as balanced as dessert can be. Another whimsical, creative and interactive dessert from Chef Ian Kittichai."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-03-14,4.0,"Perfect post-dinner date spot. It's very tiny, so don't expect privacy or setting ""the mood""..in fact I had to share a table. Got the Matcha Lava Cake, very good but also very tiny considering it was over $11. The Taro bubble tea was sweet but not over bearing. 
+Quality dessert
-Okay ambience 
-On now expensive side considering portions
+Quick (almost too quick..let me enjoy my dessert and company)"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-09-13,3.0,"As my friends and I were wandering around East Village on a Saturday night, we decided to wait in line at Spot Dessert Bar after dinner.

Since we weren't too hungry, we decided to share the milky puff 3 way. The actual dessert was pretty tasty but the presentation was kind of sloppy and didn't look like the picture. Even though I don't mind paying in the double digits for dessert, I do not think what we got was worth the price at all. The portion size and flavor wasn't any special than some other dessert places I have tried in New York.

Surprisingly, I would actually come back to try another item, but I would only go occasionally for the experience."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-08-17,5.0,"I love this dessert options. I was more fascinated by Instagram on those interesting dessert pictures and couldn't stop craving after viewing it. When I had a chance to be in neighborhood, we checked into this place for a waitlist while we were wrapping up our dinner. And that helped us to be in track and avoid the long line of wait at their bar. 
I had the harvest which was a feast to flavors. And my husband happen to take the golden toast, as a fan of bread fan. 
I loved my dessert and would like to come in for some drinks along with desserts next time."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-09-04,5.0,"Wow this is my new favorite dessert spot!! We came from dinner since we didn't want to order dessert at the restaurant and this was an amazing decision.

Spot offers Live Wait on Yelp, which I recommend doing if you're visiting on the weekend.

The atmosphere is pretty cozy, it's a small spot so it can be cramped at times.

The dessert here is so delicious! We ordered The Harvest and Golden Toast and everything was made to perfection. The little chocolate crunchies on The Harvest made it so good. It's a super smooth, almost a cream like texture Cheesecake and topped with chocolate and chocolate crunchies. 

I'll be back again soon!!!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-08-29,5.0,"This was my 2nd visit to Spot in just a month span. The desserts here are unmatched and it was perfect way to end date night. 

I ordered the cookie camp as it combines chocolate chip cookies and ice cream - my favorite dessert combination. The added pretzel makes every spoonful sweet and salty - YUM. I ordered my girlfriend the Golden Toast as I knew she'd love it the blend of flavors. The creativity of these desserts on top of the amazing service makes this one of the best dessert locations in NYC. 

Yes, believe the hype. Capture awesome IG worthy photos and Enjoy ! & pick up a Chocolate chip/Oreo cookie to go, you won't regret it."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-03-04,5.0,"Honestly I went here for the instagram pic. 
The desserts are the cutest! 

It sort of has a coffee shop vibe. It's like a coffee shop but for desserts."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-06-20,4.0,"After learning that Spot Dessert has the flower pot dessert, I was very curious to try it! We went to the store located in East Village but they have multiple locations around New York. My friend and I arrived around 8:30 PM and had to wait ten minutes to get seated. P.S. Jeremy Lin has visited this place!

The inside was very cute and hip. It definitely attracts a younger crowd. We ended up sharing a table with another couple but the seating was comfortable enough. 

[ The Harvest ]  The appeal of this dessert is definitely its novelty. I am still blown away by how much the oreo crumbs in the flower pot resemble soil. Before digging in, we ""watered the plant"" with the sweet milk that they provided in a small metal pitcher. Below the top layer of oreo crumbs is cheesecake. Honestly the flavor of the dessert was mediocre but the adorable presentation of the dish was worth it!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-01-11,5.0,"Overall a nice experience for me and my friend. The place was packed but we didn't really have to wait to be seated. We tried the matcha IPA and matcha lava. I'm not a fan of beers but the matcha IPA tasted pretty smooth though we can't really taste the matcha - it looks really cool though, like a dark green juice lol. Next one was the matcha lava comprised of the lava cake filled with melted chocolate and matcha mix plus a matcha ice cream sitting on top of some crumbles. Loved the cake but didn't care much for the ice cream because it had a more concentrated matcha flavor so it tasted a tiny bit bitter. Would love to go back and try other desserts!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-13,5.0,Tried the milky puff for the first time and was extremely satisfied. Loved the different textures in this dessert dish. Beware that it is extremely sweet!! My friend seemed to enjoy the seasonal Coffee Mountain too. The Pastel De Natas (Portuguese egg tarts) were okay - nothing special  and pricey for the size/quality. Still five stars for the main desserts! Just won't order the sides again.
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-01-14,4.0,"I heard so many good things about this place and decided to give it a try. I got their most famous item on the menu: Matcha Lava. I am a huge matcha fan, so I knew this dessert would hit the spot after lunch. The matcha is a very strong taste and it's more on the savory side than sweet. The lava cake gives of good sweet and savory balance for the dessert. It can get a little overpowering so I suggest ordering coffee on the side."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-04-28,5.0,"A great place to meet friends! Desserts are absolutely delicious and not too sweet. Not to mention, also very photogenic and trendy."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-06-23,4.0,"Spot is another highly reviewed and hyped dessert bar in New York, and I've tried my hardest from coming here. It seems like one of those places that has really mediocre desserts for expensive prices, but honestly my friend and I were pleasantly surprised. 

The service here on a busy Saturday night is excellent. Waiters stopped by multiple times to refill our water glasses and ask how we were doing. My friend and I ordered the Harvest and the Milky Puff. Both came out really quickly. 

The Harvest. I don't typically like cheesecake, and this is also one of the desserts I've seen all over the Internet. I was pretty reluctant to order this, but it completely knocked my expectations out of the park. The raspberry sorbet is not that good--it's a bit too sour and tangy for my taste. Originally, I don't really like sorbet either. The cheesecake is incredibly moist, delicate, and light. I would say it doesn't even taste like cheesecake. There are whole raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries embedded in the cake. If you dig your spoon deep enough, there is chocolate cake at the very bottom. I'm really curious as to how this dessert is plated and created because it's a pretty complex dessert with a lot of flavors and textures, but somehow, everything comes together really well. 

Milky Puff. This is probably my favorite one of the night. There's a scoop of milky ice cream on top of a delicious crispy pastry. Honey is drizzled on top, and there's a bar of white chocolate on the side. My friend and I really liked the combination of the pastry with the ice cream. I would pay just to eat the pastry because it was just that soft and delicate. There was a lot of honey, and I think that made the dessert a lot more aggressive. It was a bit too sweet because of the honey. I also don't like white chocolate, but the bark could've just been there for decoration purposes. 


TLDR; the desserts are really well plated but also complex flavor-wise. I would come here again, and I highly recommend Spot. I definitely don't think it's overhyped. There clearly was a lot of thought into creating both desserts, and I really appreciated it!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-05-24,4.0,"We are avid fans of Spot Dessert. We have come to this location 3 or 4 times now and enjoy stopping by whenever we are in the area. The first time we came here we were blown away with the amazing taste of the desserts. However, the prices have increased and the quality/quantity has been the same. It's a bit pricey, but still delicious. At this location, I would be ready for a 15-20 minute wait depending on the day and time. They change up a part of their menu throughout the year, and we like to try the new flavors that come out. Our favorites are the classic 3.

My Recommendations (in this order):
-The Harvest
-Golden Toast 
-Matcha Lava

Price: $$"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-03-19,5.0,"I love this spots! took my co-workers to this location and they have a bathroom. i love the 3 dessert deal for $32! it is perfect for parties of three. it suggests for party of 2 but when me and my friend got it, we were stuffed! it tends to get packed but it is super worth waiting for. they have a smaller location 6 stores down. i highly recommend. i will be coming back here again! also, the servers were super friendly and made us feel super comfortable and explains to us any questions we have on whatever desserts."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-06-06,3.0,"It tasted good but definitely not worth the price. The service was good though. 

I wouldn't mind paying $12 for dessert if flavors were unique or there was some special baking technique. However, I feel like you are literally just paying for a picture here and not for food. The harvest seems like an easy dessert to make, just layers of cake crumbs and cheese frosting in a potted plant. There was also nothing special about the flavors. I couldn't even taste the earl grey I poured over this. I mean it was good but I've had better desserts for ~$10-15. 

This is something I wouldn't mind skipping if I did my NY trip again. 

P.S. my friends and I did not enjoy the matcha IPA"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-05-17,5.0,"After finishing our dinner at the Ugly Kitchen we used yelp to find somewhere to get something sweet near by. Spot Dessert Bar was a short 5 minute walk at most.

St. Marks Place was really vibrant with activity on this pleasant May evening. We found Spot and were told we would have  a 5-10 minute wait for our party of 5. No problem, we walked around a little and were surprised that there are actually two Spot Dessert Bars, or at least two seating areas on the same block. Only in the village and only in NYC!

Service was really great and our server was very friendly. We ordered two desserts, two tea drinks, a soda, a cookie and and a coffee. The Miso Butterscotch cake with steamed miso cake, miso butterscotch drizzle, mascarpone cream served with condensed milk ice cream was incredible. The Matcha Lava was even better, with warm dark chocolate cake filled with matcha ganache, served with matcha green tea ice cream. If you like Matcha and Green Tea this is your dessert. The teas, coffee, homemade soda and cookie were excellent also.

Highly recommended."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-11-30,4.0,"Two specials: The toast is way to sweet, but Matcha lava is good though the lava doesn't reach the standard fluidity. 
Other dishes: Harvest is very special for its plating.
Drinks: The rose milk bubble tea tastes really weird, but bubble tea besides it is good. 
The egg tarts and cookies are delicious but way too sweet.
Highly recommend for friends gathering, if you like really sweet food."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-12-12,4.0,"Dessert is like always amazing here, definitely no question asked. So many options, not too sweet, has a selection of drinks as well, tea, coffee, wine. Place is also very clean and service is friendly. Was not a big fun of a waitress keep pushing us to get cookies when we were clear, no cookies for us. But otherwise a nice place. We got new dessert chestnut butterscotch."
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-11-02,3.0,This review is for todays visit. We had this dessert last year but it's a bit pricey. The matcha was so-so not too sweet but the lava cake tasted a bit different specially the texture I'm not sure if they use microwave to reheat it. The price of $13.10 is a bit too much. There was nothing special all in all. Probably my last visit.
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2020-02-26,5.0,"My favorite dessert spot in the area! All their desserts are so tasty, very rich and sweet. It definitely satisfies my sweet tooth. My all time favorite is the golden toast. It's just the perfect creation ever! I've pretty much tried their entire menu throughout the years and they're always introducing new items depending on the season. If you come with a group, it's worth ordering a few different item. Service is always great here; the staff can recommend you something depending on what you're in the mood for!"
7,spot-dessert-bar-new-york-2,2019-03-14,4.0,"Not to be confused with Star Trek (Spock Dessert Bar), suicide off a tall building (Splat Dessert Bar), or Bae's latest movie (Spunk Dessert Bar).

If you can spot the difference between this spot and the ones in Flushing then you're quite astute. And you're a pro. Maybe we're both pros/astutes. 

It's pretty obvious actually. There's no room whatsoever in this one. It gets very busy and there's almost never anywhere to sit. Prices are really high and I actually think the service at the one in Flushing might be better. This one is just too cramped for its own good.

It's trying to be a little coffee shop but it's one of the most popular dessert bars in the city on one of the most popular streets in the city. So this presents a problem. No space.

Yes their products are pretty good but hyper sweet and some of them are not that good at all. It's definitely an overrated place but just because I do actually like some of the stuff I'll give it a healthy 4 star rating. But seriously there's nowhere to sit so watch out for that cuz it's not going to be easy. They just really need a bigger space.

My alt review:

The Sweet Spot is a nice dessert place with expensive Asian desserts - it's a sit down place and you have to tip the waitress and so on. There's not a lot of space here cuz it's a tiny Saint Mark's Place location.

The one in Queens is much more elaborate and massive, sometimes way busier and more modern and spacious. This one is a little trendier.

Honestly I don't find the desserts to be great and I think the main problem is that they cost about four times more than they should. I know it's the number one date night spot and I know I'm hating on something that everybody loves but I don't really love it. I prefer the one in Flushing anyway."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2020-05-19,5.0,"Gotta give them credit for their customer service during this covid pandemic. I was offered hand sanitizer and even the ability to sample the drink so that they could make it perfect. They also allow only one customer a time inside the store which causes a line sometimes but I feel much safer this way, and I do not mind waiting if it means safety. Thanks Teado and staff! Stay safe."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2020-06-01,5.0,"This little gem is one of Chinatown's best kept secrets. It's a tiny shop with no tables, it has great teas and creative drinks. I very highly recommend it. 

nstead of just the run-of-the-mill black milk tea, Teado serves a variety of different teas with a variety of different sugar levels. I've had the original black milk tea and pu-erh milk tea, both of which were really good. I also really enjoyed their coconut milk tea. 

What I appreciate about Teado over other tea places, besides the wide variety of options, is that as the barista is preparing your teas, he gives you a little bit to taste test before he seals the top of your glass, just to make sure you're getting exactly what you want. 

I also really like the interior - it's really cute and welcoming. My favorite part of the decor is a little tip box where you place a coin on a button, and when you push it, a cat figurine comes out and paws it into the box. It's really adorable and fun to try as you're waiting for your tea. 

If you've never been here, I highly recommend you try it."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2020-01-19,5.0,"This place is my favorite bubble tea shop in New York City. It's a small little shop, with only a couple of seats. But they have the best bubble tea. Teado Tea has the greatest coconut bubble tea; I ever had. It is my favorite drink and it's the one thing I always get wherever I go; if they even have coconut flavored tea. The matcha milk tea is also a great choice. 

I love and appreciate that you can mix your choice of tea, fruit and toppings. The green tea jelly has become my new favorite. This please is so accommodating that they let you pick your suger, tea strength, and ice level too. Wait, what! Other places do that too. Well do they let you try it and adjusted for you if it's  not the way you like it. Well Teado Tea does. Mic drop right?  Just another reason this place is so wonderfully awesome.

Now they don't just have drinks here, but delicious snakes too. Like there thick cut toast, with your choice of chocolate, Nutella, coconut (which yes it's my love, I get two every time I come), peanut butter, and condensed milk. You don't want some toast? Well, they also have dessert too; like pudding and other a stuff. If you want a  savory snack then the onigari is the way to go. There are a few options like crab meat, fish eggs, dried meat, and other options that I don't remember. It's a big menu.  

The space is cute decorated  with anime figurine. There is a smell fish  in the corner. That I adore. There's also a small book self with manga. But I don't think they are in English, I would totally read  them all. (definitely need to confirm). The staff is always nice and polite. They also expect Apple Pay, which a greatly appreciate. Considering I heat going fishing in my bag for my wallet."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2020-01-12,5.0,"Pretty good boba place (and walking distance to wah fung).

I'm a fan of their taro slush with clouddo. Torn between the boba or egg pudding topping. Boba is chewy but tad too sweet while egg pudding is creamy but goes away too quickly haha. Clouddo is really delicious - apparently you can get ""double clouddo"" for $1. Might try that the next time I'm feeling hedonistic.

Ps: to save you from shame, I already asked if you can get a cup full of clouddo. Answer is no"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-11-06,5.0,"Teado Tea Shop is amazing ! It's a small shop packed with a delicious selection of drinks. Upon entering, I was slightly overwhelmed by the extensive menu on the wall. Teado allows you to customize your tea to precisely how you like it. 
At Teado you can choose :
1) the tea strength
2) the sugar level 
3) the temperature - hot, warm, cold, how much ice 
4) the topping(s) - tapioca, litchi jelly, aloe Vera, red bean, clouddo cream etc 
5) the type of tea - so many different kinds - I tried the osmanthus oolong tea with milk and honey - outstanding! 

An added bonus - they allow you to sample the tea before your order is completed - to make sure it's exactly the way you like it. If it's too sweet or not sweet enough, you can correct it on the spot. They also offer fruity juices & slushies as well as food. Very happy to have found Teado. And don't forget the free WiFi. Great tea shop!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-08-30,3.0,"Decided to do a milk tea crawl today, this block is really good for Bubble Milk Tea. Teado had soooooo many choices of tea!! I felt like I was looking at a pokemon of tea options, gotta collect them all.

The first thing you will notice is the place is TINY, tiny but really good atmosphere/environment.

The service is very good, at bubble milk tea places i usually get a small 30% sugar. He kept asking if I wanted it sweeter which was cool, unfortunately i thought the foamyness was due to it being a tiny sample. I didn't realize it was being blended until after the big cup and the whole thing tasted like a thick shake. Next time i will ask for it to not be blended.

Overall: The place is pretty good and quaint, will come to again. Just didn't like the lack of choices in size."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-07-11,5.0,"One of my most favorite places to get boba tea in Manhattan. The shop belongs to a very nice young couple who make everything from scratch so everything is very fresh. They only have one location in Chinatown, so every time I go, I buy 4 drinks at a time to last me for the week! Yes, that's how much I love the tea here. 

Its a hidden gem in Chinatown. @traveleen_gurl"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-05-08,5.0,"Living in Chinatown, there's no shortage of Boba spots. Walk two blocks in any direction and you'll probably stumble upon one. I gave Teado Tea Shop a try after dinner, and the experience stuck out.

For one, the decor is remarkable. Tons of succulents lining the counter and cute figurines ranging from Totoros to Marvel characters.

They have a large array of tea flavors for Boba. I went with the black sesame boba because I love black sesame sweets and have never tried it for boba. You get to choose the level of sweetness AND the strength of the tea (that's new for me!). The worker was super attentive, giving me and my girlfriend a taste of our bobas to make sure sweetness was spot on.

I went for the strong tea and definitely tasted the genuine flavor. Definitely worth checking out this spot if you love boba. They also carry desserts like golden toast."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-05-28,4.0,"Good place to get authentic tea in Chinatown. If you're tired of your normal Kung Fu Teas, Cocos, Chatimes, definitely stop by this place. It's a cute small business shop and have very wide range of teas. They definitely have things i have never even heard before, and are not as sweet as most bubble teas. 

They also have little snacks and foods to munch on if you're hungry. Would come back again to try other bubble teas. 

Price: 3/5 
Drinks: 4/5 
Service: 5/5"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2020-03-01,5.0,"What a great tea shop! I had never even heard of it but a friend introduced me to it over the weekend. They have a wide range of milk tea flavors along with slushes, regular tea, and the ability to make your own carbonated drinks. The best part, however, is they will let you taste a sample to adjust your sweetness level before they finish making your drink. I've never been to a tea shop that lets you do this before. I got the earl grey milk tea at 75% sweetness (hey, I like my drinks sweet okay) and my friend got a black sesame milk tea. My drink was delicious and still had a great tea flavor. I'm looking forward to frequenting this place more and trying more flavors."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-03-18,4.0,"It was literally so hard to find boba (besides the main chains) in NYC! We dropped by into Teado Tea Shop during our visit to Chinatown. The shop itself is pretty small, but they have a lot of flavors on the menu!

We ordered 2 drinks - the Hong Kong Milk Tea and the Hoji Milk Tea. I was so excited to see that they use Lactaid for their milk teas here, since I always have trouble finding lactose-free boba places. Unfortunately, they were out of boba when we arrived - extra 20 minute wait if we wanted some. I opted out and got herbal jelly instead, which paired nicely with my Hoji Milk Tea. I don't think I've ever tried that flavor of milk tea before, but it wasn't bad! Not sweet at all and has a strong tea taste, but super refreshing and cold. There isn't much room to sit inside, so we took our drinks on the go, as we explored the rest of Chinatown.

Glad I can say I tried authentic boba in NYC, but I think West Coast definitely has their boba game on point compared to NYC."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-09-06,5.0,"I love Teado! It's a small bubble tea shop in Chinatown with seating for about 2-3 so it's more for to go. First of all I love the taste of their teas - it's authentic and not made from powder, secondly the customization options (% sweetness, ice level, type of milk etc), and third of all the customer care - they will give you a sample of your customized drink to try before you decide. Overall a quaint shop with quality bubble teas (and they have a small selection of snacks too) that I go to whenever I am in the area and craving some boba."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-01-04,4.0,"Super happy to find a shop that sells bubble teas with lactose-free milk! As someone who is lactose intolerant, I find myself in a dilemma between pleasing my stomach, or pleasing my stomach and dealing with the consequences. But now I don't have to choose without having to pay extra!

I came here for the first time to try their rose milk tea as that is my favorite drink currently. The lady was nice enough to ask if they should put less milk for a stronger tea taste, as that was what I wanted, and I gladly said yes. I opted for 50% sweetness as I wasn't sure how sweet their drinks were. I probably should've left the sweetness alone as it was a tad bit not sweet enough. Not going to blame them as they did give me a tiny cup to sample. But now I'll know for next time.

The bubbles were alright, maybe a little undercooked. The tea itself was good and I believe they use real tea leaves as it took a while for the drink to come out. Overall, the quality ingredients and thought put into making the perfect cup of bubble tea for their customers were there. I'll probably be back to try their other foods and drinks."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-12-03,5.0,"My second bubble tea (bobatea) of the night . Hehe don't judge me!!! I wanted to try this place because of its amazing rating and WOW I am so glad i went because the lady who made my drink was suuuuper nice. She saw I was having trouble deciding since there were so many options, she told me to check out the top 10 most popular. I opted for the rose milk tea. Yumm she was so sweet, letting me try if it was to my liking before finishing up the drink. AND gave me a baby pink straw, it was like she read my mine because I already picked up my baby pink straw :) anyways, needless to say, this place made my night."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-09-08,5.0,"What I most like about this place is the ordering process is extremely customizable and the guy making your drink lets you taste test it before giving you the full size. 

They also brew their teas fresh which is always a plus.

Personally, I feel their sugar levels are definitely on the less sweet side, so I'd imagine 100% sugar level would be suitable for most people.

I'm very curious to try all the other tea flavors they have and have recommended this place to all my friends who have all enjoyed their experience here as well. The place is a bit small and cramped so just a heads up."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2020-03-02,5.0,"This is my favorite bubble tea shop in NYC. It's a cute, cozy, unassuming little place where the owner is always there spinning up drinks. You can tell that they put a whole lot of care and quality into their drinks - not just from the quality of the ingredients, but also from the fact that they always let you try the drink to ensure it's to your satisfaction. The prices are also reasonable for the quality, especially given that the price of boba in NYC is beginning to approach that of a cheap meal (i.e. the ""famous"" boba international chains that have recently popped up). This down-to-earth shop always makes me feel at home."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-02-26,5.0,"Was meeting a few people in Chinatown and knew that I would be getting there too early so I decided to stop by and give Teado Tea Shop a try. It's a cute little store with quite an extensive menu. There were so many options that I didn't know where to start! In the end, I decided on the Rose Milk Tea since that's not something I can get just anywhere and was also on the Top 10 list. 

One thing that's really cool about the shop is that they let you try your tea before they seal it up so that you can modify it if you still need to. I was really surprised by this extra bit of customer service, even though I was happy enough with my drink as it was. The prices are fairly reasonable as well, especially compared to a lot of the new shops popping up these days. It's not really a place to sit and hang out with your friends due to the small space, but regardless, still a nice place to stop by and grab a drink from!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2020-03-03,5.0,Stumbled upon this place with my SO. The interior is clean and pleasant. The drinks are all priced fairly and are not too expensive. What I really enjoyed about this place was that the person making our teas gave us a sample of our drinks while he was making them so that we could be sure that we liked them and he could make any adjustments if we didn't. Excellent idea and service. I'm super pleased with this place and definitely plan on returning.
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-09-27,5.0,"So this place is super cool. I'm just going to walk you through the whole experience. The place is small. There's three tables. They're very tiny, personal tables. One is actually a bench with a small table hovering over it. Despite the small size, the place is still very nice. It's cute and quaint (Who else peeped the revolving Ironman figurine?). The staff is incredibly friendly and patient. I ordered taro milk tea with boba and everything was made right in front of me. He asked me if I want regular sweet or extra sweet and I said regular. To my surprise he handed me a small cup to taste and asked if it was sweet enough. When it wasn't, he fixed it and let me try again. My tea was a bit weak, but apparently I could have asked for it to be stronger and they would have done that. I wish I had known that, but knowing it now, I have to give this place 5 stars. The accommodation is wonderful. The staff is wonderful. To top it off, the tea is actually fresh and you can taste the difference. My taro boba didn't taste processed. It tasted herbal and rich. They blended it with the milk, so it was frothy. An overall great experience."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-07-01,5.0,"Read that they use real, fresh tea for their bubble teas which, unfortunately, is not the norm at all these powdered bubble tea shops. And wow, can you taste the difference! My earl grey bubble tea was so delicious, and SO COLD, which on this 99-degree day, was so stupendously perfect. 

Another wonderful thing is that they let you taste-test your tea in case there's too much sugar or not enough. 

5 Stars!!!!!!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-07-26,5.0,"This place is probably my favorite tea shop in Chinatown, everything here is really authentic and unique, from the cutely decorated interior, to the vast menu of drinks and food to choose from, to the way the store is run, I really like it. 
I first came here on a Friday afternoon with my sister, the shop was packed full so we had to wait quite a bit for our order to be taken, which normally would bother me a little, but I wasn't bothered at all because I saw there were two ppl working as fast as they could, but they didn't let up on any customer service. 
Their menu is big and has a lot to choose from, and boba isn't that expensive at all, 3.50 without bubbles and $4 with, give or take, and the onigiri too looked really good. 
The onigiri especially, is hand made and each one has love and care put into it, and sometimes when they aren't that busy, they allow you to taste a pArt of the drink you ordered to see if you liked it or wanted to sweeter. 
I like this shop because it's not a chain store that sells bubble tea, it's an authentic tea shop run by charismatic people."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-05-04,3.0,"I really wanted to like this place, because they have such a variety of tea and they use actual milk, not powdered milk! I came here on a friend's recommendation, and I got the tie guan yin milk tea with boba, no sugar no ice. I really like that I got offered to try my tea for sweetness levels before my drink got sealed and handed to me; no other boba shop I've ever been to has offered to do that. But sadly, the tea flavor was just not very strong. The bubbles were chewy and good, though smaller than usual bubbles which is fine, and I really enjoyed the real milk. If the tea flavor were stronger, I would've been happy. For $4.36 including tax, it's on the cheaper side for bubble tea, so at least there's that!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2017-12-31,5.0,"For those, like me, who religiously worship Bubble Tea, the infamous Christian phrase ""What Would Jesus Do?"" is now being replaced by the much more relevant question: ""What Would Tea Do?"" This tea shop is named after these spiritual words of Bubble Tea worship.

The products here are very rich, and they only have one size. They have truly wonderful tapioca. The honey oolong drink is not sweet, but good. The girl serving me was absolutely lovely and after several trips here, it still just about retains its five star rating.

Now here is my older review when I first fell in love with the place:

The Bubble Tea itself was excellent, both the fruit and milk tea that I tried, although I have been meaning to come back and try the regular milk tea rather than the recommended Taro. They use Lactaid, although you probably won't know it, so that those with dairy allergies can still drink the milk tea.

The ""Clouddo"" is interesting, both in name and concept, and is one of the specialties that are particular to this little shop.

The prices are a little lower than most of the nearby Bubble Tea shops, and the service is really lovely. They gave me a cup holder for just 2 drinks (because I had 2 others waiting outside from other shops), and a lot of Bubble Tea shops amazingly won't do that. And they were generally really nice.

My fave thing about this shop is probably that it's tiny and cute and on a back street, completely family owned and not at all chain-y or corporate. It's a really sweet experience in the Chinatown area. My fave Bubble Tea shops in NYC are all in Queens, but of the indie ones in Manhattan, I would say this was my fave.

And I'm glad they don't overcharge like a lot of places do. Because that would be a ""Teadon't"" rather than a ""Teado."""
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-10-26,4.0,"I love this place. The tea they make here is really good and authentic, they don't serve anything powdery here. I had the HK milktea with boba and it was delicious. It tasted proper, they use lactaid milk, and it wasn't overly sweet. The person always gives you a small cup to taste before serving you the drink, which makes a huge difference. Also, the onigiris were absolutely perfect. We got the eel onigiri and it was one of the best I've had coming from someone whose been to japan. They give a lot of eel and make everything from scratch, it's not premade.

The only issue I had was with the wait times. Even a small line takes some time because it's one person. We waited 25 minutes for 2 drinks and onigiri because he had to serve other people before making it himself. I appreciate the passion and delicious tea, but waiting 20-25 minutes (even IF we don't order onigiri) with a small line is a bit long. Would be nice if he had an extra person to help out with the traffic this place gets. Some people just left after waiting 10 minutes and not being served."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-01-05,4.0,"I ordered Rose honey tea, and it tastes really good. The chief ask you to try a little first and then decide, which is really considerate. Price is also good compared to those new opened tea shop. Everything is around $4.
The music is also quiet and there is a cute small bookshelf for you to read"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2017-10-23,4.0,"This place is great if you love actual real tea in your bubble tea. There are so many different types of drinks that it gets overwhelming! 

I also love the interior. It gives it a homey feeling with cute figurines on the wall and decorations. They aren't like what majority of the bubble tea places look like. However, the only downside is this place is pretty small. So it could get easily crowded if you have more than 6 people in there."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-02-18,5.0,"Good, solid bubble tea. The menu is a bit overwhelming and there's a ton of options but that could be good for everyone. The space is really tight and there's a few seats but not comfortable. They're a bit slow but the flavor of the tea is good :-)"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-03-17,5.0,"Lovely tiny shop! Knowledgeable and courteous cashier. Enjoyed early gray with coconut, of which had a bit more sugar than I was seeking but the two balanced out well."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2017-08-15,4.0,"Teado does tea right! This adorable hole in the wall bubble tea spot have many great tea options. It comes in a one-size cup and you can choose anything in either hot or cold. The space is small but there are a few seats for people who want to enjoy their drink sitting down. 

We came on a rainy day so we both opted for a hot tea. I ordered the jasmine oolong milk tea and my friend got the earl grey milk tea. The staff was very nice and even let me have honey on the side instead of having it directly added to the drink (I like knowing how much sugar goes into my tea). My friend got 75% sweetness and it wasn't that sweet which is great! Both teas were yummy. And as other reviewers have point out the milk teas are made with lactaid milk, which is better for my stomach! 

Definitely recommend this place for bubble tea or just tea in general!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2020-02-19,5.0,"i just stopped in for a hot earl gray milk tea before dinner with a friend, and i was surprised by how good their milk tea was! i got a basic order and am generally not picky, but the milk tea was so good! regular sweetness is usually too sweet for my taste--but it was perfect here! it was quick, the space is small but cozy, and the guy even let me sample it before he finished making it for me. give this place a try if you're in the area!!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2017-06-19,3.0,"Tiny, non-chain boba stop. Grab and go since there aren't many seats... but what a cute place with all of the knick-knacks.

Menu is huge and more unique than you typically see. They have bubble teas, slushes, clouddos (I think tea with heavy cream on top?), and much more. There were at least 7 different kinds of mix-ins, and of course dozens of flavors for the tea. They also have food-- a few sweets and a very good deal on onigiri.

I went with rose milk tea because I saw it on the top 10 list on the wall and requested it at 50% sweetness. She let me taste it as she made it which made me switch to the 75%. Still, the tea was very aggressively floral and I couldn't finish it. The boba in it was fine but not the best I've had.

I also had the match rain drop cake, which was pretty good. I liked mixing it with the cream and the red beans that came alongside it.

I'll return for a different tea and onigiri the next time I find myself in this part of Chinatown."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-02-18,5.0,"Cute little (emphasis on little) tea shop with some of the best bubble tea around. Everything is highly customizable and the earl grey tea with bubbles and almond flavor was delicious. The menu is large and interesting, so would love to try other things next time. First on my list of things tontry: the cloud tea, which apparently their best seller. Make sure you're not in a rush though when you stop because it can take a little time with only 1 or 2 people working. But worth the wait!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-08-04,2.0,"I like to think I'm a bubble tea expert. This place was not great. I felt bad for the one man working there and the line that was building up. Service was friendly, but slow - my review isn't based on that. The black milk tea option is only Earl Grey tea which is unusual. Usually you have an option of Assam black. The tea flavor itself was weak, tea strength needed to be stronger. The bubbles had good chewiness but were not sweet enough. I really wasn't great - wouldn't come back."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-10-24,5.0,"One of my favorite bubble tea stores in NYC. I love that they let you taste the tea before handing you over the finished product. Additionally, the cafe has really cute asian anime decor, and I appreciate that they use real milk in their teas (thankfully Lactaid!). I would recommend this bubble tea store to anyone looking for some quality and reasonably price bubble tea!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-07-07,3.0,"Admittedly I was not pleased to find out about the 0.25 transaction fee for credit cards BUT this place excels in that they give customers the ability to customize their drinks in many different ways (including caffeine strength, sugar level, and temperature).

Also, the guy working behind the counter would give us samples of what the drink would taste like to ensure that we would be happy with the final result.

Bonus point: they use real milk Lactaid instead of the powdered stuff that many tea shops resort to.  This makes Teado suitable for our lactose intolerant friends!!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2017-07-25,4.0,"The smallest bubble tea shop I have seen anywhere but with a lot of character and beautiful steering.

Decided on this tea shop based on the reviews, it has a great selection of tea and juice drinks be far. I ordered the strawberry lychee juice with lychee jelly and have it carbonated.

It was fresh, refreshing and just the right amount of sweetness to it. If in the area, give it a try!!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-07-06,5.0,"There are plenty of boba places in Chinatown but what makes Teado so special is that they are a small mom and pop shop owned by a lovely husband and wife duo (and their adorable kid!) and every drink is truly made with a lot of care - they give every customer a sample of their drink to make sure they like it. Their milk teas are made with lactaid (instead of alternatives like milk powder or condensed milk that other shops use), so it tastes natural and like you're actually drinking freshly brewed tea. They also make their boba fresh every day (sometimes I come in too early and the boba isn't ready yet). I have been coming to Teado every time I'm in the area for the last 5+ years and they never disappoint!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-01-21,5.0,Real milk and real tea. Light. Healthy. Cheap. They even accept credit card without a minimum. No complains.
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-10-01,4.0,I really enjoy the Hong Kong Style Milk tea I ordered from here. You get a really good taste of the tea flavor. The guy brews the tea fresh and would let you sample it before giving you the full amount which is a huge plus. There is a lot of choices you can choose from the menu and customizations which can get pretty overwhelming. The only reason I deduct a star was the tapioca which I recommend to stay away from. But overall very was a good experience and would come back to try more teas.
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-09-01,4.0,"First off they make a really fresh cup of tea. I am a herbal jelly person. They made the best ginger tea, get it with 25% to 50% sugar and less ice. Second like someone mentioned I prefer to frequent small businesses when possible and pay in cash if it is under $10. Even with chains I look into the background of the business and its practice. With small businesses, I hope they are ethical with their practice and in my heart I like to believe the owner is struggling to survive financially not about being rich."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-11-07,5.0,"This bubble tea shop is unlike any others for a few reasons:

- they ONLY use lactaid, which is great if you're lactose intolerant.
- after they make your drink with your preferred sugar level, they give you a quick taste in a small cup so that you can adjust as necessary.
- they make their drinks with REAL tea.

The tea tastes great and their tapioca is cooked perfectly. The only downside is that it takes quite awhile to order and eventually get your drink since there's usually only 1 person (the owner) working as both the cashier and the person making the drinks. The space is also pretty small/tight, so it can get packed on the weekends with barely any standing room."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-10-06,4.0,"One of my fav bubble tea stores in NY-Chinatown. The place is small, but if your an animation lover, especially for One Piece 海賊王! The store also have the selection of fresh fruit drinks and lactose milk. I love their typical bubbles milk tea. Fresh milk in it"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-05-14,5.0,"My husband, friends and coworkers like this Taiwanese bubble tea shop. They don't use corn syrup in the bubble tea. The homemade onigiri are delicious.The bosses are nice."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-07-19,4.0,"Order: The Rose Green Tea had the perfect amount of sweetness and flowery scent. Unlike many drinks from other places, this one had a hint of tea aftertaste, which I means the tea was freshly made. And the color made it so aesthetic! The Bamboo Shoot & Tuna Onigiri was very flavorful, with a good proportion between the rice and filling.

Price: $3.25 for the drink and $4 for 3 small-sized onigiri. Very cheap!

Atmosphere: Since the shop is very small, there aren't many seating areas, but there are a lot of cute decorations to look at. The service was a bit slow considering there was only one person working when I went."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-08-08,5.0,"Such a cute place that gets very crowded around lunch time, so I had to wait a while for my drink. I was torn on what to get, so she let me smell the tea leaves before I ordered. The oolong smelled amazing, so after going with that and right before receiving my full drink she put a sampler in a smaller cup for me to taste if sugar level was alright, which I really appreciated and something she didn't have to do. Great service, and I enjoyed my tea:)"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-08-25,5.0,"Really awesome tea shop! Super small but super friendly. They definitely take their time with each and every order, they gave me a sample of mine to check if I was happy with the sweetness and the flavor. It's kind of a gem in the midst of the hundreds of Chinatown tea shops, but for bubble tea it's my favorite. It's also near the park so you can enjoy your tea on a bench there. They also have little snacks, onigiri and things if you're hungry."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2017-12-28,3.0,"I've been here on several occasions to grab a typical bubble milk tea. On my most recent trip here, I decided to be a bit more adventurous and try out their clouddo series. My friend and I settled for the Green Milk Tea with bubbles and the clouddo. For those of you that don't know, several Chinatown bubble tea chains have been implementing the same general white custard/cream-like topping that is somewhat buttery and salty. The name of this topping just varies from chain to chain. It just so happens to be called clouddo here. 

I wasn't really impressed with my drink to be honest. The clouddo left a buttery/oily residue on my tongue, which is never a good sign. I'd say if you'd like to try out their clouddo series,but health-conscious, ask for less clouddo. 

Overall, my experience here at Teado was mediocre. I remember there being a drink made from real avocados (avocado slush) over at the  Teados in Boston and Philadelphia. They don't offer such drink here. Maybe because this store is independently owned? But my review would sure be 5 stars if they'd offer the drink at this location! 

P.S. There usually is just one guy making drinks at this location. The drinks do take a bit longer to make compared to other Chinatown bubble tea joints."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2017-02-03,4.0,"Tips:
This place is small, so don't expect to find seating on a cold day (luckily we did)
There's only one guy working, and everything is hand made to order (kind of like a mixologist for bubble tea?) thus, your order could take awhile. Come back if there's too big of a line.
Sometimes they run out of bubbles/boba but it doesn't take too long for a fresh batch to be made - walk around Chinatown while you wait and come back.

(+) Fresh Tea (authentic, or uses tea leaves, definitely brings out the true tea flavor, no powders used)

Got the Jasmine Green Tea Clouddo + Bubbles: the vanilla cream on top is quite interesting. To be honest, I love how strong the Jasmine tea here is - it tastes top notch. The guy makes it fresh for you, and there's a lot of customizability. Also, I ordered 50% at first, but he let me taste the drink first and adjust the sweetness upward (to 75% apparently, as they don't go by the americanized scale of 25% tastes like other places' 100%). Great service.

I don't have any issues with the texture of the bubbles - luckily we got a fresh batch as earlier they ran out so we went to get Mango Mango and come back - quantity is also pretty good.

Matcha Raindrop Dessert: I was wary of trying this out because of the negative reviews on the fad-y plain raindrop desserts. However, as with the drinks, the matcha flavor definitely came through. On the side, you get some cream (similar to what's in the clouddo) as well as red beans for garnish - recommend you to try it out!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-12-27,5.0,"Good quality drinks, good services, friendly and well served. Love their milk tea! Highly recommended and must try~"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-11-14,3.0,"I wish I had liked this place more. The shop is cute, the people are nice. When you order the tea, they make you a sample and make sure it's the right amount of sugar and ice, which is a nice touch that you don't see in other bubble tea stores. I was very excited to see the osthmanthus tea (haha I never know how to spell this). So I ordered it, but was sad that there was barely a hint of the osthmanthus in the tea. Hubby ordered the milk tea, which I personally thought was better than our local Vivis but he thought it was bland. So on we go trying to find another bubble tea place in that area."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-02-17,4.0,"Today I learned that one can mix Jasmine and Oolong tea with milk followed by Rose syrup... and that's exactly what I got, with bubbles!

Before sealing the milk tea, the tea shop let every customer try their tea to make sure this meets expectation in terms of taste. I was therefore able to adjust my syrup level up, which I appreciated.

The drink itself was too much of a mix for me, so next time I plan to order something more standard. Nonetheless, I like the tea taste and the fact that they use Lacaid whole milk!"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-11-18,4.0,Small tea shop in Chinatown that gives you a taste of your tea before they finish it to make sure you are happy with the taste. Not many seats and it usually takes 10 minutes for them to make the tea due to the number of people who are ordering tea. Service was nice and the tea was good.
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-07-18,4.0,"Very cute shop, very nice employees, boba isn't fresh. Meh. Tried it for the good ratings but I'll go somewhere else next time.

8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-08-28,5.0,"For the longest time, I thought NYC sucked when it came to boba milk tea... until Teado. In the midst of all the chains of Coco's, Kung Fu Tea, Gong Cha, and Vivi's, Teado is a nice little shop making high quality milk teas. The guy who mans the front (and back) will always give you a sample of your drink to make sure it's the right sweetness for you. I haven't had anything I didn't like yet. Honestly, this is the only place I trust to satisfy my boba cravings.

Improvements: Please have a large 24 oz cup option!! I'm not use to ordering 16 oz. It's not enough. It's never enough."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2017-01-03,3.0,"I tried teado for the first time yesterday. I ordered the green milk tea iced with boba, osmanthus milk tea iced with boba, and eel onigri. I have mixed feelings about the drinks. I like that the tea is freshly brewed with tea leaves and that they use fresh lactaid milk. Both drinks had a good balance of sweetness and tea flavor. However, I didn't enjoy the boba's texture. They're smaller than the normal size and very soft as if it was dissolving.

I personally really liked the eel onigri. 3 pieces for $4 is great deal. I love how we got gloves to eat them with our hands - which is the right way to eat it. It's handmade on the spot so you get it nice and warm. It's a great snack when you're hungry but don't want to be too full. 

The place is very small with quirky decor. Although the cafe fit 2 small tables and some chairs, I personally didn't like how crowded the place felt. It's not a great place for groups or meet ups due to the limited space. Also, it took around 20 minutes for our drink and food order because there was only 1 person taking orders / making drinks & food. I can imagine that this could be a hassle if the line was even longer. Overall I'm glad I got to check this place out, but I'll probably go somewhere else to get my boba fix."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-07-27,5.0,"Teado has been my favorite go-to bubble tea shop ever since they opened 9 years ago but I finally felt compelled to give them their 5-star review because I just had them cater my wedding (I love them that much), it was a huge hit, and I am so ridiculously happy with them. 

I have maybe a dozen favorites from over the years: papaya milk tea, peach & lychee w/aloe, red jujube & longan, kumquat lime juice (good for a sore throat!), anything with clouddo, matcha slush, coconut & strawberry slush, (ok at this point I'm just rattling off the whole menu. TL;DR i love everything).

The prices are fair, the decor is cute, they use lactaid milk and REAL TEA, the snacks are super yummy, and they make sure your order is personalized to your taste. My only complaint? It gets too packed sometimes and I just want to sit inside and relax with my bubble tea T-T

(More about the catering: they are a mom+pop shop and not really set up for that kind of large ordering, but the owner was so kind to work with us to make it happen, we provided large containers for the tea and he made everything ready for us to pick up before the shop opened)"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2019-12-07,5.0,Holy smokes I've been here many times didn't write a review until I tried their rice ball what a hidden gem this place is a must go the decorations are so nice looks pretty fun always cool durning the summer and nice heat durning the winter not too overwhelming the owner was very attentive nice attitude clean place to ask just grab snack and boba it a small but friendly shop theres a spot to sit a couple people and just relax also milk teas are all very good also the rice balls are phonomenal so tasty and delicious I would really recommend the dry pork and the eel so freaking delicious better than all the other spots decorated in a nice box everything about this place is very positive compared to other places I went to little to big spots the rice balls at this place just outshines many of them not saying there aren't better spots there probabaly are but this is pretty outstanding :) good luck to the owner and the shop!!!!!

8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-04-27,4.0,"A small milk tea place. I got the rose milktea and my sister hot the oloong milktea. It tastes ok, just average, nothing really stand out.
Credit card can be use without charging a fee ($.25) if one purchases more than $10 (lucky i had enough cash haha). 
There is only one person working so it seems like this is not a busy place. 
oh they also have like 4 seats inside."
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2017-09-13,4.0,"Bubble, Bubble. Toil and Trouble.  

Am convinced some sort of sorceress must have invented Bubble Tea to cast a spell over children.  'Cause every kid I know adores it.  Including my own.  And his buddy.  So it was that we all wound up here as part of a mini Chinatown food crawl:

Anyway, this tiny place is adorable, just as everyone says.  The guy behind the counter, perhaps the owner, is pretty disarming too.  At least he was on our visit.  When I tried to order my Bubble Tea sweetened 10%, even though this spot offers either 0% and then 25% in that range, he offered to customize it for me.  He even gave me tastes as he went along.  He also explained that since flavored syrup is used to well, add flavor, reducing it to decrease sweetness would well, also diminish flavor.  In my case, less grapefruit syrup would mean less citrusy pop in my Grapefruit Green Tea with Boba.  Who knew?  

Ultimately, my Tea wound up being low on grapefruit taste, but the actual green tea flavor was really nice so I didn't mind.  I think reducing sweetness works better on a more bold flavor like Passion Fruit, 'cause that's what my kid ordered, with less syrup, and its sweet 'n tangy fruitiness was unmistakable.  As far as the boba component goes, and mind you I'm no connoisseur, but they seemed a bit overly gummy and soft.

The kid we were with, along with his Mama, ordered a Raindrop Cake.  I finagled a taste and I think maybe it was Lychee?  At any rate, based on that tiny sample, it came across as super wobbly tropical Jello. Me likey.

In retrospect, I really wish I'd ordered something more fun, 'cause they have A LOT of interesting options here. But I think I just went into 'deer in headlights mode' when I saw the extensive Tea menu.  I guess this means I'll just have to come back.:)"
8,teado-tea-shop-new-york-6,2018-08-20,5.0,"My favorite tea place in Chinatown. The menu is extensive so it might be overwhelming for some people. But everything here is good so don't worry about ordering the wrong thing. I love this place because you can customize everything, from strength of tea, level of sweetness to temperature of drinks. My two favorite drinks here are mango green tea (50% sugar) and Jasmin green tea with milk (50% sugar). The owner makes the tea himself and he gives you a sample to try first. If you don't like the sweetness or strength of tea, he'll fix it for you.  The drinks are one size only and toppings are 50 cents extra."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-04-03,5.0,"Cha Cha, I do love you so matcha! From beautiful aesthetics to craft quality drinks, Cha Cha's got it all. Came her one chilly NYC morning to get our caffeine fix for the day. I love matcha so I was excited when a friend I was traveling with recommended this place, just steps from our hotel. 

In an effort to try their matcha in its purest form, I took a match + hot water, and it was delicious! Simple, flavorful, and clean. It made for the perfect start to my morning and kept me warm while we walked the breezy NYC streets. My friend took the turmeric ginger iced match and woah it packed a punch! I personally loved it, and I'm sure my immune system thanked me for the jolt. 

As other reviews mention, the aesthetics of the cafe are beautiful, something right out of an influencer's blog post. It's cute without being cliche. I'm looking forward to returning to NYC during a warmer season to try their soft serve."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-03-17,4.0,"It's definitely worth a visit. I really enjoyed the drinks and soft serve. The matcha lemonade was refreshing with combination of the zesty lemon taste, the matcha flavor and the sweetness. I would order it anytime I need something cooling. The matcha soft serve was good, it has a stronger matcha taste than other soft serves I have had. 

I like the interior of the cafe with its bright pink color, it matches well with the green of the matcha products served."

It is so pretty in summer time when they open all the windows and let the breeze comes in. The whole pink theme is just perfect for instagram.

My recent visit felt a bit off. The lining of the seating area is coming off. The staff working there just looked aimless. It is sad to see an old friend go through rough days like nyc winter. Hope they will pick themselves when the weather warms up."

The shop is very pink and has the perfect Instagram vibe. It is a little small even though they have some seating in the vestibule. Unlike a lot of other cafes they do have a washroom that is for all genders.

I ordered a matcha latte which comes with a base of hot water. The additional of any of the milks is an additional charge. They have a lot of different kinds with all of your basics including some rarer ones like oat milk and macadamia. The barista suggested oat if I wanted something a little more full like whole milk or if I wanted a sweeter finish, the macadamia. I went with the latter. 

I thought the latte felt like much needed nourishment for the soul. I do wish it was a tad bit hotter. I was fine with the milk choice as well. It didn't overwhelm the flavor of the matcha which I find soy and almond can do very easily."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-06-05,1.0,The tea here sucks and the owners are racists. They have no respect for the culture they profit of. That's the only good tea here. Go get your matcha elsewhere.

9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-01-10,4.0,"A staple in the city. Cha Cha Matcha is your cafe for amazing instagram aesthetic and for drinks that hit the spot. Matcha has become a hot trend recently and Cha Cha Matcha does it right with the branding.

For me, matcha reminds me of a creamy, buttery green tea. The flavor has so much depth while being refreshingly light at the same time. I would say that my orders vary at Cha Cha Matcha. If it's a hot summer day, there's nothing better than the soft serve - a smooth and refreshing taste. In the cold NYC winter, matcha latte is just something I need to be cozy while catching up with a friend. 

While going to Cha Cha Matcha feels like a tropical vacation, I need to be reminded that I am still in NYC. For your city escape, this is the spot."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-02-09,3.0,"Want to just say that I love the aesthetic of this shop. Pink is my favorite color so it was no wonder that the light pink exterior and the bright neon sign drew me in. I really wanted to like it, because the shop was adorable and I love the idea of it, but I thought it was just so-so for the price. 

We came on a Saturday afternoon, and there was a medium-sized line, though the wait to order and receive drinks wasn't too long. There weren't many seats inside, so we ended up sitting on the benches outside. You have to stay bundled for that: it's a covered, walled space, though isn't heated or insulated from the cold.

We both ordered the standard matcha latte, which you could customize in terms of what milk you want inside. My friend got oat milk and I got coconut milk. To be honest, the drinks are pretty expensive. The drink I really wanted to try, the blue drink which had lavender honey, was a whopping $8, which I couldn't justify. The standard matcha latte is half of that, though it's a bit more if you customize the milk.

The drink was all right; not the best deal for how steep the prices were. It wasn't terrible, but it didn't impress me too much either. Maybe I'm just more peculiar about the taste of my matcha. (It erred too much on the bitter side for my taste.) Overall, it fit the bill for a cute place for a warm drink and a brief interlude during a Soho shopping trip. I can see why people are drawn to it, as the aesthetic is perfect for pretty photos. Not to my taste, though: one of those things I'd only try once."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-12-21,4.0,"LOVE matcha!! Their soft serve was so yummy! I wish I ordered more drinks/items there! The place is pretty small and has very limited seating! The Soft serve was $5 but their drinks ranged from about $4-6.

I love how everything was compostable!! So EcoFriendly :) The shop is super cute too!

I would definitely come back the next time I am in NYC!!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-11-12,5.0,"I'm a big matcha fan. Lattes, soft serve, pastries- you name it, I'm there. I tried the soft serve which was very strong in flavor and thick for a soft serve. Easy 5 stars from me. It's expensive for what you get but 2-3 people can easily share a cup. They change up their swirl flavors with different fruit options, too. Would come back to try the Tumeric Ginger Matcha latte. 

Also might be weird to say but I was in love with their bathroom lol! Super dark and red inside compared to think pink and green tropical design outside. Big fan!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-02-16,4.0,"Delicious matcha soft serve! I didn't really know what to expect but it's so light and sweet while still holding the flavor of matcha. I really liked it. They give you a lot too. The inside is well decorated and the staff is nice and pretty efficient. My friend got the matcha donut but I didn't think it was anything to rave over. Overall, great ice cream, great place, ok donut."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-04-21,3.0,"I came here back in January, and all I can remember is that the cashier was extremely rude to me. He wouldn't even give me time to order. He just rolled his eyes and sighed really loudly when I took a second long to answer his question about how I preferred my drink. As for my drink itself, it was basic, nothing too special. I'll probably try the ice cream if I ever return here."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-09-22,4.0,"Overpriced matcha in a kitschy store where everything is decorated in pinks, greens, and banana leafs. 

But are you still going to come here?  Yes...."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-02-12,4.0,I had the blue drink which was delicious and hit the spot. Staff was friendly and the order was very quick. I noticed that they used a food scale and I was happy to see that they perfect things here. Disappointed that I paid over $10 for a drink.
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-02-17,5.0,"If you love matcha you need to visit cha cha matcha! It's a matcha lovers dream. They have matcha soft serve, matcha donuts, matcha drinks, & so much more. The store is so cute; it's set up for great pictures. A good vibe restaurant. The donut was a cake donut, a little dry but the matcha icing on top was amazing. We also ordered the soft serve. That was by far the highlight of my day. Go to cha cha matcha!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-01-18,4.0,"When coming to NYC, I wanted to hit up a matcha cafe and this was perfect. They have so many creative options made with premium matcha. The drinks have strong matcha flavor, so don't expect a basic sugary drink.

The place is kind of cramped and very busy, so it's tough to find a spot. Nevertheless, there's fun decor all around and the small shop is like a tropical escape from New York weather. Matcha is also a great caffeine alternative, so I would recommend coming here instead of a coffee shop!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-12-26,4.0,Pretty good place. Only tried their Chai Matcha and Matcha with ginger and turmeric. But the latter is an interesting spin with the ginger and turmeric- you can taste both and it's not overpowering but a good addition. The chai matcha was a little bitter but it tasted a little spicy and like the holidays or something cozy and warm to me because of the Chai. I enjoyed my drink and the matcha they use is the real deal - and you can see them make it in front of you. It's steep in price ($6 each and about $4 for just a latte and $8 for something more special) but it was good trying and I'd come back for the ice cream.
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-01-17,4.0,"If you are a matcha lover, come here for a visit! I was in a hurry but craved ice cream, and so I came to Cha Cha and got their ice cream with vanilla and matcha swirl. The ice cream was huge and definitely satisfied my craving. I thought the interior was adorable and I wanted to buy a t-shirt or something. I guess I'll do that next time and also try their matcha drinks. But ice cream is also great!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-07-24,4.0,"You will find here all kinds of matcha drinks and a couple of photogenic spots they have prepared for you in this café. Pink and green are my favorite colors so this is my scene. Many customers come here to take a short break with their friends after a meal. The place gets filled quickly but it flows fast. 

I tried the matcha soft serve and it is creamy and on the sweeter side compared to the ones you would get in Japan. Not too shabby, it's perfect for all seasons in my opinion. 

I also had the nitro latte $5.75 I thought it was on the pricier side. It has coconut milk in it, hence the boost. The drink was enjoyable but it would cover some matcha taste. If you are expecting a very matcha drink, go for something else."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-05-10,4.0,"This place was rocking on a Sunday morning when we stopped by. Everyone loves their matcha! The menu is pretty straightforward with a few options for matcha. My wife loves it and says this matcha is some of the best. I have tried it and I feel like I am drinking grass which is weird. The store has a cool hipster vibe to it. You can tell they have taken some time to think about the design of the  store front and branding. People were taking instagram photos inside thats when you know you did your decor right.

I did try the strawberry cronut and it was good. I don't think they bake on premises and maybe outsource the product from a local bakery. Who cares... it was good. The service is also quick. They get you in and out very quickly so good place if you are in a rush. 

Again, matcha isn't my thing but I can respect the hustle. These people put good branding together with a solid product. I respect it. 4 stars."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-01-10,2.0,"This place is so trendy and cute, but I must say, my drink was not too tasty. I spent about $8 on it as well. It could have been my fault, as I tried their rainbow drink and it was something I have never had before. I would still go back, but just would definitely order something different!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-06-06,4.0,"I've tried to come quite a few times but the lines were always soo long!! Finally I came at like 10 o clock in the morning and there were no lines and ample seating. This place is definitely designed for millennials, but the match content here is super solid. 

The matcha latte iced was delicious and they recommended a coconut milk for me. I always appreciate dairy free alternatives that don't cost extra! The iced latte was good! The matcha doissant was also good! It's a very clear reference to the cronut, but it's still tasty!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-03-19,5.0,"This place is awesome and super trendy...as you can tell once you walk in. the matcha is super rich and delicious. i got blue algae ice cream and strawberry. it was so so good. the blue algae is like vanilla beans. i highly recommend. they have cbd as well.. like i said super trendy. the staffs are kind and helpful. the downside is that it is pretty expensive and is usually packed. upside is that you get what you pay for! their drinks are so good, the insides are nice and cute to take photos in with your friends and it is super close to soho."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-07-06,5.0,"I want to substitute a matcha latte for my morning coffee every day now!!!!!! But this isn't near my house or my office!!! WHY?!? It's such a nice pick me up without the harshness of coffee/espresso that makes you run to the bathroom in 30-60 minutes. Yep, it happens. The matcha is high quality and they have all the non-dairy milks your heart could desire (coconut, macadamia, almond, soy, oat). The two guys that day were also so nice and so into making the drinks. Warms my heart just seeing them be so sweet as opposed to Starbucks throwing down drinks like it's a cafeteria buffet line. 

Here's what I've ordered:
- Turmeric Ginger Matcha Latte - Perfectly balanced with a little ginger kick to warm your soul on a cold, rainy day
- Matcha Latte - Simple, delicate, delicious
- Matcha croissant - Alright this is definitely laden with butter, but it's the size of your head and the layers are so perfectly puffed up. How do they remain so crispy??? Matcha magic.

A little pricey, but it's literally the same price as Starbucks or artificial flavored bubble tea. I will be back!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-05-23,3.0,"Alright so the minus 1 Star is due to asking for DF drink and definitely receiving one with dairy. I was so sick for the rest of the evening.

The vibe is really cute, a little pretentious but based on a friend reco I decided to give this place a try. I got the purple lavender matcha drink (sorry can't remember the exact name) and was SUPER excited they offered dairy free options. The drink comes out layered in purple and green. They didn't tell me I should mix the drink together so I literally drank all the sugar and then all the bitter matcha layer by layer. I'll consider that a user error on my side. After finishing half of it I started feeling super sick and realized they must of put some sort of dairy into it. Two thumbs down for claiming to accommodate allergies and clearly making someone sick. 

I'd go again for a pic but wouldn't go again for a drink. No one wants to get sick."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-10-18,2.0,The hype is unreal - this place is insta famous for its interior decor and presentation but that is all. Unfortunately their matcha flavored lattes are extremely bland and flavorless and really do not resemble matcha in any shape or form. I tried the matcha latte with coconut milk and could not taste anything beyond an overpriced watered down concoction. I don't think adding sugar or sweetener even helps to enhance the flavor of the drink. We also tried the matcha soft serve and had a similar experience. There are so many better places for matcha themed desserts in NYC so this is definitely a skip for us.
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-11-23,4.0,"A cafe that serves everything matcha! I wish we had this at home! The place was very colorful, decorated in all things pink and green - reminded me of the rich colors you'd see in a 1950's tropical vacation [Lol, well I can vividly see it in my head so..]. They also have non-dairy and gluten free options! I got a matcha latte with almond milk and a strawberry cronut"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-11-01,4.0,"Their matcha drinks are always nice, plus it's such a pretty store to sit down and enjoy your drink!!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-01-31,4.0,"As an avid Matcha lover, Cha Cha Matcha was verrry high on my must-visit list during my NYC trip. And it did not disappoint.

Firstly, Cha Cha knows how to do IG-worthy, from the pink theme reflected in interior/exterior and cups/napkins to the adorable signs (I love you so Matcha)/decor to the cute messages spelled out with Matcha dust...

Loved both the regular matcha latte and the Beautiful Latte, though the latter was pretty steep at almost $10 yikes. Matcha flavor is very evident and lattes are smooooth and creamy. 

I love that there are so many dairy-free options, not only for the milks, but also for the baked goods. Vegan banana bread is very good. Somehow simultaneously dense and light with a nice subtle banana flavor and delicious sugary crusted top/exterior."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-09-22,5.0,Super awesome atmosphere with nice music and decor! Had a delicious matcha lemonade and can't wait to return to try different things on the menu
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-01-08,5.0,"Cute hipster place to fulfill your matcha needs. My bf swears by their matcha lemonade. He says it's the best drink around the area but I like to keep it simple with a latte. The seatings are limited but if you get one, make sure to take a picture of the place. acute backdrops and it's pink everywhere! Idk about anyone else but I liked the atomosphere."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-10-31,4.0,"I was having a late lunch early dinner with a couple of friends nearby and wanted a matcha latte after. I usually come here for the matcha soft serve and that's really good. 

This time I wanted something warm. I saw the matcha chai on the menu and I do like both individually so why not have them combined and try it out? My drink was good, the combination of spicy chai and the bitter matcha was a nice mix, you can taste both. One didn't over power the other.

If you ever want a matcha latte or even the soft serve, this is a good spot!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-09-14,4.0,"summary - 
cha cha matcha has a very aesthetic look from outside and in. from their packaging and Instagram worthy set up, it's a shop that is a tourist favorite. from someone who is from california, it is amazing to find a spot that imports their matcha from uji, japan.

when you walk in you can see the pink walls that contrast with a bunch of greenery! although this is a small spot, it seems like it would get very crowded very quickly.

they have a variety of soft serve, drinks, and snacks that would be a great choice for someone who is new to trying ""matcha"" flavored items.

i came here to try the matcha soft serve but they were actually out. it was about 1 pm when i went and it was a rainy thursday so i was sad that i did not get a chance to try it. there are not many places who do matcha soft serve well but im sure to try it next time they have it! 

prices - 
the only downside to this place is how expensive it is. with the drinks ranging from $5-$8, that being said they have a great range of milks. many that i have not heard of, including macadamia! 

matcha latte with macadamia -
personally, i liked this one more because it seemed a bit sweeter than the almond milk one. the matcha goes down very smooth and again, super cute pictures with it! 
not as sweet as people think it is
not grainy 

matcha latte with almond milk - 
for someone who has less of a sweet tooth and really wants to enhance the matcha flavor, this is it! personally, i have a sweeter taste bud so i preceded macadamia as it was more unique to me. this is real matcha, this is where you have to go!! not the sweet, over the top matcha lattes from other chain places."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-10-07,3.0,The matcha here was kind of disappointing given that it's located in Manhattan. I ordered the dragon fruit and matcha soft-served ice cream and it tasted very bland. There are much better options for matcha flavored ice cream elsewhere in the city if you're looking for a better tasting experience. The interior decor at this place is Instagram worthy and it's probably where they got their popularity from.
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-02-05,4.0,Nice small menu I really like there drinks and how the place looks very nice and colorful.
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-03-31,5.0,"The place is pink and blasts Tupac. What more can you ask for? Aside from the awesome atmosphere, the matcha they make is so good. I was worried this place was overhyped, but the matcha taste is strong and pure. Their rep is well deserved! 

Even when mixed in coffee like the matcha nitro we ordered, the taste of matcha was apparent. I love that it isn't very sweet. Too much sugar obscures the matcha taste so I was happy to have the slight bitterness. If you're not a fan of matcha bitterness then I'd def recommend adding sugar. 

The soft serve was delicious too. They give you quite a lot for the price. It's a bit loud and crowded in the store so I wouldn't recommend studying or going on a first date there. 

Must try though if you're a matcha enthusiast!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-03-30,3.0,"One simply cannot come here and not order matcha. Cha Cha Matcha usually has a crowd regardless of time and day. This entire place is very very pink, with a few tables and a nice couch spot along with great IG backdrop. The tables are a bit close to one another, and might require some stomach squeezing when trying to sit in the inside. 

This was my 2nd time here, and I ordered a Matcha Latte. My drink was only okay as I could barely taste the matcha and the milk was too empowering. I didn't order anything else as I purely came here to read and research on my next trip (work environment friendly). 

The last time I was here, I had a taste of the Matcha Soft Serve Ice Cream, and it was a homerun! I would've ordered it again, but it was definitely too aggressive to eat ice cream as my first meal and at 9am in the morning.

I will be back for the ice cream and strongly recommend it."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-11-20,4.0,"This little cafe is so aesthetically pleasing that's why they're getting a 4/5 review!! It's so cute, very instagram worthy, cute to take pictures!

The drinks are good, usual matcha lattes and love how they have a guide for the level/intensity of the matcha you want. Wish I tried the ice creams!!

Some things I didn't like about the place...
- the person who took my order was not too friendly and was kind of rude 
- they don't take cash 
- the restroom was super dark and the lights made me so dizzy (although it was a cute concept) 

Would come back for the ice creams tho!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-01-19,3.0,"The matcha drink was pretty average tasting, but the matcha-barista was super skillful and whipped up a drink that looked so beautiful so quickly! I thought it could have been a bit stronger in matcha but I felt like I tasted a lot more milk than matcha."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-07-21,5.0,My love for matcha started here! Their frozen treats and drinks are worth traveling to. Can't wait to come back to nyc for this!!
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-02-26,5.0,"This place is deliciousness in a cup! I ordered the Blue Drink and what's really cool about this spot is there are options on options- milk choices... from Oat Milk to Whole Milk, Coconut to Skim or even Almond and your choice to add or leave out matcha... definitely recommend stopping by!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2018-12-20,5.0,"Absolutely had to try this place on my recent NYC trip! I heard their drinks were superb, and Cha Cha lived up to the type. I enjoyed the hip interior with its bright pink walls and palm tree decorations - you almost feel like you're on an island retreat!

Ginger turmeric matcha was lovely! I was freezing that day (NY winters yikes), and it really helped with my sore throat. The drink was creamy and delicious (I used whole milk). 

On my other visit, I got what is called the purple drink (a mix of steamed milk, CBD, and lavender). Although the combination sounds a bit odd, it is amazing. Again, this drink is perfect for a cold winter day (partly because it is sweetened with honey). Besides, CBD supposedly helps you relax.

They have a seating area, which never seemed packed, and a restroom for customers.

Bottom line: great place with unique yet yummy beverages!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-07-13,5.0,"If you love anything matcha, you must visit this spot. I've finally had the pleasure, and I was pleasantly pleased, especially being someone who isn't the biggest matcha fan. This is a cool little joint that has infused matcha into just about anything and it's actually pretty good, at least what I tried and way! I even saw soft serve ice cream !
It was a fun experience, and the people working there were really fun and seemed to really enjoy what they were doing as well. Cha Cha convinced me to give matcha  a chance!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-01-26,4.0,"So I came to this place last week and I liked it I love the pick and green theme and the colors on the wall they have a huge menu based on matcha I've been here a few times already and I had a matcha with oat milk which was good.The  only reason I can't give it a five star is because they have pastries and there's no option to get your pastry warm last time I got that banana bread which was good and I wish they had more options on sweeteners for example date sugar,coconut sugar or even stevia I feel like if your have all these types of organic milks bring out the  organic sugars as well"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-06-17,5.0,"Cha Cha Matcha is easily one of the most aesthetically pleasing coffee shops I've ever come across. The mélange of green and pink hued décor gives the place a throwback yet hip vibe that compliments their colorful drink selection. They truly take matcha to another level as they source everything from Uji, Japan  and turn their ingredients into some of the tastiest drinks around town. Not only do they have classic match drinks like a latte or chai but they also have seasonal specials that seem to change every few weeks. At $6+ a drink you might not want to visit daily as it can become a bit cumbersome on your budget but for a weekly or monthly treat it's worth the visit to one of their three locations (Flatiron, Little Italy or NoHo)."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-05-29,4.0,"I'd always wanted to try Cha Cha Matcha after seeing it on several Instagram posts, and I finally got to see what all of the hype was about. We ordered the matcha soft serve and matcha drink (with water), which cost roughly over $10. The soft serve was very thick and creamy and the portion size was surprisingly huge. It didn't taste like store-bought matcha tea ice cream either, which I appreciated. The matcha drink was actually pretty strong. I was half expecting a watered-down drink but the matcha was fragrant and had a sweet aftertaste. I would definitely recommend this place to avid matcha lovers and those looking to try matcha for the first time."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2018-12-19,2.0,"I really wanted to try their soft serve, but the machine was not working when I went. 

I got the matcha latte instead. It did not say anywhere that it was not sweetened. So when I drank the bitter latte, I was very disappointed. I added a lot of ""blue algae"" sweetner, but the sweetner killed the taste of the matcha. Very cute place, but I will not try anything else other than ice cream. Very overpriced as well."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-07-20,4.0,"I love cha cha matcha!! I got their matcha ice cream and it was the perfect balance between slightly bitter and sweet. However, the portion size was really big and me and my friends couldn't finish our own. I would definitely recommend sharing the ice cream with another person. 
The place is super cute and i love the pink vibe. Even the bathroom is pink. This is a great place for pictures!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-09-15,5.0,"Still my favorite matcha latte. The OG. Lines are longer these days, but Cha Cha beats out all the others in the hood for consistent deliciousness. I think it's because they are so systematic about making drinks the same way every time. 

Predictably good matcha."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-06-11,4.0,"I loooooove Cha Cha Matcha. Their drinks are great, and the interior is super cute. The lines get ridiculously long but if you come at less popular times there is rarely a wait and you can sit down at a little table. 

I always get a matcha latte with almond milk, sometimes hot, sometimes iced depending on the weather. It costs around $6, so it's more of a weekly treat for me. 

The other thing is when I went on Saturday afternoon, the staff wasn't particularly friendly and didn't apologize for the long wait when someone from Postmates took about 10 minutes with their order ahead of us. Other than that though, I've had good experiences."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-07-17,5.0,I wanted to try one of their more creative drinks so I tried their purple drink. It wasn't for me but the quality of their matcha is really good. They also have soft matcha ice cream which is literally my favorite thing.
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2018-12-19,4.0,"Food: the matcha latte with coconut milk was pretty good. They sprinkle their drink with matcha powder and stencil! So adorable. 
I want to get the boiling hot milk machine, make that latte art. It was about $5.75 for the drink. V pricey but NY prices. 

When we were there on Tuesday around 3pm, they gave us free soft serve cuz they were cleaning out the machine! Ay! 

Cute interior, very hipster. A lot of fashionable people go here and the workers are very nice and look artsy (DJ, etc)"

I think it's a must try item. The atmosphere here is like Cuban chill house. I love the playlist they have on and I love the little balcony seating area they have upfront. 

Pretty good for a casual date or a quiet work space as they offered free WiFi."
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2020-01-18,5.0,This location and the many other ones I've been to around here are awesome!!! Always so nice and timely about orders. Didnt get her name but the nice woman taking my  order gave me some really great suggestions! I forgot the name of the drink I got but I've attached a photo of it. A little pricey but not surprising considering its location.
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2018-09-09,4.0,"People love matcha and I'm not gonna lie, I'm not really a matcha fan. 

Out of curiosity I give it a try after walking by because a lot of people are inside the store. Interior looks cute and instagram worthy. Nice spot to chill with friends. I got the coconut matcha latte. It was good and refreshing! I added a lot of sugar because I want to taste a little sweetness in my drink. 

Workers are very fast and on point in making the drinks!"
9,cha-cha-matcha-new-york-8,2019-06-03,5.0,"This is a hot spot right now, especially approaching summer heat. At first you're greeted by a long line but don't worry! It moves fast! Most people had the matcha drinks which looked to die for! But I wanted the smooth  matcha ice cream. Then I saw lavendar. Hint: YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH EITHER FLAVOR. The place is small but has a very instagram-able back drop in the back! Try to snag a table by the front with the huge open window for a cool breeze!"
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2020-03-02,5.0,The oatmeal latte here is I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E. Best I've ever had! The espresso is also top notch if you're looking for a quick midday pick me up. I've never tried it but the hot chocolate smells amazing:-).
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-10,4.0,"Love the fact that they have lids for you to drink so you can go a big ecofrisndly without using the straw, but the do provide straws if you would like.

This location been open for quite a while when I use to work in soho, but it's my first time trying their drink and it's great! 

I got the draft latte since my friend recommended to me, it is more creamy than a regular latte. I do like it but will add a extra shot if I could next time.



Good cute coffee shop with seating areas"
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-12,4.0,"This was a must after a sleepless night on the plane. Must needed pick me up before our adventure in NY. It was a very far walk from our original location but we figure we could use the walk after our big meal. Server was very friendly but really dried personally. Took the time to let us sample drinks, gave detail descriptions of the drinks and recommended us popular items on the menu. Cute little spot with minimal decor which makes it elegant and trendy. The decor wasn't crowded which makes the place look more spacious. I got the tornado, my friends got latte and hot coco. They arrived quickly but needed extra sugar as it's a personal preference. Pricier than other coffee shop."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-13,5.0,"I stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon for a caffeine pick-me-up, and this place was hoppin! The line was out the door when I arrived but it moved quickly. I ordered a regular iced coffee, which was really rich and bold tasting. A little pricey, but it's worth it."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-12,4.0,"Good coffee here. Awkward service set up. I've been confused each time I've gone here, ordering is a bit uncomfortable and unpolished here. I'd like to be able to hear my barrista or cashier at least. 

The oat draft latte is my favorite here. It keeps me going back!"
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-25,5.0,Amazing coffee in a quaint cafe. There is limited seating available. They have small pastries too. I didn't get the donuts but they looked delicious. I got the oat milk latte and it was incredible- probably one of the best lattes I have ever had. If you're looking for a solid cup of coffee I would highly recommend them.
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-24,4.0,"Came here for the coffee and left smiling-

Latte is GOOD- I am from LA but this coffee is quite good-

Latte was smoth and just lovely-

Service was Ok. It is NYC after all-

Not many place to sit but people drink and leave quickly-

So wait about three minutes and you can sit-

Yup New York- New York-

Will come here again for sure :D"
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-28,4.0,I was in search for a local coffee place and this place was highly recommended and I figured why not. I asked the barista what she recommends and she said the latte draft but honestly I WOULDNT recommend it at all. It tastes weird in my opinion and I like coffee a lot so I have tried quiet different varieties of coffee. She made me the regular latte. It tastes so much better but they don't have any syrups or whatsoever so if you like sweet latte it wouldn't be this place. It's a super small place so I recommend taking coffee Togo. There is very limited seating
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-12,5.0,"EXCELLENT hot chocolate. The best in town (and I've tried them EVERYWHERE!): 

(1) They use raw cacao 
(2) They let you sweeten in yourself 
(3) They make it HOT 
(4) It's really chocolatey
(5) It's a really good price

As a Brit who usually finds hot chocolate in the US too sweet, semi cold, often like a cup of warm milk with a hint of chocolate, and overpriced, its awesome to find a hot chocolate that meets the standards! Tried other branches in the chain (such as Wall Street) and the standard was consistently good. This is my go to place now. 

PLUS the staff are friendly and personable. They care."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-08,4.0,"La Colombe's oatmeal draft latte is the bomb and is pretty much unparalleled (on tap is way better than their own canned lattes). This location has friendly service but a small and somewhat cramped seating area-- unless you snag the corner table right by the window, which is an awesome spot for people watching.  No bathroom either, so taking your drink to go is probably your best bet.  Speaking of to-go, I appreciate La Colombe's solution to the plastic straw problem: sippy cups that don't require a straw at all. Pastries are generally good, especially the almond croissant.  Why not 5 stars? The drip coffee is quite bitter, so stick to what's on tap."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-11-26,4.0,"Very smooth espresso! Not acidic, which I liked. I got an americano and added some oat milk for the first time after seeing someone use it. It was really good! Creamy and strangely nutty."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-21,5.0,"Great coffee poured here. Always best with an espresso shot dropped in for good measure. 

Sometimes there's a line of 10+ people out the door, but even that is easily braved and well-worth the wait....which won't actually be that long. And, you need coffee anyway and trying to find another spot pre-caffeine isn't likely to be super successful, so yeah, go here."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-28,4.0,"This coffee shop is convenient for taking a break from a stroll in SoHo. A lot of people think the same and the location is almost always pretty populated. Seating is limited, but because they are close together, it's easy to ask other customers if you can share tables."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-25,3.0,"Service: Efficient, but lack any sense of human interaction or concern. I ordered a cortado for here and the girl repeated it, but the translation to the barista obviously was a hard miss. The guy made two togo cortados and scoffed when I said mine was to stay. No apology or anything, the barista was actually pretty rude when replying  ""next time make sure to say for here when you order"" I obviously replied that I did, but he completely disregarded my response. 

Coffee: pretty tasty cortado. Not great micro foam or design, and made slightly too warm, but overall not half bad."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-21,2.0,"I would give this place more stars if my barista wasn't so rude. It was my first time to La Colombe SoHo and I simply asked her what the draft latte was. She rolled her eyes at my question and gave me snooty response. My oat milk draft latte tasted fantastic, even though it was totally overpriced. Oat milk also costs $1 extra. Not worth it to wait in a long line for expensive drinks and bad service."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-06-26,5.0,"Sleek, modern, and damn good coffee.

I was intrigued by the exterior of the cafe, which is what enticed me to walk in. The staff are all kind and welcoming. The coffee itself is above average and definitely matches the price range. Whoever designed this SoHo branch put a lot of effort into it. I enjoyed my time here.

Just be on a look out for your drink. Some lady took my cappuccino, but the barista was kind enough to make me another one. 

A must visit if you're in SoHo."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-02-26,4.0,"Saw the huge live coming from here so I thought, oh, maybe good coffee is coming to NYC. 

Me and the gf got a cold brew and a cappuccino.   The cold brew was fine.   The cappuccino was ok.  The coffee mostly tasted more of the roast than of the bean.   Certainly not a craft coffee place where beans are paramount but the place was fine.   Not worth a long line but worth getting if it is convenient."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2020-02-18,5.0,Best coffee in town and love that they have sparkling water fountains in most of the locations.
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-12-02,2.0,"Unimpressed.  I had higher expectations based off of reviews.  

Service: I'm just visiting here... walked in and didn't see a menu in the typical up against the wall fashion, I asked if the had a menu or any specialty drinks, the girl looked at me and with zero expression said you're looking at it and turned around.  I didn't even know what she meant...took me a minute and then I noticed the small postcard sized menu in front of the pastry case I was looking at. Neither employee smiled or said hello... even after I said good morning.  

Taste: I ordered a mocha latte.  At this point I'm expecting to be blown away by flavor... and no, it's just meh. It's not terrible, but that's not saying a whole lot. 

Ambiance: cute wooden tables and a fun neon sign but nothing else to note. 

Will not be returning."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-04-20,2.0,"I needed some caffeine for a day of shopping in SoHo recently and I dropped by this place because it was close to some of the shops we wanted to check out. 

I actually had pretty high hopes for this place because of the high ratings that I had seen on Yelp. 

When we entered there was no line and we went to the front to order and were immediately rushed and I felt like they didn't care to answer any questions that I had about the menu. In all honesty, I don't even remember what I ordered because I felt like the whole interaction was so quick and forced that I didn't have time to think about it. I feel like if there was a line out the door or a huge rush I would totally understand this kind of customer service as it seems like a goal to get customers in and out with their coffee as fast as possible (which definitely has it's appeal), but I just felt like they could have taken the time to more thoughtfully answer my questions given that there weren't too many other people in the store. 

As for the coffee itself, I felt like it was pretty standard and it didn't stand out to me as anything amazing. Mostly the two stars is for the rushed customer service that we experienced. If you want quick coffee and you know what you want to order then it might not be a problem, but that's not my cup of tea, so definitely not one of my favorite coffee shops I've ever been to."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-09-22,4.0,The coffee is consistently good. But please call our name when our order is ready because we don't want to accidentally take someone's oat milk latte ‍‍
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-16,4.0,"Came here for morning coffee, they seem to really know their coffee! I really like their decor and everything looks very clean, there are long wooden benches and tables to sit down and enjoy your cuppa. I came specifically to try an Ethiopian-yirg drip, and the coffee beans were roasted well, not too dark but long enough to really get a potent brew - as a very occasional coffee drinker, it was mindblowing tasting this coffee! The aftertaste had strong notes of lemon and a fainter sense of being chocolatey, something that I have never experienced with coffee before.

I am disappointed, however, that I cannot in good faith give this place 5 stars. The staff have a very short tolerance to customers and hesitating for even a second causes them to give impatient looks and body language. As a first time customer, I wanted to ask how to return the cup and plate that the coffee came in, but had to spend minutes just waiting for a staff to finally look at me - they only seem to care about people, barely, until you pay, and then you are pretty much tossed aside for the next person to chip in."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-01-18,2.0,"One of two La Colombe locations I've been to regularly (the other is 400 Lafayette St). This location is less busy, so I prefer to go here.

My problem with both of them is that they don't seem to know how to pour a draft latte?? Lately they keep giving me all-foam pours, which, when settled, comes out to half of the cup. Not worth $4.25. When I asked for less foam, they said it's just how it comes out of the tap. If it works like draft beer, just hold the cup at an angle??? What is being done differently with the tap or by the barista when they give a good pour? Surely it's not random? If you look at pics on the company website, a draft latte is supposed to be at most half foam and half liquid. No one would accept an all-foam beer, would they? It's sad because I really love their draft lattes (even the unsweetened canned ones taste too sweet), which no one else has, but I can't really justify $4.25 for half a cup."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-18,5.0,"Super friendly service every time and great drinks. Love that they don't use straws for any of their drinks. I get the oat draft latte every time I am in the area and it never disappoints. About a typical price point for a specialty drink at a Soho coffee shop. Line tends to be out the door, but it moves quickly."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2020-01-01,5.0,My favorite coffee so far. You should go & try the single origin when you  do. I had a curtado... amazing!!
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2017-09-16,3.0,"Came here with several friends on a Friday afternoon because we were tired and wanted a jolt of caffeine while we were in the area. I've been wanting to try out their drinks here for a while now. Instead of settling for their famous cold brew, I went with several of my fellow-Yelper's recommendations and ordered a medium almond latte. 

There was a line, (there always is going to be) but it moved relatively quickly. When I received my drink, I was disappointed in the fact that my drink consisted of 75% ice and 25% latte itself. The almond latte itself wasn't bad, but it sure wasn't effective in keeping me awake.

Overall, I don't really recommend the Almond latte if you're seeking an energy boost. I've been here before in the past, but only to grab a croissant. Maybe next time I'll try the cold brew to see what the hype is all about."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-12-06,3.0,"Average coffee, staff is ok. Think Starbucks without all the extra goodies to buy. Quick service."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-17,2.0,"I really didn't want to give a bad review because the coffee is AMAZING HERE! I would personally say the best in New York, but the workers there are terribly rude. I went today to order a latte and the lady at the front gave me a rude stare as if I don't belong there when I asked if they served caramel with the coffee. Honestly, it threw me off and I don't know if I'll ever come back even if the taste of that latte is hard to resist. I don't like dealing with rude workers and hopefully in the future, you guys hire friendlier people to work for La Columbe. 
(Edit: The worker who was rude was an Asian lady so please look into her and realize that treating customers like they're doing us a favor isn't the best way to draw more attention to this place. And this is my first bad review on Yelp.)"
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-06-12,4.0,"I love this location. I always get the ""Pure Black and Tan"" when I come here. It's like the perfect thing for me when I need a wake me up. Smooth and delicious. It's usually busy in the morning and there's a few seating but it's NYC. 

Great coffee, friendly staff. I can't complain. 

Note: There's no parking."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-15,4.0,"I've found myself in this La Colombe many times since it's located right next to my work.

Their coffee seems a little overpriced for what it is but their pastries are great. Definitely recommend any scones or the chocolate almond croissant if they have it."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-10-28,4.0,"Pretty good coffee. Haven't tried anything  else but the staff is pretty nice but were bit weird and awkward. I was the only person on the line so I didn't  have to endure whatever  setup they have but I had to give my order to like 3 people just to get my coffee. The initial  person who I guess doesn't  do anything, the person  who makes the coffee then the cashier."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-05-28,4.0,"My friend and I were walking around SoHo, and we decided to stop at La Colombe for some coffee.  As soon as we walked in, it seemed like everyone was jonesing for caffeine: the place was packed! Despite the length of the line, we were able to order relatively quickly. 

I went for my usual Americano, which I thought was tasty and not overly acidic. Seating was quite limited, so it felt like we had to pounce on some seats once they became available. It's also a narrow space, so during a busy time with many people standing and seats in short supply, it can feel claustrophobic. However, the coffee was great, and I would come back in the future."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2017-06-27,2.0,"Meh. Needed an afternoon wake-me-up and found this place was close-by to wherever we were headed. When we walked up, it seemed like they had a decent stream of people in line that moved very fast. Maybe I'm not enough of a coffee aficionado to appreciate whatever this is but ordered two regular iced lattes. It's okay that they don't have flavors (vanilla, caramel etc) ... but my friend wanted a sweetened one and they just handed him packets of sugar LOL. It's pretty hard to dissolve solid sugar in iced drinks, usually just end up with chunks of crystal sinking to the bottom but welp.

Very low interaction rate with customers and kinda comes off stand-offish, imo. Might be a normal thing for the city, but who knows, I'm a tourist LOL. Probably better of sticking with starbucks trollolol. In the city that never sleeps and is always constantly on the move, this is their ish but I'm used to coffee shop cafes where you can relax and lose track of time ... although, it is pretty interesting they pull their lattes off draft and also sell canned caffeine drinks."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-06-11,5.0,Love the coffee here. I believe this is my first time visiting a La Colombe cafe which is popular in the Northeast. We ordered a couple of Oatmilk Lattes which were very tasty and not acidic. These are the real deal. Would definitely come back again.
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-13,5.0,Making an update on my previous review.  I love this place but felt they had a few staff members lacking in the hospitality department.  They seem to have all new staff and the experience has completely changed.  Its been friendly and welcoming during my last few visits and the coffee is still my favorite.  It's back on my regular rotation.  Thanks guys!
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-21,4.0,"I've tried two different locations of La Colombe and enjoyed both experiences. The first time, I tried the Black and Tan draft and it was great, but nothing special. The second time, I had the Pure Black and that was good as well.

Overall, good coffee at a fair price."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-11-23,2.0,"Overpriced, shitty coffee. I don't doubt that they roast quality beans, but they need to train their baristas better. My workshop (light roast) americano was bitter as hell, even after adding milk and sugar, which is something I almost never have to do. I threw it out halfway down because it tasted so horrible. Also I noticed the barista was pulling the shots way too long. The store is cramped, and there are no bathrooms. For $8 for an espresso and an americano I expected way better."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-07-19,5.0,My favorite coffee place in NYC.  Just wish it was a tad bit cheaper!! Delicious none the less and strong af
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-25,4.0,"I long for their cold brew with lemon every morning. If I were rating their products, I would give them 6 stars if I could. The dealbreaker for 5 stars was the service-- As someone who is in the service industry, you'd expect the service to match the product, especially for a such an exceptional coffee company."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-08-29,5.0,"So good to have a bit of relax in Newyork, nice cold brew and amazing flat latte for me!"
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-09-08,5.0,"Despite the crowd, there was a good amount of people just chilling and doing work on laptops. 

I got an skim milk latte and the espresso was really strong! It has the kind of latte where you take a sip and you know it's a serious. Don't know if I'd ever go out of my way to come here since it's so far but 5/5 stars for a coffee shop!"
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2017-12-20,5.0,"So, so good. While I haven't tried anything other than their lattes, I can vouch that the lattes are awesome! The service is speedy so if you're in a pinch for some coffee, don't hesitate if you see a long line!

I also brought home a box of the Ethiopian coffee beans. They are fresh and delicious even at home. 

10/10 would recommend"
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2017-01-28,4.0,"After brunching at Jack's Wife Freda a block away, we came here to have a second round of caffeine and a chatter. I enjoyed La Colombe coffee at every locations I've been to, and this place was no exception.

The drip coffee was very aromatic and strong. I wish there were coffee shops like La Colombe in NJ and no more of Starbucks, please (although I'll continue to go to Starbucks for the rest of the year to use up all the gift cards I received over the Christmas holidays ;)

While sipping on our coffees, it started to snow outside, which was pretty picturesque and romantic on this cold, gray afternoon. I missed small moments like this that I had while I was living in the city a couple of years ago. 

One small downside is that they had very limited number of seats. We were lucky to secure a table, but I saw a lot of people waiting while sipping on their coffee, and heading out to the door when they had finished."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2019-05-06,5.0,"Great coffee and espresso beverages made quickly.  Not a great spot to work, but a good place to grab a quick coffee with someone on a lunch break or abbreviated appointment slot."

10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-10-09,4.0,"Great coffee, and speedy service. Even when the line looks long, the system they have works and gets people out quickly! My only complaint is that it's a dollar more for nondairy milk on any drink, which seems steep. Otherwise great grab and go coffee spot."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2017-10-12,5.0,"I have only to say that this was an experience. It may sound funny and exaggerated but my visit here was definitely a moment in my coffee-drinking life. The draft latte here is definitely one-of-a-kind. Very unique. This was my first time trying draft latte and I could see why others praise it.
The draft latte is very light and refreshing - almost gives you the sensation that you are drinking draft beer. Unlike regular latte with rich milky flavor, this one is more pleasant. You must try it to understand."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-01-28,5.0,"This was my second time trying La Colombe in NY. I tried a regular latte and a draft latte at the location near Times Square. 

First off, the regular latte was delicious. Good coffee flavor, mellowed out by the steamed milk. The star of the show, however, was the draft latte. It tasted like a very thin milk shake that was not too sweet. I kid you not. It was so delicious that I probably could have drank three of them in one sitting.

The draft latte was so good that I came here a second time on my last day in NY, skipped getting a drink at Jack's Wife Freda, just so I could sip on the delicious milkshake... er I mean coffee.

I know there are lots of coffee places to choose from in NYC, but I definitely recommend giving Colombe's draft latte at least one go!"
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-07-21,2.0,"I normally don't write reviews but this one deserves a shoutout. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. 

I've always loved La Colombe Coffee so I decided to purchase my own ground coffee to make at home. I like medium roast coffee, so I asked the cashier what roast the shop normally uses. She responded with a ""huh?!"" with an annoyed face and looked around at the other baristas who were busy doing other things. I asked again, but she completely ignored me by serving the coffee to the customer before me at the other end. When she came back, she replied with a ""what?"" so I asked for the THIRD TIME. Then finally she replies with an aloof ""we just use medium,"" as if answering me just to get it over with. 

I still love La Colombe coffee but I am never going back to this branch again."
10,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,2018-08-26,4.0,"This is not your leisure coffee shop- where you bask in the sun and indulge in conversations on velvet sofas. Go to another La Colombe location for that.

This is more of a grab-and-go kind of coffee shop. No BS and frills in the middle of busy Soho. Drinks are solid and consistent. Staff members also ain't got time for the tourist baloney. I don't either. 

As a NYC local, I give this a green light."

Will not return."

My boyfriend and I are both annoyingly serious about our coffee, and this cafe's creations taste just like the ones we make ourselves.

High quality beans, smooth texture of the milk, and wonderfully topped off with latte art.

We both ordered their regular lattes and were super impressed, we just wanted to keep drinking more!

Relatively affordable and in a fab location. Very modern interior, limited seating so it's more of a grab&go kinda cafe."

I fell in love with the draft latte, that's the only thing I've had to drink from there, and my go to. It tastes like a foamy iced coffee but with the texture of beer without the alcohol at the same time...It's amazing, and a MUST TRY if you've never had it. 
$4.25 for the draft latte, not that expensive if you ask me!"

I don't know if they are tired of being cramped in a small space (which I get, but still) or they get so much foot traffic that they're sick of dealing with people, or what, but if looks could kill...!"

Their onigiris are great, too. They're pretty cheap and are a tasty bite for when you're on the go and need a quick bite."

Recently I've been ordering via seamless to my office in chinatown while working late nights and almost every time the order has been late. Late as in the delivery time being pushed back 15 - 20 mins. The yakisoba definitely downgraded over the years. I remember when I first tried it, it was great.

I will stick to the rice ball and drinks!"

11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2020-02-12,5.0,Such a cute place! The staff were so friendly and the prices are competitive. One unique thing about this place is the seating. There are 3 picnic tables for plenty of space to sit. They also have unique products from Asia.
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-09-26,5.0,"Came here for a drink because Kung Fu Tea down the road wasn't open. To my surprise, this store was really cute. I got the lychee tree drink, which is a white tea. There are photos of the drinks on the wall so that you can see what they look like before you order. I also ordered shumai. It was fried and came with 5 pieces. Probably not the best shumai you can find in the Chinatown area. I asked the cashier what flavors she recommended since I hadn't been there before. I also got a small order of their spam, Yaya chicken, and Yaya onigiri riceballs. The Yaya flavored was my favorite. It contains seaweed and mayo. I like that the packaging is so thoughtful. The seaweed is seperated from the rice until you're ready to eat it so that the seaweed mains crunchy and fresh. Will definitely be going back to try more flavors!"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-03-09,5.0,"It has been a long time since I last visited this place. Since then, they have renovated the place and it looks more spacious. Aside from the food and bubble teas, they also sell Japanese snacks and merchandise. 

I'm so glad to find that they sell vegan onigiri. They have 3 vegan flavors, spare ribs, gongbao, and ginger chicken. Tried all of them with Pogibear and loved every single one of them. My favorite is gongbao and for him, it was spare ribs. Both affordable and delicious. Last time I went they packed our onigiris in this cute eco friendly reusable bags. So yay for that."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-09-03,5.0,"There's a wide variety of fruit teas to choose from on the menu at Yaya Tea. I wanted to try them all! I don't remember the name of the tea I ordered, I just remember it being very fruity and refreshing! The cups they use for the small drinks are so cute! I love cute packaging!"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-08-14,4.0,"Tucked away in the outskirts of Chinatown, Yaya is a special treat for some solid refreshments! Once you enter, the unique decor creates a welcoming ambience that is hard to miss. I had 'the Boyfriend' and the tea was quite good but the tapioca lacked flavor and didn't have the best texture. My friend ordered 'the Yaya' and it was definitely on the more tart/sour side - it wasn't for us but I'd say is still worth trying. 'Blue blood' was our favorite drink at the table and I'd definitely come again to have another sip. Especially for only $3 (small), these drinks are worth the trek!"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-07-29,4.0,"I ordered many small rice balls and a peach oolong tea with mango star jelly. I've had rice balls before at other places where the plastic is hard to come off and here the process was much easier. That was a relief. I ordered the Yaya chicken, crab, salmon and Japanese rolls. All were delicious. The spicy mayo is worth it! One star less because there was no place to charge my phone or use the bathroom. I would've stayed longer and purchased another drink at least. But I'll return."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-11-23,4.0,"Best place for riceball. Highly recommended for their drinks and riceball. My favorite is their blue blood. They always have a very cute quote at the bottom of every drink. It's like it made your day. This was my always every typical day after school during middle school to get a drink and a riceball and time to had for handball lol. It was absolutely delicious! My all time favorite for riceball are the original chicken, yaya riceball, and crab fish. I'm not a big fan of their takoyaki cause it's to soft that when you pick it up it's like dissolving already."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2018-10-25,3.0,"Yaya is known for their onigiri- rice balls. My favorite is the shrimp and the japanese- it has seaweed, eggs, and imitation crab meat. $4.50 for large and if you check in you get a small container of spicy mayo. It taste  really good and fresh. The spicy mayo is not spicy at all and it taste amazing on the rice balls.

Customer service is ok. Not so friendly but fast service. 

The drinks on the other hand is absolutely terrible. It is overly sweet and taste very artificial. First love was too sweet and tasted bad."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2018-12-03,5.0,"I've been here twice - once it was super crowded and hard to enjoy the experience on site. Second time, it was dead empty. Just us and our stroller and kids. Finally got to experience what Yaya is all about. 

Hubby decided to swing by here on a cold day as our toddler was hungry. Stroller and kid friendly during off-peak hours (when you're able to find a seat).

Salmon rice ball - delicious. Great seasoning and crisp seaweed. Love the packaging. So smart! I believe we also got the seaweed salad rice ball which was packed with ingredients and flavorful! 

Peach tea drink - so yummy. Jelly was perfect with this. 

Taro bubble tea - just the right sweetness and the tapioca was done right. They also have quotes taped underneath your beverage for your reading pleasure. 

Big fan of this place and can't wait to come back to try the other rice balls."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-05-05,1.0,"Good customer service but not good milk tea. Milk teas actually has powered tea base that is pre sweetened. That means no real brewed tea is in their milk tea, also means you can't customize sugar level.

To get around it, the gal making the tea was good to suggest a tea latte ( that's has real brewed tea and milk). However it's a bit watered down and doesn't have true tea or milk flavor. Kinda tastes like second brew tea ( using leaves for second time) with a tad of milk. 

Would not go again. Prefer milk teas that use a real brew tea as a base and powders only for cream or different flavoring."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-04-28,3.0,"I got the Boyfriend Tea (Mango/Lychee White tea) with 50% sugar and less ice and it was pretty watered down. I could definitely taste the white tea, but aside from that, the fruit flavor tasted artificial because I guess they use syrups for the Lychee and Mango flavor. Makes sense because it was cheap ($3.00 before tax), relative to other places with infused flavor teas. 

Went on a Sunday afternoon and there was no line and quick efficient service."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-09-12,4.0,"I Had the fried chicken udon noodle dish that I found two salty... But it was flavorful...Pretty neat place to come to a lot of other items off the shelf... Mostly tea drinks... Overall a pleasant visit, no table service... You clean your own mess..."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-10-20,3.0,"I came here in the evening and ordered a jasmine milk tea with lychee jelly. The tea was ok, kind of watery. The lychee jelly was also just ok, a little too soft and lacking really good lychee flavor. If I come back, I want to try the onigiri, which look delicious! This place just wouldn't be my first choice for boba."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-09-16,5.0,"The perfect place to get both your rice ball and asian snack fix!  Great options for all that are meat free and gluten free. Top it off with cold bobbaly (get it boba tea). I nom nommed the salmon rice ball so fast and saved a plum one for later. 
This is the an awesome eat on the go meal.  Much healthier than most fast food meals. You def won't have oily fingers eating these rice balls!"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-07-24,1.0,"I've been coming to this place for years (before it got fancy) and last night I decided to stop in for bubble tea after dinner. I brought a reusable 24oz cup with me to cut down on using single use plastic. I've done this at many bubble tea places before and never had an issue. The cashier refused to use my cup and informed me that they only fill their YaYa reusable cups. If I'm trying to cut down on waste, why would I buy a cup when I already own one?!

I decided to cancel the order and go to one of the many bubble tea places near by. I enjoy the bubble tea at Yaya but it looks like I'll have to go elsewhere if I'm trying to do my little part for the environment."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-11-11,5.0,"This is my favorite spot to drop by for a quick bite and a drink. Onigiris are such a good snack to get on the go and Yaya definitely beats convenience store onigiris. They also have a lot of fruity teas that were very refreshing.

For onigiris, I tried the Japanese and the Yaya chicken. The Japanese is my favorite. This filling gives the most variety with seaweed, crab meat, and egg. The Yaya chicken was also good, but the combination of chicken with seaweed felt a little off to me. The rice tasted weirdly good to me and the ratios were spot on. For teas, I tried the sunrise and the boyfriend. Honestly, these weren't too memorable (all fruit teas taste about the same to me), but I remember they tasted pretty good. They tend to be too sweet, so I opted for 50% sweetness.

I love this place for a quick bite and drink. This is one of my go-to's."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2018-07-01,4.0,"Their taro heart jellies are amazing and unique. I've never seen them anywhere else. They sort of taste like coconut but with a hint of taro. 
The Tealux was pretty good, I'd try other things on their menu before I got it again. 
The interior was slightly cluttered but had adequate seating. They have a huge variety of Japanese snacks on the walls. 
I'm a huge fan of their crab meat rice ball. This time we had the chicken rice ball which was $2.50 for a small size and pretty filling. It was good and did the job, but not fantastic."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2020-01-20,5.0,"If I come back to NY 1,000 more times, I will be back to eat here 1,000 more times.   Bubble tea and rice balls made the perfect lunch!"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2017-12-30,4.0,"The place where pop singer Lady Yaya always goes to hang out when she's in Manhattan. She has a ""Bad Romance"" with one of the employees, and she doesn't blame any of the teas for being substandard because baby they were ""Brewed This Way."" 

Named after the Manchester City Legend, his bubble tea shop is nothing to amazingly special although it's very original and very popular.

I do like the elaborate drink known as the  blue blood, which is the best bet on a menu that is all about fruit, without really good milk tea options. The Blue Blood is not too sweet, and nice and cheap, especially for Manhattan. However, it has awful hard tapioca pearls, so for that alone I can't give 5 stars.

The coolest thing about this place is definitely the names of all the drinks. It's just so much fun."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-04-15,4.0,"This was the only Yaya's in Chinatown for a really long time (all through my high school years) and it was on the way to my friend's house from the Grand St. Station, so it's always gonna be special to me.

But now I'm older and every time I come here there are always a ton of kids *shakes fist* Those kids! This place tends to be extremely crowded when school is out, and pretty empty when school is in session. I know this place also struggles with keeping people who are just waiting for their bus out. A lot of chinatown buses start and stop here, and a lot of people just want to get out of the cold. So that can also make this place pretty crowded. 

That being said the food is delicious and so are the drinks. They've also remodeled since my high school days and they have nicer tables now and furniture wise it's less crowded, so it's easier for the people who work there to keep it clean. Thank you!"

Got a couple dranks here cause my bus stop was right outside. Biggest regret ever cause after i had to pee like three times on the bus. I got the first love and the sunrise which was kind of bland to me. Im not sure if it was because of the white tea or something but i felt like it was kind of watered down. But who knows?!?!?!? I heard the rice ballz here are pretty good so stay tuned for a rice ball review coming up really soon."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-07-28,3.0,"Ordered the Tuna Riceball and Udon Tempura - Tuna Riceball was a little difficult to swallow - a lot of mayo(?) in the filling, and the Udon Tempura's broth is miso soup with tough, chewy noodles. The tempura was really greasy, and the mayo on the side didn't really help.

I came here for a little snack, the price was about $12, so I get what I paid for, but I definitely have had better meals for the same price (sometimes even less).

The workers were friendly, even when the store got busy and that's a plus."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2018-10-11,4.0,"Yaya's never disappoints me! This little shop also has the assortment of Asian snacks, a wide variety of drinks, and super cute decor.

11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-06-09,5.0,"Introduced to this location back in 2014 and to this day I'm still crazy about it. 

I love trying new things especially food and so couldn't be happier to be introduced to this place of amazing Japanese culture and try their foods that they introduced to us Americans I was over joyed and had the distinctive please of going throughout this past weekend and will be making it more often from now on"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-11-04,4.0,Really tasty food here. Would've given it a 5 if they had a bathroom and better aesthetics.
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2017-07-05,5.0,"Cute boba shop. Think fruit teas rather than milk teas, as well as a few hot Japanese snacks. They also have a decent variety of candy and packaged goods at the front of the store. Very twee decoration-- middle school me would have flipped.

But what I came here for was the onigiri.

The smalls (palm of a medium-sized hand) are $2.75, and the larges (large fist) are $4.50. So many flavors! Chicken, salmon, shrimp, spam, and many more. I went for the Japanese: egg, crab, seaweed.

It came out within a couple minutes. It's wrapped in the fancy plastic triangle so you could save it for later without the nori getting soggy. They're made to order, and the rice was hot and fluffy. There was a sizable amount of filling for all three: half a hard-boiled egg, a generous strip of crab, and a mass of seaweed salad. It also had a touch of mayo. Delicious stuff.

Happy to have found this place and will try out their sister shop further north."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-03-12,5.0,"Been going here for 8 years now, since I was a freshmen in high school. 

The rice balls are always a great snack when touring around Chinatown. They've managed to keep the prices affordable all these years, which I really appreciate. 

Spam, shrimp tempura, and crab meat are my go tos. Their tea is also pretty tasty and have cute names with little ""fortunes"" tapped on the back. 

A riceball and a tea will run you about $7, so even the most frugal can afford to get full here. 

It does fill up quickly with middle schoolers and high schoolers, but it's still worth popping in and grabbing a riceball."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-07-03,5.0,"This seems like a favorite place for after-school hangouts - the most popular attendants seem to be middle-school or high-school students. My favorite drink is the ""Boyfriend"" drink, but there are a lot of other great drinks there too. They tape inspirational paper quotes on the bottom of the drinks, which I think is a really cute idea. The variety of onigiri there is also great - I like the shrimp tempura and the Japanese one. They also have other types of food there too, but I haven't really seen many people get the other types of food. I think this may be one of several locations, including Gramercy and even in North Carolina! Definitely check it out."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-11-09,5.0,The place is so cute and it even has its own merchandise when you get closer to the register. The people there are really friendly and the idea of having a snack shelf full of asian goodies is brilliant! The names are adorable of the drinks and the fact that the actually have good food is so underrated. I remember when the use to have a note printed and posted on the side with cute ments but now it's on the bottom of the drink. Very cute place and is always a spot for me when I come by in the neighborhood!

I am really glad to have found this little gem.  The shop is small, but nicely decorated and there is a beautiful table to sit and sip/eat. 

 I had the First Love with lychee topping and a Japanese Rice Ball.  Total came to under $10 and when I tried to pay via credit card I was informed of the $10 credit card minimum.  So bring cash if you only get a snack.

My tea was the perfect refreshing beverage on a long walk and the rice ball was so delicious I almost got back in line for a couple more.  Make sure to check out the message on the bottom of your cup when you are done; a fun surprise.

Great place for a quick stop, great place to sit and enjoy your food/drinks.  I will be stopping here again."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2017-04-18,3.0,"This is a pretty nice place to get tea. I really recommend the genmaicha especially, it is fantastic. The jasmine oolong was also okay, but the genmaicha was definitely the star of the menu. They do have small snacks you can get as well.

The shop itself is a cozy tea and coffee place, not unlike many others in Chinatown, but fairly spacious with a large communal table in the middle. The atmosphere is pretty nostalgic for those of us who spent our teenage years drinking bubble tea and hanging out at these kind of places.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but I'd definitely stop by again if I was in the area and craving a warm cup of tea."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-07-21,3.0,It's okay.  The AC is kind of weak. No bathroom. Cash only under $10.  Grassjelly is the more jello-y kind rather than the pudding-like one.
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-02-23,1.0,"Thank goodness the food is so good because the service is awful. The only time the staff, especially the cashiers are interested in the customer is when it's time to sign and add a tip. The staff never knows anything about the merchandise along the wall. I spent $40 and asked for a small spicy mayo that i forgot to order with my food and almost had to break a $50 because i had nothing smaller and didn't want to use my card for $0.25. I'm highly appreciative that another customer gave me a quarter. I went to the counter by the door to get my things situated and seen a sign on the counter requesting that customers bust their own tables and return the property they used to the cahsier...lol if the customer is to bust their own table then what's the purpose for leaving a tip. This place is such a joke. Again, thank goodness they have good food"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-02-21,4.0,"I love Yaya Tea Garden overall! You can go to any location and appreciate its nuanced drinks, tasty riceballs, and aesthetic walls. It is one of the few places in New York City where you can savor good quality eats with just a few bucks. 

When I'm around Chinatown and feel like grabbing some quick, healthy refreshments before heading into the Grand Street subway station, I'd stop by at Yaya and experiment with a new combo of flavors and toppings. They complement each other seamlessly, so you wouldn't go wrong with any combination!

However, if my stomach could wait a bit longer, I might ride the D train down to Bay Parkway to visit the Brooklyn branch for its more intimate and peaceful feel. During the day, this Chinatown branch is usually crowded (thus, it may take longer to wait for your order), and upbeat music throbs over the ceiling speakers at high volumes. It also taxes while the Brooklyn branch doesn't. Depending on what mood you are in, it may be a portrayal of the urban hustle-bustle you may want to depart from."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2018-11-14,5.0,"Was looking for somewhere new in Chinatown to munch on before my plane, and this place was perfect to get takeout! Their onigiri reminded me of japan and everything was wrapped perfectly for me to bring on the plane. Their boba in their glass bottles was also a cute touch and was quite delicious! The interior is small but homey and they have a vast selection of Japanese snacks. Not on a very busy street, so wouldn't have been able to find it if it wasn't for yelp! Forgot to take photos because I ate so quickly, but the tempura and the chicken onigiri is definitely the way to go."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2017-01-13,3.0,"Stopped by specifically for the onigiri. I've been looking for a place (other than Cafe Zaiya) in NYC that makes these, so I was really excited to find a place on Yelp where they make them FRESH. Here at Yaya they do in fact make the onigiris to order, so that when you get them, they are still warm.

I ordered the Japanese and the Fried Chicken Onigiri, based off of reviews on Yelp. I had the Chicken Onigiri when it was still hot and fresh. The Chicken was better than the Japanese, but I felt like the chicken was a bit oily and tasted like it had just been refried. Also, I wouldn't call the portions of chicken 'generous' by any mean, the onigiri was still largely rice (a bit excessive in my opinion). The Japanese Onigiri was very mediocre. It had a slice of boiled egg, some imitation crab, and seaweed salad. By the time I had mine, it was already cold, so perhaps this is affecting my judgement?

There is an hour time limit on tables, which I'm assuming is because they are usually really crowded. However, on a snowy Sunday morning, they were very quiet and most people came in only to pick up orders. I had a large table alllll to myself without anyone bothering me. :)"

I also saw quotes under my bubble tea! I've also saw someone eating rice cakes which looked delicious. I will be returning to try one. Very nice and clean as well. If you're ever around the neighborhood give it a try."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-07-01,5.0,"Second time visiting a YaYa tea, though the first time in this location. As I remembered from last time, the food and drinks here are just great. For NYC, the price was amazing. About $2.50-$3 for a small onigiri stuffed with toppings and $3-$4 for a tea (much less than the average $5-$6 at KFT or Gongcha). Would definitely recommend the Yaya chicken onigiri- great balance between chicken and seaweed salad and it had a nice kick. All the drinks are great as well and have clever names. My favorite part is definitely the adorbale stickers they put on their onigiri, they're so cute! My only complaint is the limited seating area. There are only about 15-20 seats and they were mostly filled when we had got there."
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-06-23,4.0,The chicken rice ball was good and warm.  The tea cocktails were even better.  Yaya is a hidden gem in Chinatown where the food values is the most important.

DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS

This place used to be a place I regularly came for tasty savory rice balls with character. Unfortunately, the owner's son who refused to give me his name, proceeded to curse my girlfriend and I over a social experiment that we are conducting on finding the best service resturants in NYC by asking for 10% discount. Unlike most locations in the city where a counter-offer was given, the gentlemen proceeded to say ""fuck you"" in front of his staff with the assumption that we could not afford. An older lady, unknow to be the owner or not, attempted to dismiss us. 

Beware of places like this.

Do not support this behavior.

I first heard about it because of its popular rice balls (onigiri) but they sell more than that. They have little hot snacks, bubble tea, and random Asian snacks (ramen, chips, etc.). They also sell tea leaves in cute little jars, if you're interested! I've never tried anything but the onigiri here. They offer a variety of flavors (different stuffing in the middle) - I usually get the seaweed or the Japanese style. You can get it in two sizes (small or large). Even if you're not super hungry, just get the large and save it for later. 

It's a small and cozy place with cute decor. There are a few tables around, so if you need a place to sit and have a quick snack, this is the place to go!"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2018-07-27,5.0,"My review is mostly based on my experience having them cater for my wedding. Our main point person throughout the whole process was Mindy, and she was amazingly helpful in making our bubble tea station vision come true. Our tea choices were First Love and Blue Blood fruit teas (besides for being very tasty, I also chose that combo because the colors went well together, because aesthetics are important haha). They provided beautiful drinks dispensers, jellies, straws, cups, stickers, and even made ""His"" and ""Hers"" signs for the tea displays. Everything was seamless and ready for pickup on the designated day, and needless to say, our bubble tea station was a huge hit! 

We also ordered a ton of onigiris for my bridal party and helpers for lunch on my wedding day. My personal favorite is the yaya chicken onigiri. The onigiris are really well made and the perfect size for a snack or a light lunch."

The names of the drinks are a little outrageous and some outright vulgar. Although, I admit that it's hilarious saying things like ""please give me a 'Boyfriend'"" and ""I would like a 'Better Life.'"" Heck, they'll even make you ask for a ""Period Pad."" Kids these days and their businesses. The front is like loaded with Asian snacks, but you don't come here for those snacks. It's the boba we want.

The boba we got with our drinks was like yogurt popping boba and that meshes perfectly with the fruit tea. My drink tasted great. I kept sipping away until my cup was drier than Los Angeles and then I got homesick. New Yorker friend paid for all 4 of our drinks because he's surprisingly yet unsurprisingly a sweetheart. Maybe he's seeking attention again, but he's also basically family, and plus, free boba so no complaints from me."

11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-02-25,5.0,I come every time I'm in New York. A super casual place to grab a drink and some rice balls. Rice balls come with so many different fillings. I always get the  salmon one!
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2017-06-07,4.0,"5 stars for their tea and onigiri. 3 stars for their appetizers/food. 
So I ordered the blue blood tea with mango jelly. The jelly was star shaped, which I thought was very cute. The tea overall was very good, not too sweet but very fruity! 
I got the spring roll onigiri. The wrapping was very cool, and it was so fresh! Really loved the balance! 
I also got the fried gyoza, soba noodles, and takoyaki. Overall, I was not impressed. I was not a fan of the noodles at all because they were too salty. The fried gyoza was okay, meh. The takoyaki is shaped like a half dome, which I prefer but they put too much sauce and not enough mayo. The balance was not good!"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2018-10-20,5.0,"Came here once. Still dream of coming back. I just love the atmosphere here. Stopped in here for I think they're called fish balls? I always forget their name. And bubble tea.
Always dream of coming back"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2016-02-18,4.0,"Sometimes I get confused by this place. Is it a tea shop or a Japanese inspired snack shop? Gotta admit, though, that Yaya Tea Garden is pretty eclectic. It's a combination of a whole bunch of things. There's a lot of variety of tea leaves for sale and then a whole bunch of Japanese snacks & foods on shelves right by the cashier. It's also a cafe furnished with wooden tables and benches that resemble a picnic outing within the confines of pleasing pastel green walls.

My favorite item from here is the Shrimp Tempura Onigiri(a Japanese rice ball). Wait is around 5-10 minutes, and I always get them warm and steamy(freshly made)! You can also choose to get it in a medium/large serving. The shrimp was not rubbery, but rather crispy and easy to chew. The fried outer batter does not quickly strip away from the shrimp upon consumption, unlike the shrimp tempura of other establishments I've tried. 

Biggest pet peeve would be removing the packaging of the Onigiri. Although there's instructions that teach you how to unwrap it, it's still confusing. I can't get my mind around the fact that I'm literally taking apart the seaweed and wrapping it around the rice again. 

The names that are apportioned to the drinks here are unique. I've sampled a few of the drinks(Boyfriend, First Love...)from a couple of my friends who have accompanied me here, in the past. Although it's a bit too sweet for me, they taste pretty idiosyncratic. Tea-lovers will marvel at the unusual and distinct tastes, but still appreciate the quality and flavor of the teas.

Yaya's can get pretty congested real fast, so plan accordingly. If you get caught in the traffic, no worries. The line moves pretty fast and efficiently!"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2017-05-04,4.0,"This was a cozy little shop right on the edge of Chinatown/Little Italy.  We stopped in for some bubble tea and decided to try the rice balls as a little snack and were so glad we did.  I had the First Love with Lychee ""topping"" for my tea and a small Japanese Rice Ball - both were absolutely delicious (I was almost regretting not getting a large rice ball, or more than one flavor).  
If I find myself in the area again, I'll definitely be swinging in for more!
Don't forget to read the fun message on the bottom of your tea cup!"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2018-04-01,5.0,"This is my ultimate favorite tea spot! They have very cute names for their drinks such as the 'Boyfriend' and 'Lychee Tree' which are my personal favorites! It is the healthiest choice for tea in Chinatown since they actually brew authentic tea leaves! You can also choose what kind of fillings like tapioca, lychee jelly (my fave!), pudding etc. They are also known for their delicious rice balls! My personal favorite are yaya's chicken, the Japanese rice ball and the spicy crawfish rice balls but the spicy crawfish is seasonal. The rice balls are decent size for their price of between $3 to $4. I would highly recommend this place to a friend who loves rice balls and tea!"
11,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-3,2019-09-26,5.0,ive been coming here since the original shop first opened on Hester St. unique teas and yummy snacks. great freshly made onigiri and quite good japanese comfort foods like yakisoba and takoyaki. a fine place to stop for a light meal.
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2020-03-05,5.0,"Stumbled upon coffee project on the way to some breakfast last weekend and decided to get a coffee to go. But then I read Deconstructed Latte and Nitro flight on their menu..  I dropped plans to go anywhere and decided to dine in! Was an amazing experience being pampered by your coffee in NYC 
The nitro flight had the original nitro brew and a half n half (with milk) served with honey and waffle wafer, my partner who doesn't drink anything but cold brew was on cloud 9! I got the deconstructed latte that was served with a shot of espresso, another shot of milk and a beautiful glass with the two mixed together (such an amazing concept) along with seltzer water to cleanse your palate! I cannot explain the sequence of having them as good as the barista so you have to really go there to experience it! 
Ps: We also got the banana walnut muffin which was so good! Have it warmed up!"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2020-03-04,4.0,"The deconstructed latte 
A very interesting concept. This consists of a shot of espresso in the first glass, some steamed milk in the second glass, full latte with beautiful latte art in the third glass. Additionally, it comes with some sparkling water to drink in between each cup that you try. The barista explaining the concept of it was a very nice touch. Again a bit pricy at $8, but very nice presentation and just a cool thing to try. 

Ethiopian blend pour over
Wasn't anything unique, and is definitely a bit more expensive than the average pour over at $8. On top of it, they serve this $8 pour over coffee in a $2 ikea glass. Would be nice if this coffee shop found some local artists to purchase glassware from. Especially at this price point. 

The service
Overall nice service, but we had come here from a bagel shop that ran out of seating space and had hoped to eat our bagels with our coffee from this place. Sadly the staff told us they do not allow any outside food.
They have an interesting no laptops no tablets rule. Might not be for everybody, but I respect the attempt to create a more interactive space in their coffee shop."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2020-02-07,5.0,"Really enjoyed the three-piece deconstructed latte! It was delicate and smooth! 

This hidden gem has limited seating but definitely a must try spot!"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2020-01-26,5.0,"I came to Coffee Project to try the deconstructed latte. It was a wonderful and unique experience for me. I've never seen this on any other menu before the Coffee Project! 

As a first timer, it was so helpful that the barista brought it over to my table and explained the process of how to drink it. She explained what each thing was and the purpose of it all. The milk is also locally sourced, she mentioned. It was delicious and fun. 10/10 recommend for the experience. 

The coffee shop is small with few tables. I wouldn't recommend this place as a ""stay for a couple hours to work on laptop"" -- in fact, I think they have a polite sign that says to be mindful / not hang around for too long with a computer. Makes sense, for a small shop that has a lot of foot traffic!"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-10-16,4.0,"This is a tiny coffee shop with limited seatings. They offer wifi on weekdays only and there's a table close to the bar that is reserved for people who do not use laptops. This is thoughtful because many people like to work at a coffee shop and they tend to occupied the tables with long hours. 

I've tried their deconstructed coffee last time and it was very unique. The coffee comes in cups: espresso, steamed milk, latte, water, and a wafer. The caffeine was very strong for this one (I couldn't sleep that night lol) but overall it was very interesting and the coffee smelled nice. 

As for the latte, the aroma was nice, the latte art was pretty and it wasn't like a simple latte art. I feel like the milk was what made the drink so good because it was rich in flavour. Is it just me or the drink had a after taste of milk tea? Either way I loved their latte and coffee."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-10-06,5.0,"Just when I thought there is nothing new in coffee I stumbled upon this place and it's deconstructed latte concept. I'll get back to that in a second.

The place is very small, most likely geared towards to go orders. They had a lot of people coming in on a Friday at noon. There is extremely limited seating, but somehow we managed to grab 4 seats at the bar. They were having some problems with the grinder as it required a dial in after every shot for some reason. Because of this our drinks were delayed quite a bit.

We opted to go with the deconstructed latte. You basically get half a shot of espresso, ~50 ml of steamed milk, a small latte, a wafer and a glass of water as a palate cleanser.

The espresso had a great smell with a very well rounded taste. The milk is something else. They told us that they partner with an upstate NY farm that uses low temperature pasteurization to increase sweetness. I called BS in my head, but I was wrong, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I steam a lot milk at home for espresso based drinks and I tried all the kinds I could get my hands on, but I've never had anything this sweet. I now wish I would've asked for some cold milk to see how the sweetness compares to what I know.

The latte (being a pairing of the two) was of course really tasty.

I enjoyed the experience and I encourage you to come and give this place a try."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-11-09,4.0,"We came because some friends recommended the coffee flight, though we ended up getting more classic coffees. The space is modern, clean cut, a lot of wood and white. They also are creative with their foam art.

THE WAIT: At 1pm on a Saturday, there were just a couple people here. 20 minutes later there were maybe 10 people waiting for tables.

THE COFFEE:
We enjoyed our espresso, cappuccino (a bit watery), and latte. The cappuccino and latte had good body to them. My father-in-law got the espresso (he's a bit of an expert) and said his was good but not the best."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-08-06,5.0,"I had a craving for a cup of latte after a nice meal nearby. I searched Yelp to help me find a place. What makes one place stand out from many coffeehouses around is something different and unusual. A couple of pics of a deconstructed latte popped up on my screen and I was intrigued.

The place is quaint with wooden floors, high ceilings, and cool lighting. Grabbing some stools by the bar...I was excited to understand what this deconstructed latte was all about. The guy asked if it was my first time having it and I said, yes. Dre was patient enough to explain the order in which I needed to drink this set and appreciate each one as I went along. He went on to explain what notes each one held. Even though I made him repeat a couple of times, I have to admit I wasn't listening to him 100%. Shame, shame. But this is what I heard...

- Espresso, as expected, was extremely bitter with notes of chocolate. I have to admit, I didn't taste the chocolate. I pour some of the milk into it to help me finish it. But I can taste the high quality of the coffee for what it is.

- Pasterized Milk, being lactose intolerant I have noticed that when milk is warmed up, it's okay on my stomach. Dre told me that this came from Upstate New York. Served warm, it was probably the most delicious milk I have ever tasted. A bit sweet without that strange taste that is often left on your tongue. I wanted a refill.

- Latte, probably my favorite out of this entire set. It was PERFECT! I enjoyed every sip and took tiny bites of the delicious waffle cookie along with my drink. Here is when you taste the espresso and the milk come together. 

- Mineral Water, to help you cleanse your palette. I thought this was a great idea to add to the set. 

My kiddo enjoyed his iced latte and I can tell service was excellent as I heard them greet some of their regulars by name."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-07-20,3.0,"I have heard so much about the Coffee Project via Instagram and online and I had to try it out. It's a great cozy cafe with a very welcoming vibe. It's quite small with limited seating so make sure you grab a table when you enter. 
We ordered the deconstructed coffee and a regular coffee. I loved the whole feel and the different way to serve coffee and it was a lovely experience without a doubt. However, the coffee itself didn't taste good so that's why I had to rate this place 3/5 for the lack of good tasting coffee. It was extremely mild, even a little bit of added milk made it too milky and more mild. I like my coffee on the medium-strong side so because of this preference I didn't enjoy the coffee itself. I wish the coffee tasted better and there's no doubt this place would be rated higher."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-04-25,5.0,"The deconstructed latte alone is worth the price of admission.

One of the most unique coffee drinks I've had anywhere. You get your espresso served separately from low-temperature steamed milk and a side of sparkling water. Drink in order of how you're instructed, and enjoy the magic.

You can also get normal coffee and espresso drinks, but where's the fun in that?"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-11-13,5.0,"I really like what this place is trying to do and how they are being innovative.

The main down-side to this place is that it is SMALL. It's smaller than I thought form the photos even and there's only a few tables. We had to wait quite awhile for a table and some of their items like the deconstructed latte are for dine-in only.

What we ordered:
Deconstructed latte - I really enjoyed this and the whole concept. They explain each step to you and then have you compare that with a small sample of a latte already made to compare with the deconstructed one.
Nitro cold brew flight - they rotate what they offer for this but when we were there these were soo smooth I was impressed. I am not a fan of nitro cold brew but these ones were very good. They don't add any sugar to them originally but give you some syrup so you can add to your liking.

I love the concept of this place I think it's really cool. They have quality coffee here. I just wish the space was larger so more people could really experience it."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-12-14,5.0,"Found Coffee Project NY on yelp and saw that they had an item on their menu called the ""Deconstructed Latte.""
The Deconstructed Latte consists of 1 shot of espresso, 1 ""shot"" of whole milk (no milk substitutes for this menu item), the latte itself, a waffle cookie, and a glass of sparkling water to use as a palate cleanser. The Deconstructed Latte is only available for order for those who are sitting at a table; it is not available otherwise. A barista will bring it to your table and give you directions on the recommended approach to drinking the deconstructed latte and a little background information regarding the espresso itself.

This is the first time I have ever come across such a menu item at a coffee shop. 10/10 would recommend. Service was fantastic, latte was great, and the overall atmosphere was very inviting!"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-11-02,5.0,"Happy to score a table late Saturday afternoon for cafe society. This place has been on my radar for ages and not for the deconstructed latte. I was happy to see all of the black coffee options. I rarely get to enjoy a pour over and todays didn't disappoint. A pour over is a true coffee luxury. Went with the Mexican with its medium body and light acidity. Some light fruit notes, more like fresh, bright notes with a chocolate finish. Leon said his hot chocolate wasn't hot enough. Love the ambiance, efficient and chill servers. The ambiance is quite energetic. Glad I live close enough to make it here on the rare occasion I enjoy a coffee out."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-12-23,5.0,"Just like any others talk about this place. And yes about deconstructed latte. . 
I would like give one more info 
I came in on Monday. The front for parking will be free all day or the next couple days after 10:30am. 
Before that time in Monday just be careful about ticket for sweeping street. 
$8 for the deconstructed latte. And everything is just hospitable. I can tell people love here. 
It's nice little business. Guess can name it ""the soul of the 2ND AV""."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-02-20,3.0,"I had this place bookmarked as I became a sucker for the photos of the deconstructed latte.  When you walk in it's literally three small tables with six chairs and they were all occupied.  I also tried to find seats in the back, but it was a fail.

After we ordered the deconstructed latte (for me), latte for the bf, and two croissant sandwiches- we sat at the high stand table.  Being that it was close to the cashier, we were squeezed us two as I was sandwiched between him and the patron.  Well he was squeezed also.

The deconstructed latte looked cute, but I found the process a bit obnoxious as we felt pressure from the onlooking eyes of patrons patiently waiting  for the barista to finish explaining the instructions.  Also I found process not worth the price.  

However, the croissant sandwiches were good.  Service was ok, coffee was good, but pricy, the seating was uncomfortable, and so three stars."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-10-13,4.0,This was the cutest experience. Tasted the deconstructed latte and it was definitely interesting. This place can get busy and it is quite small & cramped but def worth coming here at least once to try this latte out.
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-01-01,5.0,"I loved it here - my husband and I made a pit stop here before we went museum hopping. Space is pretty limited and small - there is seating for about 12 people I believe: 3 2-person tables and 2 3-seaters on the sides that all face the same direction (kind of like you're sitting at a bar). There was a short line by the time we got there at 10am. We both shared the Nitro cold brew flight and ordered a berry scone and a ham and provolone croissant sandwich for food. We were able to nab a table, but they filled up after the 3 people behind us ordered. 

The nitro cold brew is AMAZING. You really don't need any milk or sugar with it. It is so smooth. Most of the time, when I have cold brew, you can still taste the bitterness from the coffee, but there wasn't a bitter taste at all from this nitro cold brew. I personally liked it less with the milk - think it takes away from the flavor instead of adding to it. But I drink my coffee black so I'm used to no cream/milk or sugar. The stroopwafel at the end was nice too. It was a bit on the sweet side, but paired well with the cold brew.

Would definitely come again - that Nitro Cold Brew is still on my mind!"

Also, the cookie is such a great add, I wish all my coffees came with one :) Must try if you're in the area."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-07-20,3.0,"I'm basing this review on the Nitro Flight. The nitro coffee was good, but for $8, I expected something a little more. More coffee would have sufficed. I do enjoy the coffee, but I'm not sure I would really recommend the flight; a regular nitro coffee would be a better value. Also, through no fault of its own, the space is pretty tight. There are about 12 seats, but, given the popularity of this space, things can get tight quickly. That said, the baristas are very friendly and willing to make your visit pleasant. 

Taste: 4/5

Service: 5/5"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-07-08,4.0,"Friday afternoon like 2pm, I came here with a friend to order the deconstructed latte. There was not much of a line and we squeezed into two seats by the front entrance pretty easily.

For the deconstructed latte, you get sparkling water, espresso, milk, latte, and waffle cookie. You're supposed to drink espresso, milk, then latte while having sparkling water in between each to rinse the palate. At the end, you finish with the waffle cookie.

I tried in that order and it was an experience. The espresso had some citrusy flavor while the milk was warm and sweet. Separately tasting the espresso and milk before imagining how the latte came to be was something I never really thought about before.

My favorite part was when I sipped espresso and immediately had some milk. I could taste the espresso fading behind the milk until I could only taste sweetness with some citrusy notes.

I wanted to guess the ratio of espresso to milk in the latte but I couldn't really tell.

Overall I gained a greater appreciation for the latte making process. I liked the deconstructed latte as an experience, not as a drink. I thought the actual latte was just ok but then again I also don't order many lattes.

If you have a remote interest in coffee and you're loafing, you should try it."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2018-12-02,5.0,"This cafe is a gem! Such sweet staff who'll go past their job descriptions to make you feel welcome, cute and cozy ambiance, and smooth, yet strong coffee that doesn't need any sugar added to it. They're doing it all right here.

I got a coffee with almond milk and loved it. I needed more almond milk, and the manager literally grabbed my cup, took it to the counter, and added more for me. Say what! Also tried the soy latte, which was so foamy and delicious. I'll have to return to try their almond milk lattes, which, if you read my reviews, you know I have a thing for! 

They do have a bathroom, along with a few tables. It's so popular, so seats will forever be taken, unless you hang around and snag one up soon as it frees up.

They do have free WiFi, but the whole place is laptop-free on the weekends. I don't like the restrictions, but their house, their rules. Come here for a quick and casual date or to catch up with a friend. It's a place that's meant for socializing, so drink that refreshing coffee and chat away!"

My sister enjoyed the latte and warmed almond croissant.  It's small with only a few tables, and the signs state to working on computers on the weekend.

12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2018-12-13,5.0,"Awesome place! 

If it's your first time here, you have to go with the deconstructed latte. Separate servings of expresso, steamed milk (I have never tasted something so delicious in my life), and an actual latte. With a waffle cookie thing. 

The latte is one of the best I've had, smooth, strong, tasty. It left me wanting even more, but I rightfully excused myself from the café before things got out of hand.

Staff is excellent, enthusiastic to explain how the heck to drink this thing, if you're a nooby like me.

The place is small and intimate. Seating can get tricky at peak times. They have a rewards program if you become a regular (hard not to)- you're 11th drink is free.

Cannot wait to try the cold drinks!"

Simply the BEST coffee place that I found lately. Went there after having lunch with a friend. I liked the vibe and interior there and had some time to kill so decided to sit and enjoy my cold brew. 

As soon as I took a sip of that cold brew, I received a text from my friend who grabbed her cold brew and left - she was amazed by how good it tasted. It was really just so smooth! Honestly, I don't even like coffee and I fell in love with it. 

As I sat down, I realized that one of their tables was a laptop-free table, which is the idea that I like but I had to work on something so I sat on the bar table instead and got to look at them making drip coffee and other drinks. These baristas are crazy talented, they make each cup of coffee to the level that they are satisfied and I enjoyed watching them!"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-11-15,5.0,"Pretty good coffee but the place is extremely small and probably better for take outs. Of course they are known for the deconstructed latte and nitro which are $8 each, if you think about it, it's not expensive at all but on the other hand, it's just latte/nitro served separately in fancier/cuter cups so it's expensive but it's not something you get everyday, so I'd say it's worth it. I just wish they had a menu to explain what type of beans and milk we were trying in writing. The coffees are definitely good. I'd like to be back to try regular coffee/non-coffee to go next time I'm in the area."

The item to get is actually the deconstructed latte, but I've never had it- the only thing I've had hear is the regular brew. Still, my experience here was pretty good. I like the coffee here, and the seats are fairly comfortable. There are usually not many seats, but if you can get one, especially near to the window, you'll notice that this place has very good lighting. It's a great place to have a conversation, and even though all they serve here is coffee, I think this place serves its purpose. I don't seem to recall these guys having wifi, but it's not really a work-space type place anyways, so I wouldn't come here with that goal in mind."

I was suprised how hidden it was and how small it was after seeing online pictures and recommendations.

Had a affogato and it was top notch, the espresso was so deep in flavor.

Definitely noticed a peaceful atmosphere and a good vibe in the whole place.

Also one of the nicest toilets i've ever seen in a public place. Felt like home"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-01-10,5.0,"Great (and really strong) coffee with A+ customer service (and human decency tbh). 

Small space but actually a lot of seating. There's a hidden table in the back as well as bar seating all around. On weekends you can't use your laptop but otherwise really nice space to catch up with a friend or chill in. I got a croissant which they toasted which was great (but very flaky haha) and a latte on my first visit. The latte is strong af. I didn't sleep til 3am that night lol but I'm also very affected but coffee (although usually not this much).

Now to the people - thank you, thank you! Not only when I was there everyone was super friendly and nice. But I actually dropped my AirPod (I know, such a first world problem) and they returned it and answered my message via Yelp. Thank you!!

Would recommend."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-01-15,5.0,"The first time I walked in this place, ""Provider"" by Frank Ocean was playing in the background.  Instantly, I fell in love with the vibe. The space is small, but cozy.  Unlike some places in NYC that can be pretentious, the baristas seemed genuinely friendly making it that much more enjoyable.

I decided to set up shop for the day giving me a chance to sample several drinks.  Let me just start by qualifying that I'm a HUGE coffee head.  If my grandma and coffee were both hanging off a cliff, and I could only save one... I'd ask for a little room for cream.

I started with the Nitro Flight (which is now in my Top 3 All Time coffee drinks).  The nitro flight includes 1 small glass of nitro, 1 glass of nitro w/ cream, a side of simple syrup, and a hazelnut and caramel biscuit that pairs perfectly.  The nitro itself was SMOOTHER than me sliding thru some Dmz after a couple drinks. (In my own mind)

By this time, Khalid, Jagged Edge, and Miguel had all shuffled on the shop's playlist.  I was in R&Bean heaven...(see what I did there).  I decided to try the Deconstructed Latte next.  The presentation itself was interesting and fun. It was served in 3 parts -- espresso + milk + latte.  The drink came with sparkling water and another biscuit, and quite frankly if you're not pairing sparkling water with your espresso, then you're not really living.  Overall, the latte is solid but wouldn't order it as my everyday drink. 

This place stole my heart and is holding it captive for the foreseeable future.  They are doing everything right from the ambiance to the stars of the show which are their drinks.  Shout out to Coffee Project NY for setting the bar really high. 

PROTIP:  If you ever wondered what would happen if espresso, ginger, and sparkling water had a baby (yes I know it doesn't work like that but just go with it) give the Ginger Elixir a try, its an iced drink and it's amazing.  Refreshing AND it gives you a pick me up."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2018-12-31,4.0,"small interior but the deconstructed latte is pretty cool. Something to order on occasion, I wouldn't imagine getting this all the time. Comes with a shot of espresso, steamed milk, a latte, some sparkling water as a palate cleanser, and a little biscuit. Pretty tasty and definitely a unique experience. It gets pretty crowded so you may have to wait for a table (you can't stand up or take the deconstructed to-go). Also, they have a no-laptop policy which is nice."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-02-26,4.0,"Came for the very Instagrammable deconstructed coffees and stayed for the welcoming decor and nice ambience. The latte was fine, I personally didn't think it was anything special but I really enjoyed the berry scone we also got. Very cute place and would love to come back! Bring your friends who like coffee and nice pictures."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-08-17,3.0,"I was in the area searching for a spot to sit down to do work and grab an afternoon cup of coffee. I saw online that Coffee Project looked spacious and had a ton of good reviews so decided to give it a visit. I have to say, however, that I probably won't be coming back because of my lukewarm experience. 

I ordered a cup of cold brew with some almond milk, which was fine. The staff seemed a little cold to me, though the service was fine overall. The menu did look interesting, with some food items and also some coffee flights. I saw two people doing the flight, which looked interesting - one of the baristas explained how to taste the coffee (similar to a wine tasting). 

There aren't too many too many tables in the cafe, and the ones that were there were fairly small. The cafe had wifi, but they have a rule that it is a computer-free establishment on the weekends. Also, two of the tables in the cafe are reserved for customers who are not using laptops. Because I visited on a Sunday and really needed to do some work, I ended up leaving after grabbing my coffee to go. 

I would suggest potentially giving this cafe a chance if you want to try some interesting and trendy drinks, but it is probably not the best spot for working. I would say that I also prefer a cozy vibe when I go to a cafe, but this place is definitely more modern and sleek."
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2018-05-20,5.0,"I pass this coffee shop most days on my commute. After my first visit here today, I may just have to start waking up 5 minutes earlier to add it to my weekday routine. (And budgeting an extra $5 a day into my currently modest coffee expenses.)

Coffee Project is best known for its deconstructed latte, but on a warm and sunny day I needed something cold and to-go. Thankfully, they have quite a few iced options, including a cold brew and tonic. I went for what sounded like the most interesting, the Ginger Elixir, and also one of the more expensive options at $5.75. Ouch.

The price set a high bar for me, and I'm pleased to report the drink passed it. Who would have thought that seltzer and ginger syrup would have been the perfect foil for coffee? Not too sweet, not too spicy, just balanced and refreshing, with a healthy dose of caffeine that didn't make me bounce off the walls. Simply delightful. This goes in my coffee hall of fame, which includes La Colombe's draft latte, Miscelanea's coffee horchata, and All Day Miami's Sweetheart No. 4.

The staff was extremely nice and with-it. I felt truly welcomed even through only two brief interactions. It was also pretty quick in and out despite being in the middle of a weekend afternoon. The only knock I can think of against Coffee Project is that the space isn't ideal for weekend work as they have a no laptop policy then.

Will certainly be back!"

I stopped by yesterday morning for the deconstructed latte. You get an espresso shot, milk, and then a separate latte. Also comes with sparkling water and a delicious waffle cookie.

12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2018-04-24,4.0,"I came for the deconstructed latte but stayed for the ambiance, staff, and excellent coffee. 

Known as Project One, the deconstructed latte ($7) is exactly what you think it is - a latte that is broken down into a three-glass flight. The progression goes from espresso to milk (from a local creamery, pasteurized at a lower temperature to resemble the flavor of raw milk while still being perfectly safe to drink) to a beautiful, fully assembled latte. A glass of sparkling water and a wafer accompany these glasses on a wooden tray that is brought to your table by the barista, who explains the flight in detail. The reason for this deconstructed project is to take the time to sip the individual elements of a latte and recognize the flavor layers. 

Located in the East Village, Coffee Project New York is the project of Chi Sum Ngai and Kaleena Teoh. Ngai actually trained in Portland before moving to NYC. This coffeeshop serves up everything from espresso, drip, pour-overs, to nitrogen cold brews and even coffee alternatives like hot chocolate and even misugaru (a Korean roasted grain drink). If you don't want a deconstructed latte but like the idea of a flight, they have a nitro flight that is dine-in only. Hungry? They have scones, croissants, Kouign Amann, muffins, and brownies.

Aesthetically, it's warm and inviting with earthy tones and exposed brick. The atmosphere is calm and evokes a sense of community. The baristas are all extremely knowledgeable in the art of coffee-making, and they are so friendly. I am excited to come back and see what new projects are up their sleeves!"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2019-01-14,4.0,"Okay, everyone talks about the deconstructed coffee here, go ahead, read their reviews... but I tried this Misugaru drink, a sort of Korean grain milk blend, and it was delicious. 

Its high in protein, calcium, magnesium, selenium, and what not, so basically its healthy, no caffeine and low in calories! Great for a detox diet!!

If you're not interested in coffee and end up with a friend at Coffee Project, this is a good alternative!"

I went there initially on a Saturday to try the deconstructed latte and accidentally left my beanie in the store. I messaged the owner on Yelp about it and she immediately responded back they would keep an eye out for it. When they were closing, they found my hat, and I stopped by the next day to get my beanie. On Sunday, I tried the cold brew flight and rescued my beanie.

Besides having great drinks, the service is wonderful, and they walk you through the drinks, providing background on where the drinks were sourced and what is the recommended order to taste them. You can definitely tell they have a passion for coffee.

Highly recommend the Coffee Project for a unique experience and for the wonderful service!"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2018-03-30,5.0,"Why your coffee gotta be so popular and live in such a tiny space?!  Classic good coffee spot problem.  The pride here appears to be coffee selections of single origins so your taste buds can travel to Columbia, Nicaragua, or Mexico more fully.  If you're a barista-time-sucking-pour-over-snob, you may need to wait 8min before they can even begin your pour-over request because of that line of 10 people behind you waiting for a simple pre-made take-out cold brew.  Thankfully, because they know you're willing to wait, they push you aside until they've knocked out that line first- and in the process they save you from everyone else in the tiny cafe sending you angry hate vibes for hogging the barista's time for your damn-fresh-pour-over-cup.

Came after brunch with some friends - we were looking for hot chocolate. The shop itself is small and does feel slightly cramped. However it's clear the baristas really care about their art here!  Well worth the trip if you're looking for an experience instead of a quick fix. 

We had hot chocolates and expressos:
- The hot chocolates were lovely they use 60% shredded dark chocolate mix in hot milk... we even ordered a second round! Each of the hot chocolate had its own ""latte art"" which was very lovely. 

- The espresso beans that day were
  a mix of Guatemala and Columbia. The uniqueness of the experience part was how the espresso was served Italian style with a glass of sparkling water."

Pretty bummed out about this, but I guess I do understand the need when the space is just too small to host a bunch of laptop zombies while also trying to make it an interactive experience that is all about coffee.
I love their coffee options, although slightly overpriced. However, you will get very good coffee for what you pay and the almond croissant is the best in town (trust me, I'm an expert on this). 
Also, the people working here are extremely friendly and will explain exactly what their coffee 'projects' are about and how to enjoy them. Highly recommend!"

______

I came here for one reason and one reason only.... the Deconstructed latte.

Granted. I don't know if I was a local if I'd be getting this every day, but as a tourist I sure as heck was going to.

Starts with an espresso shot.

Then milk...that's been pasteurized at a lower temp. It's weird to say one milk is better than any other, but this was the best milk I've ever had. Didn't even taste like milk that I've had before.

Then the latte. They mentioned all the notes I'd taste but I just tasted a perfect latte hat was creamy.

Also got a little round bite that was cakey and had custard inside. It was a delight to nibble on while I went on the journey of my latte.

Overall they are using great coffee and obviously taking special care when crafting their drinks! Check them out!"
12,coffee-project-new-york-new-york-3,2018-04-15,5.0,"Absolutely love this place!
I have spent numerous afternoons soaking up the sun at the window or the bench right outside with a nitro flight. Their nitro coffee is absolutely the best in town.

It was a small shot of expresso, a shot of milk, a latte, a soda and a wafer cookie. You finish it in that order. It was ok. I also went with ginger elixir. Black coffee is suspended over, may be, soda. You mix it and have it. It was ok too. I couldn't get what was special about these coffees. May be it is because I am not a coffee person."

The place is cute and cozy. So we Went in and not sure which one to order. We asked for suggestions. We ordered Costa Rica coffee, cold brew and de-constructed latte.  My friend and I were really really disappointed with the coffee. The cold brew was watered down. I told them I love  strong black coffee and they recommended Costa Rica coffee. I was so excited and can't wait to try it. The Costa Rica coffee was really watered down too and was so disappointed. 

The only good was the deconstructed latte, it was unique and cute for Instagram. I don't really like latte but it's pretty good. It comes with a shot of espresso and I enjoyed that. I should have just order the espresso. 

For me, You can come here for the deconstructed llatte, if you like strong black coffee I think you can skip that."

Well, Saigon Shack will certainly scratch that itch; for hunger that is. Came here before seeing a show at the cellar, place was packed and getting a table looked bleak. However, Ang and I only waited for about 15 minutes before being seated, it's a tight squeeze but they do a great job of presenting a warm atmosphere I.e. exposed brick, wooden bar hosting cafe du monde coffee and warm lighting.

Service was fast but awkward, granted it's Saturday night in a bustling joint. Had the fried fish platter, so good breading was crispy, not too thick and fish was tasty. Tremendously filling portions, the sauce the accompanied the fish was very tasty, almost like a spicy mayo. Fried spring rolls were good as well although, wish I went with something a little cleaner, too many fried dishes!

Would love to come back and try there Banh Mi, Ang's shrimp one looked and tasted amazing!"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2020-03-07,5.0,"I love this place's pho. I've been here a couple of times now and even though I live in Brooklyn, this is one of those places that I would frequent to if I was craving pho. 

The service is pretty quick and even though there always seems to be a line, it seems to go pretty quickly. 

My most recent visit was last night and it was also my first time not ordering pho. I decided to try the shrimp po boy and also got the fried spring rolls as an appetizer to start. The spring rolls came out nice and hot. Perfect for the cold and wet weather yesterday. For $5, it seemed like a pretty good deal for 4 of the spring rolls. The shrimp po boy was also pretty darn good. Although I couldn't taste much of the sauce that was inside the po boy. I want to try the traditional banh mi next time for comparison. 

The pho...the pho is pretty freaking darn good. The broth is rich with flavor and the noodles are the perfect consistency (not too soft or overcooked). I usually get the beef balls and they're always on point. My boyfriend usually gets the thin slices of beef and he's quite a fan. 

Their menu is also very student-friendly--the prices are a really good deal for what you're getting. BUT as a reminder, this place is cash only, so remember to bring enough cash for your meal!"

Once you sit down, water cups comes. Your waitress immediately greets you and youre give menus. Drinks vary from teas, to sodas, to my favorite: THAI TEA. Once ordered, they get to the table super quickly. 

Order your food, don't ask questions. This is a fast paced environment, DONT be annoying. They don't like that. Lol if you order appetizers, they will come out with the food too. 

Once the food arrives (which is incredibly quick) it is fresh and hot and delicious. I loved my
Combo, my friends oxtail was tasty (although the broth was a bit simple compared to the other pho's). Overall it was delicious, i would definitely come back. BRING CASH! It's cash only! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"

I had the summer rolls as an appetizer (ask for fish sauce in addition to the peanut sauce the dish comes with, you won't be sorry), the spicy SS special pho, and a Thai iced tea. The pho was delicious and so meaty. Be careful, even though it's soup it's so beyond filling, I left in a very unexpected food coma.

1) Saigon Shack pho: you get exactly what you hope for, a really good bowl of pho and good portioned
2) Pork chop vermicelli
3) Classic banh mi (only $5!!): truly the best banh mi I've ever eaten - flavor was sooo good and every element tasted fresh
4) Thai iced tea: really refreshing, not too sweet aka just how I like it

**Notes: cash only"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2020-02-21,4.0,"There's a lot to explore on this stretch of MacDougal, first and foremost being Saigon Shack. I can't speak to how the food compares to other Vietnamese places in the city or really how it stacks up to a bowl of pho served sidewalk-side in Ho Chi Minh but it was delicious and hearty and very reasonably priced, relative to other froufrou brunch spots. 

I was pretty hungry and while the others in my group all went with the pho, I ordered the summer rolls with the soy protein, the mango and papaya salad with steamed shrimp, and the sautéed daily veggies (which also included generous chunks of the soy protein). The protein or fake meat or whatever it was, was absolutely delicious. I get a little grossed out by imitation meat but I could have eaten a whole bowl of this with some rice by itself. The salad came in a heaping mountain with some delicious dressing on the side. And the summer rolls were a great, refreshing alternative to the spring rolls (which tend to make me break out in these splotchy zits that used to be the bane of my teenage existence), though pretty messy to eat with one's bare hands. Bits of vermicelli flying everywhere. 

Love the four-rack condiments jar - green chiles, hoisin sauce, chili sauce, and sriracha. 

My only gripe is as we were ordering and I mentioned the cucumber drink, I noticed the waitress was not writing anything down and I knew deep down in my gut she would forget it. Which is fine. Not that I really needed sweet cucumber squeezin's. I'll try it another day.

Cash only. On the weekends, get here right when it opens so you don't have to wait. Text, call, harangue everyone else to get there right at 11am when they flip the sign because they won't seat you until the entire group is here. Don't invite the one friend who says they'll be there at 9:30 and won't get there until 9:50 (often, I am shamefully that person)."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-12-26,5.0,"Saigon Shack is a fantastic spot for Vietnamese in Greenwich Village! 

Before you go, note - the space isn't huge, so going with groups or around peak lunch or dinner might require you to wait. Also, it's cash only. If you don't carry cash on you, go get some because this spot was the bomb!

I went with a friend around 2 and we were seated within about 5 minutes. We both got the spicy special pho (15.95, with 3 different types of meat!) The pho is decently priced for New York; the more classic types are about $10 and the rest are about $16. I wanted to try the banh mis and vermicelli bowls as well since they looked delicious, but as it was cold I went with the pho.

I'm glad I did! It had just the right amount of flavor, came laden with meat and noodles in addition to your standard bean sprouts, lime, etc. on the side. The heat was at a good level, I think it is likely due partly to a chili oil of some sort since you could see it on the broth. It was tasty and a great portion size - we were thinking of splitting an appetizer but I would have for sure been too full to finish it; the bowl was completely filling.

Lastly, I have to mention service - they were polite the food came out quickly (less than 5 minutes), attentitive and kind. I asked the hostess if I could charge my phone (yes, I was that guy) and she brought over a charging pad and charger! Definitely not what I expected from New York.

Fantastic food and service, I'd love to go back and try other items on the menu!"

The staff is super friendly except one time this much mature Asian waitress that was being incompetent but every other time I went, it's usually the same servers and they're super nice. All their food is delicious! My friend got a vegetarian pho from them and she loves it. (vegan friendly too). I highly recommend. only downside is it's kind of out of the way but so worth traveling to since its like a 15 min walk from soho bleecker street. also, being a cash only place but bank of america is nearby and they have a atm outside. the thai iced tea may be too bitter but either way, i always come again and give it 5 stars. it's delicious!"

We both enjoyed the banh mi, which is a definite bang for your bunk and has great texture (smooth pate with pate constrasting with the crunchy pickled veggies. I've had people tell me it's the best banh mi they've had, but while I enjoyed it a lot it didn't blow me away.

The pho was generously portioned and broth flavorful! Overall really enjoyed the vibe (and my boyfriend enjoyed the bitter + sweet Vietnamese coffee)."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-10-01,5.0,"I think this is one of my favorite Vietnamese spot in Manhattan. Came here for a Tuesday lunch at 1130am with a colleague, and we were looking for something homey but flavorful. The restaurant was actually quite full, but the hostess managed to get us a seat at the bar. We ordered: Saigon shack pho for myself, he ordered a pork vermicelli, and we got a shrimp summer roll which we spit. Total bill came out to be around $33, tip Not included. Pretty good deal I'd say!

AMBIANCE:
Casual spot since it caters to mostly students and undergrads who study and live around NYU. There are a few tables and a long table at front that can sit eight people give or take.

PROS:
Flavors are definitely on point here! My pho was so flavorful and the broth you can taste the umami and beefiness, without it tasting too oily or thick. The noodles were boiled to the right softness. I love the variety of meats you get in the pho, including sliced beef eye round, beef tendon balls etc, and they definitely did not skimp on the portions of meat or noodles in the bowl. 

The pork vermicelli was also super flavorful. Think super greens meet giant chunks of charred pork, which had a sweet honey glaze yet a smokey flavor to it. Definitely taste healthy and the food makes you refreshed after eating it. 

Also love the summer rolls we got, they were light, big portioned, and paired really well with their house made peanut sauCe.

Price wise you can't beat. My Saigon shack pho was slightly pricier at nearly $13 a bowl, but you can get their regular pho bo for less than $10. The vermicelli was around $10.

OVERALL:
This place is incredible! Some of the best pho in Manhattan, I know I'll be back hungry for more!"

I ordered the grilled pork vermicelli and thoroughly enjoyed every single bite. There were generous portions of each component of the vermicelli bowl: veggies, noodles, pork. It's easy to split this into 2 meals. 

Saigon Shack can get pretty busy, but service is great and food gets served quickly."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2020-01-27,5.0,"My friends and I came here on a cold, rainy day (depressing I know) and were all in the mood for some amazing pho in the village so Saigon Shack seemed like our best bet and fortunately we were not disappointed. The tables are already stocked with the works and the food doesn't take too long to come out either. We all ordered different types of  pho. Personally, I got the Saigon Shack Pho and wasn't disappointed. First, the bowls of pho are HUGE so if you want to order appetizers that's fine but I wouldn't overdo it. Second, the pho itself is absolutely delicious. The broth itself is on the lighter side but that's why there's different types of chili sauce to add on to it to reach your desired spice level (for a lack of better terms). My friends and I all liked this place and I could definitely see myself venturing back here."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-09-14,5.0,"With the exception of a possible wait, I really liked Saigon Shack. We came on a Friday night at 630p, put our name on the list, and got seated after 15 min. It's busy in here and with good reason. The food and vibe is great, and I'd love to come back again for the pho and banh mi.

I tried the Bun vermicelli with grilled pork, shrimp, and spring roll plus an app of shrimp summer roll the first visit. The bun with the medley of toppings sounds like alot, but it's a good way to try a little bit of everything, which was my intent. I loved the spring rolls and the shrimp was nicely grilled and seasoned with flavor. The spring rolls are a must try; super crispy throughout. I think these might be the best spring rolls I've had in general. The grilled pork was tasty too, and they put a lot on this dish. Overall, portion was more than sufficient, and there's plenty of vegetables and noodles in ratio to toppings. The summer rolls were delicious as well, and if you want something 'lighter' for an app, these are the way to to. Make sure to add some sriracha to all your dishes if you like that bit of heat.

I'll definitely trek back to Saigon Shack. It's totally worth the little wait. It's a quick meal, so a wait shouldn't be as bad as it looks. Their bun vermicelli totally hit the spot for dinner, and I'd love to try their pho and banh mi. Service was also very prompt. Definitely give Saigon Shack a visit if you haven't for some tasty Viet food."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2020-01-22,5.0,"My favorite pho place and also many others' favorite as well! While the line can be a bit intimidating, I'd highly recommend waiting if you haven't been here before. It also moves quite fast and they have a pretty good system of making sure things are moving along. 

A classic bowl at Saigon shack is THE BEST thing to eat after a hangover. Not sure if I've found a better bowl of pho in Manhattan yet. 

I always get their pho. The broth is packed with flavor and I think that's what makes the pho here so good. It comes out very fast as well. It's very simple but SO SOLID. 

I've had the summer rolls and spring rolls here too - would recommend either as a good appetizer! 

This place is CASH ONLY!!!!! There is an atm nearby , but it's easier to come prepared. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND for a casual but amazing meal!"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-08-31,5.0,"Go here, pho sho! 

I had an awesome time here. I went here on a Saturday around 3pm with no wait, we sat at the bar. The service, staff and atmosphere was efficient and friendly. 

Before I decided to come here, I saw a cash only sign but realized there's a Bank of America just down the street. 

I ordered the oxtail pho - amazing. The meat literally melts into the pho and off the bones. Yummmm. Even for a hot, summer/fall day, it was perfect. I added a lot of siricha because there's basically no spice to it. I also had the summer roll with shrimp. It's refreshing and comes with peanut sauce. I'd definitely come back!"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2020-01-31,4.0,"Some of the better pho I've had in NYC (which seems to be somewhat lacking in Manhattan). The chicken was great and the broth was solid. My only complaint is that the price is on the higher side, especially for being cash only."

The interior is clean with not much seating, and the seating at the front is all group seating, so there was a little bit of a wait when we went at about 7:30 on a Sunday. Service is great and turnover is pretty quick as well. 

Banh Mi: I got the classic Banh Mi and it was actually the best banh mi I've ever had. And it was only $5! It was filled with super fresh veggies veggies like carrots and also meat and was incredibly well seasoned. I also loved that there were a variety of different Banh mis, which I am excited to try in the future! 5/5 

Chicken Pho: Definitely very flavorful and huge portion sizes, like this could probably be split into 2 meals. The noodles were cooked to a perfect texture and the broth was both light, but hearty on a cold winter day! Around $11 which is super affordable! 5/5"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-09-17,4.0,"Good food. Reasonable price.

My boyfriend introduced me to this place. He went yesterday and then brought me here today because he liked it so much lol. We got their pork banh mi and their lemongrass chicken banh mi to go and then went to Washington Square park to eat! Both had a lot of flavor and the meats were tender and not over cooked. The day before he got the classic banh mi. After trying all three he said that he liked the classic the best, but overall they were all really good. So I guess you can't go wrong with any of them! 

I'm interested to try their pho and bun dishes!"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2020-02-10,5.0,"The most amazing Pho I've ever had...because it was the first Pho I've ever had, and I will definitely be having more. We sat at the bar, which was very cozy (make sure you're not a rightie sitting next to a leftie) but perfect for a cool spring day. Our water cups were never empty as the staff was very attentive and consistently filling them up. The broth was light and the aromatics made me want to keep eating more. I had the vegetable Pho, and it had carrots, broccoli and some potato in it. The attached photo speaks for"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-07-31,5.0,"I been dying to go here and it was worth every minute of wait. The Bahn Mi is remarkable, i went with the brisket (most common). The waitress before it came out asked if I wanted jalapeño in my sandwich, I opted for them out. That attention to detail saved my life.
I had the spring rolls and it was the perfect compliment. It was fresh and appetizing.

My favorite part was that it's the middle of the summer and all these diverse faces hunched over hot bowls of pho. Literally drenched in sweat. That's how you know your food is good."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2020-01-17,5.0,"Delicious, high quality Vietnamese food. I've recently returned from a trip to Vietnam and the quality of the food at Saigon Shack compares extremely well. The service is quick, efficient and the food is exceptional. Strongly recommend the spring rolls ($8), the classic Bahn Mi ($5), and the Saigon Shack Pho ($12.95). The Bahn mi is a good size, especially for the really affordable price tag. The Pho is huge, delicious broth and full of meat, including brisket, beef balls, and sliced beef. Everything came out within 5-10 minutes. One important thing to note is that the restaurant is cash only. Take out some cash and go eat at Saigon Shack, you won't regret it!"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2020-02-04,3.0,"I came here with a friend who had recommended it. She got the beef pho and I got the lemongrass chicken over vermicille. I had never had this dish before so don't have much to compare it to, but I wasn't really impressed. The chicken was packed with flavor but the rest of the meal tasted pretty bland. My friend loved the phoo so I give it three stars based on the fact that I could have just had an uninspiring dish."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-08-17,4.0,"Saigon shack is the best place for pho/vermicelli in Manhattan and it's so popular that there is always line. The service is super quick so the wait isn't bad. 
I love their grilled chicken vermicelli so much, it's so delicious with sweet, garlic flavored and little spicy sauce. 
Their place is kind of crowded but service is so friendly and welcoming."

13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-07-29,5.0,"My sister and I have been to many pho houses but this was one of the best! The rice noodles were thin but stretchy and the pho brisket bowl was so big! The pork spring rolls were also quite big and filling, and the pork had just been cooked and the warm meat with the fresh vegetables were very delicious. 

Just FYI they're cash only!!! Also I would come early because there tends to be a line from their popularity."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2020-01-09,5.0,"TLDR - bánh mì the pho'k up 

""Shack"" accurately describes this small, no frills, no nonsense restaurant that offers a variety of Vietnamese classics including a couple pho options, bánh mì, and pork chops over vermicelli or rice. 

The thin beef and beef balls in the ""Saigon Shack Pho"" were delicious, but what was really full of flavor was the house brisket that was in it. Fresh bean sprouts added a nice sweet, crisp to contrast the aromatic and rich broth that brought the whole noodle bowl together. 

I absolutely will be going back to show friends and to try out more of their other menu options. 

Expect a wait during peak lunch/dinner hours, but rapid service after you get a table. Also, don't forget to bring cash, because they are cash only!"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-07-31,5.0,"Such a great find! I went with a friend who said she loves this place for Vietnamese food. I was a bit skeptical at first as I have been to Vietnam and love the food and know it well. Its hard to get great Vietnamese food but this place is excellent!!

We shared a few things, we had a vegetarian Pho, vegetarian spring rolls and fresh spring rolls. The Pho was one of the best I've ever had. It was outstanding!! I want to go back asap just so I have order the vegetarian pho again!

Absolutely a must when you are in NYC and want Vietnamese food. The service was great as well.

13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-12-15,2.0,"I've been here on multiple occasions and loved the food. This time, I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from the Classic banh mi, which is a shame because this place has given me awesome food for years. I will be back, as I think this instance does not define the restaurant, but I am disappointed by the quality for this visit. 

Otherwise, I thought the fried spring rolls were very tasty. They have a nice, crunchy exterior, which goes well with the dipping sauce."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-12-09,5.0,"I placed an order for pickup on a Sunday afternoon at about 12:30. The woman on the phone reminded us that it was a cash-only establishment, and that the orders would be ready in as soon as 5 minutes! 

I arrived about 10 minutes later, and our order was ready. We ordered one order of Lemongrass Chicken Pho and one order of the Saigon Shack pho, which had thinly sliced beef, beef balls, and the house brisket. The order was packaged meticulously: the broth for both orders was packaged separately, and then the noodles and meat were in a separate container. The basil, bean sprouts, peppers and lime were also in a separate bag, so nothing was soggy. The broth was remarkably hot, so everything stayed warm despite the 15 minute walk from the restaurant to our apartment. 

The broth and flavors of the dishes were well spiced, but we were most impressed by the amount of meat that was included in the meal -- the combined quantity of noodles and meat in both of our orders made the $13/$12 dishes very well worth it. 

All in all, we were very impressed with Saigon Shack's quality and quantity of food, especially with the efficiency with which it was prepared. I will definitely order from Saigon Shack again!"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-11-08,5.0,"One of my favorite Vietnamese noodle spots in the area. Although PhoBar is also owned by Saigon Shack, for some reason, I prefer Saigon Shack so much more. Some of my favorite items include the fresh spring rolls (not the fried ones), the classic beef pho, and their banh mi sandwiches. The prices are not the worst, their pho's range from just under $10 and their banh mi's start at $5. Now that the weather is getting colder, all I crave is pho and I'll definitely be back to Saigon Shack. 

It does get pretty crowded around peak hours, but the wait generally goes by fairly quick. Good to note that it is cash-only, which is kind of annoying. I always tell myself that I'll try something different when I come, but I end up getting the same thing every time..."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-11-09,4.0,"I got to experience Saigon shack on a Saturday brunch hour. It was a little busy, a little cozy, and very diverse in terms of crowd. Located right near NYU, the mix was youthful and swanky. The interior decor was nice and I enjoyed how modern the place looked with its coffee bar. We decided to share the bun Dac viet with everything and the original Bahn mi with cold cuts. 
The service was nice and fast, the menu simple and clean. The food came out very pretty and quite fresh. I would say that my Bahn mi had an interesting brown meaty sauce I have never experienced at another Bahn mi placed- maybe that took the place of pate? I wasnt sure why that sauce was there. It had a great amount of carrots but not much cilantro. All in all the Bahn mi was solid and tasty. 
As for the dac biet bun, the noodles had a nice texture and the sauce was flavorful with the right profile. It had awfully tasty fried spring rolls to boot.
I would def get this to share.
I enjoyed myself, regardless if it wasn't the most authentic and a little more pricey. I had a good time and it tasted nice."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-11-06,3.0,"I was sick of dorm food, and needed an out. Along with my boys, we went to this restaurant, situated not far from our dorm. Keep in mind, we are all college boys, therefore value plays a major role, along with taste, vibe, etc.

We must've walked in at the perfect time, because as soon as we entered, there was a table cleared up, ready for us. The restaurant was PACKED, and after we were seated, a long line had begun to form behind us, so expect some waiting. The restaurant is chill, with a vibe similar to a local pub or grill. Our table was more of a picnic table than actual restaurant seating, but we enjoyed the setting.

The prices are good. The banh mi was only five dollars! Pho ranged anywhere from nine to thirteen dollars. Food came impressively fast, and while the banh mi was alright, the pho was noticeably lacking in amount of meat. We ordered the expensive pho, so we expected there to be reasonable amounts of beef in our soup. Don't get me wrong, the pho was good, but I might have decided otherwise if I knew how little beef they would add to the soup.

Service was generally very good. Although there was one server who gave me quite a bit of attitude. All I asked was how big the banh mi was."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-06-09,5.0,"Five stars for a delicious, filling sandwich for only $5!  The price point and quality of food canNOT be beat.

The SS Classic is a savory mix of well flavored meats, crunchy sweet carrots, and refreshing cucumber.  So satisfying!!  Come here- you will not be disappointed. 

**cash only**"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-03-13,4.0,"If you like Vietnamese food, you'll like Saigon Shack.  The food is clean and well prepared.   The places is clean and for New York spacious and comfortable.  

This has a strong NYU student presence not only because of its proximity but because this is a good value with Bahn Mis starting at $5 and huge bowls of good pho for $10.

I went with classic beef pho and could barley finish it all.   Broth is good and the beef is raw brisket that cooks in the broth.  

The sweet potato fries looked good for $5 and so did the Peking duck bahn mi for $13. 

This place is just south of Washington square park or just east of the W 4 subway stop.  This is a good value lunch for Manhattan.  Go when it's later like after 2 and you can get seated right away.  

Cash only.
Gets very busy."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-09-22,1.0,"This is not my first time be here. Just because I missed the pho so I came back. Food is good, the atmosphere is nice. 

However the female waitres's service was terrible. She did not greeting to most of customer, put put on her poker face all the time. I wanted to have soft drink. So I asked her is the sparkling water unsweetened, she showed her impatience and annoyed face. I think she hates doing her job. In the end, when I left the resultant I saw she would like to come back into the cashier. The aisle side was too narrow to fit two people at the same time. She just bumped and squeezed to get her way. She did it even saying anything. She did not assert to apologize, but at least saying something like watch out ... or anything. 

I strongly not recommend you go to that restaurant. The artichoke pizza and the food stand next by are also famous and high yelp reviews. You don't need to treat you bad!"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-12-02,4.0,"Pretty flavorful broth and quite filling. You may have to wait some time for a table. But if you're dining solo, the bar cycles fairly frequently. I got the summer roll, which is Gluten Free if you don't eat the sauce.

Overall, I'd visit again if I were in the area."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-04-13,3.0,"We've tried so many times to dine here but to no avail. There's always a line and even if we wanted to wait, the ""wait time"" isn't justifiable. 
But we were lucky this time to be told that we would be seated in less than 10 minutes.

This place is cash only. No reservation, no alcohol and there's always a wait, so plan your visit in advance to avoid disappointment. I did not find this place a date night place or romantic but rather just  a good place to eat delicious Vietnamese cuisine.

We were seated at the bar (what's the purpose of a bar devoid of alcohol). Our waiter came to get our orders and since the menu is small it didn't take us a lot of thinking to decide what to have. We started with crispy summer spring rolls with pork, shrimps and vegetables served with dipping sauce. My eyes caught the grilled pork chop over rice while my partner tried Pho Bo. They were served in a timely fashion and it was delicious.

To be honest, I've eaten in many Vietnamese restaurants. As a matter of fact I even spent two weeks in Vietnam and I felt that I do have the authority to say that nothing really stood out here but nothing to dislike either, hence the 3 star. So, if I crave for Vietnamese food next time, Saigon Shack will not be the first that comes to mind!"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-02-25,4.0,"Saigon Shack is a quick-serve, sit-down Vietnamese spot right below Washington Square Park. Despite being in prime NYU territory, they turn out solid food at a low price point.

I've come twice now during peak times (1 pm and 7 pm on Saturdays) and have had about half hour waits for a party of 3. Service is very good at getting you in and out. The vibe is casual and busy, though it's a surprisingly photogenic space with lots of old wood.

Pho starts at $10 and goes up to $16; banh mi are mostly around $9. Their beef pho broth is okay, a little on the light side, but the spicy broth is way better and more flavorful. Their eye round beef and brisket are pretty good; skip the beef balls. On the banh mi side, I've only tried their vegetarian version, a soy-based protein that's quite good.

Overall, Saigon Shack serves well as a reasonably priced pre-event meal with friends. Though their food is all well-executed, I can't say I'd come here so often if it didn't have the convenient location it does."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-10-06,3.0,"While not the best Vietnamese food I've had, this place offers a solid choice for the area with the flavors being correct and the overall dish being authentic.

I opted to order to go and got the vermicelli bowl with pork. Man, they loaded this box with goods, I definitely had enough for 2 meals. The pork was slightly on the tougher side. However, it was nicely seasoned with lemongrass and they give you a lot of meat and also don't skimp on any of the fixings! I ordered and got my meal in about 5 minutes. This place is definitely solid for Vietnamese food, I like that it's pretty authentic and the meal was reasonably priced too (~$10) compared to many areas around NY! Looking forward to coming back for their pho (I do see that they expanded a Pho Bar around the corner as well!)"
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2020-02-03,2.0,"I usually only go for American or Chinese food when I'm visiting New York. But we were visiting a few weekends ago, when it was POURING outside. Since it was cold, we thought pho sounded really great. Despite being 3pm or so, there was still a good amount of people - larger parties had to wait. We got pho and the spicy banh mi. The soup was pretty good. Everything else was pretty bad. I get that it's cheap for New York, but the meat in it was dry and didn't hit the spot for me. The banh mi was ok, but it wasn't particularly flavorful. I'm used to getting my Viet food in VA (i.e. Eden Center), which has more authentic flavors. This was a bit disappointing for me."

13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-10-01,4.0,"Some friends and I came in for an early dinner before class. We were seated right away at the large communal table at the front of the restaurant. We ordered the fried spring rolls to share and then everyone ordered a separate entree. I went with the classic Pho, while my friends got Banh Mi and rice dishes. My Pho was awesome. The size is plentiful for one, the beef was perfect, and the broth had great flavor. They also bring everything on the side, so you can put in as much or as little of the extras (jalapenos, sprouts, etc.) as you like. My friends enjoyed their choices as well, particularly the Banh Mi. 

The ambiance is cool inside. It's a small spot, so I could see it getting very busy later in the evening. They had the windows open too, so we could enjoy the breeze with our dinner. Waitstaff was nice too. The food came out timely and they came around to check on us frequently enough. 

Overall, highly recommend this spot if you'e in Greenwhich Village. The food is excellent and the scene is pleasant! They are cash only, but nothing is crazy expensive."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-02-13,5.0,"This is my favorite spot for a satisfying bowl of pho on a cold day. Good price, location, portion size, and overall taste.

The house pho is always the way to go at every pho place and this one is no exception. I've been here twice and gotten the Saigon Shack pho both times. The meat to noodle ratio is amazing and the broth is super flavorful without tasting extremely MSG-laden (you can tell based on how much water you drink throughout the meal). The portion size is surprisingly large and can feed two people if you're both not super hungry. Great portion for the price, which is very reasonable given the convenient location. Service is always super fast and this place is always packed.

The only downside (and this depends on your preferences) is that the meat is very lean and doesn't have much fat on it. Again, this might be a pro for those who don't like fattier meat."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-08-05,4.0,"I tried the three way combo that includes grilled pork chop, bbq shrimp and spring rolls (the best part). It comes over rice or noodles with a load of lettuce, carrot and cucumber (much appreciated).  It's like having an app., entree and side dish all wrapped up nice and neat in an large low bowl."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-09-16,2.0,"Upon reading many NYU students' raving reviews, I was excited to relieve my hangover with a warm bowl of savory pho. I was one of the first people to enter on a Sunday morning. As I was the first to order a bowl of pho, especially ordering food on a weekend, I was ready to slurp my Sunday away. To my dismay, the meat crumbled in my mouth. The grainy texture of the meat was so appalling, I left without finishing the bowl. This marks the second time in my life that I left pho unfinished.

I thought I was overreacting and decided to give this place a second try. Again, a disappointment. With a party of three, we ordered three plates and they enforced a $15 minimum per person. The sandwich was overfilled with pickled radish and carrots. The spring roll was bland because majority of the filling was filled it rice noodles. 

Come here for sandwiches, not pho. Oh, and this place is overrated. I've had better pho and sandwiches in Philly."
13,saigon-shack-new-york,2019-03-11,3.0,"***Vegetarian Review

We decided to try this place out because it was one of the few things still open after midnight. Unfortunately it was closed early for the day without warning. Our fault for not calling in, but I would hope that the restaurant could put some sort of update on their website or social media if this is happening.

When we eventually got to try the food, I thought that the vegetarian sandwich was just okay. I had high hopes for the food here since I'm always looking to find a similar shop to my all-time favorite - Saigon Sandwich in SF. I thought that the seitan was an interesting texture, but I actually prefer the flavors from Num Pang more. The sandwich wasn't bad, but I've had much much better bahn mis elsewhere.

Another downside of the restaurant is that it's CASH ONLY. I believe the closest ATM has a fee, so remember to bring cash."

How many places have one $ sign on yelp with over 2,000 reviews? Not many. The traffic speaks to none other but the food itself, and you'll be glad you waited those twenty minutes.

So many different people are cycling in and out of Saigon Shack, so it could get a bit crowded. I don't mind the crowd as it reminds me of the extremely populated restaurants in Asia that serve the best traditional food. When my friends come here, we will never order only one thing... you have to pair your bowl of pho with some spring rolls or even a banh mi. The food here is that good. 

My favorite bowl of pho is the Saigon Shack Pho. Great option when you can't decide on the protein you want with your noodles. The beef is average quality that cooks in the broth, but that brisket seriously makes up for it. The ridges of the brisket act like little pockets which pick up little shots of broth for you. Drinking so early?

Anyways, once you're done here, go check out their Pho Bar spot! only a couple of minutes away :)"

EVERTHING  THERE ARE THE TOP NOTCH .
Pho[soup] is the only place  that have the right rich  stock grill chicken go  in the bowl.
I have try other places[100 different  restaurants]  cannot compete  this special  restaurant. Other items there also top notches.
JUST GO THERE WITH OTHER  MEMBERS  OF YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS....."

Those orders are taking 5-7 days to be sent, and their tracking information indicates that the USPS is overwhelmed & therefore orders are heavily-delayed when being sent out from the post office."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2020-01-09,4.0,"Beautiful little quaint bookshop in the Nolita/Soho area. Find yourself here when you're tired of shopping and need to rest up a bit. Mad props to them for not hating on the squatters in the cafe lol 

Don't forget to checkout the downstairs area!"
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2020-01-04,4.0,"Owned by a Rand McNally Road Map (who knew a road map could own a freaking bookstore), this is one of the highlights of this neighbourhood in many ways.

This is an adorable little bookstore in New York City in the heart of Greenwich Village and I come down here all the time when I'm in New York, and many other regulars do too.

It's got a local feel to it which you can't really say about the vast majority of bookstores these days. It's expensive, and the big downside is that to use the bathroom in here you have to pay. If that weren't the case I'd have given it 5 stars.

But having said that, they do cool little quirky things like printing your own books, or even someone else's book for you if it's not copyrighted. Not cheap to do so, but a very cool service that most don't offer.

So all in all I'd say it's a really great place with a very memorable cafe as well."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2019-12-31,4.0,"Right in the heart of SoHo, McNally Jackson is a cute and vibrant independent bookstore with a really interesting selection of novels, stationary as well as a very nice cafe. It's a really great place to get away from the chaos of shoppers and sit down for a cup of coffee with a nice book. Since it was the end of the year, they also had an entire section dedicated to reduced priced books! Definitely worth checking out. 

I was able to grab a seat downstairs in one of the larger communal tables but I wasn't able to get any reception. Unfortunately I noticed there was no wifi option either (at least on that floor). Although most people tend to sit in the cafe upstairs, it would've be nice if some kind of WiFi was available!"

That's the best way to describe this bookstore located in the middle of the street.
It's filled with out of the ordinary books. Sections and topics.
It's inviting and warm which is rare to find in this part of the city."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2019-09-22,5.0,"I love this bookstore. On a rainy day, this place is a perfect getaway to sit down, order some coffee, and read a book while listening to the putter patter of the rain on the sidewalk. Coffee is excellent. The coffee shop seating area is adorable (but oftentimes full - it's very likely that you'll have to share a table with someone). There's no outlets or wifi. There is a restroom downstairs.

I was reading the recommended books around the ship and found two great books. I haven't bought books for leisure in ages, but I had to in support of this place. Will definitely stop by again. BTW - this place is really close by to Uncle Booms, so call ahead and take a seat here while you wait for your number to be called. ;)"

This small and clean bookstore has a local feel, an extensive news periodical section, a coffee shop, and a wide range of books that seems well thought out and extensive for the limited space.   Most books only come in 2-3 copes but again the selection appears vast thoughtful and quirky.  

Staff appears bright and they order stuff."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-11-23,5.0,"This is the bookstore that I once dreamed of opening.  The selection is incredibly broad, so when I want new Science Fiction, Japanese Mystery or a classic, McNally Jackson has it covered. You'll walk away with something that you want to read.

But, I want to talk about the staff (spoiler, they're amazingly great)
I once was passing by and saw a book in the window display and thought ""I want to come back and buy that.""  Here's proof that delay rarely profits: I went back two days later and the window display had been changed and my only memory was that ""there was a book I wanted.""

I realized how unlikely this was to turn out well, but I remember *really* wanting ""that book,"" so I went into the counter and said ""there was a book in the window a few days ago...""
""Sure"" the man at the register said ""What's the title?""
""Ummm, no idea.""
""What was the subject?""
""I don't remember.""
""Do you know the color of the cover, or if it was hardcover...?""
""Nope. I'm sorry.""
""No worries.""
He asked his coworker to find out who had changed the window display, called down to her and she brought up the books that had been removed for me to look through.

WHAT?  REALLY?

Best part: I recognized the book: ""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13612949-pataphysical-essays"",
bought it and got one of the charming school desk seats in the in-store cafe to start reading.

*That* is how you earn a fan and a customer for life!
But wait... there's more!

I had reached the end of my current notebook and the only place that I've seen it was, where I've always bought them, one of McNally Jackson's stores.

I came here after work and couldn't find the exact one, something close but the wrong color cover.  I asked the employee who was arranging the stationery about it, offering to go around the corner to the other location if I had to.  She, Anna, was sympathetic to my being so particular: she offered to go downstairs and see if they had the one I wanted, but also asked if I'd looked at the new notebooks.  I demurred, as I told her that I'd been through many before settling on my favorite. She said that she understood completely and was the same way about hers, but suggested it as these were truly new, not before carried and different.
She showed me the new ones and... 

I have a new favorite!  The Blackwing with dot paper and pencil.  I've been so happy with it and with the fact that someone in a store actually listened to me and helped me discover something I love."

14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-11-29,4.0,"Fun!

This is a cute bookstore with a great selection and really fun stationery. I liked the display of cookbooks, which included a variety of cuisines and cookbooks for specific dietary restrictions as well as creative cooking books where weed is the main ingredient.

It's nicely organized, there are nooks to settle into if you want to get a headstart on your reading before you even leave the store."

When I first entered the store, I thought it was a super small bookstore and cafe, but when I came in a browsed through, I realized it was larger than I thought, also with a basement with a larger selection of different genres.

A section that I really appreciated was local history section. I found a lot of interesting books about the history of the Hudson Valley Region (where I grew up!) I was able to read up on the history of how my local highways were funded and constructed (I think that's cool lol)

The overall place has a nice relaxing atmosphere. I like the feel of being surrounded by a lot of books, haha. The basement area has a table area similar to libraries where you can chill and read with friends. I have not yet tried the cafe, but I definitely would like to the next time I go! There were many books that caught my eye when I visited, and for that I really wanna come back!"
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2019-10-21,1.0,"The staff provides horrible customer service . I went in tonight after my friend told me how cute this place is and was incredibly disappointed. I bought a $5 card and when the cashier said $6.48, I asked why tax was so expensive on a $5 card. She said the card was $5.99 and I asked her to look at the tag which had an accurate card description and said $5. She wouldn't honor the price and told me I could pick a new card. I asked if she would fix it and she said she would-- which apparently meant fixing the rest of the stickers and not honoring the $5 price. I was in no mood to continue to argue on a Monday night so I took the card, but I certainly won't be back. Small book stores should be trying a lot harder to win your business- especially with Amazon."

The bookstore has a coffee shop too, and it's nice to smell the coffee while wandering around the bookstore. I like how there are seating areas available downstairs - there are usually some open seats, fortunately. My only concern is that there is only one bathroom and often there is a huge line."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-03-07,4.0,"Ok this coffee and bookstore is beautiful and in a great location. Definitely going to be a regular here. my ONLY problem is they don't have Wi-Fi nor outlets. Which is a shame because I could spend hours here.

The bookstore is so cute!"

However, they have a wonderful selection of books and I never have trouble finding something new/interesting! 

If you'd like to sit down and read a book while sipping some coffee, then this is for you! There's a great little community table that you can sit at and read or do some work. But be wary that people might chat over there as well..."

14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-09-19,5.0,Love love love. There aren't many local bookstores like this with adjoining cafe. A nice variety of books and selection. Ended up purchasing 4 books. Not bad prices to get the experience of searching for a good book. They also had great nick Nacs such as stationary and such. They gave us the cool bookmarks with our purchases as well. Would not be disappointed GO!
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-11-11,4.0,"This store is well stocked, but it is small. It also attracts a lot of tourists, so it can get pretty crowded in here on weekends. The prices are average, you will pay the list price for the book, unlike the Strand, which I think does discount books a bit. The employees have all been unfriendly every time I come in here - at least the ones at the register. The employees at the information desk downstairs are usually quite helpful and friendly. The cashiers barely smile or utter a word to you, and their demeanor is ice cold. Overall, a good bookstore to find interesting books you may not even think of or to find specific titles you want."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2016-10-20,5.0,"Love. Cafe with fabulous coffee and unique bookish ambiance and decor, adjoining book store.  Incredible find for coffee lovers, creatives, readers, writers, and if you're really creative and inspired - have a book printed here. Really? Yes. I left here wanting to write a book just to use this incredibly cool service.

I stopped in for a coffee and snack before a meeting and loved it - will definitely go back when in the neighborhood for a fabulous coffee, to get productive or creative in the cafe and to use their book printing services.

Ambiance.  Bookish inspired Character.  The cafe connected to the book store has books interestingly hanging down from the ceilings, and pages of books as the wallpaper. Some tables and also my favorite -  seating area along the wall that has wooden rests buckled up against the wall which you can pull down to set your coffee, snacks or a small writing space. So creative. 

Espresso Book Making.  How amazing . Have a book or story you want printed? They will do it with basic packages starting at $30. 40 page minimum (front and back) or 20 pages one sided. Your own creations or will print Public domain/ copyright free books. 

Coffee and snacks. Incredible and strong coffee. I don't LOVE coffee often but theirs was fantastic.  I needed a quick 5 minute snack, had the cheddar chive biscuit, very good. 

Service.  Counter service was quick and friendly. Jacob at the Espresso Book Making area was informative w details when I called to ask and emailed details.

Must come back to write that novel. Ok, realistically, no time to write a book, but definitely a holiday gift for my son, printing something absolutely fabulous he recently wrote that I thought  needs to be bound and saved forever. 

Definitely recommend."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2019-01-06,5.0,"Perfect writing space while in the city. The selection of books is impeccable. The food selections are nice as well.

Would be 5 stars if only they had wifi.. Otherwise, the coffee is decent and the bookstore is great for perusing if you need to kill time in the area."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-05-16,5.0,"My friend recommended this place because I was looking for new notebooks and pens. I am in love with stationary, but sick of going to the basic Target or Barnes and Nobles for it. So he suggested coming here and wow, it exceeded my expectations. 

They had the pens that I really liked. I like extremely thin pens and then have a 0.25 size pens, and it goes on the paper so smoothly. It's called the Micron 01. If you're looking for the 0.25 ones, make sure to read closely because some of them are 0.30/0.38. So just keep an eye out for that. 

I also got a couple notebooks. I bought a normal spiral notebook and a travel edit notebook because I travel a lot. There were soo many choices, and the have a japanese brand that I really liked. The texture and the durability of the notebooks were really strong. I love it. 

Unfortunately, I didn't get to explore the coffee and mini bakery, but all I can say is if you're looking for some kickass stationary then definitely stop by here. It was delightful ^-^"
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-08-24,5.0,"Excellent selection of books, rare finds, unique books, and everyday classics. Check this place out, especially since books stores are dying out and they are not as common as they once were. Some of my favorite bookstores all over the city have already closed. 

I love digital books and read them that way all of the time but there is something special about holding a book and turning real pages. 

It's also fun to browse, look at cover art, and just pick out a book based on  pure whim.

If you are in lower Manhattan then this is a great place to relax, browse, and spend a few hours.

Bonus: The coffee and pastries are good too!"
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-06-10,4.0,"Independent bookstore with a different selection of books, music and periodicals.  Classical music plays softly.  You may peruse a book or magazine uninterrupted.  There is some seating up and downstairs.  This time their bathroom was out of order.  No good when you offer a cafe!  Still enjoyed our visit."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2017-02-03,5.0,"This DEFINES what a good bookstore should be like.

Unlike other bookstores in the commercial area, McNally Jackson really takes efforts to get the best quality books - it mostly focuses on literature (US and international), art, photography and other humanities subject. All the books just look so beautiful and are like artifacts in a museum.

I came on a Friday night after dinner and there happened to be a James Joyce book reading session there in the cafe area which really fascinated me. Downstairs (yes there are two floors) there was a group of people talking about ""literatura"" in Spanish. It really feels like a bookstore in the Latin Quartier in Paris with all the intellectuals and scholars discussing and debating. 

I got a novel by Murakami with almost ~1000 pages and it's only ~$15. Reasonably priced! And they take credit card."

Very approachable staff (not too pretentious or snobby)
Okay events
Nice comfortable cafe without wifi which works out for me so I don't get distracted 
The selection is okay
They're trying with their cute philosophy section with some butler, Foucault, fanon...

The bathroom needs a quarter with a condescending sign in the bathroom about intravenous needles.  I would love to see the correlation with quarter bathrooms and intravenous needles. Maybe the us should just install quarter 25 cent locks on all doors to solve this heroin epidemic. Like maybe if only Philip Seymour Hoffman and some of my friends just had a 25 cent lock on their bathroom doors--they'd still be alive.
But McNally mentions their plumbing... plumbing is so ""expensive""  maybe McNally should install a needle disposal container there? https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/0909.pdf

And their Asian history and politics sections are offensive
They should just rename them as capitalist China with some token vietnam and maybe some Japanese books and leave it alone ...
Oh and apparently the ""Middle East"" is not part of Asia ? It's a very offensive term . There is no ""Far East"" and no ""near east"" anymore.
I was there on a Saturday one time and there were a bunch of precocious white children making ""crafts"" or something downstairs. I'm glad that I didn't bring my kid and expose him to that element. I'll take him to a real NYC institution, Housing Works Bookstore around the corner for some real culture,  less cutsy insensitive signs about intravenous drugs and a better selection of books...or maybe the NYPL which is also a stones throw away for some kids events ;)"

I live in a city where Barnes and Nobles is where I go for my novel fix. Not only does this bookstore do an amazing job of posting recommendations by genre in several locations throughout both floors, but there is also a healthy dose of novels including best sellers. Great location in SoHo. A bit packed during the holiday times. Came out of the store with 3 delightful reads I can't wait to start."

- The hot chocolate is delicious and comes in a hearty portion 
- Good selection of books, easy to locate 

Cons:
- Place gets really packed"

Pages of books adorn the café like wallpaper and books are uniquely displayed hanging from light fixtures. If you're an Instagram addict, this store is your place (although there is no wi-fi or outlets, so perhaps you should give your phone a ""time-out"" while you visit!)

They have a nice selection of popular fiction that is 20% off retail price - not too shabby!

Everything is clean, organized and meticulously labeled. The only thing that surprised me was the teeny-tiny bathroom (which doesn't lock, btw). There is a sign that states it doesn't lock because apparently some fine citizens were flushing syringes?! Best take a buddy with you and have them guard the door. Or ask a nice stranger like I did."

A cozy spot to grab a book, order a coffee, and read or just relax in the cafe, if you're lucky enough to snatch a spot. No wifi (or outlets in plain sight) so not a place to take your conference calls, but that makes it all the more special as a place to unplug and bury yourself in a new favorite novel."

There is a downstairs space as well and all the books are nicely separated by genres/interests. 
One of my favorite areas is on the staircase between the floors where they have a small assortment of stationary and notebooks. A lot of things from Japan & I want to buy everything every time I'm in there. 

They also have this really cool printing machine where you can ""publish"" your own books and get them bound. Pretty cool -- hopefully will have a chance to do that in the future!"

McNally Jackson has quickly become one of my absolute favorite places in Manhattan. I've gone on more dates with this bookstore than with boys during my time here (hah). I'll plan errands in the vicinity on weekends so that at the end of the day I can reward myself with a few hours of book-browsing. The front table displays always have the greatest and most current hits. They have a phenomenal poetry section with a little desk piled high with selected volumes that you want to flip through. Somehow they manage to cram the perfect ensemble of everything you want to read in a small bookstore in the heart of downtown Manhattan. Jedi tricks, I say. 

The staff is hip, friendly, and helpful. They courteously stay out of your way unless you ask for help, and I never get yelled at for sitting somewhere or lingering or accidentally leaving a stack of books on the table. Let me tell you as a bookstore enthusiast, this reverence for the actual readers inside a bookstore is rare to find. 

The greeting card section is full of gems for the intellectual types that enjoy deliciously horrible puns, Rorschach test double entendres (""I only see you""), and other pleasant surprises. 

McNally Jackson hosts regular readings by an impressive array of writers. I still remember sitting in rapture while Eileen Myles quipped about living in the East Village. 

As if that weren't enough, you can treat yourself to cafe baked goods and coffee while curled up with a book. 

Thanks for spoiling me, McNally Jackson."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2017-10-15,5.0,"A dying breed. An independent bookstore located in some of NYC's pricier real estate. The vibe is wonderful here. Staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Selection is not for everyone, but a thrill for serious readers (no offense meant to those who fancy romance novels or Stephen King).

Even the customers were helpful. They admired best buddy's collection of essays by some writer only read by English majors.

Final funny anecdote: we were having a boozy lunch down the street at a lovely place. They couldn't tell us where ""52 Prince St."" was; but 5 out of 8 people chirped up ""it's right over there"" and pointed when we mentioned ""McNally's."""

This is worth checking out. I do love Strand for its immense amount of books and great selection of used books, but this bookstore offers a nice alternative with easier browsing and a more intimate feel. 

There is also a cafe at the entrance, offering a variety of items, including vegan options. I had the lentil soup and a cup of coffee. There were people on their laptops and people reading- they have free wifi but no outlets, so make sure your phone/laptop is charged if you want to do work there. Before I left, I bought a vegan chocolate muffin to-go ('cause who doesn't love trying vegan pastries??) and it was yummy too. There is no minimum purchase for credit card too which makes it convenient. It is a little pricey (the muffin was $3.50 I think, and the soup/coffee a little under $10) but that is pretty typical of small cafes. I wouldn't make it a regular breakfast spot but as a treat it was great.

Overall I enjoyed visiting it and the staff were welcoming and helpful. It is a good place to look if you want to add a book to your collection or find a unique book as a gift for someone."

This is a cool coffee shop and book store. There is pretty limited seating but there was a communal table where you probably squeeze into. I ordered a cappuccino and Pan Au Chocolat ($6.5). The coffee was smooth and delightful. There was too much steamed milk. The foam was soft and sweet. The pastry was a bit dense but still flaky with a golden crust. There was plenty of chocolate which is a rarity.  It tasted best when dipped into the coffee. Overall a nice place to get a cup of Joe. 

The Book store felt a little cramped but still well organized. They even have a print your own book machine."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2017-06-04,3.0,"Im torn on this book store because it has both pros (selection, ambience) and cons (events) to it. 

Pros: The bookstore itself is great and the staff is usually very approachable and friendly. I love the selection of books that they have and the curation of the books is a great way to have a quick glance at interesting new books! The pricing is standard and I love the little bookshop feel it carries!

Cons: They have lots of exciting events but I feel like they are pretty meh. My first experience was at a David Sedaris reading (which was super exciting). When I got to the stairwell they forced you to buy the book before you could enter the basement area, where the reading was taking place. This was unexpected and not standard across other book readings I had been to. Dont get me wrong, I am all about supporting the author, but I dont really agree on making someone buy the book prior to reading and the staff was being very pushy about it as well. Also at the reading, they hadnt set up any seating so the crowd was scattered and disorganized, making it difficult to see the author and felt like it was very crowded."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2016-06-21,4.0,"This review is for their printing services:

Since you rarely see bookstores anymore we went to take a look inside this store. While entering I saw this huge machine, and hey it turns out that they have a printing press here! Picked up the pamphlet and noticed that they print theses! I just finishing graduate school and actually wanted some extra copies of my thesis, since it's really expensive to print the hard cover binded copies. 

Anyway I emailed them and went back and forth through emails until finally getting it printed! You need to send a PDF to be printed. Also if you want them to adjust your document to a printable size it's an extra $10. Honestly it was totally worth it for me, I was not going to sit down for hours to readjust this on my vacation lol. Overall I think it cost $15-20 per paperback copy, which is way cheaper then having a hard cover binded copy! I was very happy with the service here, and their timely manner of printing my documents since I was going back home to Hawaii!"
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2016-08-03,5.0,"Such a beautiful place.  I got the newsletter saying that the store was open and I had to stop by today. It's such a cute store. The space is roomy and every item appeared to be properly picked out for display.  This store caters to those who love paper, writing, and read.  They sell beautiful paper goods and stationary. There an amazing draft table that unfortunate isn't on sale, holding a cool triangular scaled architect ruler.  Prices are good and the staff is just an extension of McNally Jackson Bookstore's super amazing customer service! Good stuff!

I can't wait to come back for some note cards, and there was a pencil case that I want."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2017-12-31,5.0,Best bookstore in NYC. The staff is knowledgeable and really like the curated selection. The cafe is lovely and has good coffee and pastries. I love coming here to find interesting magazines and journals.
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2017-05-05,5.0,"I love this bookstore. It's a bit small, but they have a great selection of new, up and coming, and interesting books. I love browsing through the two tables in the front to see what's popular, and I find these sections more interesting than similar tables in other bookstores. 

There's a neat selection of postcards and handmade cards in the front, which is great for me, as a collector.

There's also a wide selection of notebooks - I bought my current journal here and I'm very happy with the purchase.

They have events all the time, although I have yet to go. I bought an autographed copy of a book by Ariel Levy a few days after they brought her in - unfortunately I didn't know about the event until after!

This is my go-to bookstore, love this place!"
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2016-01-29,4.0,"Want the zeitgeist view of New York? Check social media like everyone else...joke.

It's very zeitgeisty (made a word up there) this bookstore, a go to for current political, fashion, architecture and all things east villagey (there's another one I made up) 

I like it though, not a huge selection, say compared to the strand bookstore...but if you're an avid user of social media, are probably under 40, and want to expand your mind...I think you'll like this place."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-01-03,5.0,I always wanted to come here as a teen. Yes I was a weirdo teen who loves books. I ordered a hit chocolate here which was amazingly good and tasted of rich dark chocolate and graham cracker. I came inside with the intention of browsing as I wait for a friend but ended up buying a book. They even sell autograph signed books!
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2016-01-06,4.0,"One of the best independent bookstores around.

They have a great selection of thumb-able books, seductively arranged, at the front of the store. I always come in here and browse a bit if I have time. They have a café, which is nice, and they have a [pay] toilet on the lower level. 

There's a notice in the bathroom about why they had to add a coin-lock to the door; apparently--in the bad old days--junkies would go in to use the restroom for what junkies use it for, and they'd flush their works. This creates a plumbing nightmare, and as a result, #thisiswhywecanthavenicethings.

This is a very inviting, community-oriented bookstore. Makes my fingers itch to pick up a book when I walk in the door, and even more, makes me glad I'm a reader."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-12-30,1.0,No wifi. No toilets. Very inconveinet if you have to work. The barista was not very sweet either.
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-08-24,5.0,"Love this place! The selection of books is amazing and I always find something unexpected each time I pop by. Not to mention the cafe is charming with an excellent ambiance for doing work or catching up with an old friend. was helped out the other day by Mhonduro, an extremely kind barista who made an excellent cappuccino 10/10 must visit while in New York!"
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2015-09-04,5.0,"Read more books.  Buy some of them here.

I could go into detail, but the time you spend reading reviews of a bookstore could be spent reading a book's cover copy in that store.

Go!"
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2015-12-28,5.0,"Woah, I started my review with ""I love this bookstore"" before glancing at the others. It's interesting how McNally Jackson inspires that in you. I love bookstores in general, but there's something different about this one. It's warm, comfortable, comforting. 

This place feels less commercially focused and more like a community hub. I like that it's not overwhelmingly crowded with people or books. I don't feel like I'm in the way and I don't feel rushed. I like browsing through the self published works, the magazine collection, and the books on display. Shelves are beautifully arranged and a joy to peruse. I have yet to attend any events intentionally (I've stumbled upon a few) but I enjoy checking out the calendar to see what author or speaker will be around next. 

On the floor where you enter, there's a quaint cafe with a simple selection (they serve stumptown) and a decent amount of seating. There's a bathroom downstairs in case you decide to stick around a while. 

Half a floor down, there's a landing with stationary and journals of all kinds and sizes- basically the best thing ever. Got my first leuchtturm (an alternative to the moleskine) here! Another half floor down, there's a pretty extensive kids section and what I remember to be sections on fitness, business, poetry, and science/medicine. Some seating. Selection is well curated. 

If you want to hide from the chaos of the city or need a place to breathe while friends or family shop nearby, come here to find calmness."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2017-10-03,4.0,"Came on a weekday morning.  Spacious cafe with a good amount of seating.  Had a chai latte and yogurt with bananas for almost $10 (standard NYC prices).  Cafe staff was ok, could have been a little warmer.  

Cons: no wifi, didn't seem like staff come around to clean tables much (I had to clear leftover tissue paper on my table)

I looked around a bit once the bookstore opened.  Seemed interesting and they have a small, but well stocked stationery section with different writing journals which I enjoyed looking at."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2016-12-30,5.0,Such a great bookstore with good cafe/coffee and lectures/events. Hoping this great independent shop never closes like so many others.
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-06-29,4.0,"Stopped in to check out McNally Jackson as we had seen the great reviews here on Yelp and were in the area. Very impressive bookstore, organized in a great way with plenty of stools strewn throughout the store. I really appreciated the books that were featured in each section, providing a description from an employee and why they like that book so much. There is also a coffee shop inside which is a huge plus. We didn't end up buying anything but really enjoyed looking around."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-07-24,5.0,"I love bookstores and this is my favorite in NYC. On the outside it might have the appearance of a chain, but it's not. It's a total indie with a great selection on two floors. I especially like the employee picks and always find something new and cool there. They have an awesome art and lit journal magazine section. They also organize their fiction according to country which is a great way to discover some new and interesting. I often see cool, literary celebrities shopping here. If you're a journal and pencil and pen aficionado be sure to go to their two additional shops around the corner."
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-07-13,1.0,Went to the cafe today. Expensive tea for $5 a cup but no WiFi!? Someone explain this to me.
14,mcnally-jackson-new-york,2018-08-06,4.0,"This is such an adorable bookstore! It has a comforting atmosphere, and a really good selection of books. The only issue is the lack of wifi access, but other than that, it's a great place to spend some time reading!"
15,round-k-new-york,2020-02-02,5.0,I ordered the almond croissant & ginger tea and omg SO good!! A great place to chill before work. Stopped by here on a whim & I'll deff be back!!
15,round-k-new-york,2019-12-02,4.0,"Came here on a weekday at 8:30am for breakfast. When I first walked in, I thought it was just the counter seats to order but behind the curtain are a few small tables. The table chairs are a bit cramped but it's manageable if there's no one sitting behind you. I was surprised to see two other tables also there having breakfast early in the morning.

I ordered the egg cappuccino and darius's lox. The egg cappuccino is a korean cappuccino with egg yolk and whipped cream. The top first sip is really good because of the sweetness of the whipped cream. Once you stir, you get the taste of the espresso. It may be a bit bitter but I usually drink coffee with no sugar so it was pretty good to me. The darius lox comes with scrambled eggs made from the espresso machine, avocado, toast and smoked salmon - perfect breakfast combo."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-11-17,5.0,"I randomly happened upon this place while wandering around LES and was intrigued because I didn't really see a sign, but the window had an ad for what looked like an activated charcoal latte.  Looked it up on Yelp and couldn't resist.

The guy at the counter seemed to really know what he was doing.  It almost felt like I had walked into a speakeasy with one guy behind the bar and people sitting on barstools drinking coffee.  The menu was interesting and there were multiple things I wanted to try, but I settled for the wasabi latte because it seemed the most unique.

There's a really cool room in the back and my drink was brought to me.  I was not prepared for what I was about to experience.  The wasabi latte was sort of mind blowing.  It was surprisingly very well balanced.  It had a really nice coffee flavor and, right at the end, you get a hint of wasabi flavor and a bit of a mellow burn.  With each sip, the wasabi flavor became a bit more prominent, but never overtaking the coffee itself.

I'm so glad I wandered into this place.  It was an experience to remember and I'll be thinking about that wasabi latte until I can get it again next time I'm in New York."
15,round-k-new-york,2020-02-27,3.0,"The cafe is small, cute, and cozy. The menu items are pretty overpriced. I ordered a Korean chai latte and blueberry scone which weren't so great, and the total came to $14. Also, the service is inconsistent. The guy who took my order when I first arrived was clearly annoyed that the next shift worker hadn't shown up yet and his shift was running over. Unfortunately, he let that affect his customer service. He had a rude tone when he spoke to me & never brought me what I ordered. After the next shift worker finally arrived, he brought my scone, which I had already been waiting about 15 minutes for, and I had to tell him I also ordered a latte and then wait another 10 minutes for that."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-08-06,5.0,"This unassuming coffee shop in the Lower East Side is a safe haven for those seeking quietude and good coffee. When you first walk in, you are greeted by a narrow coffee bar. You might think this tiny space is all there's to it, but if you continue past the bar and proceed behind the curtain, you will find the ""back room"" neatly lined with small tables. The atmosphere is eclectic and cozy, with Korean memorabilia scattered around. It evokes the imagery of an old school Korean coffee shop. While it's a nice ambience to enjoy brunch and chat with a friend, it is quite dimly lit and the tables are very low, which makes it a little challenging to work with a laptop.

Now moving onto the coffee. I've been a regular customer, and it seems that they have changed the way they make ice lattes. Previously, they would use frothed, hot milk and then add ice at the end, but now they have conformed to the more common way of making ice lattes - cold milk and espresso. I don't really mind it, but I would say the past method felt more characteristic of this place. Overall though, they still have really good coffee, and they roast their own beans!

As for the food, I've had the Darius's Lox breakfast special, and it's so simple yet so delicious. It comes with toasted sourdough bread, scrambled eggs made with espresso machine, avocado, and lox. Everything tasted so fresh, and the lox was honestly one of the best I've had in a while - thick but not too salty.

I will leave off with a random note. On 5 separate occasions, I tried to order their roll cake, and not once did they have it. It's starting to feel like a McDonalds ice cream machine situation. I wonder if this item actually exists. Mysterious."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-07-09,5.0,"My one regret is that I tried this place only once during my trip to NY. Not gonna lie.. photos and videos of the Matte Black coffee all over social media caught my attention so I made it my mission to try this place at least once. 

Upon entering, it looks super tiny but there's actually quite a bit of seating behind the curtain. I ordered that matte black coffee, along with the 'I Am Avocado' toast, and headed to the back. The ambience and vibes were great here. Even though there were some people here, we were all really quiet while we worked and did our thing, which made me love the place even more. The matte black coffee was amazing and was totally worth the hype - if you like black coffee that is. It's a lot less sweeter than I had anticipated. The avocado toast was pretty tasty too since it differs from traditional avocado toasts. 

Aside from the food and coffee being worth my while, service was excellent from beginning to end. Overall, I had a great time here and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Too bad my time and stomach space were limited; I would have loved to try another coffee and food item before leaving."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-11-29,5.0,"An unassuming coffee shop that looks small when you first walk in, but there's a curtain that opens up to another room in the back for you to eat breakfast all day, read, do work, whatever. Really enjoyed Darius's lox - a plate of avocado, lox, fluffy eggs and toast. The egg cappuccino at first sip tasted like an amazing custard dessert, but after I stirred it, it became bitter but I kinda liked it. Especially since it came in a little egg shaped tea cup. I'll come back to try their wasabi latte!"
15,round-k-new-york,2019-04-22,4.0,"This was my older brother's favorite coffee shop. He brought me here and said I had to try the egg cappuccino and I'm super glad I did. 

The egg cappuccino is so different from any type of coffee I have ever had. The eggy-ness, bitterness and chocolate-ty flavor mixes perfectly well together. It's distinct and unique flavor will definitely have me coming back. 

It's about $7 for an egg cappuccino, on the pricier end, and pretty standard for NY. I definitely won't hesitate to order this! 

PS The interior design makes you feel like you're in an antique shop. I didn't get the chance to go to the back room but strings vibes were felt."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-11-24,5.0,"Hidden gem of NYC! From the outside, ambiance looks like a run down shack, but awesome on the inside. 

You can definitely stay in Round K for hours! A combination of coffee, food and music is all you need to get to know someone. Its chill ambience with peaceful but not sleep-inducing jazz in the background makes it the perfect place to unwind and have a conversation. It's a little small, so I it feels more cozy and intimate."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-02-08,4.0,"Round K offers a very comforting ambience. Although space is quite compact here and it seems like there are a lot of items inside, it is clear that the placement of everything was well thought out. This is more of a place to go to when you want to sit down for a bit and enjoy a great latte. I wouldn't recommend having a full blown study session though because the tables are small and space is limited.

We decided to give the matte black latte a shot. The texture reminded me of the sweet black sesame dessert that I sometimes get. You get a slight bit of gritty ness to it but instead of it being from the sesame seeds it is from the espresso bean. Despite the drink being pitch black, it actually has a slight creaminess to it and a bit of sweetness which neutralizes the bitterness pretty well. Overall I think the drink is very unique and great tasting but be warned that the caffeine level is pretty high so don't drink it too late in the day if you have any intentions of sleeping.

I have been here two other times and I must say that, like the interior, they really focus on the intricacy of details and quality in their beverages. There are places you go to for a great latte/coffee, and then there are places you go to for a unique experience that offers a different perspective of what you are used to having. Round K is one of those places that has both."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-11-25,5.0,"Coffee is just amazing!
Having lived in Colombia for 8 years and trying coffee from around the world, I can say this is one of the best I've tried. 
The barista here of course makes a huge difference (Erik)
Even though he was on his own taking care of the restaurant he did a great job with a great attitude!"
15,round-k-new-york,2018-11-27,3.0,"I was passing thru New York City going to New Jersey and I wanted to stop for coffee. My trusted Yelp app brings me to Round K.

Walking in, its an old school spot. Wooden floors and counters gives it a true coffee house feel.

I walk up to the counter and I see a bumper sticker: Gods Hates Yelp
I tell the two counter guys, I'm Bill S, Black Status Yelper! I show them my phone and my black Yelp profile. God loves me so he must love Yelp! Now let's get the coffee process started. 

I asked them about a Flat White, less milk than a latte. Not a problem sir. He starts to clean the espresso machine and it looks like there is egg all over the wand?? What the F?

Round K makes something called ""egg cappuccino"".

I heard of butter coffee but egg cappuccino is something that I'm not willing to try. I see him take an egg and separate the yoke from the white and drop in into a coffee cup. Yeah... I'm not down with eggs and coffee. Maybe its a cultural thing, but in NYC? Eggs and coffee is a no bueno.

The coffee barista starts to clean the egg off the steaming wand, its just caked on. He then makes my flat white and puts a little spin in the foam. 
Here you are sir, enjoy.

If my wife (who is in the car) saw this cleaning process, she would have fainted. Me? I know God made the chicken, the egg and the coffee beans. What came first, I'm not sure. But I know they should never meet.

Egg cappuccino & Wasabi Lattes, if your jonesin' for these items your prayers have been answered. 

I'm good."
15,round-k-new-york,2018-11-02,5.0,"Hidden gem of NYC! My girlfriend and I were around the Koreatown district of New York that we stumbled upon this cool place. Although, ambiance looks like a run down shack from the outside, but awesome on the inside. Han, the manager of this establishment greeted us when we entered. That dude is chill! He got a very approachable vibe in him that makes his customer service an A+ in my opinion. The front bar make it seems like they serve sushi, which is unique. The preparation he put to make our latte is similar as preparing an authentic sushi with style; at least thats how I describe it. 

I ordered their Ice Matte Black Latte because its Halloween season so might as well try it out. It is super delicious and refreshing. It is made out of 98% Deutsche cacao with almond milk. They called it the ""Hell drink"" around here. The sweetness and the bitterness of the cacao are not overpowering; one of the best blend of latte that I ever had. After finishing my drink, I don't remember if Starbucks exist lol. Overall, I am definitely going back here again :)

PS: Shoutout to Han.. you're one cool dude"
15,round-k-new-york,2019-01-12,5.0,"Oh my gosh I'm so glad I came here! 
Admittedly, I was drawn to visit for the matte black latte, but I truly loved everything about Round K.

The shop is unassuming but inviting from the outside. Inside, there's the cutest, quite eclectic bar/counter area. All the cups and plates and utensils are different and kitschy in the best possible way. It smells great and when you walk in, you just feel relaxed. They had a curtain up between the front and the back, which did a great jobs of keeping out the winter chill and also made the seating in the back feel more intimate and cozy. 
They have more seating than you'd expect when you walk up. Sweet little booths made up of chairs. The decor in the back is also just so inviting! 

After ordering they told me to grab and seat and that they'd bring out my order when it was ready. I'm not sure if this is always, but they did ring me up until I was leaving. But there's no check or table service fee. No one comes back to check on you after they drop off your order. Which is nice, doesn't feel like they're rushing you out. 

I, or course, got the matte black latte (which only comes iced). It did not disappoint! Completely black. The blackest black I've ever seen in a drink. Much darker than a charcoal latte. Theirs is made with ""hell raiser"" espresso, Dutch processed cocoa, and almond milk. Topped off with the blackest of black whipped cream. It's also apparently vegan! 
This was totally delicious, not too sweet, with a very smooth mouth-feel. The whipped cream was just a bit gritty, but also gelatinous? Not totally sure how it's made since it's vegan, but! I still loved it and was tempted to stick a fork in my drink to eat all of it. 

I also got the roll cake with yu-jah marmalade. It was really different and also great! Airy sweet cake with a tart marmalade. The whole thing was quite rich and the serving size (along with the tiny fork!) was perfect. 

Really loved the whole experience, I plan to come back and try some tea and one of their breakfast (all day!) dishes!!!"
15,round-k-new-york,2019-11-12,4.0,"Ambiance goalzzz. I love this place so much. The bf and I were in the area and I remembered the romantic vibe of this place. Small pot of tea was $6, but they refilled it for free. We got the jasmine tea-- no complaints. Very delicate & cute teacups. Bathroom design on fleek. 
Great place to study or have a chat!"
15,round-k-new-york,2018-08-19,1.0,"I've been here twice, once on a weekday morning at 9AM and another on a Friday afternoon, close to 2PM. Round K had been featured on various social media accounts, and being Korean myself, I wanted to check out the drinks they had to offer. 

Both times, I was rudely greeted by a barista who told me the signature drinks (matte black latte and wasabi latte) were sold out. Note that I was there in the morning, and the drinks were sold out? And I stood there disappointed but asked him if there was another drink he would recommend. He kept on telling me to wait because even though the restaurant had been open for an hour, he had just begun to put the baked goods out. There were no other customers, and he could care less that I should be serviced. He had to do his thing first.

The second time I was there, after being told the signature drinks were sold out, I asked if there was a dessert menu I could look at, and the first thing the barista does is laugh and tell me is to go to the pie shop next door. I mean, is this guy serious?

I will never come back"
15,round-k-new-york,2019-10-03,4.0,Tasty and quiet. Would come back. Coffee was awesome and super different flavor. Would recommend stopping by and trying it out if you're a coffee person!
15,round-k-new-york,2019-04-13,4.0,Went to this cute coffee shop for a late night hangout with friends and it super cute! The bathroom is even more amazing cause it doesn't feel like a typical bathroom.

Ive been in NY many times, this time the only thing on my ""must things to do"" list was to drink a matte black latte. 
We walked in and ordered drinks, we were asked to sit down and our drinks will be brought to us. 
After some time I walked back to check on our drinks and was told that people that came after us ordered 5 of those drinks, and he'll make those 5 to them and after that there is no more, so ""you'll have to change your order"" he said...

5 minutes goes by... no coffee yet, no biggie... 10 minutes.. hmm, this is odd... 15 minutes now... OK what the hell? I go back to the front and there is the same barista working on other customers coffee. I asked him for an update on my drink to which he gives me a surprised look, stares down at the counter, looks up confused and asks me ""what was your drink again?""

15,round-k-new-york,2018-06-21,4.0,"This is a pretty cool coffee shop in the Lower East Side neighborhood that I've been wanting to try because of their matte black latte. I finally got the chance to give this place out a visit a few weeks ago and was totally mesmerized by the antique coffee machines and other coffee paraphernalia displayed all around the store. 

I gave their matte black latte a shot and was in awe with the texture and the flavor. Upon first taste, this latte reminded me of the Chinese black sesame pudding that I used to love as a kid. There was a gelatinous layer that slightly resembled that of pudding on the top layer. Definitely give this latte a shot if you haven't already because the taste and texture sure are unique and are different from your typical latte. I also tried out their blueberry muffin, which wasn't the best, but was decent. 

They also offer a ""hidden"" seating area in the rear of the venue behind a curtain which is table-service only. I did not even notice the seating area until someone pointed it out and it reminded me of a Prohibition Day speakeasy haha.

Overall, I'd recommend trying this place out if you haven't been here already and I'll be sure to consider this place whenever I'm in the area and going for a coffee-run."

You order at the bar and then take a seat at the back where the drinks are delivered to you. You don't pay until you're leaving the cafe. While there aren't too many outlets the wifi is solid and there a a bunch of cute small sofas seats and tables for you to sit at.

We ordered the charcoal coffee and the egg cappuccino. I loved the charcoal coffee. The drink was a bit sweet, but it also had this sesame-tasting whipped cream at the top which was absolutely delicious.  The egg cappuccino was also quite good but there's a flavor that hits you a little bit after you take a sip which was a bit strong for my taste. Definitely a must try for coffee lovers, however."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-12-13,1.0,"Sadly the worst experience of my entire life :( I had asked if this was a Korean restaurant/shop to which I was told that was an incredibly rude question. I was informed that I must ask ""if this is a Korean themed restaurant"". I am completely open to rhetoric shifts and being cognizant of respectable language. However, it quickly got out of hand. :( I was repeatedly reprimanded by the barista in an increasingly harsh manner even after I expressed my confusion and was only create conversation because of my personal interest :(. Went home in tears - have truly never had such an interaction with another human being.

As someone who lived in Korea for 5 months, spent time learning the language and culture, I was utterly shocked to be treated in such a hostile manner. 

I SO wish I could write kinder words and rank this coffee shop higher as I was instantly drawn in by the incredible aroma and seemingly pleasant surroundings. A big bummer that the customer barista was eager to argue and create an environment that was horrible for my friend and me. 

Here's to hoping there's improvement and that NYC as a society can work on engaging in dialogue that moves the needle on critical conversations rather than becoming aggressive."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-08-24,4.0,I live around the neighborhood and always walked passed this place. I'm so glad I gave it a shot and actually tried it. It's a coffee shop with seatings in the back. It's korean so it has some korean infused dishes. They serve all day breakfast and coffee. You first order in the front then grab your seat in the back. They will serve you the food and you pay after. I tried their egg Cappuccino and it was so good I had to order another round. Breakfast was also really good and simple. I liked it a lot. Will definitely recommend to friends and family and will definitely be back to try their other dishes!
15,round-k-new-york,2018-05-24,4.0,"Stumbled upon this place on yelp when looking for a cafe in the area. Upon walking into the cafe it seemed like a really small and cramped place but keep walking towards the back and past the curtains for more seating! The seating area in the back is the perfect place if you need somewhere quiet to study. The space is clean and had cushioned chairs however it is pretty dim. 

Initially I was a bit confused on where to place my order but the person who was working was really friendly and told me to order up front and he'll bring me my drink. I ended up settling on the Matte Black Latte bc it was something on the menu that stood out to me. This is an iced drink made from almond milk and espresso. When I got my drink I didn't know what to expect! The top looked creamy like a milkshake but after taking the first sip it was a sweet and unique taste. 

Interesting menu and nonetheless great first experience!"
15,round-k-new-york,2019-09-27,5.0,"By far, hands down, one of the best coffee spots in NYC.   The coffee guys are experts at their work.  A must see to simply see how they make their designs.  Cozy.  Clean.   And always a popular spot.  Don't miss this if at the LES.  Near the tenement museum.  Must visit!!! Awesome guys work there"
15,round-k-new-york,2018-07-13,4.0,"Incredibly impressed with the aesthetic curation. It's a much larger space than it initially appears to be, with the front parlor closed off from the back section with a curtain partition. The front of the cafe is meticulously curated and welcoming, with knick knacks galore it feels like the lobby of an asian tea trading company's office - cozy but worn in with history abound.  

The seated section past the curtain feels like a dimly lit private speakeasy meets library and again very cozy. I ordered the carb-less eggs + choose your own adventure sides so I got sundries tomatoes and prosciutto. The eggs were very bland, the tomatoes overdone, and the prosciutto fatty and tasteless as well. I did like that the meal came with a cup of coffee I'm fantastic silverware, but come for the vibes, not for the food."
15,round-k-new-york,2018-03-26,5.0,"Had the standard latte and don't be fooled by the small store front with a few seats at the bar. There's a room in the back with a few tables and each table has a menu. Feel free to grab a table first then go back to the counter and order. 
The cup was ginormous! And of course the coffee and caffeine content was great enough and kept me up long enough to finish my night strong without passing out. 
Overall, this was a super cute hole in a wall coffee shop. If I ever come back to NY, I'd try the other cool items they got on the menu."
15,round-k-new-york,2018-10-12,2.0,"The 5 star reviews seem like it was given mostly by Social Media Whores, White Washed Asian Americans, and Suburban or out of state tourist crowd who are always fascinated about everything Asian and rate it high cuz they were too lazy to fly out of America to see that an entire world exists outside USA. But I digress

One of my Caucasian friends suggested I check this Korean owned coffee place out with its signature Matte Black Iced Latte that has been all over social media apparently. As a Korean American with superior knowledge in both language and culture of South Korea, decided to check the place out one day since apparently the theme of the place is 'Dabang' or Traditional Korean Coffee place that used to be a meeting place among the older generations to have a conversation over egg yolk coffee and maybe some tea with their dates. 

What really put me off was the slightly annoyed and sort of pompous attitude that the Korean owner dude gave off as soon as I walked in. When I saw the menu and tried to order their signature drink, the Matte Black Latte, he replied with a condescending tone of 'SOLD OUT'. So I browsed through the menu again to see what  I should get instead. After a minute he tells me that he can make it but it will take 30 minutes. So I tell him that's fine and I'll just chill out and wait in the seating areas in the back. (Minus 2 Stars there for lack of customer service which is surprising for a Korean owned place and the pissy sort of like an Entitled Diva ATTITUDE)

Now the seating area is very 'cozy' but as a 5'11 person, the chairs are not very comfortable and very small (I needed to use both chairs and I'm not even fat) It has a clean restroom so I only took half points off (Minus 0.5 stars)

Matte Latte is served and this place is definitely for instagram purposes only. Nothing too special nor was the coffee strong. It was a bit too sweet since I was expecting like an Espresso type of drink. Even then, the drink was $6.50...more like a novelty item rather than an everyday drink (Minus 0.5 stars)

I think the place is good for a one time visit and not worth coming back for a second. I think the owner is a bit selective on who he is willing to sell his 'Sold Out' Matte Black Latte drink because he did make it for most of the customers although for some he told them it was Sold Out (we could hear the conversation he's having with his customers since the space is small)

Personally I think the barista/owner dude needs to realize that this is 2018 and although we are in once hipster hood of Lower East Side, the prententiousness has to go. Hell even Hipster Capital of Williamsburg Brooklyn just across the bridge from LES has gotten way friendlier the past few years since they don't want to go out of business. Maybe he's still new to NYC and the hospitality business since his English wasn't the best and I read he went to Konkuk University for his engineering degree which has nothing to do with what he's doing right now apparently lol

Nevertheless, I'm good with one time. I'll just stick to Starbucks for my everyday cup of Joe and head over to Williamsburg and Bushwick when I need really good coffee."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-09-08,5.0,"LOVEDDDD the matte black latte it was so good, my friend got the Korean chai latte this was also very good. The seating is a bit small but I really liked it bc it went with the whole vibe of the store. Would go again, this time to try the wasabi latte"
15,round-k-new-york,2018-05-06,3.0,"I had higher hopes for this place. Of course, consider this biased since I took my one drink to go, and perhaps the drink/dine-in experience is more positive.

Interior is really cute. The menu has a variety of options in terms of coffee, teas, signature coffee drinks, alcoholic drinks, and breakfast/brunch options. Didn't get to enjoy the decor since I took my drink to go, but got to admire their little trinkets while waiting in line. Line was a bit slow, but that may just have been due to its popularity. 

I got the matte black latte. It was yummy, but I would have expected more for $7 and some change. About half my drink was whipped cream.

I liked it and I'd probably come back to try their brunch, but wouldn't come here just for the matte black latte."

The owner who  sweetly acquiesces my late night dose of ginger tea + honey every time I arrive after closing is worthy to be praised. As well as for the ambiance which makes you feel as if you've been transported to a rime of the Korea of antiquity. My favorite place to nestle with cappuccino, a good book and have the world fall away..."
15,round-k-new-york,2018-02-07,5.0,"My favorite ""secret"" cafe in NYC!

When you just take a glimpse of the cafe from the outside it looks like a hole in the wall, but behind the curtains there is a cute seating area. The decor and vibe I get is jazzy, classy, Asian...if that make sense. They play soft jazz in the background and have many cute decor all over the cafe.

Everything you order here is delicious. I've had their regular coffee, matte latte, wasbi latte, yuzu tea, and breakfasts (bagel, egg and avocado). My most recent visit, I ordered the ginger tea because it was late at night and a coffee would definitely mean no sleep for me. It was so good! Sharp and sweet. I highly recommend getting the ginger tea if you aren't a coffee drinker. It was super gingery and had little pieces on the bottom.

Lastly, the service is always amazing. The baristas working there are so kind and friendly. Definitely my to go to spot. Almost didn't want to write this review so I can keep this place all to myself!"
15,round-k-new-york,2018-05-21,5.0,"While my review is only on the instagram infamous ""Matte Black Latte"", you should still read it LOL

One day I was on my way to Washington Square Park so I was on the F train and I said you know what I'm nearby let me just go stop and try out this black matte latte. It's pretty close to the train only. Two blocks so why not. It is a very small storefront. I ordered the Matte black latte and got a carrot cake to go. The latte was pretty good. It was very rich in flavor. I did wish they did give you different sizes to choose from because I definitely would've got a extra large. Great photo op and it taste good so hey why not."
15,round-k-new-york,2018-09-01,1.0,"Coffee shops in New York are a dime a dozen. There are so many that you need to serve something special to stand out alongside so many gems. I must say, round K certainly does a great job of standing out, with their specialty drinks and unique take to coffee. 
However, of the two times I've been here, the customer service is horrible. In response to all the other yelpers who have complained about the service, I've experienced it too! You can place your order in the friendliest tone, but the barista will look at you like you've just cursed out his entire family. I want to say that he's a coffee nazi (If anyone is familiar with the soup nazi in Seinfeld) If you are okay with getting rude service and just want to gram the coffee that you saw on instagram or a youtube video, then by all means come. But don't expect to have a 5/5 experience."

I came here on a Thursday night around 7pm. It started getting crowded around 7:30pm. When you walk in, there's a counter with the barista inside and 6 (?) stools on the outside. It seems cramped at first but behind the curtain, there's more seating! I think there were 7 tables. The little couch chairs can be moved around so you don't have to be all cramped and squished. We ordered the matte black latte which was such a delight to drink! You need to go up to the barista to place your order. The bathroom decor was so cute and the theme reminded me of the 1940s era."
15,round-k-new-york,2018-08-31,1.0,"Worst customer service.

The owner is very rude.  I came here once a few months back and helped my friend order a coffee at the front while she went to find a table for us in the back.  I mistakenly ordered her a black coffee so when he brought her coffee to us, we asked if we could have milk. He then said to me, ""you said no milk,"" and I responded, ""I know but would you please add milk, I accidentally ordered black."" And he proceeded to ask me to come with him to the front, and made me bring the milk back to my friend.

I can't believe that asking for milk was a whole ordeal for him that he made me get up from my table, walk to the bar, and serve the milk to my friend myself.

I've never experienced anything like this before.

What kind of customer service is this? Never come here. The coffee isn't even that great. Save your hard-earned money for another coffee shop. Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts has better customer service than this place."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-01-12,5.0,"Had this place bookmarked in my Yelp for a while--finally went this morning and so glad I did! 

Thanks to a recommendation from another customer who was waiting in line with us, we tried one of the most interesting drinks ever: the matte black latte. One sip and I my mouth fell open. It was so yummy! It tasted like a black sesame latte with a lingering coffee aroma. 

I will definitely be going back with my girlfriend to try their breakfast menu!"

15,round-k-new-york,2017-11-19,4.0,"Round K's entrance is so unassuming and average you'll walk past it a million times and not think twice or even inquire about it. Guilty. As. Charged.

They have plugs and a cozy but very dim sitting area in the back - dim like Gryffindor's common room. It's perfect for work or for catching up with friends; I spent a solid 3 hours chatting away with a friend and it was perfect, though I wished the tables were bigger/taller because my 5'7"" frame kept hitting the table corners and plates! 

Drinks/
The barista makes kawaii latte art like bear and rabbit if you ask him to (and they're served in the cutest tea party-ish floral cups)! We wanted to try the wasabi latte but it wasn't available that day. 

Food/
All their eggs are made using the espresso machine! We ordered Mrs. Lee and Michelle's breakfast sets, each of which included a latte for an additional .50¢. Michelle's was lightly fragranced with truffle oil and my favorite of the two. Think American breakfast, but lighter and healthier versions.

I'll definitely be back to try the egg cappuccino and the matte black ash latte!"
15,round-k-new-york,2018-11-12,5.0,"Such a great place for tea in the city. Small and quaint but if you can snag a table in the back, you'll be glad you've visited. Who needs Starbucks when you can have a pot of tea for under $10-and split between two people is about 2 cups each. 

The staff is super friendly and attentive. They also have vinyl records playing. So that's always a win for me. It was such a good place to break from the cold weather on a Sunday afternoon. I can't wait to return and try a few other flavors."
15,round-k-new-york,2019-04-21,5.0,"Excellent coffee, great environment, friendly people, nice secret seating area in the back. It even smells nice, because they roast the coffee there.

The ice coffee is the best I've ever had. There's also a nice collection of soju.

Great spot to get some freshly roasted coffee, beer, or soju with people and hang out. Also be a good spot to study or do some work early in the day. This place is a gem. 
I always drop by when I'm in the neighborhood."
15,round-k-new-york,2017-12-06,5.0,"Best little hidden gem. 

I was actually walking down the street in search of something else for dessert, but I was immediately drawn into Round K by the strong coffee aroma (seriously, the coffee smell outside is intoxicating!!). Although the cafe looks tiny from the front, there are a few tables tucked away in the back where you'll find people working/studying or just chatting and chilling. The whole cafe gives off cool, hip vibes and has a sort of warm and cozy feel to it at the same time.

Since they were all out of the black matte latte, I decided to order the mocha instead. It was rich, smooth and had just the perfect amount of sweetness, which is something I've found that a lot of other cafes struggle with. The drink also came out in a lovely drinking bowl and had the cutest bunny latte art on top! What a nice surprise. 

Love the ambiance and drinks here. Definitely will be back to try other drinks and food."
15,round-k-new-york,2018-09-14,4.0,"ALRIGHT. Let me just start by saying OMG the Matte Black Latte is OMBOMB! Let me backtrack for a second. I knew that I was gonna get both the black latte and the wasabi latte seeing that its on the menu today. When you enter, you enter into like a bar setting with one barista serving you. He was decently nice enough, so I didn't get any rude service like some other reviewers are saying. He made me my black latte and wasabi latter while I waited sitting down at the bar stool. I am pretty sure he messed up my wasabi latte b/c he said that usually it looks better and that it shows some of the green in the latte, but it came out regular light brown like all other lattes out there. There's a curtain in the bar area and when you go through it you get to the main seating area. Plenty of seating when I went around 2pm. Wifi was strong and steady. 

ANYWAY. The Matte Black Latte is seriously strong and packed a punch! It was JUST the right amount of sweet (I don't like very sweet drinks, usually get 1/2 sweet for most sweetened coffee drinks), and it has like a slight char-flavor ish. The real MVP doe is the black whip cream. It tastes like theres gritty bits of espresso in it, and the whip cream is a little bit sweet, so together they countered the smooth bitterness of the latte itself perfect. I was like DAMN DAMN DAMN and slurped down the drink. It only comes in ICED form. 

The wasabi latte I had hot. It was aiiight. TOO sweet for me. The wasabi just punches you in the facehole but I like that wasabi burn in the back of my throat. 

But BRUH. When I was leaving the coffee shop, there were 2 cops ordering drinks, and they came out and tapped me on the shoulder and asked for the barista if I paid yet. I was thoroughly confused as I came out from the curtained seating area with NOTHING in my hands. Lol. That was weird. But overall, I would 100% get the black latte again if I am ever in NY again."
15,round-k-new-york,2017-11-26,5.0,"What a cute little cafe!  The cafe doesn't look like much from the outside or from the bar you're ordering from, but when you go past the bar you'll find the most quaint dining area.  A perfect spot for a coffee date or to hang out with your best friends for an afternoon pick-me-up.

I came here from watching a video of an egg cappuccino.  It was intriguing and I'm all up for something new.  Once I got to the cafe, I did just that.  I ordered the egg cappuccino and was told to take a seat in the back.  There's a back?  What!  So I walk past the bar, through a curtained area, and found a hidden gem.  While waiting, I went to the bathroom to wash off subway germs and found the bathroom to be decorated in a traditional Korean house.  Exposed wood, decor based around tea, and a cute desk area that's purely decorative.  Being Korean, this was highly amusing. 

Once I returned to my seat, they brought out my beautiful cappuccino in a vintage looking tea cup.  The egg cappuccino is divine!  Its a little denser than the traditional cappuccino, and the egg white that is frothed into the milk gives it a meringue like consistency.  Its dusted generously with dark cocoa.  Definitely a sipping beverage.

The seating is quite small and cozy.  Try not to bring a lot of stuff with you."

15,round-k-new-york,2018-07-11,4.0,"After having been to Round K a couple times, I understand why locals bemoan the opening of chain stores & cafes in their neighborhood. Round K is a rare find & it adds to the Lower East Side's appeal; the same could never be said about a Starbucks. 

The entrance consists of the coolest espresso machine, a few stools to perch on, & a barrage of decorative tchotchkes, some within an Asian theme, to keep your eyes & mind busy. Behind a curtain is a cozy area with small tables & couch-like chairs & the decorative motif continues. I geek out for secret entrances, rooms, passwords, compartments, so finding out about this back room was like striking gold for me. 

It ain't just your surroundings that's a hoot in this cafe; their coffees, in particular, are a different breed. We had the black matte latte & omg, so much delicious coffee flavor. I don't know what's swirled atop this icy concoction but it's velvety smooth. This is the place to go if you're into the charcoal/black food & drink trend. There's also a Wasabi Latte and an Egg Cappuccino on the menu, if that's more your speed. 

The food menu is simple. I ordered Burrata Creation which was a ball of the soft cheese, scrambled eggs, & avocado. My breakfast left something to be desired. For how special this spot is & how inventive the drinks are, the food was a bit lackluster, & the eggs (cooked in the espresso machine -- I know, mind blown, right?!) & burrata were both runny. Despite this, I'd come back to Round K for their espresso drinks, & maybe try a different dish next time."

Also the place wasnt noisy at all; very comfortable to sit and talk. They had outlets to plug in if you need to charge anything. There were Korean traditional decorations here and there, and it really added to the unique cute atmosphere.

16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-11-27,5.0,"Find this place!   If you're looking for the finest pastry this is the place...cookies, cannolis, eclairs...you name it!   

No place to dine in but buy and eat as you stroll down Mulberry.  

The staff is friendly and helpful.   And they have a really cool automated string tie machine!!
I only wish o could get these treats at home!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-05-05,5.0,Thanks to La Bella Ferrara I finally got my Cannoli fix I've been seeking since Italy.  Me and one other person followed our noises to this sweet smelling bakery.  We spoke to one of the locals there who got six of their mini ones that were sold outside just for himself.  He convinced us to also get a few for ourselves.  Their mini ones are great if you want to try all their options.  My favorite was their peanut butter one that had the cannoli shell dipped in chocolate.  Yum!  They were all impressive and good though.  Inside their shop was an overwhelming variety of desserts and baked goods.  I really want to come back and try everything.
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-06-16,4.0,"Don't let the red neon lights and less ""modern"" appearance fool you. These people know how to make an incredible cannoli! I got the mint cannoli, something I had never seen before and was very excited about. It was awesome! The outside was a crunchy Oreo shell and the center was filling with just a slight hint of mint, topped with chocolate chips. The filling wasn't to heavy or overwhelmingly mint, which I loved. The employee at the counter even put powdered sugar on it for us because she knew we were going to eat it right away. It was a perfect after dinner snack! They have plenty of other desserts that also looked delicious, and I'm sure they are. When you're in Little Italy, make sure to check this place out!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-11-10,4.0,"Having grown up on the west coast my experience with cannoli was fairly limited until recently. I didn't really fall in love with them until a trip to Sicily last year. 

Stopped by la Bella Ferrara for a quick impromptu breakfast, and it was amazing. I had a cannoli, a rum baba and a lobster tail. Each pastry was the equal of anything you will find across the Atlantic. 

This shop is definitely worth a visit."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-05-25,5.0,"When I tell you they have the biggest variety of cannolis I have ever seen, you should truly come here and give this a try. They have also a variety of Italian desserts to choose from that to be honest can be very overwhelming but so decedent you have to try. We got a lobster tail, a peanut butter cannoli, tiramisu cannoli and a red velvet cannoli! (Can you tell we are truly into cannolis). Everything is so good, one of my favorite local Italian bakeries"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-04-26,5.0,We spent $100 on 2 boxes of cannolis! The peanut butter flavor is my favorite and original chocolate dipped.
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-11-30,5.0,"Little Italy classic, cannoli are of course important but also a good selection of other treats including fruit tarts and eclairs. As the street has become more and more commercial, this place remains the same in the best way possible."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-09-17,5.0,"Oops! Two Ferrara Bakeries! This one is La Bella Ferrara. Review belongs here! There's absolutely nothing more I can say. I thought I died and went to heaven. The best Cannoli in the world to me. The bakery is clean and full of delicious baked goods!! It's a small space but there's seating in front. I even found an electric plug. 

The employees are welcoming, smiling and listened to me raving in excitement. I told them I didn't realize I could come to the bakery here in Little Italy all year long. I always came to the Feast and had the Cannoli from the stand. 

The Cannoli's come in several flavors. I stick with the traditional. It's $4.25. You can't beat that price in Manhattan!  It's huge. Soo indescribably delicious!! I posted the price list in tips. Everything was reasonable to me. I saw a slice of Coconut Cake with my name on it. Next time. 

You won't hear a single negative comment about la Bella Ferrara Bakery from this Italian. When you visit NYC have the ultimate Little Italy experience by visiting here. Have a Cannoli. I'm coming back for more!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-04-03,3.0,"Stopped in here for some treats after lunch in Chinatown. They have quite the selection of cannolis, which was the main reason I visited. They have mini versions of everything, which is great if your like me- indecisive and really just want bites of things. 

I ordered the following minis- tiramisu and red velvet cannolis, a cream puff, and Italian cheesecake. I also had a cappuccino. It came to around $15 for all. 

The cannolis were a bit disappointing, as the filling wasn't an actual special flavor. It also wasn't standard cannoli filling, but more like delicious whip cream. Completely skip the Italian cheesecake. Dry and dense, was not good. The cappuccino was great!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-08-13,5.0,"A real gem.  The service was outstanding and personal.   We would come back just for the staff.  They are so much fun and helpful.  The pastries are top notch.  The lobster tail was absolutely exquisitely delectable.  The coffee was superb.  Our son loved the gelato.  Super fun, super delicious.  Give them a try."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-04-01,5.0,All I can say is WOW!  This place was incredibly awesome and frankly we where overwhelmed trying to figure out what to buy.  We went with classic Cannoli and a lobster tail.  All I can say is that they where seriously good.  Staff was very friendly.  I only wish I could have made it back to buy more.  Try it I don't think you'll be disappointed.
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-03-16,5.0,"So glad my friend recommended this place! Great cannolis and some fun options, even the choice between mini and regular sized. I liked that the shell was the perfect amount of crispiness but not too hard."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-07-29,4.0,"Joey and La Bella Ferrera were absolutely amazing in their customer service when my husband and I ordered our wedding cake from them. Our wedding was on 7/27/19. The price was beyond reasonable and they had no problem delivering the cake to La Nonna where we had our wedding celebration lunch. I emailed Joey a photo of what we wanted our cake to look like and it ALMOST looked like the photo. I took away one star only because we really wanted peonies on the cake since that was what we used for my bouquet and my husband's boutonnière but the flowers on our cake were definitely not peonies. Not even sure what they were lol. But either way, the cake still looked beautiful and tasted AMAZING. We went with a ""semi naked"" icing since my husband and I are not fans of icing and they did a great job with that. The cake was super moist and the cannoli filling was perfect. All of our guests were raving about the cake. Thank you Joey and staff for being so friendly, accommodating and making us a beautiful and delicious wedding cake!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-11-25,5.0,"The bakeries in Little Italy are superb!  Yes, they're a bit touristy than they were 30 years ago, but it serves the sweet tooth purpose for sure!  La Bella Ferrara is fantastic with their array of pastries! From the tiramisu, eclairs, Black/white cookies, and cannolis you'll be quite satisfied with the quality of their creations!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-07-12,5.0,I wanted to eat the whole bakery case! This place was everything I expected out of a bakery in Little Italy and more! What was crazy is that I accidentally left one of the cookies I bought out overnight in my hotel room and when I ate it in the morning it tasted even better than the ones I ate the night before! THAT'S how good this place was. The ladies behind the counter were also really nice! I hope to come back!
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-08-09,2.0,"I had their mini traditional cannoli. This was my first time having a cannoli, but it wasn't all that great. The moment I bit into it, it was way too sweet for my liking. It also tasted a bit plain and stale. I will say that I ate it a few hours after buying it to go, but it shouldn't have tasted so disappointing anyways. The cashier was nice, so that's why I'm giving two stars."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-05-06,4.0,"Delicious coffee and fresh pastries; great service! In tiny SRO-cafe counter.

We had a sfogliatella and chocolate cannoli to share."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-09-14,3.0,"Went to Little Italy so the bf could get his cannoli fix.

Found this place, and it looked very mom and pop. They had regular cannolis, and bigger sized ones as well. Plus tons and tons of other sweets and desserts.

We got: the original, red velvet, peanut butter, and the tiramisu.

They were okay. Kind of chewy. Peanut butter was the best flavor."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-04-28,5.0,"Damn good cannolis.  

I can't speak for much else as we only went there once.  But it was good.  Not crowded.  There was a table we could sit at with no wait."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-04-01,4.0,"Anywhere we go, you have to stop for some sweets. We saw this cute bakery in Little Italy and had to check it out. My sister spent a month going around Europe and missed the sweets so she just had to stop by. There's a huge variety of cookies. Correct me if I'm wrong but they charge the cookies by pound I believe. The cookies were wonderful. Not overly sweet and the price wasn't too steep either. Workers were more than happy to help and give recommendations on which cookies were their favorite."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-09-22,1.0,This place was awful. The items were not baked fresh and most of them even had MOLD on them in the case!!!!!!! That should have been enough for me to walk right out but I wanted to try something since this place was highly recommended by a coworker and I was in little Italy trying to get an experience of being there. I opted for a traditional cannoli. It was blah. The flavor was nothing special and I truly felt so disgusted after seeing the moldy desserts that I couldn't even enjoy it!! I would not recommend this place for anyone. There are many other dessert options you can try!
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2020-01-06,5.0,I had never tried a cannoli before and I can say I'm super stoked these were my first ones. They were super yummy and not over the top sweet. We tried four different flavors and they were all equally good. Especially the red velvet one. We also tried one of the mini eclairs and it was so good. I 100% recommend this place! Definitely try some of the different ones.
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-11-13,3.0,Good but better place in NYC that don't make a local scream. Rainbow cookies were a little dry.
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2017-10-15,4.0,"Skip the big commercialized/touristy Ferrara's down the street and come here to this tiny shop to get real old school Italian bakery treats. Especially if you are in the area and just want to grab some things to go.

This is one of those ""old school"" little bakeries located right at the end of Mulberry Street that is worth the trip. Even though it's only been around since 1970 it seems like it belongs from a more distant ""gangster"" era of NYC.

Yeah, we dropped in here to pick up some terrific butter cookies, cannolis, and anisette toast to go with our morning coffee. After enjoying some Dim Sum close by in Chinatown this was an easy stroll over. 

Decent prices too along with good quality."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-12-27,5.0,We loved our cannolis so much we went back the next night for more. Delicious. Overwhelming number of options.
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-12-15,5.0,"Best sweets in all of New York! Great service, tons of variations to each dessert. You won't be disappointed."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-09-14,2.0,Not a fan! Not sure who owns it anymore but definitely isn't what i remember. The number of sweets we had were no doubt altered. It just didn't have that yummy factor. Little Italy in general has just become commercialized.
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-09-20,4.0,"I wandered upon this place after dinner down the street, because I really wanted gelato. 

There happened to be a street fair happening at the time so instead of walking into the restaurant, they had a booth underneath a tent on the street. Obviously, in any situation like this, the presentation is not going to be as great as walking into the actual establishment. I must say though that their presentation was still pretty good. They had a simple selection of flavors, not a huge selection tho. Which ended up being great anyways! A lot of times when there are too many flavors, I can't make up my mind.

Another thing that I really thought was a great idea was that they have the amount of flavors you can get already figured out based on the size that you order.

If you get a small you can get two different flavors. If you get the next size up, THREE flavors and if you get a large size you can get up to four flavors! The cost between the different sizes I think is about $.25-$.50. 

Overall an excellent experience!!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2017-09-11,5.0,"After watching one of the youtubers talked about the Lobster tail, I must try it. The store is small and clean, it does have one small area that fits two people for you to eat but I assume that they prefer you buy your food and drinks and eat somewhere else. 

So the Lobster tail, it's 5.25 but it's hand-sized, good enough for my friend and I. This crispy pastry topped with icing sugar and filled with custard cream, is going to be in my Must-eat-while-traveling-to-NY-list. If you have tasted the puffs from beard papa, this Lobster tail is like 2-3x bigger as well as the amount of the custard cream, with a harder and crispier pastry. 

The youtuber said the Lobster tail is only available on Sundays with limited quantity, so good luck with that."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2017-10-12,3.0,"Stopped by to pick up some pastries to bring home after our dinner in Little Italy. 

I decided on a Lobster Tail, Napoleon, and a cannoli. 

My favorite was by far the Lobster Tail... the pastry was flaky and the filling delicious! 

The cannoli wasn't that great and the napoleon was ok. I was a little disappointed in the quality especially after what it cost for 3 pastries. I've gotten much better quality and value from my local Jersey spots... Nothing was bad just not that great..."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-09-28,5.0,"I am guilty of almost always getting the cannolis when I come here. Every time i am in NYC, i make sure to bring whoever I'm with to this bakery. In the heart of Little Italy and China Town, this bakery is an experience anybody who visits NYC should have!! 

The cannolis here are the best ones I have found... both in NY and outside of NY. I dont know what makes them so special, but they sure are special and so delicious. I just bought half a dozen and they flew with me across the country. While I have tried some of the other cannoli flavors offered, I still believe the best line is the classic ricotta flavored ones sprinkled with just a few chocolate chips!

All their baked goods are fresh and delicious, besides the cannolis I also recommend the lobster tails and their cakes. The coffee here is also made to order and a good deal for the size you get."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-01-06,5.0,The best bakery! We come back every year...such great staff and yummy baked goods. We will definitely be back again.
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-06-01,3.0,"Hubs and I came in late at night looking for sfogliatella - This place has a ton of options! I feel like they had a lot of food left considering how late in the day it was - I guess maybe they get a lot of people who go in for late night desserts? 

Anyway, he got a couple of sfogliatellas - One was stuffed and the other plain. He thought they were ok. I got an oreo cheese cake that was pretty good! 

This place is just a pastry counter pretty much, so no seating to speak of."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-11-28,5.0,"After finishing our pork bun snack in chinatown, my family and I decided to walk on over to little Italy for some dessert. We happened to stop by this little gem, and were excited. These cannolis were reasonably priced versus buying them elsewhere in the city, and they did not disappoint. They were very delicious and filling. I grabbed a traditional and a chocolate covered cannoli. They were both delicious! It was great because they had their gelato and cannolis displayed outside so we could just get a quick bite of a dessert without having to go inside. I will definitely have to come back here."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-01-14,5.0,"Wow. This was my first time trying cannolis and it really didn't disappoint me. 

We looked up where they had the best cannolis in Little Italy and La Bella Ferrara popped up so we obviously had to look at it. When we entered it was basically a pastry heaven. We got two big cannolis and went back and stored in the fridge for a little while and when we took our first bites, it was HEAVENLY. The filling and the outside crust was so delicious and I now know where to recommend for cannolis.

The store itself was just a typical pastry shop, but the workers there are extremely friendly. 

It is also a $10 credit card minimum so if you don't plan on buying the whole store, definitely bring some cash!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-05-24,2.0,"I came here twice during my 1st trip in NY because my boy friend loved the cannolis. Now here the second time, the woman who helped us had a terrible attitude. She rudely asked what we wanted and while we were picking our pastries she kept asking what else in an inpatient, annoyed manner. I understand one can have a bad day but one shouldn't take it out on people who had nothing to do with it. I found it upsetting, the sweets weren't great either... all in all consider your options before going here"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-10-13,4.0,"The place was excellent, came in late night around 10:30 for something to satisfy a sweet tooth and some coffee if possible. No coffee since the shop had already closed down, but when I asked for the best stuff they got, lady gave me a Lobster Tail. 

Incredibly puffy with a cream to die for, not overly sweet and had a smooth taste to die for.

It was expensive though for a treat-$5.25, but I'll comr back and try some other things."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-09-28,5.0,"Must have every time we're in NY. Lobster Tail + Canoli can't go wrong ever! A classic gem in Chinatown, coming in again for that shaved ice! Writing this at 2am as we eat away at our takeaway lobster tail!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-08-19,4.0,"This is one of our favorite Italian cookies places in NYC. We came here whenever we are in Chinatown. The mini cannolis are great. Not feeling guilty if you eat the whole thing coz it's mini lol
But I was they have more cookies with jam in it. We got some cookies today, we thought it's jam inside but all chocolate. :("
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-02-16,5.0,"Turning the corner from one ethnic block (Chinese to Italian) to another, you can feel the presence of difference. Knowing my days cuisine would be composed mainly of the earlier, I wanted to most on a traditional Italian treat or two before the debauchery.

Two Anise Biscotti, one to manja and one to carry home, a lovely conversation was struck up between the counter girl and I. She immediately knew that I was Italian and was engaging, super friendly and was an all around pleasure to spend a few moments with.

I couldn't help myself to the short order of two biscotti, so I ordered up two plain canoli and the filling inside? Oh My, that's what's gonna keep me coming back, and yes, the excellent coffee and wonderful company as well."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-07-19,4.0,Also thought this place was a bit overhyped BUT when in Little ITaly yagottaagetta Canoli!  Amiright or amiright??? Do it cause u can say u did it.  $Worthhhhh
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-12-10,5.0,"Best cannoli I've ever had.  Super crisp shells with a hint of cinnamon oil.  Cannoli filling is delicious, and not too sweet/not too cheesy.  Perfectly smooth, fresh.  Also tried the rainbow cake--it was phenomenal.  Will return to try more things in future!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-01-14,1.0,"WHAT THE @#!@ HAPPENED HERE? This used to be THE BEST Italian pastry shop in the city (and I've tried most of them). And as recently as this past summer, it was still amazing. 

But now something has changed. The hours have expanded dramatically, however that's nothing compared to the explosion in the sugar content of the pastries. The cannoli, tiramisu and eclair were so unbearably sweet that my teeth screamed out in pain after the first bite. Either the pastry chef spilled the entire carton of sugar while making today's batch or this place is under new ownership that has decided to mimic every other overly sweet dessert shop that is pandering to American's obsession with sugar. Unless I can learn it was the former, I shall not be returning!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-08-22,5.0,"Omg omg. So good. Not sure how else to describe it. I am someone who doesn't like cannolis... USUALLY until I tried one from here. I got the red velvet one. It was amazing. Also, got a scoop of coffee and a scoop of Oreo gelato... literally delicious. But the most tasty thing I got and devoured was a slice of the chocolate cheesecake.  so amazing. Will return whenever I come back to the city."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-05-31,1.0,Note: this review is based only on a rum baba and the staff. Neither is very pleasant. They did note there was management change.
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-07-18,5.0,They have many Italian options and service is so great! They take all major credit cards as well
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-03-26,5.0,Great afternoon stop for deserts and expresso. Table service was a nice break from a day of walking around. The lobster tail was amazing!!
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2018-11-16,5.0,"DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE! Where to start??!! Just taste a little bit of everything! The cannolis were to die for, as were these chocolate peanut butter cookies... and the chocolate eclairs... and the fruit tarts ... oh and the chocolate mousse! I'd be so fat if I lived near this place. They also had Jordan almonds which I haven't seen since like 1985! Excellent prices for NYC! I'm posting all the pics I took- I wished I could've tasted every since thing there. I cannot describe the incredible quality of the pastries. You just have to try it - that's all I can say. Also, the staff was very patient as I asked a million questions about the different fillings in various cannolis (traditional ricotta vs. Bavarian cream vs. chocolate peanut butter...). Get a latte and just say screw the diet! You only live once!"
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-08-22,5.0,"This is a great stop and go pastry shop. It's my favorite cannoli spot. They have miniatures of everything so if you aren't that hungry but want a small dessert it's perfect. The cheesecake is so good I got the strawberry one and I highly recommend it. The cannolis are also very good, however, the one from inside the shop is better than the ones sold outside. It may be due to the weather so the ones outside were exposed to more moisture."
16,la-bella-ferrara-cafe-new-york,2019-12-20,5.0,"Love Ferrara. As out of state New Yorkers, we come every year and always take back home a box of Italian butter cookies. Thank you for your fresh and tasty sweet treats."

I passed this place a few times (usually in a hurry) but couldn't spot the name because its floral & rustic decor really does mask it like an urban backyard. But FINALLY, I got to stop by a few weeks ago when I was in the area with a friend waiting to get our yoga sesh on. This place is adorable (check YES for Instagrammable) & is perfect for people grabbing a cup of joe with a friend. Walking in reminds me of entering an adult version of Alice in Wonderland. Their cupcakes are decorated like succulents. Their lattes are colorful & delicious and are plated in cute cups/mugs. If only I could take this place home with me so I can just lounge around here in my sweats (would be kinda nice during this stay-at-home order with Covid, huh?). Welp, guess I'm going to have to go back after this lockdown is over! ;)"

The sesame croissant is light and definitely has a lot of sesame flavor. 
Definitely a must go!!!"

I never noticed they had baked good IDK how I could have missed this. Need to recheck my prescription lens HAHA. It so happened to be a coworker birthday and IT WAS A SIGN, i had to get 1, but as I read the choices  THEY HAD A VEGAN ONE ... with my name all over it. ANOTHER SIGN!

The first time I came it was super packed and they sold out their cute cup cake as well. So I decide to give another try next time.
This time I came here, it was raining day. Lucky enough, I got the seat and I got the cup cake too!!

Drink- rose matcha latte, very good. Little sweet and you can taste rose flavor in it. And it match so well. Coz I had terrible experience of rose latte that has artificial taste. This one I highly recommend! And it was very pretty too with dry rose on the top.

Cupcake-  it was the cutest ever. 3 flavors, chocolate, vanilla, and red velvet. I got chocolate and red velvet. The bottom cake was pretty good, but the cup too part was really sweet. And each of this is $3. Not cheap. But love the design too much.

Definitely coming back to try other drink and dessert too!"

Great place for a quick coffee, insta-worthy caffeine-fueled post, and tasty baked treats. The seating is limited, and shop is legitimately tiny. However, if you can stop by when it's not too busy, this is a fun place to stay and chat while sharing a beautiful coffee, blooming tea, and a succulent cake (or almond croissant or golden egg tart, you see where I'm going). The lattes are strong and floral flavors (if added) pair well. I can't wait to return here again soon"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-01-23,5.0,"This coffee shop is pristine. Tiny, but beautifully decorated and seems very eco-friendly in practice and aesthetics. There is a heavy plant/floral theme.
Our beverages were excellent. My rose latte was carefully made and delicious.
There were people doing work in here but there's also only a few tables/chairs so not ideal for staying for a while.
Aside from coffee/tea, they offer some pastries as well as reusable, non-plastic alternatives."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,"Quaint coffee shop that really makes you want to cozy up inside with its wooden decor, strategically placed greenery, and 6 measly seats. Baristas are super friendly, and know their drinks. Their cupcakes are baked in store and artistically decorated with cactus and flowers. As for their other baked goods, they come from bibble & sip and a few other manhattan bakeries. I had their pumpkin spice latte for 5.75 which is pricy, but definitely worth it as a treat - pretty sure they put pumpkin puree to give it that wow factor. Their small cupcakes are $3, but understandable thanks to the decoration. Is this cafe pricy? Sure, but worth the penny if you're staying until you need to pee. 

All they're missing is a bathroom, and the seating situation is definitely a pro and a con here... Can't wait to come back for a date or to simply catch up with a friend if I'm able to snag a seat again :)."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-12-23,5.0,"I saw this place on Instagram and it looked sooo aesthetic, so I wanted to check it out. 

The inside is small but very cutely decorated. I'm not sure if this place would be suitable for working (like a Starbucks).

I got the Ube Latte and it tasted amazing! It wasn't too sweet and it looked really pretty. I highly recommend you try it.

I also got two cupcakes. One was the flourless one and I can't remember the other flavor, but I like the flourless chocolate one waaay better. The cupcake designs are also insane! They're so pretty and definitely looked like it took a lot of time and effort."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-03-04,5.0,"Not a sweet tooth gal but I was intrigued with the designs of the little cupcakes. Greeted with friendly staff which make it easier to order with no pressure. I like the coziness of the decor and every corner of the design is welcoming. I surprised my little angles with cute cupcakes...their smiles warm my heart a million time. Definitely worth the money!

Note: not too sweet and the frosting did not taste heavy or greasy. Loved it!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-10-14,5.0,"As a price-conscious eater, I don't always go out to get a coffee. But when I do, I make sure that I'm supporting a local business and not a coffee chain. I saw Urban Backward when I was in the neighborhood. I was immediately attracted by the hipster vibes and eco-friendly decorations this lovely coffee place radiates. I ordered an almond milk iced-latte ($5.5). The coffee was served in a glass bottle and wooden (or bamboo) straw! +1 for being eco-conscious. 
I sat down to study for several hours. This place is perfect for studying as it's small so it can't house too many people. Just a few tables, and electric outlets (yay!). They also play indie songs which I appreciate because it's my favorite music genre. I was there for 2-3 hours and was never pressured to leave. So thank you!!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-02-24,5.0,"Earthy and hippy, this hole in the wall cafe close to Little Italy has us hooked. And what's not to love? Yummy yummy cupcakes and macaroons? Check. Priced reasonably (something most bakeries these days lack)? Check. Cool calming tones with lots of plans inside? Check. Instagram-able place and food? Check. Girl behind the counter who completes you on your jumpsuit? Check. 

This place is so chill to go grab some yummy bites and yes they're cute as hell, but even better is the pricing and the taste. It's not overly sweet like most cupcakes with tons of icings. It's well balanced and the macaroons were baked to perfection. Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with a nice hit of natural flavors. 

They sell out early on weekends so be sure to go ahead of time. They just had one cupcake left by the time we got there."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-02-02,4.0,"So cute and so eco friendly! Yummy drinks with a focus on environmental sustainability. Plus adorable cupcakes! I've had the rose matcha latte that was lovely and had a cute little flower. Also tried the Ube Latte that was ube with steamed milk (you can add an espresso shot). It was not too sweet, nice and creamy. A warm afternoon treat. Cute succulent cupcakes, had a red velvet vegan and a gluten free chocolate one. Super adorable. GF chocolate one was pretty much a brownie. A bit pricy for what it is ($3 each) but good for the instagram shot! Interior is also really cute and quite small."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-12-16,5.0,"Omg love this place!! The girl at the register was so nice and helped me pick a new fun drink while giving me recommendations. I got an iced lavender latte with almond milk and drank it in approximately 1.2 sips. It was SOOO good. 

I always want to be that alluring person that slowly sips my coffee while peering over my glasses in an aloof yet endearing manor, but I'm the person that comes in like a bull in a China shop, trips over the garbage and throws an entire latte back like a farmer with a canteen. 

Anyway, the shop is so so so cute, I absolutely LOVE the decor. Like a refreshing little garden! Seating is TIGHT but worth it. Would definitely be nice to sit outside during the summer. 

Overall love the shop and the coffee! Will def be back!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-07-09,5.0,"Urban Backyard is a beautiful tiny coffee shop in lower Manhattan. There's open-air seating in the front and a few small tables inside the narrow space. Plants hang throughout the cafe with lights appropriately positioned throughout. It's a great cafe to snap a photo at. 

The coffee itself is good. My latte was perfectly creamy. They sell a variety of pastries as well. There's a glass jug of cold water in the front for guests."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-02-11,5.0,"NYC's cutest cafe? In a tiny Nolita space.

Urban Backyard has pastries, cakes, coffee and specialty drinks. Its wild plants, vintage furniture and the atmosphere make your shoulders sink in and make you want to sit back and relax. 

The food and drinks are on point, and the whole setting makes you wonder, if this is the cutest spot you'll ever come by or ever get to experience to be in. 

I went with my friend who showed me the place and I just couldn't make up the mind of what to get because of how adorable and amazing everything looked. 

We ended up getting vegan dark chocolate cupcakes with Hibiscus Tea that blossoms which was so beautiful on its own. I am definitely going back for sure and so worth it to check it out anyone who enjoys simple but beautiful things at the same time. 

It's definitely not as pricey, they have very nice and friendly stuff as well."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-12-15,5.0,"Their baked goods are almost to pretty too eat! The lavender chai latte was delicious. Stop in, grab a tiny cupcake and enjoy it with a warm cup of joe."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-05-31,4.0,"A very sweet and precious cafe with lots of greenery and a mere handful of seats inside.  Their offerings are specialty coffee and teas and little colorful macarons and beautifully displayed mini cupcakes decorated with teeny tiny succulents.  Perfect for teeny tiny ladies with teeny manicured hands with an indie bent.  

Their iced matcha was good."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-05-28,5.0,"Urban Backyard will probably be one of my new playgrounds. The aesthetics was amazing and lively. This place reminds me a lot of Bali coffee shops, where there are tons of green and the interior design was carefully thought out. 

Aside from the decor, their drinks are amazing. The Ube Latte instantly caught my eye as I've never had Ube Latte before. As I took my 1st Sip, I instantly knew this was perfection. My brother took a sip and was also surprise of how flavorful this latte was. 

The menu is full of tasty lattes and drinks. I will definitely come back here and make my way down the list of all the lattes. 

Props to the owner as I think you have done it correctly!!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-04-21,5.0,"Such a cute and lovely cafe! They have a variety of drinks and pastries. I tried their macaron and it was absolutely delicious. There are small and large macarons and I recommend the bigger ones. My friend tried Rose Latte and it looked super good. I might try it next time. 

The staff was friendly and welcoming. It's so tiny and there are only 2 tables. No bathroom. Cozy and nice atmosphere. 

I will come back!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-10-27,5.0,"Urban Backyard consistently have one of the cutest store fronts in New York City. They seem to change their storefront every season, and I am loving it all. Along with their little snacks and drinks, they also sell succulents, reusable cups, reusable straws, and other small items. I had their rose latte which I thought was pretty decent. As a heads up, they do not have that many seats inside. I'll probably be back again to try other items on their menu and hope to be lucky enough to snag seats for next time as well."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-03-23,5.0,"Tucked away in the edge of little italy and Soho, this adorable cafe is a place of instagram dreams. Curated teas and knickknacks line the shelves. The drink list include the hot item of the season - ube latte. The true MVPs are these adorable bite size cupcakes with amazing succulent icing. The details of the icing are truly a work of art. We also tried the giant macarons and were not disappointed. The honey lavender and champagne came highly recommend and were delicious! 

5/5 would come again. 

Pro-tip: there is a little stoop outside which will be perfect for people watching during warmer weather !"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-10-12,5.0,"DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE. Hands down some of the best coffee beverages I've ever had. EVER. I'm a #BasicBeyotch in the fall. Therefore I love pumpkin spice lattes. They use REAL purée (not syrupy crap like THAT CHAIN FROM SEATTLE). I also got it made with oat milk, which was the icing on the cake. Worth every penny. I would channel my inner Jason Biggs from American Pie and f**k it if I could. Can't wait to come back"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-09-11,5.0,This place is great! It's just like chilling in your back yard. The staff here is great! The coffee is just amazing. I got the ube latte and I'm sad I didn't know about this spot sooner. If you want good coffee nice music and a friendly staff stop in.
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-10-23,4.0,"I am pretty picky when it comes to expensive coffees and teas, but this place is great! 
Such a great atmosphere, and great baristas. They were super kind and attentive. They have a ton of regulars who love it, I could tell. Good vegan options and all their flavors are homemade! 
I had the chai mocha and my friend had the lavender chai. Both we were delicious and so beautifully prepared (I appreciate good aesthetics). In a great area of soho and super cute atmosphere, I sat and worked there for a couple hours. 
A little pricey, but yummy!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-08-18,5.0,"Cute little place with amazing coffee prepared by a humble and welcoming barista. 

Me and my wife were nearby, tired and low on caffeine. So went to this place after quickly checking the yelp ratings and pictures posted by fellow reviewers and I would say we were not disappointed at all.

The barista was welcoming and helped us making selections. For example when we ordered Macchiato, she told us that it's going to be just espresso and steamed milk. We also ordered a hot lavender latte. Both the drinks came out great; although after seeing someone getting a purple latte, I wished I had ordered one :)

The ambiance was earthy with lots of plants. Seating is quite limited though. We had to wait before any of the seats were available but it wasn't too long before we got one.

Overall, highly recommended."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-01-19,4.0,great place to grab coffee and go unless you're lucky enough to get a chair or table. The coffee here is pretty good and the pasty selection is decent. In terms of the vibe- it's really cute and cozzy. So many coffee photo opportunities.
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,So good and creative! I loved they made these flower cupcakes in house and they tasted differently. The sugar coating wasn't frosting and bad the perfect sweetness.
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,"Coffee and food made with love.
Try the different lattes they have. We tried the golden matcha and lavender latte, both were excellent. We had chocolate croissant and avocado bagel which were good as well. The crossiant was definitely much better."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-01-06,5.0,The staff are really friendly. This coffee shop is pretty small..there is only about 6 seats available inside. The outside of the shop is really cute for a photo op. I ordered a lavender latte. It tasted good. I'm glad I stepped in!
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-12-10,5.0,"Gloomy winter days require some Latte Love  This Rose  Latte is my best new discovery in SoHo. It was creamy, earthy with just the right amount of Rose flavor. The mini vegan vanilla cupcake was cute AF. I would like to pretend like I thought it was too pretty to eat but naaahhhh that's never the case for me  I gobbled it up in two bites  The thing is, its not just a cute cafe , they have strong ethics as well. They believe in sustainability and eco consciousness. I love that they had a lot of information about it on the walls along with no plastic products in sight. I came around a Friday afternoon so it wasn't too crowded, but yes it's a snug spot , like many similar cafes in New York. But Tbh that latte makes up for everything. Definitely coming back here soon to try their Lavender Latte !!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-01-04,5.0,"Enjoyed a red velvet cupcake with icing shaped like succulents and a Rose Latte. Not a lot of room inside, but there's a little spot to sit outside if the weather permits"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-07-12,5.0,"I learned about this place when a couple of friends mentioned that they had gone here and had a nice time. I decided to give it a try and see for myself. I noticed immediately that they have a wonderful ambiance and it really pleasing to be here. The staff is wonderful and very nice. I had the Lavender Latte and Cactus Cream cupcake, wonderful! They used bamboo straw to reduce plastic. A great place to enjoy tea time outside with internet connection. Would definitely come back."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-01-15,5.0,"Small, quaint, eco-conscious AND eco-friendly, and staffed with sweet people. Love this place. Worth the trip and price. Serendipitously found this spot and now I try to come whenever I am in the area.

I had the lavender latte with almond milk, which definitely had amazing relaxing benefits. I also tried their adorable vegan vanilla cupcakes which had very intricately decorated cacti and succulents! Too cute to even eat, but someone had to do it.

Aside from the vibe and aesthetic of this small coffee shop, I love this coffee shop because of its eco-conscious presence. They take time to explain alternatives (ie: bamboo straws and toothbrushes) and just promote a consciousness that every business can learn from."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-05-19,5.0,"So I bookmarked this place a while back but never went. My friend was telling me about this cafe she went for a whole week straight, and boom, it was Urban Backyard. 

The little cafe is so cozy, I love the nature feel to it. Their staffs are so friendly and very helpful when I couldn't decide between 2 drinks. 

I got the matcha latte with soy, and tried the honey rose tea later on. Both drinks are very delicious. 

Overall, I will be returning!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-05-13,5.0,"Urban Backyard is a small and lovely cafe. This neighborhood cafe is eco-conscious and filled with lovely houseplants, succulents, and cacti. The beautiful array of plants lured me in, but the friendly staff and eco-conscious message displayed throughout the cafe kept me coming back. My friend loves their lavender and rose latte, and I enjoy their cold brew and iced black coffee very much. Although I have never ordered it, they do have blooming teas that look very beautiful. They have a variety of cupcakes (made in house, vegan options available), and baked pastry goods. My only complaint is that they can be a little more liberal with their cream cheese spread, but their portioning is definitely more health conscious than what I have in mind. They also offer vegan cream cheese for all you lactose intolerant friends out there :)

This cafe is very small, with only 3 tables that fit a 2-3 people and an adorable outdoor seating area. The small space is utilized very well and the openness of the cafe is good and bad because the airflow is great, but the noise pollution from outside might be excessive at times. The staff is incredibly friendly and always smiling, which adds to the pleasantness of the cafe environment. 

Many cafes turn me off because of their excess use of plastic straws and cups, but Urban Backyard is very eco-friendly. They offer a discount if you bring your own cup and accompanied with every drink is either a hay straw or a bamboo straw. They sell beeswax wraps, bamboo cutlery, shopping bags, bamboo straws, and other reusable goods that I find myself ordering online, but now I will simply purchase at their cafe to reduce my own carbon emission. 

I have recommended this place to a few friends, and I hope this review brings fellow yelpers to this place!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-12-01,4.0,"Super cute little cafe with beautiful decor inside and lots of different latte options. I ordered their lavender latte and the presentation was beautiful. Perfect balance of the lavender flavor with coffee. However, the only thing I wish I took out were the little lavender leaves they put inside the cup for aesthetics. I was constantly spitting out the lavender since I didn't like biting into it. But other than that, would recommend their lavender lattes here!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-08-20,4.0,"This coffee shop is so cute! The coffee is also really good and the menu has a lot of interesting choices that seem like they would be pretty good too. 

Only downside is that it can definitely be pretty cramped in here, and I wish there was more seating."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2018-10-30,4.0,"This cafe is super cute! I am not going to lie. It is in Little Italy and its a super small place but super cozy. 

I haven't tried the drinks but I came for the succulent cupcakes and I must say, they were VERY DRY. It's pretty much for the aesthetics. I only took one star off for that. I will come back for the drinks next time I visit. 

I would def recommend this place since it is super cute and, if you want it for the gram, I say go for it. :) Just don't have high expectations for the cupcakes."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-10-10,5.0,"This is the cutest little coffee shop! Everything, from the cupcakes & drinks, to the decor was just so well done. I had a golden latte, my brother a masala chai and my husband a vanilla latte. They were all delicious! The turmeric in mine wasn't overwhelming, it was made perfectly. We all shared a small cupcake, just to taste, because I couldn't walk out without buying one. I don't know when I'll get a chance to come back, but I wholeheartedly would recommend this place!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-11-12,3.0,It's a very cute place. The drinks are okay and the cupcakes nothing special. Really like the hay straw. Environmental friendly. The decoration and the decoration for the cupcakes are really cute. Definitely reccomend anyone to come and try it if they are around the neighborhood.
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-04-18,5.0,"Beautiful tiny coffee shop!! I tried the lavender latte and the cherry blossom macaroon, and they were both delicious! The decoration is very nice and also very good service. Perfect for having a coffee with a friend :) just one, cause it only has 3 tables for 2 people, so it's really small!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-10-20,4.0,"Pretty and nice place . But I guess I was in the wrong time . Because when I ordered my hot chocolate,  it was cold . Disappoint about that ."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-08-30,5.0,"Absolutely beautiful little creations! I almost didn't want to eat the cupcakes because of how wonderfully crafted they were. But, after tasting one, I immediately put the remainder into my mouth. The taste lives up to the aesthetic.

I also got to try the matcha yuzu-ade and the rose matcha latte. Both were delicious and refreshing with the matcha yuzu being slightly unwieldly to drink as the yuzu chunks get stuck in your straw. The matcha rose latte delivered on presenting both of these subtle, earthy flavors without having them overpower each other. 

My only complaint would be how limited the seating is, and how it is unfortunate that there is not room to add any more."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-12-27,5.0,Such a cute small coffee shop with the best lattes and mini cupcakes! It's the perfect place for a photoshoot. It's a pretty small place so I definitely recommend going early to get a spot!
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-02-19,5.0,"I daily walk past 4 coffee shops to get to UB. Great coffee, consistently good - equally important. Relaxed and intimate atmosphere, beautiful cupcakes, friendly and professional people!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-04-01,5.0,"This place is very charming! It's tiny with minimal seating, but if you're lucky to grab a seat, it is such a relaxing experience.

I love the Honey Rose tea and it's delicious. The macarons and everything croissant are my go-tos. They have a selection of vegan pastries as well.

The employees are always really nice as well. 

It's easy to pass by this place, as it's kind of hidden and small, but don't skip it! 

They have an adorable outside seating nook as well for when it's nice out!!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-09-08,5.0,"My favorite new coffee shop! Lots of vegan options to drink and eat, water for fur babies too. And most importantly, super nice and friendly staff."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-10-06,4.0,"Great oat milk latte! It was my first time in NYC and apparently the city that never sleeps also doesn't caffeinate quite as early as the west coast! I walked around for about an hour before I found an open coffee shop. This place is cute, lots of plants and sustainable cups/straws around. The oat milk latte I had was PERFECT. Highly recommend."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-02-19,1.0,"It is very small. It has a hippy following and ambiance. Even beyond those setbacks, I could not recommend. The latte I had was weak at best and barely warm. The sweet bread was dry not moist as it should have been. A disappointment and no where to sit to write this review. Could be a 4 star place or even 5 if the coffee was good."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-08-05,5.0,"What a gem. My friends recently ordered their gender reveal cake from here, and they let me know how cute it is. I am an avid coffee shop worker in the summer, and have been to MANY but this one is surely at the top. The place is tiny and not a lot of seating but I snagged a spot outside surrounded by plants and on this super comfy outdoor chair with pillows. The person working was super friendly and made THEE most delicious lavender latte! Be warned there are 2 shots of espresso in it! I felt so relaxed and the weather was perfect, the tiny outdoor seat was in the shade anyway. I will be back."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-10-18,5.0,It was my first time visiting and I was really excited because everything was just so pretty and detailed. There were no tables available so I came back later. The baristas were super nice and everything was just so perfect. It's really tiny so you'll have a hard time finding a table but it's worth waiting in my opinion.
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-07-12,4.0,"What a cute, unique café. It is beautiful inside and small. Like your secret hideout place where you can sit back and enjoy coffee and other treats. Now, the coffee is very strong and just to my liking. I have been to places where the coffee is watered down but this is strong and woke me right up. Actually, as soon as I walked into the place, the smell of coffee made me feel awake. The employees here are friendly and make you feel at home."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2020-02-05,5.0,Oh my goodness. My absolute favorite spot in all of the United States of America. The cupcakes are so yummy and the rose latte is a must! Love the owners and everyone that works here is so lovely. Shout-out to Cindy and Mark
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-02-19,5.0,"This place is so cute. Love the theme and the interiors! 

The seating is very limited but customers were really friendly and willing to share their table!"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2018-11-14,4.0,"On the gentrification of Chinatown and Little Italy: When waiting for my sister to finish work and go home, I told her, I'll just find a small cafe to study and wait. She asked where would I go? I looked up this place and said, oh it looks like there's a cute little cafe called Urban Backyard. To which she replied, UGH, GOSH... Sounds really nice. 

I feel so conflicted about places like this, because I love it, but I also know it is these changes that further drives the prices of the shops in Chinatown up. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE NYC Chinatown, but the gentrification is a small problem (Still one of the more authentic original chinatowns in the country). YET -- I love some of the hipster shops that have moved in, especially since I have taken up the habit of coffee and reading out of the house or library. 

On to the actual place:

This is a cute cafe that has limited seating (also known has below the seating limit to require bathrooms, so make sure you have an empty bladder). The pastries are amazing, and unbelievably cute as well!  Their coffee drinks are very good, and quite strong. 

Another little bit to love about this place, they taught me about the existence of straw straws -- straws made from hay. Blew my mind."
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-03-18,5.0,"Such a cute small coffee shop, great place for working or studying
I got the iced coffee and a brownie, stayed there for a couple hours to catch up on work and had such a pleasant time"
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-01-08,5.0,This was the cutest and best coffee shop I've been to in a while!! I had a hot chocolate with soy milk and it was sooo delicious and creamy  I also got two of the vegan cupcakes and they were so delicious-- not to mention they were SO beautifully decorated. The staff was so nice and helpful and I enjoyed my visit there so much. The outdoor seating area is to die for. I can't say enough good things about this place! I want to revisit next time I'm in New York
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-08-22,5.0,My favorite cafe in the city. Absolutely perfect decor and good coffee. I had an oat milk latte. They also have beautiful succulent-themed succulent cakes.
17,urban-backyard-new-york,2019-04-05,5.0,"This neighborhood addition is magic. Coffee. Ahmazing. Pastries. Perfection

The atmosphere is zen & its such a great use of the the tiny space. So well designed & lots of love in there u can feel it. Smiling baristas...what a concept & my go to caffeine station. Lucky us."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2020-03-22,5.0,"Honestly, coffee shops with wifi and comfortable seating and all those things are cool, but there is nothing like a deliciously sweet cup of coffee from a place like Golden Steamer. 

I take the time to write a few reviews during this global pandemic, to really look back on my favorite places in NYC and offer some words of thanks to the beautiful memories of cuisine they've offered my palate over the years. 

Pumpkin Bao's and coffee, (I even dip them in the coffee - not sure if that's okay but if you're a dunker, you'll love this place), walk over to the park on Grand St. and watch the kids play basketball and handball and enjoy what it means to be alive and enjoying life in NYC - for about $2.50."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2020-05-31,5.0,"The pumpkin buns from Golden Steamer- teehee, the name makes me giggle a little for some reason- are one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. We got a to-go box of six (just $6), and they reheat easily at home in a steamer basket over a pot of boiling water. The texture and flavor of the bun itself are perfect, and the pumpkin filling is creamy and sweet-but-not-too-sweet. We had these as an accompaniment to a savory meal, but I can easily see how these would be awesome with coffee, or maybe even with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Will 10000% be going back for more of these."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2020-02-11,4.0,"Golden Steamer is the bun place I go to every time I come to Chinatown.  Their ""Dai Bao"" literally meaning Big Bun is exactly as implied.  Filled with meaty  morsels and vegetables, it's a meal all by itself.  Typically I would buy 3 or 4 of the frozen packs (comes with 4) and bring them back for friends and family.  They have other buns here too of course like their super popular but limited supply carrot bun and chicken bun.  

What makes them so good?  This is all they do.  Buns.  And they're pretty damn good at it."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2020-01-28,5.0,"I love coming here for their baked pork buns! They are the mini ones too. I always come here for the buns and no where else. They are sold 3 for $1.50. It has a good amount of fillings in the middle. My boyfriend enjoys them a lot as well. Great price! They have steam pork buns as well.

They sell egg tarts, sesame balls, and other bake goods. For the buns, they come in mini size and are 3 for $1.50. Same thing for the sesame balls and egg tarts. I like their egg tarts as well. The crust wasn't too much and they are soft. The sesame balls are nice and crispy too. 

Come here for mini pork buns!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-12-29,4.0,"This place was a lot smaller than I imagined it to be. There were just 3 seats, in which only 2 were usable. Everything was very reasonably priced. I liked the pumpkin bao the most. If you have a sweet tooth, egg custard bao will satisfy that. Pork bao had only small quality of meat in it. I took a ton of baos for take out, kept in fridge and had for the next week. If planning to take beyond a week, they recommend freezing it. Steam for 8 minutes and tasty bao ready. They make bao fresh. So the bao is not refrigerated when purchasing. I bought it in the morning, and reached home only in the  night. But the bao stayed fresh."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-10-19,4.0,"Great place and a little difficult to find as it's located in a very busy street on the weekends with a bunch of grocery markets selling fish, nuts, etc.

This place is famous for $1 steamed roast pork buns and it really is phenomenal for what you get. The service is very quick here, but don't feel too rushed to order when you want. I believe if you want the buns on the side. Usually, line isn't too long (~3-5 people). I will note that the multiple times that I have ordered the steamed pork buns, they are very hit or miss in terms of meat to bun ratio but predominantly are leaning towards more meat. 

I also order a lot of the iced tea/coffee mix which is around ~$2 - the caffeine tastes slightly stronger than normal which is what I prefer, but don't expect too high of quality for a place this cheap for that drink. 

Funny Story: One time I came here I tried to practice my Chinese and I spent so much time thinking about how to order my items in Chinese that I completely forgot to ask if they could replace with skim milk and don't add sugar, but I completely forgot because I kept trying to think about how to speak in Chinese!! Oh well, and on another visit, I found that they don't offer skim milk :/ Still check it out though!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-08-22,5.0,"I came here the first time in 2017, after my cousin's recommendation during our visit to NY!! She said she had a crazy friend who would drive all the way from Boston to NY for 4 hours just to pick up some food in Chinatown and then go home! And of course, her friend always picked up buns from Golden Steamer!!

The place was not hard to find, and I was impressed by rows and rows and rows of buns boxes!! I got bun with BBQ pork inside and egg custard buns!! OMG!! They are sooo good!! They are so good that every time I have friends who come to NY, I would ask them to pick up some egg custard buns for me!!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-09-02,3.0,"I'm honestly torn between giving Golden Steamer a 3 vs a 4 star rating. The first time I came, I got a roast pork bun which was quite generous with the filling. The sauce that was inside the bun was not overpowering, and the chunks of pork were a good size. 

However, the second time around I ordered two steamed buns: a red bean, and a custard. I love red bean buns, and this one really disappointed me. This bun was probably 10% filling, 90% dough. While the dough of the bun was fluffy and tasty, with a slightly sweet aftertaste, there was just too much of it! The custard bun was more enjoyable, with a better filling to bun ratio. Despite this, I still felt quite disappointed. 

I would probably come back again to Golden Steamer, but I'd definitely not get my hopes up as it seems to be kind of hit or miss experience."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-04-10,5.0,"We wandered in between watching 象棋 at Columbus Park and walking around Wing On Wo.

The 南瓜包 (pumpkin bun) here is mostly pillowy, fluffy, dough with some creamy sweet pumpkin in the middle. You can get them fresh out of the steamer to eat right away, or take a box of six home to steam yourself and eat later. They're good either way, and I'm hoping to come back and try the other flavors."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-08-10,2.0,"My previous review was before I revisited this place a few days ago. The last time I went was 5 years ago. It's sad to see that the pumpkin bun has gone downhill. 
There is WAY too much dough and not enough filling. The filling is not evenly spread throughout the bun. The first half of it you eat is just plain dough. I was going to just get rid of it, but I decided to pick at it and tear it apart. Only then did I reach a generous amount of pumpkin filling. But it didn't taste as good as I remembered.
Really sad that it's become this way."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-11-19,5.0,"When you're looking for Golden Steamer (and you should be)- you'll probably walk by it 2-3 times. Or maybe that's just be, but it's a tiny tiny storefront unnoticeable with all the hustle and bustle of chinatown around it.

However, FIND IT. When you do, you'll be paying anywhere from 50 cents to a dollar for the best steamed buns ever. Seriously, I was blown away by both the prices and the flavor choices and how damn good they are. I got the salted egg yolk and the pork (in hindsight I wish I had ordered like all of them) and they warmed them up for me and I ate them on the go. Some people have noted that there isn't a lot of meat filling, but you can see from my picture I didn't have that problem! They also have packages of 4 or 6 available to buy that you can take home and heat up, and some other pastries and baked goods. 

My total came to $1.20, seriously, for some of the best eats ever."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-03-27,4.0,"Tried their pumpkin buns and it was really delicious! The bun is large but so yummy - it got a nice pumpkin flavor. A little bit similar to the custard bun but not as sweet.
Also got some bbq pork bun and pineapple buns for the 3 for $1.5 deal. Well worth it though not very impressive.
Popular items run out at the end of day so arrive early."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-04-10,4.0,"I love the golden steamer and always find an excuse to stop by when I'm in Chinatown! It's a tiny shop, easy to walk by, but once you're inside you can buy the best steamed buns around. They sell freshly steamed individual buns as well as multi-packs that you can bring home and steam yourself. I always get the Egg Custard Bun for $1, which really can't be beat. My one complaint is that it's somewhat hit and miss with how much they fill the buns. I've had ones that were bursting with hot, sweet custard and some with a tiny spoonful buried in a mound of dough. Either way this spot is on my list of Chinatown essentials."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2020-02-22,5.0,Finally had their egg York steam bun!  This is the best egg yolk  steam bun that I've so far! They are not stingy with their egg Yolk at all! Strongly recommending this place if you're a big fan of egg yolk stuff
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-10-06,5.0,Best pork bun you can ever get in Chinatown. Quick tip - they have some frozen if you want to share with friends and fam!
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-07-29,5.0,"I can't make up my mind about which of these buns I like better. The trifecta of steamed buns: Salted Egg Yolk, Egg Custard, and Pumpkin. 

By far the best steamed bun in NYC."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2020-02-22,5.0,Really enjoyed the pumpkin and roast pork buns! We ordered the 6 packs to go as well and used a steamer at home and it tasted just as good! Planning to come back and stock up and maybe explore some other buns. The quality and texture of the buns was super good. Thinking about my next trip there!
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2020-02-25,5.0,This place was bookmarked in my yelp account and I finally got to try their buns. I had five different kinds of them and all of them were just so yummy. Right out of the steamer and just perfect. The ladies working there were also very helpful. I'd definitely go back.
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-02-21,5.0,"Literally one of the best ""bang for your buck"" places I've ever been to in all of NYC!

I had the chance to try Golden Steamer after discovering in the depths of Yelp and I'm SO HAPPY I did. This is definitely a hole in the wall type of place though, but if you're able to make the trek and step inside you're definitely bound for a world of nicely steamed buns that'll fill you to your hearts content.

I had the opportunity to visit on a Saturday afternoon around 4 PM. They have an assortment of buns that you can choose from. Half being more on the sweeter side, and the other being more of the meat-heavy variety. When it came time to order I ended up going with the Pumpkin, Salted Egg Yoke, and BBQ buns. All costing me around $2.90 as the final total. It definitely is true that just THREE of these can fill you up quick. If you're looking for something tasty and filling, definitely go with the meat-heavy options.

The service was also fast and efficient. They let us know if they didn't have something we requested and gave us time to pick a different option. 

When it comes to space though you're better getting these to go. They literally only have three seats adjacent to their right wall, so unless you're lucky enough to nab those you're going to be left standing. No worries though! They sell their buns in packages as well that you're able to take home and heat up. If anything I'd grab a few and head back home where you can also enjoy the goodness of a warm bun after popping it in the microwave for about 30 seconds. 

Overall a great spot to grab some QUALITY buns. I'll definitely be returning whenever I get the chance - aka whenever I'm at least one subway stop away."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-05-10,4.0,"I was surprised to see a C on their door, but a near failing grade did not deter me from walking in. I usually shriek from the sight of a letter that is not an A or B, so for me to walk in through a door, in Chinatown, with a borderline score affixed to it means something: their buns are damn awesome! I usually go for a box of large roast pork buns (for which they also have mini versions of), since I can go through 1 or 2 a day (yes, I am a fatarse). However, I've also tried other assortments of buns and love them all, including the mini ""roasted"" buns (versus the white ""steamed ones""). They sell drinks as well, but I'd probably stick with the buns and buns only.  Minus a star for the unfriendliness, dingy looking store and the C, but you still pass with 4 stars in my book :)."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-02-20,4.0,"Wow, if you're looking for a super delicious, filling and cheap meal look no further. Really not kidding about the filling and cheap part (got three amazing buns... pumpkin, salted egg yolk and bbq pork for a total of $2.90) and I couldn't even finish the third as they are pretty sizable. This place also sells buns by the box for cheap.

Went around 4pm so it wasn't very crowded. There's some limited seating inside but seems like most people just grab and go. Note this place is cash only. Buns came out super fast. My favorite was probably the bbq pork which I actually didn't see on the menu but knew they had based on reading Yelp. 

Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they have a kind of low sanitation score. BUT it's Chinatown, these buns are steamed pretty well anyway and it's $1 or LESS for a bun... so can't complain"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-11-30,1.0,"Worst customer service ever by one of the girls server who does not know how to be professional. No manners at all in taking orders then insisting to pay extra for a miscalculation she herself made on the calculator upon picking up the order. No apologies made! Just demanding and blaming it on the customer! 
 
Frankly, the buns were average with mostly dough, sesame balls are cracked open with little filling if any at all , as well as the salty fried dumplings. Not worth ordering!

Even worse was the nasty server who has no idea how to be courteous to customers! Not only that but check out their recent health violations. Ten violations concerning unsanitary and unhealthy food preparation. It will make you have second thoughts about coming here! 

I will never patronize this business as this server left a bad taste on my mouth and had me steamed up!! No need for steamed buns anymore from this place! Customers beware!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-12-22,4.0,Dude their buns were so freaking good that i went back in 5 minutes to buy a while box... Docking a star because they were literally out of almost everything we wanted but it was like 1.5 his before they closed :) so glad that i went
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-08-23,5.0,"It is no understatement that Chinatown is filled with nothing but fruit stands, fish markets, bakeries and pharmacies. This is one of my favorite bakeries to buy bao from. Lined up alongside the wall on metal shelves, are delicious pockets of sweet dough filled with red bean, roast pork, pumpkin and salted egg filling. The baos here are about the size of your fist and they're extremely inexpensive at about $1 each. I personally, like to buy the baos that come in the plastic boxes and steam them myself at home. 

My favorites are the red bean, egg custard and the roast pork baos. The red bean and egg custard are both sweet and the roast pork is savory. I'm also a big fan of the ""jumbo bao"" or ""combo bao"" or ""big bao""...whatever you want to call it. It is essentially a huge bun packed with chicken, a hard boiled egg and Chinese sausage. I suggest trying out every offering of bao that they have here because they're all decadent.

Aside from their baos, Golden Steamer also offers a plethora of cookies, cakes and various other pastries and desserts, such as the (every Chinese kid's favorite growing up) custard egg tarts. The venue is extremely small and there is very limited seating (if any). Overall, I'd recommend this place and I will definitely be returning here whenever I'm in the area and in search of an inexpensive breakfast for the next day."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-01-07,2.0,"Hmmm I took several bites before I saw the tiny filling, then one more bite it was gone. I would believe if they told me they accidently put some roast pork inside a plain bun...
Yes price is low but I prefer them being honest, either put more filling inside or just change the name to ""Plain steamed bun""."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-12-16,4.0,"Value: 8/10
Experience: 7/10
Taste: 7/10

Small hole in the wall where they sell packaged and individual buns for cheap.

Value: Most buns cost around a dollar and they have a good selection. They're all decently sized too and 2-3 should fill you up for a meal. The filling is definitely on the smaller side for their meat filled buns. You can also get a drink for $2-$3.

Experience: The buns and drinks come out quickly but there's not really a place to eat inside. Pretty much what to expect from hole in the walls.

Taste: The fillings are always yummy when you finally get them in a bite. The bun itself is slightly sweet so that's a nice touch as well."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-09-06,5.0,"Came here with my boyfriend when we were exploring Chinatown and the buns did not disappoint! The baked goods on the side were not as fresh (tried the custard bun and pineapple bun), but the salted egg bao and pumpkin bao were super tasty, hot, steamy, and soft! I really loved the breading for both of the steamed buns.. I can't get over how delicious they were. We went back a second time a couple days after because it was so good. I personally liked the salted egg bun over the pumpkin in terms of flavor, but that's just personal preference. Since pumpkin isn't a very common flavor, I would recommend trying it for first timers. There were other bun flavors too.. but I don't remember them all, I think there was custard and a chicken/egg one. They also sell drinks here too, like hot coffee and milk tea for only $1!! So cheap and good! The buns and baked goods are also around $1 here, a really affordable snack/breakfast. This store also sold some buns in packages, so you can bring it home if you live in NY. If not, like me, and you live far away you will have to savor the delicious buns in the moment :-("
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-11-29,4.0,"I've gone to the Golden Steamer every single time I've been down in Chinatown. It's all for their Liu Sha Bao, or Salted Egg Yolk Bun. The English name is a bit deceiving though, because the egg is actually pretty sweet. The bun bread is super light and fluffy if you get it out of the steamer fresh. I also tried the pumpkin bun, which was amazing because you could really taste the pumpkin in its natural form (although I question it's pumpkin... tastes more like butternut squash). If you have a steamer at home, I'd recommend buying their package deals, where you can get 6 buns for 5 bucks or under instead of the dollar you pay for the pumpkin and egg yolk bun.
Cash only!
Next visit: Got their carrot package and their scallion package the other day, and I'd recommend the scallion. The basic dough for all of the buns is the same, but the carrot one barely has a carrot taste... food coloring? Reason for the four star update from a five star review"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-02-10,5.0,"Best place for buns! They specialize in buns and have a few other items. I love that they have the walnut and almond cookies. 

Bring your cash though."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-02-21,4.0,"This has long been our favorite spot in NY's Chinatown to grab steamed buns!  If it's a chilly day and you're enjoying the craziness of Chinatown, a warm steamed bun from Golden Steamer is the place!
They aren't well versed in English, and I don't suppose they need be, but they'll understand exactly what you're there for and gladly help you out.  The pork and chicken steamed buns are the best as both are filled nicely and roughly the size of a baseball.  Make sure you ask for warm ones as there's always some in a container that are intended for take home.  The sesame balls are not my speed generally, but I will say that everyone loves them here!  There is a egg yolk bun that's sweet without being too much that's perfect for finishing off a savory visit to Golden Steamer!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-03-20,5.0,"When i found out about this place i KNEW i had to go try their buns no matter what!

It took me a week before i found time to come here and the good thing was that i came here on a Monday. Less traffic less people and more pork buns for me! The place is pretty small and humble.  There's probably 4-5 seats available so a grab and go would probably be more convenient.

The dough is how i expected them to be..soft, fluffy, tasty! i have not had such good buns in sooo long so to be able to finally stuff some on my mouth was bliss!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2016-11-20,5.0,"Ok. So I was planning a trip to Jersey (God help me, right) and I was determined to find the best hot dog bao in Chinatown to bring as a gift to my Jersey friends. Appropriate, right? I read an Eater article that talked about the OG hot dog bao: ""The first appearance of Teutonic-sausage-bearing pastries of this general type may have been at Golden Steamer in Chinatown, where very plain baked bao have concealed hot dogs for several years, coming as something of a shock if someone simply hands you one.""

MISSION ACCEPTED. 

I tracked down Golden Steamer's tiny, unassuming, rather ugly hot dog bao. Compared to other newer bakeries' glossy, humongous, buttery buns, I was skeptical. But I went inside every Chinatown bakery accessible to me on the way to the Canal St. R Train, and bought at least one hot dog bao at each. Ok, and a few other things too. I'm only human, and bakeries prove far too great a power for me to resist. 

We had a hot dog bao showdown in Jersey, which, is probably one of the most exciting things that has ever happened there. Just kidding. Golden Steamer's humble tiny buns totally won the taste test, hands down. 

Hey, remember: it's what's inside that matters most, my little sausage buns."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-11-10,4.0,"The quick scoop on Golder Steamer: a small bakery tucked behind glass doors that I've almost missed every time I mean to go there because of all the distracting markets and shops leading up to it (going north from Canal). Golden Steamer has a ton of baos, from salted yolk to plain mantou (between $4-$6 in packs of 4-6) to little pies closer to their counter. 

I actually stumbled across Golden Steamer when I was craving da bao (filled with chicken, egg, and sausage) from my childhood days and started an intensive search for them online. Thank you internet for leading me here because the filling is packed just right and the texture of the bun brings me back to my childhood. Despite the variety of baos, all I ever come here for is the da bao, and that's honestly all I need in life.

Two notes about Golden Steamer: most of their baked goods are chilled, so you do need to take the time to heat them up to enjoy the goods in all its glory. The da bao (pack of 4) very recently went from $5 to $5.25, so have that quarter handy!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-07-15,5.0,"Sooo good best baos and mantous ever!! Grandma and I love this place and buying the frozen ones to steam at home, cheap easy and delicious breakfast. The buns are huge and just so pillowy and soft and fluffy and lightly sweet.. and the custard and salted egg yolk fillings are delicious. Even without fillings it's simple and great, we love the mantous especially the wheat spiral one. The sausage one is ok, comes with a super tiny piece in the middle and isn't as great as sweet ones. Overall the place is amazing!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-10-28,4.0,"Despite the gentrification creep (rush?) in Chinatown, Golden Steamer's still got the old school classics (pork/egg steamed buns, char siu buns, pineapple buns, egg tarts, etc) at relatively old school prices. Items are freshly prepared and well stocked. Old school drink options (basic coffee and milk tea, lemon water + honey, etc) at a dollar a pop. Space is small so get your goods to go. Open early every morning. And as with most places around here, cash only."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-02-19,4.0,"Buns everywhere!! I got here in the afternoon, so the non-packaged bun display was probably short on a few things, but settled for some 3 for $1.50 egg custard buns, which were of course delicious. Also yes, they're 3 for $1.150! Perfect for a quick snack.

They were putting out more pumpkin and bbq buns though, so I assume that from open until close, their packages of steamed buns are very popular, and for good reason. They all look super delicious and soft, and while I didn't get to try any of the steamed ones, I had a sudden urge to buy a pack of them to eat even though I had no way of reheating them, and also no need for them. The egg custard buns were soft, and had the perfect amount of filling. It wasn't overly sweet, and it was a great little snack to much on while walking around Chinatown.

Also, as many of these Chinatown stores are, cash only! Make sure you've got some, because those buns definitely look so delicious and you might regret not having any change on you."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-07-08,5.0,"The first thing you notice when you walk into Golden Steamer is buns. Lots of buns. Walls upon walls of buns.  These buns are GINORMOUS and cheap, and they'll fill you up very quickly. 

I purchased a 6 pack of pork bbq buns ($4.50), the big buns ($5), a salted egg yolk bun ($1), and a pumpkin bun ($1). The bun part itself is delicious - slightly sweet and fluffy - but the fillings are really what make it.  The pork bbq tastes like your standard char siu/chashao steamed bun, but I really enjoyed it.  The big bun is absolutely stuffed with egg, cabbage, pork, and chinese sausage.  The pumpkin bun is one of their more unique items and contains a pumpkin puree.  The salted egg yolk bun, however, was my personal favorite.  The filling isn't quite evenly dispersed, but there's plenty of it.  

If you order individual buns, they come freshly steamed.  Purchasing the six pack boxes is more economical, but they will need to be reheated for optimum tastiness.  As is typical with small Chinatown establishments, the service is a bit brusque, but that's to be expected in these types of places.  If you like steamed buns or cheap food, this is right up your alley."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-11-28,5.0,"I am literally dreaming about this place. The buns were really really soft and delicious like pillows.

I stopped in on a weekday morning. I made a mistake of getting some of the baked items right next to the counter. Although they were okay, the star of the shop are the steamed buns. For the price that they were, I should have definitely gotten more. 

Anyway, I got the following:
BBQ Pork bun: Didn't have much meat but I still enjoyed the soft and light dough. 

Pumpkin Bun: Delicious and sweet so more on the dessert side. 

Salted Egg Bun: I think this was the best bun of all. The gooey filling, the soft exterior, everything combined to make the best and tastiest bun that I ever had. If I can, I would come back here in an instant.

Each bun is $1 or less. Bring cash. Recommend 100% for the buns."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-04-25,1.0,"Nothing special. Cash only. Gave them a $20 on a $7 bill and they gave me $3 back, then pretended like they didn't understand my English. I get better steamed buns in Florida. Disappointed all the way around."

The big buns were giant and were only $5 for a pack of 4. They were so big that they were packed with sausage, egg, pork, and cabbage. 1-2 of them could easily fill you up. The roast pork buns were also delicious, cheap, and very filling. The pumpkin bun and salted egg yolk bun was a little lacking in filling, it made up for it in price and taste. There were so many other things that I didn't get to try. I will definitely be back to try some of the other items!"

The amount of filling inside the baos was a bit inconsistent (some of them could have used more filling), but it was tasty.  It reminded me of the baos I used to get in LA Chinatown."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-04-09,5.0,"On this side of Canal Street Mott Street turns into tightly cramped store fronts which are all piled on top of each other like some type of collage.  If you walked by Golden Steamer several times and missed it I would not blame you.  It is a tiny store front that is easily missed.  However, if you are nearby, I highly recommend you slow your walk down a bit and check this place out.

The entire bakery is basically a small hallway that leads to a cashier station (with a kitchen behind that).  To the left are *stacks* featuring containers of steamed buns.  Each container has 4 buns in them and the price averages around $4.50 which is a great price for four of these awesome buns.  Flavors range from roast pork to lotus seed paste to egg custard to red bean to PUMPKIN (because why not?).  However if you really want a treat, order a fresh bun to eat as you walk.  They pull those right out from the back of the shop where they are still warm and more importantly, so are the *fillings*.

While I purchased four different buns (red bean, custard, roast pork and lotus seed) I have only tried two as of this writing and both were AMAZING.  Previous reviews that described the buns as fluffy and cloud-like are indeed accurate.  The buns have an amazing chew to them but they are not dry (as I have found in some places) but nor are they too mushy.  Their consistency is perfect and they taste wonderful.  In both of these buns the filling to bun ratio was perfect in my book.  There was enough filling to get some of it with each bite until the buns were gone.

Let's talk about the fillings for a second because I have to.  The egg custard was perfect.  It has a thick consistency but it can still be scooped up with some bun without a problem.  No shredded bun here!  Even better, it has both a sweet *and* salty flavor.  Most places that make egg custard in a bun focus on the sweet, but forget there is supposed to be a savory hit as well, and this has just the right hint of saltiness along with the sweetness.

A lot of the same can be said for the lotus paste.  Now, lotus seed paste is supposed to favor the sweet side, but it should also have a slightly savory flavor and this has that balance.

Do you like steamed buns?  Do you like knowing you got some awesome thing to eat from a literal hole in the wall?  If so, you owe it to yourself to check out Golden Steamer!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-03-01,5.0,"Came here on a Thursday morning around 10 AM, and even then half of the buns were already gone! They have warm buns and then refrigerated buns of six for you to take home. I took the last custard bun. I've been looking for these everywhere so I was excited to find them! I also got some pork sung bread and a baked red bean bun for breakfast ($1.50 for 3). Overall, for 9 buns, I paid $6!! This place is cash only.

I found the red bean bun a little too sweet, which is a rare occasion for me. I could only eat half of it. I liked the pork sung buns. Not enough pork sung, but when is there ever enough pork sung? I didn't have the phoenix buns until later, and I was worried because some of the reviews mentioned they would dry up if you didn't have a steamer. I'm broke. I have one pot. So we had to do it the way my parents taught me: 

I wet two paper towels and wrapped them around the phoenix bun and microwaved it for 130 seconds. It was perfect. Delicious. I wish it could have been a little more runny, more golden, instead of pasty, but it was okay. It was very easily 85% bread and 15% filling, maybe even less? But for its price, I can't even be mad. 

There's nowhere to sit inside because it's basically just a hallway, but if you walk a little down around the area in Nolita, there's a place that sells gelato with some cute benches to sit on. It's all very wholesome."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2016-03-12,4.0,"The solution to end world hunger: Chinese bakery buns! Seriously, they're so cheap and you can practically make a meal out of them! I came here to Golden Steamer after hearing about their popular Pumpkin buns and decided to buy 6 for $5.40, which means they are $0.90 each. The lady then handed over 6 cute little yellow buns filled with a mouthwatering pumpkin paste that had a few chunks of actual pumpkin in it and that sort of tasted like the paste found in the custard buns. It wasn't too sweet but still retained a delectable taste. Yummy!

As for the place itself, it's really small with practically no seating so I recommend taking the buns to go. Service was your typical Chinese bakery fare. I don't think Cantonese is their first dialect though which I found very odd but they did seem to be able to speak some English. Overall, give the pumpkin buns here a try!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-09-06,4.0,"A small store with good pricing for steamed BBQ pork buns. I also got the salted egg yoke steamed bun. 

* BBQ pork bun was very soft and the dough was slightly sweet, decent amount of filling but I think it's too much fat pieces. Although it's fat, it's not the super chewy type. 

* Salted egg yoke bun was a disappointment. Filling was a bit thick and not much salted egg yoke, wasn't like the ones in dim sum places. 

I would come back for the BBQ pork buns."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-11-28,5.0,"Golden Steamer is one of the places in Chinatown that brings me back to my childhood. Whether you are looking for steamed buns or baked buns, this is the place to go. Liu Sha Bao ""Salted Egg Yolk Bun"" is my absolute favorite and it's not exactly an easy find here. I'm so happy Golden Steamer makes it and makes it well. Bor Lor Bao ""Plain Bake Bun"" and Lai Wong Bao ""Egg Custard Bun"" are two more of my childhood favorites. (Fun fact: My neighbor used to call me Bor Lor Bao because every time she saw me, I was eating one. I loved it THAT much as a kid.) I would recommend heating both up in the oven to optimize taste and texture, unless you are lucky and get a fresh out-of-the-oven one. My only gripe with the buns here is the bun to filling ratio, which is a bit high, but the bun itself is so soft that they can (almost) get away with it."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-06-13,5.0,"I very rarely give perfect 5 stars, I feel Golden Steamer is that good
Their food is delicious and wonderfully cheap. try one of everything!

The customer service is good. I am sorry but I don't understand people that constantly complain about abrupt service in Chinatown. You try working 10 hour days, 6-7 days a week, standing on your feet. very common in Chinatown. See how you feel, have some compassion for your fellow human!

fay da bakery is the only other place in Chinatown that even comes close. but I feel golden steamer is better in taste."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-01-18,4.0,"Golden Steamer has made my dreams come true. For years, I've wondered where to get siopao bola-bola. Asado is pretty easy to get, because it's a classic Chinese pork bun, but bola-bola can't be ordered at dim sum, and I was at a total loss of where to find it. A friend suggested I try ""that bun place on Mott Street that is wall to wall buns"" (which is a great way to remember this place if you can't remember what it's called). Their ""Big Bun"" is a bola-bola siopao, complete with chicken, egg, and the little piece of Chinese sausage in it. I'm not a fan of Chinese sausage, but the rest of it is so delicious I can't resist. These reheat in the microwave pretty well, and don't require the use of a steamer.

Other things of note here: they have salted egg custard buns, which are the reason we end up at Ping's for dim sum month after month. Now that I know I can get my fill of them here, we will probably end up trying a few other places for dim sum. To reheat these, you definitely need a steamer (steam for 10 minutes), because the microwave will harden the egg custard within.

My only complaint about Golden Steamer is the lack of filling for the size of the bun. Yes, the bun is fluffy and like biting into a cloud, but I wouldn't mind paying a little more for more meat!! Despite that, I'll be back, satisfying all my cravings at once."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-03-13,2.0,"We were standing outside the store and discussing which buns to buy when an angry man came out and overheard our conversation. He told us not to buy from them because they sold him spoiled food. On their door was a posted sign with a ""C"" grade from the NYC Health Department so we didn't go in. I checked their inspection history and it looks like it was ordered closed 2 times by the Department. I won't be buying from them until they get an ""A"" inspection grade."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-08-29,5.0,"Love the pumpkin bun here, when you eat while is hot OMG! The best. I had bbq pork bun was also good too. The salted egg yolks was soso for me. Their price is really good too super cheap!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-12-11,5.0,"Like buns? This is your place. BUNS GALORE 

Asked a friend who's very fluent in Chinatown about the best places to buy pork buns in the city and was recommended this place. Since, then I've come here once a month - sometimes to quickly stop by and buy a few buns for lunch, other times to buy the take-home 6-pack bun set the store also offers. 1-2 buns is enough to feed me for a meal. 

Everything is super fresh. The dough is super fluffy, and the dough-stuffing ratio is pretty balanced, which is RARE. 

Buns are less than $1 but BRING CASH. 

Also come here early or everything will be gone."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-02-15,5.0,"This place is a guilty pleasure of mine. Is it healthy? No. Do you wonder if the pork bun you got actually has pork in it? Sometimes. But its an authentic China town experience that all New Yorkers should try. Every bun that I've tried is delicious. I would particularly recommend the pumpkin bun if you're in the mood for something a little sweet (great for breakfast), and the roast pork bun if you want savory. 

Pro tip: buy these in the bulk containers of 6 a piece, take them home, and you can microwave them with a damp paper towel wrapped around them and they taste as though they were just made. I usually do about 30-45 seconds. You can also steam them over water and all that jazz, but the microwave is great for lazy people like myself. 

Come here if you want super cheap steamed buns that are delicious. You wont be disappointed."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-11-08,5.0,"Perfect for the fall, pop in early and wrap your mitts around their steamed pumpkin buns. Subtly sweet, yet strong enough to satisfy your autumnal food cravings."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2015-06-21,5.0,"Simply the best steamed buns. The dough is perfectly - soft, light, but doughy and moist...ahhhh so good. Buy one, but don't walk away too quickly because you'll want another one immediately (especially for $0.80).

As everyone says, the pumpkin buns are really special - they are soft and smell buttery, the pumpkin filling is gentle and smooth and not arrestingly saccharine as you might expect.

Note that this is for the fresh buns that come directly from the steamer into your eager hands. The refrigerated/frozen ones they sell in packs of 4 are good but not at all the same."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2015-06-09,5.0,"When I'm roaming around anywhere in or near Chinatown, I try to go out of my way to make a stop  here. Normally you could easily pass this place just walking by. The entrance is a single door camouflaged above some mini steps. AND THEN YOU ENTER THE HEAVENLY HALLWAY OF STEAMED BUNS.

There're really no space to sit down so you're most likely taking you steamed buns on the go. You'll notice the stack on stacks of pre-packaged bun containers (4 buns each) to take home and heat up yourself. You can order hot ones at the counter and each seem to cost 80 cents or more depending on the filling. This place is known for their PUMPKIN filled buns and it certainly does not disappoint. The filling is sometimes minimal but I can't complain for the price. Even better IMO is the EGG BUN! There's no shortage of fillings to choose from here so literally I find myself buying at least 6 at a time when I come here.

Oh and they speak English here also!"
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2018-04-21,5.0,Amazing pumpkin bun for just $1. It was huge sweet and amazingly flavorful. Also enjoyed the pork and veggie bun for $1!
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2019-06-30,1.0,"If I can give no star I would have do that but I can't so I'll tell you, don't come here!!! They are very nasty!!! There service is very bad!! Don't waste your time and money to come here!! My first time there was horrible! They need better services to have more customers to come because trust me if they keep up with there attitude they won't have any more customers because there are not the only one that sell Bakery in Chinatown. Also there food wasn't even fresh and there bun was soggy which was sad...... bottom line please don't bother to come here."
18,golden-steamer-new-york,2017-03-18,3.0,"I grew up eating steamed buns in the household, in food courts, in hawker stalls, at street stands, at various bakeries, at dim sum restaurants, in train stations, in just about every kind of Chinese locale, savory and sweet. I was interested in going to this Chinatown bakery since it offers some novel flavors, such as salty egg, pumpkin custard, and egg custard--unlike the usual red bean, BBQ pork, and scallion flavors more commonly found.

This review is based on my order of the pumpkin buns (6 for $5). They're easy to heat up on the stove or in the microwave. While quite large, this steamed yellow pastry has a paltry amount of pumpkin filling in the middle. What filling there is quite good, but nothing to speak of. A few bites of plain starch in, you finally, finally uncover the smooth, subtle pumpkin paste...and then it's back to eating more plain yellow food coloring-tinged rice carbs.  

You can buy frozen buns from the grocery store that taste just as good, if not better, than these creations."

If you aren't a fan of sweets than I wouldn't recommend it. I would also recommend sharing it with a friend since the sweetness might be overwhelming. I also got the macarons here. The taste was strong. I definitely like the early grey and the salted caramel. They were my favorite. I noticed that they have special macarons for certain holidays. Hopefully I'll be able to snatch some one day.

For this holiday specjal, they got pusheen, MicKey and Minnie mouth with a Santa hat. Unfortunately, they gave us broken pusheen macarons."

I am not a huge macaron fan, and only went to try their chocolate chip cookies. I got the Chocolate Chip Pecan XL and the new Peanut Butter Oreo XL cookies. Both were pretty good - they were cakey Levain style cookies. I enjoyed the Peanut Butter Oreo more than the Chocolate Chip - it felt more unique and I was pleasantly surprised by the combination. 

Overall good cookie if you're in the area, but not as good as the greats (Levain & Chip). Definitely interesting with the Peanut Butter Oreo, so I'm excited to come back and see what new combos they come up with!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2019-11-10,2.0,Underwhelmed with my order. I got the oreo peanut butter cookie and it was very dry and cost $4 I believe. The staff behind the counter were not very friendly either.

19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2019-05-28,3.0,"I was so disappointed by our recent visit to the Macaron Parlour. I used to live in NYC back in 2013 and I remember going to a different location, but I recalled the macarons and service to be fantastic.

I told my wife we had to stop by because I remember the Macaron Parlour being one of my favorite shops. I felt a little embarrassed when we showed up to this specific location. The staff isn't friendly and lazily sat in their chairs behind the counter when we entered. I asked about the previous location that I visited in 2013 and they told me it never existed, only to find out that it DID but it had closed. 

There were maybe 10 options of macarons with only one character available. I remember them having multiple characters and flavors when I've visited in the past. 

The macarons were decent but not the same. Looks like we'll have to find a new place."

I had 24 count boxes  sent to each of my recipients and they were thrilled. The boxes were beautifully packaged with hand written cards with my message.

19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2020-03-15,5.0,"I dream of these macarons! They're perfection by definition. Flakey, moist and flavors that are like fireworks. They also have the best flavor combinations.  I've eaten my way through most Manhattan macaron shops and have to say this is my favorite place, and will make the trek wherever I am to get a few! They also have other delectables (croissant that is to die for, and super rich chocolate chip cookies). Trust me-- fhis is worth going to!"

19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2019-09-27,5.0,Such fresh macaron available! I hate when places have macarons that are obviously frozen and not made in house. This place was great and the employee gave very good recommendations. The cheeto (might have been dorito) flavor was weird but something cool to try. The Pusheen cookie was absolutely adorable and a nice gift.

They were able to accommodate my color/flavor requests, and the macarons were delicious! Candace was super sweet and easy to work with. I also got personalized stickers for the gift boxes and Candace not only offered to place them at the store but also offered various ribbon colors that would be the perfect match. I was able to pick up the gift boxes fully wrapped with stickers the morning of the shower. They were communicative, friendly, well priced and the macarons were delish. So happy with them and would recommend."

My wife asked the employee if she knew where the gallery was and she kind of just shrugged.  My wife gave her the exact address and again, she said she didn't know.  (the gallery was right across the street from their shop)  After buying some macrons and coffee I asked the same person if they had a bathroom.  She stared at me if she didn't know what a bathroom was.  I asked again and she just said ""no.""  I asked her if there was a place nearby I could use but they absolutely made no effort to help a paying customer.  I would understand if the place was busy but they had no other customers but us.  The macarons were good, coffee was average, their 2 person staff were very uninterested in helping customers and in my opinion, very rude and unfriendly.  I would not go there again, and they actually ruined the start of a good Sunday with the kids."

It's a cute little shop on St Marks Place. When you first walk in through the door you see all the cute little macaroons. In the back, there is seating where you can order and chill. 

Food
It's a very unique macaron store as they sell characters on their macarons. The only down side is that you should call ahead to find out if they have any. They are not always in stock. When my friend and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, the only character macarons they had left were Pusheen, and the emoji of the monkey hiding its eyes. We bought the 4 for $10 macaroons- Pusheen, tiramisu, cognac, and caramel. All were very flavorful and tasted as how they should. 

Service
The guy was helpful when we were ordering offering his opinion."

19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2016-08-24,4.0,"Everyone has their own opinion on which place has the best macaron store in NYC, but from the list I found, which talked about top 10 or so specific macarons in NYC, instead of rating a store as a whole. In this list, a Fig Macaron from Macaron Parlour was among the top 10, so it got me curious. 

We got a box of 6 with our choices of yummy looking choices, of course including the Fig macaron. It is not some ""fig-flavored"" filling, but has actual figs in it. So, I was pretty excited how this infamous Fig Macaron would taste like. It came with Figs cooked in White Wine and Honey. That alone sounded great. As I cut it into half, I could see the juicy, shiny fig filling. It was very moist, flavorful, sweet, and decadent. I can see why this particular macaron was chosen as one of the top 10 in NYC.

All the macarons we tried were quite good and tasty, I especially liked their S'mores, Earl Grey, and Red Velvet. I would like to try some more of their flavors. 

We also had Ice Cream Macaron Sandwiches, which I have actually never heard of before! We chose a colorful one called Care Bear Stare, made with Salted Caramel Ice Cream. The ice cream filling was quite massive, which was awesome. The macaron shell was a bit hard, making it a little difficult to eat it without squeezing out the ice cream to the side. The ice cream was really tasty, nice caramel flavor, very sweet."

You know what else? Macarons from Macaron Parlour. I can't say you'll really get too far with them unless you buy in bulk, but these light, inviting, delightfully indulgent puffs of sweetness will absolutely help ease your travel anxiety.

I selected a box of six (for $15) in rapid motion after noticing this place next to Crif Dogs in the East Village. I actually don't remember all six flavors at this point. Red Velvet, Party Time, Strawberry, Raspberry, Dark Chocolate and...something. Nonetheless, they were INCREDIBLE.

At one point I glanced over to see Sari A. looking totally confused on the bus. I had apparently consumed half the box before she could look twice! They're THAT good.

The shop itself is adorable and even has booths with macaron-shaped (re: circles) pillow backs! They also have a bunch of pretty looking dessert items if you don't like macarons.

Love, love, love this place. Will keep it in mind for future NYC trips!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2017-04-30,4.0,"Mmmm.. Fig macaron and peach iced tea.

I passed by Macaron Parlour a few times and decided to check it out on a hot scorching day cause I couldn't walk anymore and needed to hydrate. So I got their peach iced tea and a few macarons. You can also ask them to make your tea more/less sweet, whatever floats your boat. Even though they have some interesting flavors like cheetos, I played it safe with earl grey, fig, and s'mores. The fig macaron really stood out for me, maybe cause I like figs? All in all it's a cute spot to cool off, chat up with your friends and get some sugar in your veins if you have a sweet tooth like me. I wouldn't recommend coming with big groups since there's minimal seating. I can definitely see myself popping my head back in again the next time I'm in the area."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2016-07-20,5.0,"So glad that I stumbled upon this place while walking.  I spotted it from across the street and had to go in!  Lots of cool flavors and they have the special ones that they seem to rotate thru every so often.  I got a Totoro macaron (*squeeeeeee*) which was their Party Time flavor.  Definitely had a hint of salt which complimented the flavor nicely.  Also got the Apple Cider Caramel, Giggity, and S'mores.  Least favorite was probably the Apple Cider Caramel just because it didn't taste apply what so ever.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but didn't hold up to the name either.  The S'mores one was good for sure, but I would've loved to have some graham flavor to make it complete.  Giggity was my favorite with a great and not overpowering peanutty flavor.

The girl working at the counter was really nice!  The only thing I disliked is that the macarons are ""packaged"" in a plastic bag to go.  Better eat them quickly after that or when they get softer in the middle, they sort of slide and then some of the filling gets on the others.  A box would've been nicer, but maybe you get one of those if you order a larger amount.

Definitely coming back to try the other flavors!  One day when I'm feeling adventurous, I'll try their Cheeto flavored one O.o"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2019-03-14,5.0,Amazing. Perfect texture. Abundance of flavors. I even bought a Cheeto one! Best of all was classic strawberry. Light with a flawless flavor.

Some macarons were fresher than others, the older ones were more chewy, but honestly I didnt mind because they tasted good. The best macarons are still Mille Fueille on the west side, with its delicately flavored light and airy yummy concoctions! I'd buy here again if I was in the neighborhood. Check my pics.
Happy Yelping :)"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2018-09-27,4.0,"I have tried macarons at many other places before but this place is amazing! It has a twists in its different flavors of macaron; however I didn't like the lemonade it was just plain, felt like water mixed with just lemon without any sugar or anything else. The price was a bit too much compared to all other places, each macarons was $2.75 and character maracons were $4.50 which is totally over the top. The ice cream macaron was amazing, I tried the velvet macaron with cheesecake ice cream and I have to admit, it was quiet fascinating. I confused my taste buds a lot but in a good way. If you're not willing to spend that much money, I wouldn't recommend this place. I had 2 macaron, 1 macaron ice cream and a lemonade but the total came out to be $15. So I would say it's better to choose some other place maybe unless you're a big macaron fan!"

A big plus is that next door there is a cute cat cafe called Meow Parlour!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2016-07-11,5.0,"Found these guys in Greeley Park and bought an assortment of the most beautiful and delicious macaroons ever created.

Super crispy outside and creamy good inside. Flavor assortment was amazing from carrot cake to red velvet to earl grey to s'mores to cheetos. Sold in a really nice dozen container. Great staff and friendly service. Lemon was a particular standout.

Went back the next day for an ice cream macaron (red velvet with cheesecake ice cream) and while it was good, it wasn't amazing. Macaron was just as crispy, but ice cream was a bit hard and packed like it came from a factory. Probably not worth the $5 price and uncountable calories.

This place is a definite stand out."

They have a good variety of flavors, and the prices are $2.50/ea. Their smallest box size is $15, and there's not additional charge to have it in the nice box. 

My favorite is the earl grey one. It's a must-get for me every time. They have have some interesting flavors with bacon, but I haven't gotten that adventurous. 

PS: I had them in a fridge for a week, and they were still pretty good. :D"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2018-03-02,3.0,"Pretty disappointed in their macarons. I was actually deciding between other macaron places and decided to come to this location. I got a box of macarons to try different flavors and one separately packaged corgi one. The corgi one was my favorite out of all of them. Not only because it was adorable, but It was chewy which is the texture I'm looking for in a macaron, maybe because it was more fresh than the others? Although they did have a huge selection on flavors. But the other macarons, they were all dry almost crunchy, and didn't have that chewy texture. Maybe it's because I came towards the end of the day and had the ""old"" macarons, but idk wouldn't try again."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2016-03-14,4.0,"Got a box of 6 as a gift from a very awesome friend :D If you're reading this review you know who you are!! Ok back to business...The macarons here are great. I kept them in the fridge for a few days and they still tasted just like they're supposed to; crispy-shelled exteriors and soft/slightly chewy centers. Some of them even had really cool designs on them as well! From the 6 that I got, my favorites had to be the Earl grey, Creme brulee, Tiramisu, and Hazelnut because they all really captured the essences of their respective flavors! The Matcha, however, was a little disappointing since it didn't really taste like matcha. It did have a nice design imprinted on top of the macaron though. The last one, which I think is Smores, was alright.

I haven't had a chance to step into the premises so I can't comment on the decor/service but honestly if you're here, you're most likely getting the macarons as gifts anyways so it doesn't really matter. I looked up the prices and they're $15 for 6, which I would say is standard for macarons. Overall, if you're looking to get a gift for that special someone or just a friend in general, I definitely recommend Macaron Parlour! The macarons are on point and they come packaged in a really nice box! Great!!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2017-04-13,4.0,"I love macarons! This shops sells many different flavors- unique ones such as candied bacon with maple cream cheese, and the cheeto flavored. Had to try both of them!!! They also sell cute cartoon character macarons such as tortoro, cookie monster, elmo, gudetama. Huge plus plus. There are a few seats in the back to enjoy your yummy treat. 

In addition to the candied bacon, and cheeto. I also got the fig, earl grey, raspberry chocolate, and the tiramisu. The macarons were chewy and baked to perfection. The unique flavored ones were interesting, probably won't get them next time. The candied bacon tasted like lays bbq chips, the cheeto one didn't taste like cheetos at all- sweet. I really liked the raspberry chocolate macaron and the fig. They were so full of flavor. I will definitely come here to try more flavors!!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2017-05-08,3.0,"All you need to get is the Matcha macaron. I got four and none even came close to the goodness that was the Matcha one. I also got the Tiramisu, S'Mores and Apple Cider Caramel. There's so many to choose from, so don't get overwhelmed like I did! They're super chewy, if you're into that. I feel like a lot of them were just missing something, but if you do swing by here, again, the Matcha one is the best."

There's also a small water cooler in the back where you can help yourself to some water with their plastic cups.  Bathroom is clean too.

I had the sea salt caramel macaron ice cream sandwich and it came in Care Bear colors.  The flavor was on point and went well with the frozen yet moist once bitten.  A simple yet fancy afternoon sugar treat while in the East Village."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2015-01-30,4.0,"Awesome macarons + Friendly Employees = Good Times

Their Macarons are delicious. Slightly crisp cookie on the outside with cool and creamy fillings. Below the crisp cookie is a cakey inside. The fillings are flavorful and generously filled. Some of the macarons were a bit sweeter than I'd like but overall, we enjoyed them. 

They offer a variety of macarons, in addition to other baked goods. There is seating towards the back of the bakery and they have a restroom here."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2019-01-06,3.0,They have very cute character macarons. But their macarons aren't very tasty. Kind of meh...
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2016-10-09,3.0,"I should've called ahead to see if they had unique macarons (Totoro, Cookie Monster, emojis) but I came to find out they had none I really wanted when I arrived...unfortunate but I still had to choose a few to try...because why not.

I built the four pack for $10, with rosemary olive oil (amazingly well balanced), sweet corn (not very distinguished), lemon (sweet and tart), and earl grey tea (light and slightly spiced). 

Not bad for all but probably would call to see if they have the cuter macarons in store...because I think that it's what makes them more special than any other macaron place. The cafe area is quaint and good for even a small study session for students or those who just want to relax or enjoy some reading. Comfortable setting to enjoy a sweet or two!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2015-05-09,4.0,"Macarons are what real dreams are made of!!! I could eat them everyday but because I fear being fat I don't! But that doesn't stop me from craving them. This place is one of the few that offers really great unique flavors. 

The first one I tried had actual bacon in it! It doesn't get more unique than that! They have a lot of unique flavors. My favorite is SMORES and the giggity (not sure if I spelled that right). 

They have lots of other great treats to offer also, however when I am here it's all about the macarons! They ever have macarons for your pup!! Yes! I almost fell out when I saw the tiny little dog macarons! My guy loved them as well! (My dog, not my boyfriend) :) 

Staff here is always friendly and willing to answer questions and give you the deets on what's the best thing to order or try! When I am in the east village this place is always on my radar!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2018-08-24,5.0,Actually was at Meow Parlour next door and got these adorable creations and some tea! I can't wait to go back again to try out more of the designs! Make great gifts that can be frozen but be very careful when transporting!
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2017-11-28,5.0,"Macaron Parlour is your almond biscuit heaven meets a team of amazing staff in Lower East Side. Simon is the lovely co-owner of this shop, with his wife. Everything is made out of love and respect for the community. 

Forget your faux macaron from Starbucks. This is the real deal. There are so many wonderful flavors here that will satisfy your adventurous side of life. From tiramisu to cheetos (yes), this will make great gifts for the holiday season! 

I'm so intrigued with the earl grey, passion fruit, and matcha macarons. The earl grey is welcoming with the bergamot flavor, which melts down to a chocolate-ty smoothness. The passion fruit is the perfect bite of tanginess and juiciness. At last, the matcha is a creamy crunch of your latest obsession with green tea. Really. 

I also love that the Macaron Parlour is present at the holiday markets all over NYC this year. I'm talking about Union Square, Times Square, Columbus Circle, etc. You're not going to miss out wherever you are. It will follow you. And you will die of joy.

This store is also affiliated with Meow Parlour - which is owned by Simon's wife. It's super close to Macaron Parlour, just right across the street on Hester. If you love cats, do yourself a favor and meet some of the friendly cats there!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2014-10-19,4.0,"Fact: Not 10 min before I stumbled across this place, I was talking to someone about their trip to Paris, and was asking them if they had any Macarons.  Coincidence?  I think not!

So being presented with this opportunity, I felt like I had no choice BUT to load up on a sampling of these goodies.  Now I'm no macaron expert, but these were some of the best I've ever had.  Delicate, and perfect texture.  I'd like to do a side by side with Ladurée, because I really can't recall it being that special. The caramel fleur de sel is Pure. Crack.

Added to which, the staff here is super nice, and didn't take offense at all when I walked in here asking for doughnuts (cuz I'm not too smart sometimes)."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2014-08-20,5.0,"So I figured out what that pain was on the side of my torso. Apparently that's the sensation you get when you whore out your pancreas to macarons. So, this is what love feels like... and diabetes. No worries, I read somewhere on WedMD you can live without that organ.

Pancreas: I'M BEGGING YOU, PLEASE STOP!

Shut up Pancreas & bring me more insulin! Muahahahahahahah

     Anywho, much like that anorexic girl from my Chemistry class has won my affection, this place also holds my heart. Fun Fact: She loves macarons... because everyone loves macarons (duh). There's a number of reasons to visit this place:

1) Because I said so!
2) The only place you'll find Earl Grey macarons in town... the world?
3) They have a Cheetos flavored macaron... cheetos. It's one of those combinations you never expect to go together until you try it, like nutella on pizza or nutella & sex, they're all delicious combinations. Fun Fact: The most popular edible lingerie flavor is Cherry. Chocolate being the least.
4) They hold macaron making classes. Pretty fun.
5) They make custom-made macarons. To name a few: Hello Kitty, Ghostbusters, & their cat (I believe his name was Mr. Socks or Captain Socks). Sometimes it's too cute, you almost feel guilty eating it... almost.

     OH! Also, they were listed as one of the top 5 Macaron spots in NY, they were also acclaimed for their Blondies. I haven't tried one myself because I'm always too distracted by the macarons."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2019-05-23,3.0,Love the gluten free muffins! The staff isn't that friendly though and the bathroom was gross which concerns me about the state of the kitchen. Really cute space.

At.Any.Given.Time!

We were walking around the East Village, and we passed by Macaron Parlour. Kathleen D bought assorted box of 6 macarons, which she seemed to enjoy. Personally, I haven't tried any, since I'm not a big fan of macarons, but can you please think of a more indulgent dessert?

-Oleo ($2.25.) 
Moist and sinful brownie with cheesecake-like(I think yummm!) fantastic filling. (sigh)

- Goodbit bar ($3.00)
Chewy caramel & crunchy peanut butter- white chocolate square.
Simply, a killer brownie! What's left to say?

-Chocolatey Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2.25.)
Nuff Said!

- Peanut Butter Chocolate Cookie ($2.25.) 
This, dear yelpers, is the pinnacle of Cookies goodness.

And when it comes to macarons, you have many choices. Cheetos macarons, carrot cake macarons, figs cooked in white wine and honey macarons? At the end of the day, you want some macarons that's going to meet your needs. 
P.S: if you obsessed with those macarons, and you want to make your very own at home, take the 3-3.5hour macaron class ($100) taught by one of Macaron Parlour's pastry staff.

Four and Half Yelps."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2016-10-31,5.0,"Found Macaron Parlour in Broadway Bites, but never purchased it from there. I decided to go to the actual store in St Marks to see what their character macarons were about. They are super cute. Though they are not the same price as the regular flavored macarons. I ordered Raspberry, candied bacon and a Tortoro. Each bite is savory with a moist texture. Beats out the famous macaron Laduree. My husband is obsessed with the candied bacon, eating a total of four. That should say a lot. Fun visit, sweet little dessert!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2015-02-16,5.0,"These macarons are AMAZING. They are so tasty and come in some crazy cool flavors, and I only wish I could have tried them all! I particularly liked the caramel apple, earl grey, and honey cognac flavors. The caramel apple had real apple chunks, and the earl grey was very fragrant, just like the tea. 

Each macaron is $2.50, but I bet you can't get just one. There's a few cozy tables in the back where you can sit and enjoy your delicious macarons as well as free water. We were here on a weekend and practically had the back area to ourselves, which is a rarity for Manhattan."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2016-02-28,4.0,"They were running out of the cute hello kitty macarons, oh no...but they do have a handful of other macaron selections.

Got my daily americano. Wish they have wifi here as well..."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2016-04-23,5.0,"As a macaron fanatic, this place felt like heaven. It's a really cute and warm shop located on St. Marks place, and they serve up some really cute and delicious macarons!

I initially went in to buy the emoji and Cookie Monster macarons, but to my disappointment they didn't have any left. However, I was lucky enough to find the Winnie the Pooh macarons and not only were they aesthetically pleasing, they were delicious! I got 4 more macarons for $10 (Party time, smores, matcha, and tiramisu), they were all pretty good, except the matcha, which tasted nothing like matcha. They were all  soft, chewy and tasted freshly made, they also had interesting flavors like cheetos and bacon and maple syrup which I'd love to try next time around. I also ended up convincing myself to try the red velvet macaron ice cream sandwich, which was HEAVENLY! I've never had anything like it! 

For macaron lovers this place is a dream come true, definitely recommend it!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2014-02-24,4.0,"Would you believe me if I told you, I never ever had a macaroon in my life. Yes, I am not lying. As one friend like to put it, I'm a bubble boy. Better late than never. 

When you walk down, you immediately see a huge selection of macaroons. So many to pick from. What do I choose. They also have a other desserts. They have a good selection of unique teas. Being that this place is about macaroons, I had get some. I couldn't decide on just one. I had to get a few. 

For $15 you get a box of 6 macaroons of your choice. I picked...

1. Cheetos- Cheetos infused white chocolate ganache. It was okay. It wasn't as savory as I thought. I was hoping for my fingers to layered in cheese.  

2. Party Time- Salted Milk Chocolate & Dulce De Leche. Great combination. Yes, it is a party. 

3. Pistachio- Pistachio Shell with Pistachio & White Chocolate Ganache. I thought this was a delicious macaron. You could taste the pistachio. 

4. Red Velvet- Cream Cheese Filling. This tastes just like an actual Red Velvet Cake. I approve. Really good. 

5. Caramel Fleur De Sel- Salted Caramel and Buttercream. AMAZING!!! Not overly sweet. 

6. Smores- Brown sugar & Honey Shell with Dark Chocolate & Marshmallow Creme.  This was decent. Nothing to rave about. Sweet, but nothing stood out. 

I also got a cup of Hot Chocolate, which was one of the better hot chocolates I've had in a while. 

My macaron experience was a great one. Where have I been. Deliciously, sweet, bite size dessert."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2014-12-16,4.0,"A couple weeks ago my grandmother sent me a check for my birthday.  I cashed it and then proceeded to spend a portion of it at Macaron Parlour ...

I started off with the Hazelnut.  A hazelnut shell with a chocolate ganache filling.  The hazelnut flavor lacked a little bit for me, so that was a little disappointing.

Next up was the Candied Bacon with Maple Cream Cheese.  I don't even know what to say about this one.  They use an actual piece of bacon inside the sandwich.  A real slice of maple-y salty bacon!  I'll be honest, my first bite was weird.. its a cookie w/ bacon in the inside after all, but I quickly got over the texture and just enjoyed the flavors.  Crazy flavor.

My final selection was the Chocolate Peanut Butter - a chocolate shell with a dark chocolate peanut butter filling.  My favorite of the three fo sho.  I can't think of anything better than a chocolate peanut butter combination and this one was spot on.  Neither flavor overpowered the other which was nice.

I'm so crazy for macaron's lately!!

... and I think that Grandma, a fan of all things sweet, would be proud of how I spent my birthday money.  :-)"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2013-12-05,3.0,"I'm not sure if it matters, but I've never actually been to Macaron Parlour.  While walking around Chelsea Market, I noticed Bar Suzette offered a vareity of their macarons, so I picked up a few.  As such, I can't comment on the service or their offering of flavors but based on the handful I tried, I can't say I was amazed.

I'm not sure how many flavors Macaron Parlour offers at any given time, but I had roughly 8-10 to choose from.  The prices seemed a little steep at $2.50 a pop, but I went with four for variety and to make it an even $10.

-- RED VELVET with a Cream Cheese Filling
I'm not a big fan of Red Velvet-anything, but admittedly this one was pretty good.  For whatever reason, I liked this cream cheese filling better than others I've tried.

--PARTY TIME - Salted Milk Chocolate and Dulce de Leche
The combination of flavors sold me, but the two were muddled together.  I couldn't taste much of the caramel so it oddly tasted like some sort of chocolate cake mix.

-- CARAMEL FLEUR de SEL with a Salted Caramel Buttercream
While there was nothing wrong with it, it wasn't spectacular either.  The filling had a nice flavor to it, but I've had other salted caramel macarons that were far better.

-- CANDIED BACON WITH MAPLE CREAM CHEESE
My favorite of the bunch.  I liked the uniqueness and how the bacon and cream cheese meshed so well.  That said, the taste was awfully sweet.  If the macaron was any larger, I wouldn't have been able to finish it. 

As for the cookies themselves, the texture wasn't as ""crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside"" as I would have liked.  Since I got them at another venue though, perhaps they weren't as fresh as they would have been from Macaron Parlour itself.

From skimming through other Yelp reviews, it seems like I may have missed out on Macaron Parlour's more popular flavors (Earl Grey in particular), but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to try Macaron Parlour again.  I certainly wouldn't be opposed if I happened to be in the area or came across them again though."
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2017-12-09,5.0,My friend gave this to me when she visited me @ work. I'm definitely buying the totoro design. Just too adorable to eat. Flavor and texture of the macaron was nice. I still want to try the cheetos flavor though! lol
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2016-03-01,5.0,"If yall wanna see pretty patties from Spongebob, then it's probably best to come here.

I love how Macaron Parlour offers some of the most exotic and unusual flavors of macarons I've ever heard of, from cheetos to thai chili to candied bacon with maple cream cheese. They also have some traditional flavors ranging from the aromatic floral flavors to sweet and fruity macarons. Initially, I was a little skeptical to try the candied bacon macaron, but it turned out a lot better than I thought it was! Somehow there was a hint of savoriness from the bacon meshed with the sweetness from the macaron. My favorite has to be the creme brulee (cause it's so toasty!) and apple cider (probably cause of the color honestly. presentation does a lot to sway me over)! 

I find their macarons a reasonable size for $2.50 (maybe a little larger than normal macarons actually!) They're a perfect amount of chewy and light too!"
19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2016-04-20,4.0,"Really cute place on St. Marks. Unique flavors. They have baked goods other than macarons, and they have seating! Reviews for each of the macarons I bought in April 2016 (*Note: I bought them to take home. I put them in the fridge for two days before consuming them.):

Matcha macaron: Good and visually appealing, but doesn't taste like matcha at all. The filling melted the fastest of the four that I purchased, and you could really taste the buttercream. 

Giggity: I like this one. The peanut flavor is really present. The chocolatey filling is nice. 

Sweet corn: I forgot what flavor this was since I didn't eat it immediately after. It just tasted sugary to me. After I realized it was the sweet corn, I guess I taste it? It's a very subtle corn flavor. This one remained hard the longest without melting (shell + cream). The filling was more of an icing consistency. 

Winnie the Pooh honey and cognac: This one is a limited time offer, and I took one of the last few for that day! It was around 5PM so be sure to get there during daytime if you want one of their special macarons. It cost more than the others. I believe it was 75¢ more. 

Brownie surprise chocolate chip cookie: I tried this because of Yelp reviews. It's quite good--very crunchy and reminded me of Tate's, but the brownie filling added a nice softness inside."

I know $2.75 for a small dessert might not be ""reasonable"" to some people but a lot of other macaron places charge just as much if not more. At least Macaron Parlour has cool flavors.

The guy that served me was also really helpful and polite. It is a cute little shop and really colorful yet subtle. My friend got the carebear stare salted caramel ice cream sandwich and I bought a half dozen macarons for $15. I regret nothing."

19,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,2013-06-04,4.0,"Have designer macarons taken over from designer cupcakes as the latest divalicious snack fad among single women in need of a sugar fix? Yes, that appears to be the case. And it works for aging Asian baby boomers as well. I think that's because macarons are French in origin, come in a variety of shabby chic colors, have smooth textures and come across as lighter than similar sweets since they're made with meringue, egg whites and almond powder (photo: http://bit.ly/11jMRA5). They're even gluten-free. I just never find them that satisfying, but I am willing to take exception for Macaron Parlour which offers these fashionable temptations with a blue-collar streak of devilishness which make them rather unique. 

Take, for example, their house special, the Candied Bacon with Maple Cream Cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/11DIvCE). What's not to love about a piece of bacon in a sweet cookie? There's the Elvis with Peanut Butter and Caramelized Banana or the Caramel Fleur de Sel with Salted Caramel Buttercream. Jamie W. and I ordered all three for each of us, and it added up since they're $2.50 a pop (photo: http://bit.ly/18TJA2d). Fifteen dollars strikes me as a bit steep considering how quickly they were devoured despite the pretty packaging in which they were housed in such an orderly fashion. Fourteen other flavors await ranging from Matcha Green Tea to Cheetos. Who can resist a macaron with a sense of humor and a Blue Bottle coffee?

MACARONS - 4 stars...flavorful confections with a streak of amusing devilishness
AMBIANCE - 3 stars...just your standard subterranean East Village shop with Christmas trees of macarons (photo: http://bit.ly/14uwTE3)
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...no one yelled at me for saying ""bacon-bacon""

For $2.50 per piece was worth the favorable tasty appeal.  Macarons can be sold in boxes of 6, 12, and 24 pcs are available.  So many flavors, oh my!!  Undecided for nearly five minutes.  Customer service is very attentive, courteous and efficient as my party of two were the only patrons occupying the shop at the moment.  On a very warm and humid June Sunday early afternoon with abject pain from recent major surgery + the uncomfortableness of humidity we were able to sit for nearly forty minutes in peace in air conditioning environment without being quickly ushered out.  I am still in excruciating pain at times as it comes and goes depending on my bodily movement.  The shop owner or manager is very friendly to allow our party of two sit waiting for my pain to subside as we chat.  Background music is the radio playing 1980s music.  Coffee is also served here.  Cookies and other baked goodies are offered.  I decided tea which they offer Harvey & Sons Chamomile tea to accompany these delicate French cookies.

I've been here twice with friends for weekend brunches. If you call ahead of time, they are happy to accomodate larger parties. Each time, I was there with a party of 10+ people. 

The first time I went, I ordered the eggplant parm. It was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. The second time I went, I ordered the ravioli in sage brown butter sauce, The portion size was good, and the sauce was delicious. 

As an appetizer each time, I ordered the tomato eggplant bruschetta, and it was really good as well. 

I really enjoyed the desserts. My top 3 favorites were the chocolate mousse, the tiramisu and the bread pudding. 

All of my friends, except one lactose intolerant friend, enjoyed this place. (If you're lactose intolerant, I recommend a different location as many of the dishes use cream or butter)."

All their egg dishes come with field green salad. No potatoes - super weak! But the avocado toast was very good. Instagram-worthy, as many said it was ""amazing-looking."" I had their American coffee - no half and half just heavy cream. It was strong, dare I say not that...great? (Sorry guys) next time I'll stick to the espresso drinks like cappuccino. Which the server recommended but I decided to goof and get the regular coffee. Since the clientele is moving and a wait can accumulate pretty quickly, you're served, eating and leaving fairly easily.

20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-10-28,2.0,"Big portions and cheap prices, but bland pastas. 

I came for dinner in a group of five only to be told that my reservation (made through Opentable) was nowhere to be found. After asking a second time, they did in fact find my reservation, but all the tables were taken. We waited 45 minutes for a table that I had a reservation for, and I noticed that a few of the tables were leisurely chatting after having already finished their food and drinks. In these circumstances, the servers should've asked them nicely to give up the table. Also the light in the bathroom was broken and you had to precariously use your phone flashlight. 

All of this would be forgivable if the food was fantastic, but unfortunately, it was not. The pastas we got were all bland and pretty much tasted the same - we had the linguini with clams, cacio e pepe, and carbonara. The portions are very large and the prices are pretty cheap (cash-only, fyi), but there is nothing exciting about tasteless pasta."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2020-01-20,4.0,"This place was good. The staff were very friendly and helpful and didn't rush us. The atmosphere of the place was comfortable and calm. There was no wait (noon on MLK day) and we were able to seat a group of 10. I ordered the eggs Florentine and while they were good, the salad that it came with was not much to speak about. By checking in through Yelp online I was able to try the coffee Panna cotta for free which was also very good. However my friends ordered the bread pudding and that was by far the best dessert option. The best menu option was the vegetables panini with caramelized onions (I tried it from one of my friends). FYI: The place is cash only."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-08-13,4.0,"This brunch spot hidden in Little Italy/NoHo is super cute and affordable, tucked away from the bustle of the nearby more touristy neighborhoods. I'm obsessed with the complimentary dessert that comes with a Yelp Check-In: the coffee panna cotta is so light and the sweetness, coffee flavor, and smooth texture really resembles that of a flan. It's also super jiggly and bouncy, which makes it all the more fun to eat! Their prices are also incredibly affordable especially for brunch, but note: it's a CASH ONLY establishment, though there is an ATM downstairs. 

I've had their Eggs Benedict with salmon before and really recommend! The poached eggs were delicious and the yolk was runny, just like I like it and the side of greens also balanced the saltiness of the salmon. I haven't had the chance to try their pastas yet, but I look forward to coming back with friends!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-08-11,5.0,"The cutest little spot in little Italy. Great prices and even better food! I'm stumbled upon this place one October evening after shopping in Soho. I'm a pasta lover and had become skeptical of most Italian places in Nolita that are overrated, crowed, and pricey. Fiat was a pleasant surprise!! The carborna is magical. Hands down best carborna I've had in nyc. Do check this place out it's cozy and great place for a pasta dish."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2020-05-10,5.0,The salmon bagel was incredibly delicious. Great service and fantastic coffee rounded out a great experience. I'd definitely eat here again.
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-12-11,4.0,"As small as a fiat car is this restaurant is tiny but packs great meals. We have eaten here a handful of times and have never been disappointed in anything we ordered here. The kale Caesar salad is a great starter to share with the table. The fresh shaved Parmesan slices on top with the croutons add texture and I love how each leaf of kale is evenly coated in dressing. 
The fresh pasta is cooked al dente with just enough bite. There are plenty of options of different sauces and combinations to choose from. I had the papadelle pasta dish which had a earthy sauce with various mushrooms and duck confit to give it a little richness. The portion size was just about right, but we didn't have any room for dessert this time around. Service is also very good.
This place is cash only, but they do now have an atm downstairs by the bathroom if you need to withdraw cash."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-08-11,2.0,"I decided to order delivery from here tonight, & I got some ravioli & my friend got the pasta w duck.

Half way through my pasta, I find a HAIR. DISGUSTING. I had to get my money back

Also, my friend found duck bones in her pasta.

Very disappointing, probs not ordering from here again."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-10-18,5.0,"Fiat Cafe is a cute tiny cafe right off of the hustle and bustle of little Italy. Great place to sit and have a quiet and relaxing lunch if you have a bit of time. I work in the area and order from here way more often than I'd like to admit :)

I usually get their paninis - prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula is my fave! I also love their bucatini with pancetta, and the grilled chicken panini. 

Service is always prompt and the people who work there are so sweet and friendly."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2020-03-12,5.0,"Went there in height of corona panic...waiter, Alessandro was funny charming and accommodating. Eggplant parm was amazing as always and wine was shockingly cheap which is always what makes this place a hidden gem. A must!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-11-02,1.0,"Stopped in for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. The place was packed which I thought was a positive sign. Turns out it was not. To start, the waitress wasn't very friendly - no smile, no small talk. She gave the impression that she really didn't want to be there. I ordered the eggs Benedict. I asked if I could substitute the salad for home fries. She said they don't have home fries. Fine - I asked if I could substitute for mashed potatoes. She says yes. I also ordered a coffee, which they forgot to serve me. I finally received it after my meal was served. 

When they served my meal I got the salad in addition to a side of mashed potatoes - which is not what I asked for.

The portions were small, the English muffin was hard, most likely stale. The eggs tasted like vinegar. The bread was not fresh. The mashed potatoes were made from boxed flakes, were mushy and flavorless. I ate one spoonful and couldn't bring myself to eat another. 

Skip this place. Not worth it."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-09-29,5.0,My favorite Italian place in the city! I've been coming here for about 7 years and celebrated several birthdays as well as my college graduation here. The food is consistently incredible and the prices are very reasonable for the quality. Everyone I've ever brought here has been very impressed. 5 stars aren't enough! [photos are from my birthday dinner this past May]
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-10-04,5.0,"Warning: ATM in basement; but this is CASH ONLY. Absolutely charming in all aspects. We had the pleasure of meeting a ladies book club here and they told us ""get anything that looks classic, and it will be delicious."" So I got the pasta with duck. Rich, garlicky, with a tomato base. It was much heavier than I expected and I needed a nice long walk after dinner. 

Mother dearest got the linguine with clam sauce and it was very light, buttery and perfectly accompanied by the salty pancetta. This dish also had fat slices of garlic dropped in, and I am always of the opinion that thicc garlic makes anything tastier. 

Our server recommended a rose and mousse for dessert. Maybe she was trying to upsell, maybe she just wanted us to experience true joy. Regardless the mousse was DIVINE. If you're going to be a regular anywhere: be a regular here."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-11-25,2.0,"CASH ONLY.
Really overpriced for the quality of food you are getting. The kitchen is tiny so don't expect to get food quickly.
The place gets VERY loud and cramped during the weekend. They squeeze in as many people as humanly possible which makes it uncomfortable and impossible to enjoy your meal. Definitely exceeding the legal limit of people allowed in such a small place. 

The door opens inwards and there are tables on both sides. How is anyone supposed to get in and out? Especially in the winters when everyone is bundled up and walking around like the michelin man.

Maybe lunch or quiet weekday afternoon might be a better time to visit."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-10-08,3.0,"Was referred to this place by the concierge at the hotel we stayed in, in Tribeca: Walker Hotel at 77 walker st.  Its only been open for a month. Cant find it on yelp.  Has a sister hotel in Greenwich.  FYI Hotel was a bit hard to find and there's no parking! Rooms are really small but very modern. For one night it was fine.

Anyway, the guys at the front desk were very friendly and said we should try the fiat cafe. We walked about 15 mins or so and had an ok breakfast. Very cute and quaint cafe.

I ordered the spinach and goat cheese omelet. Pretty basic, but seemed a little greasy.

If Im ever back in NYC, not sure i would return there for breakfast, maybe lunch or dinner."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-04-05,5.0,"No complain at all. Everything is so great. Me and my friend chose to come in at a Monday night, which is a great idea. Not busy or crowded, nice and easy vibe to enjoy a wonderful meal. The pappardelle I had is amazing, and the service is attentive and friendly. Cute decoration and homey environment. Can't wait to go back again.
P.S. it's cash only, which may bring you some inconvenience."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-06-17,4.0,"Yet another cute little breakfast/brunch spot in Little Italy. On a Saturday morning it was only about half full, which was very different than most places nearby. The smoked salmon benedict was very tasty and the coffee was great. I was definitely happy with the food and service and will absolute go there again if it's going to be that much less crowded than everywhere else!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-07-20,5.0,"Excellent cafe. The wife and I stopped in for brunch and were very pleased. We had wheat toast with poached eggs, cream cheese, and salmon. Very good. Also had pancakes that were super fluffy and tasty. And a treat on the house."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-11-18,4.0,"This place is so great!! Very small, tight tables and byob. But the food is delicious and reasonable. The service is great as well. They serve brunch and dinner. I went for brunch. I had salmon on toast with poached eggs. Light yet filing. The coffee constantly flowed and was delicious!! Highly recommend this place! I look forward to returning for dinner sometime."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-12-17,4.0,A cute cafe to sit and unwind. Didn't order food but had a glass of wine and sat down to people watch. I would return to try the food.
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-07-07,4.0,Great little place. Cool décor dedicated to the Fiat automobile. Breakfast was good and served hot. Servers were also friendly and attentive. This is a great option if you're staying at the Citizen M hotel on Bowery. Just a short walk.
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-10-02,5.0,"The pizza place next door doesn't serve coffee, so I popped in here for a coffee to go. Really cute little restaurant with a bit of a FIAT automobile theming. 
Friendly, efficient help. GREAT coffee. 

I ordered regular coffee, but the taste was much better than the bitter coffee from Starbucks style chains. 

Good bold flavor, without the burnt, bitter taste."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-10-21,5.0,Such a cool find. Thought it was neat because I currently drive an Alfa - which is brought to the stages by Fiat and yet the decor and the food plus awesome location were all around a wonderful experience. A big plus that they take and honor reservations too!
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2020-01-12,5.0,"A small beautiful place. 
Sat here for breakfast that each and one of the dishes was tasty, fresh, beautiful  served. 
The coffee is a real coffee. Loved it.
Will come again and will reccomend the place."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2017-12-14,3.0,"I came across Fiat Cafe on a shopping trip in Soho. The restaurant itself gives off a cute Italian vibe with vintage decor on a pink wall. It was quite empty when my friend and I walked in around 1pm on a Tuesday. 

The menu has so many options including basic breakfast & brunch (serves until 4pm yay!), sandwich, pasta, and other main entrees. I was really debating between the egg benedicts or pasta but finally went for Linguini Fini Pasta. It comes with a reasonable amount of baby clams and A LOT of linguini. Chunky bacon and chili pepper added. Frankly, I would give it 2 stars. It's very bland to my taste. However, I tried my friend's Polenta with Italian Fennel Sausage and it is surprisingly good. The sausage is fresh, paired great with tomato sauce, mushroom, onion, and creamy polenta. 

As they have so many dishes, I figure I just happened to miss a good one. The lady owner is very friendly. Price is reasonable. Large portion. 

PS: CASH ONLY! (ATM downstairs but might cost extra $). Check in on Yelp for a free dessert - highly recommended Coffee Pannacotta!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-06-13,5.0,"The good: 
We just had an arrow salad and meatballs and they were delicious. Can't wait to go back

The bad: cash only"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-07-17,4.0,"Fluffiest pancakes EVER!!!! Fresh squeeze orange juice is so refreshing first thing in the morning!! Eggs, bacon and oatmeal were also a hit with our group. Quaint location and good service. A little pricey for breakfast but it was very good!!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2017-11-13,4.0,"It started from hearing about this little cozy cafe to having dining here many times. I was glad they opened a new location in Brooklyn but unfortunately, it did not last long. What I love about this place is having brunch, lunch and dinner food at the same time. 

The whole restaurant is obviously Fiat-themed.  Small spot with a good amount of seating and tables. There's outdoor seating as well. They really try hard to get as many diners as possible so the spacing is real tight in there. Small open kitchen. Service is typically mediocre, never outstanding. 

The breakfast and brunch food is served 7 days a week and I usually go for the poached eggs with gravalox salmon, french toast, pancakes, and special pastas. Sometimes I order for pick up online when I'm more time limited. However, the order is still not ready when you arrive after a period of time. They claimed they did not see the order and started to make it after I arrived. 

CASH ONLY. The closest ATM is on the corner of the grocery store."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2017-11-21,5.0,"I ran across this cute cafe in Little Italy after deciding that a restaurant down the street wasn't worth their $$$. The prices here were very reasonable for the portion of food that you receive. The staff was friendly & the food arrived to our table in a timely manner. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs & it was extremely delicious - the noodles, the sauce, & the meatballs was well seasoned! 

The atmosphere is very casual."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-12-31,5.0,"AMAZING! what an wonderful surprise! It's NYE and no one is delivering that is close by, so I took a chance. wow! Glad I did! The orange juice was fresh and the egg sandwich was delicious!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-12-21,5.0,My favorite restaurant in Manhattan. Me and my friends have been going multiple times a year for 6 years or so. Delicious pasta. Cozy vibe. Not too expensive. Great location. No reservations tho so be strategic about timing or be prepared to possibly wait. Can't wait to go back soon!
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-11-12,5.0,"Go to restaurant for any mood. The waitresses are kind and hospitable, the food is cheap and always delicious. However, cash only, so prepare for that. The ricotta ravioli in balsamic, the simple side of pasta (w/ cheese, of course), and the specials are always my go to."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-09-09,5.0,"One of my favorite spots in Little Italy and NYC as a whole. I discovered Fiat Cafe on Yelp 2 years ago when I was looking for a place to go before San Gennaro Festival and it did not disappoint, so much so that I've been back 4 times since. I have always come with groups of 6 or more and although the restaurant is VERY small the staff is always so accommodating. I love that they take reservations directly through Yelp too. It is cash only but they have an ATM located downstairs so you can wait for the bill to know how much you need to take out. First off, the prices are amazing. The wine is so affordable and the giant portion sized dishes are all around the $11-16 price point which is almost impossible to find in NYC. Everything is authentic and the ingredients are fresh and delicious. Also, I love that they offer healthy options too because it is sometimes difficult to find something at an Italian restaurant that keeps the waist line in check. The bathroom is located down a fairly steep staircase in their basement so this is not a spot to take someone if they are handicap or have difficulty navigating stairs. Also, keep in mind that since the restaurant is so small it can get a little warm in the Summer months. Otherwise, everything about Fiat Cafe is amazing. It is charming, the staff is lovely and attentive and the food is delicious with unbeatable prices for the quality of it all!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-05-05,4.0,"This place is absolutely adorable! Love the space and very authentically Italian vibe. The service during dinner was bit slow but the waiters were kind and attentive. 

Regarding the food, everything was delicious! For an appetizer, the beef carpaccio was great. Perhaps it came with a little too much arugula but the beef was amazing. For an entree, I tried both the gnocchi with bacon and parmesan sauce as well as the carbonara special. While both were great, the gnocchi really stood out. The sauce was much lighter than expected and the bacon was INCREDIBLE! 

To top off a great meal, there was free dessert thanks to Yelp's special check-in offer. The coffee panna cotta was delicious, light, and very flavorful."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-05-21,5.0,"This place was absolutely incredible. The Italian food here somehow tastes better than any other place I've been to. The dishes are a bit pricy and this place packs up really quickly so be sure to make a reservation if you're showing up with a big group like I am. Their specials were delicious and comes with a free dessert. I ordered a spaghetti carbonara and it came with a coffee panna cotta. The pasta was cooked to a little bit past Al dente and the sauce was flavorful. The panna cotta was absolute amazing, it wasn't too sweet and it literally melted in my mouth. This place has a really great community atmosphere and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for amazing Italian food in Nolita."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-10-04,5.0,This place is so sweet. I'm plastic-free and they are so gracious about accommodating my take out orders - so rarely the case in nyc! The hostess - I'm not sure her name - is just the sweetest. The food is excellent and fresh.
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-12-28,2.0,Fiat café was not my personal favorite place to eat breakfast in the city. It was very small and we had to wait half an hour to get two separate tables because we were a party of eight. It appeared to be only two waiters and waitresses bussing tables and taking orders.  I ordered a hot chocolate and I received my hot chocolate right before we were leaving. They didn't have cheddar cheese or American cheese. They ink carried  Swiss. I  ordered a ham omelette and when I got it it tasted like artificial ham processed in a plastic machine. I ended up eating all of my sister's pancakes. I would definitely not recommend this place to eat as well as the fact that I found a lipstick mark on my friends coffee cup. However it was a cute little coffee shop.
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2017-08-11,4.0,"One of those small quaint restaurants that you stumble upon and walk away feeling so great you did. 

This is a small restaurant with about a dozen tables, very dimly lit at night, and if course the decor is all vintage Fiat cars.  

The food was superb, I had the eggplant parmigiana and my son had the gnocchi. Both were delicious. The service was fast and the staff was very attentive. Really enjoyed the cozy feel of this restaurant.

The noise level is a bit high, just be aware."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-10-08,4.0,Broccoli panini and pancakes. Breakfast all day. Super thick crusty pancakes. Panini was crunchy and tasty. Very small local restaurant.  Very friendly and quick service
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-08-05,5.0,"YUMMM! (CASH ONLY PLACE) This place is close to little Italy. The place itself is very small. Seating for 30 people or less and it's tight seating. There are few outdoor seatings. There was only one waiter working all tables but he did great. He got all our orders correct, and food came out quick. They serve brunch and dinner. I've got toast with avocado and eggs. It was very good! And their mimosa tasted like it was fresh squeezed. We also got tiramisu, and that was also amazing. There's nothing bad to comment about this place except that the space was tight. I would definitely come back here again."

20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-06-08,5.0,"A restaurant in NYC that can take a last minute reservation for 9 people on a weekend for lunch AND provides attentive service AND delicious food with no error deserves ALL THE STARS! They even provided complimentary dessert for us!

I shall be back for cute pasta dates with the bf and it will be glorious!!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-12-18,5.0,Food was amazing. Best sangria we ever had. Food is big enough to share. Too bad place is small and is cash only.
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-03-09,5.0,"My family and I decided to home to Fiat Cafe after a horrible experience at a different restaurant. Upon entering Fiat Cafe there was a strong smell of great tasting Italian food. The restaurant is small and has a comfortable atmosphere. The food, unlike the Fiat 500 is large in portions at a resonable cost. I ordered the Lasagna, while my family members ordered the Spaghetti Bolognase. We all agreed that the food was seasoned beautifully and tasted wonderful. The Fiat cafe gave my family and I a corrective experience while dining in Soho and we would definitely recommend checking Fiat Cafe out."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-06-18,5.0,"Ugh! I love this place!!! I went on a Saturday afternoon and we were able to get a table immediately. This place has such a cute little throwback vibe. Our waiter got to us immediately and my friend and I ordered our meals. She was attentive throughout our time there. The pasta were order was flavorful, delicious and a good sized portion. I also tried out their sangria which was delicious as well. If I was in this area I would definitely stop here again for quick bite of Italian. 
P.S.
It's cash only!!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2017-06-06,4.0,"Cute Italian joint with fast service and delicious homy food. We stopped by on a quiet Monday night and shared, between 2 people, an eggplant bruschetta (sweet tomato sauce but slightly on the sour side), arugula Italian ham salad with shaved parmesan, and a duck confit parpadelle.

The salad was my favorite part with perfect balance of vinaigrette. The saltiness of the ham balanced very well with the creamy cheese and fresh arugula.

The pasta sauce was great especially with the fresh pasta (on the softer side, not as al dente as other Italian joints). I wasn't a huge fan of the duck itself even though it's tender, the truffle oil overpowered the flavor and made it too salty.

Finally, check in on Yelp to get a delicious coffee pannacotta!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-06-16,4.0,"This place is adorable! The food itself is pretty standard - nothing special - but it was pretty cheap for the area. My friend and i stopped by at around 10 this morning, and we were seated immediately. The vibe is very much like Italy in 60s (according to my friend, who's from Italy). But be aware that it's cash only!"
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2019-07-07,1.0,"The food was just okay, but the real issue is that it's cash only. First there should not be any reason why a restaurant is cash only in today's digital age. They are only trying to save on the 3% credit card fee and make customers more inconvenient. I won't come here again because of this disregard for CX."
20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2017-02-22,4.0,"Downright charming, and with a healthy dose of ""just off the boat"" charisma from the staff and the proprietor (who MUST have been that guy who flat out said ""no pictures"" when I was lining up my iPhone to capture the diminutive kitchen I had to walk through to hit the john, located in the basement - right next to the wall-mounted ATM placed inconveniently at shoulder-level for guests arriving sans cash (the only form of payment accepted here).

From apps to doppio, everything good - AND reasonably priced!

Cozy.

20,fiat-cafe-new-york,2018-06-19,3.0,"We ordered 2 carbonara spaghetti and a red sangria. 
Let me start it off with the service. 
The server is a really nice lady, she let us took our time to order & eats. 
They begin with serving us with some bread! The bread deserves ONE star! Tasteless, dry, hard and cold! I would not recommend even serving that at all, it's a waste of food. 
The drink sangria was alright not the best I have but worth the price. 
Carbonara spaghetti comes in a good portion that i can share with my boyfriend, but it is not creamy like the traditional one, instead it is very cheesy & salty. However, i will gave them credit on the nicely done egg and freshly good pasta. 
I don't see anything special that can make me come back again! 
Oh and it's cash only!!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-03-08,5.0,"Honestly, I have to give it up to Nick (Nic?) who helped me out at Grey Dog. 

Of course, the food is amazing, even the things that seem simple (hello kale caesar salad!) will surprise and delight you. Almost everything is a winner and they've elevated a lot of dishes with thoughtful additions (crunchy chick peas in a caesar, I could go on and on about this darn salad and like, it's salad for goodness sake.) The food is always tasty and as such is a staple for lunch and dinner at our office nearby. Sometimes great restaurants require that you're eating in-person to really enjoy the good food because it won't travel well but Grey Dog really holds up (solid/smart packaging and prep) and is one of our favorites for that reason.

So why do I, and my whole office, love Nick? He went above and beyond when we had some issues with our delivery order to make sure we were happy across multiple calls. Basically, at some point the channel I was supposed to get support from was from my carrier service, Nick and the restaurant didn't even have our address or other information to help. But when we found that we weren't going to get any support, I had a final desperate call to the restaurant and they came to our aid (it was a bunch of us working late and starving.) He didn't need to help us honestly, but he did, and it really made our night. That kind of service is becoming harder to find in the city and you've really officially gotten a bunch of Grey Dog fans for life now. Thanks to that whole team!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-03-01,5.0,"This was my second time visiting the restaurant and it was just the way I remembered it. The food was well seasoned and my eggs over easy were perfect. The decor and aura makes it the perfect brunch spot to start your lazy Sunday or festive Saturday. I would recommend this place any day. 

I had the Grey Dog's breakfast with pancakes. Yummmm. The best part of this dish was the home fries. I'm not sure how they get there potatoes so perfect but they do. My friend had the same with French toast. 
I have nothing bad to say about any of the food. Just about to end this review and didn't talk about the mimosas that we had!!! Orange pineapple with some really good bubbles. Not to mention they have four other flavors of juice to choose from. If this wasn't enough .. you just gotta go!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-02-06,1.0,"There was a table available so they let the 3 of us sit down first while we waited for our friend. We each got up to order individually and half-way through (when our friend arrived) the lady scolded my friends for ordering individually, saying ""I'd rather you be here for 45 minutes than 2 hours."" Snatched the menu from my friend and told her to wait in line to decide what she wanted. 

Food was average."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-12-27,4.0,"Great brunch spot if you're on a time crunch! 

Order at the counter, head to the self-seating, then the waiter/waitress will serve your order when it's ready. Their breakfast sandwiches are pretty good and fairly priced of $12-15 and come with side options of salad, home fries or fruits. 

I personally ordered the grilled chicken press and the egg white and avocado sandwich. I loved how the chiabata bread for the grilled chicken press is well toasted and crispy with a well amount of chicken. They also weren't cheap on the avocado! Finally a place that serves enough avocado that covers the bread! Service is great and there is a average amount of seating available. 

There is a also a clean bathroom--always a plus! 

Food and pricing: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 5/5

21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-10-14,4.0,"Lovely little place for brunch. I came here on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. There were a lot of people there but we were able to find a seat right away. This place is self-seating, so best to claim a table and then order your food at the counter.

I ordered the grilled chicken press and sweet potato and kale soup. I wasn't sure if I would like the soup, but it was good!! Chili vibes but a healthier alternative. Sandwich was also delicious, nice and crispy toasted bread. They also have frosé and other brunch drinks. I saw juices there available for mimosas. Coffee and tea on the menu as well. These drinks looked yummy but I opted out.

After ordering, they bring your food to you and will take your plates when you're finished. They have a self-serve water, condiment, utensil station. Help yourself! Would definitely come here again if I'm in the area."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-12-23,4.0,"After hearing multiple positive feedbacks, I finally decided to come with a few of my friends! At first, I was very confused as to how the system worked as no one was there to greet us in the front. But we caught up and for those first-timers, you order first and then go and find a seat!! They'll bring the food right after. All the utensils, condiments and water are in the back and is self- serve. There were a lot of people when we went as it was lunch hours. 

I was torn between the Grey Dog breakfast and the Club (which was $13.50 not including tax and tips), but I ordered the latter. It came in a decent amount of time. The sauces- honey mustard, tomato and mayo were perfectly fused and it was very saucy to the taste buds! It also came with a side of home cut fries or a ""cute salad."" I chose the fries (obviously, haha) But the fries were on the saltier end. My friends who ordered the same thing can also attest to that as well. The sourdough bread was very crunchy and fresh, so that was a plus. Also, coffee is unlimited refills! They're super nice about it too, just go up to the counter and ask!

The interior is super cute and antique! I really dig the Michigan flag (does anyone know what the story behind that is!) 

Overall, this is a very ambient place for you to catch a quick bite with a friends and catch up over unlimited refills of coffee!! The prices are decent for what we can find in Soho. I would consider coming back if I am craving for a good sandwich, however, it wouldn't be my go to if I want to find a cheap bite."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-12-15,4.0,"What a great find!  The menu offers a wide variety of savory and sweet, healthy (one salmon & arugula bowl) and homey (omelettes and home fries) as well as fresh juices and local brews.   My bestie had the avocado, salmon & arugula salad with poached egg and I had the Upstate omelette with butternut squash, mushroom and goat cheese.  Both of our dishes were delightfully yummy with the perfect portion size. 

The cafe is charming and quite busy with an order at the counter, then find a table - type of service.  But don't let that discourage you!  At 11am on a Sunday the guys at the door helped us claim a table and the food came out hot and quick.  

This was a fun find with great service and tasty food.  It's a ""come back"" restaurant, fo' sho!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-11-12,3.0,Foods not bad here. Decent food for the price. Nice place to hangout and get a quick bite. First time here. Will try to visit here again
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-10-26,4.0,There was a long line when we walked in but the wait was fast.. it was less than ten minutes and we got a table. Great for brunch/lunch. 7/10
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-03-31,4.0,"I've been to Grey Dog many times, but never got the chance to yelp it until now.

The Grey Dog was about a street away from the 6 train that was right on Spring Street. If you liked, this place was about three streets from the Broadway-Lafayette subway station, where you'd have access to the B, D, F, and M.

This place was a self-service type of restaurant, so you'd order first and seat yourself (only if the place wasn't busy). You'd have to get utensils and water by yourself.

This place was great for breakfast and lunch. I've never been here for dinner, so I can't say much about that. On the menu, it had french toast, pancakes, salads, omelettes, tacos, sandwiches, burgers, fries, rice, and drinks such as coffee, juice, tea, soft drinks, and beer. **TIP: Free refills for coffee.

Two items that I remembered liking were the Grey Dog's Breakfast ($14.50+tax) and the Grey Dog Club ($13.50+tax) that was served with either fries or salad. Both were very filling to the stomach.

It was the other day that I came here for breakfast on a weekday with a group of three at around 10am. It wasn't crowded at that time of the day, so we sat ourselves down at an empty table before getting up to order our food.

I had to get the Grey Dog's Breakfast again. For the Grey Dog's Breakfast, you had the choice of eggs any style (sunny side up, scrambled, poached, etc. [you name it!]), french toast or pancakes; bacon, sausage or avocado. It also came with home fries.

I got the Grey Dog's Breakfast with sunny side up eggs, french toast, sausage, and home fries, which filled me up for the whole day. The sausage was juicy. The french toast was warm and tasty when you spread butter and dipped it into the small cup of maple syrup. I didn't like the crust of the french toast because it was dry. The home fries had no flavor and I'd suggest you to dip it in ketchup. I saved the sunny side up eggs for last and it was eggcellent.

Overall, I highly recommend this place. You would leave this place feeling stuffed and satisfied."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-11-08,5.0,"A nice and cozy place for small groups of people. I was greeted by a very nice gentleman who explained how the food ordering process works. When you enter the restaurant, you have to order your food first, pay, and then find your own table so it's pretty much a free for all. They have a good amount of selections to choose from. I went with the steak and egg which is on the breakfast menu (*they have breakfast all day so that really got me!*) and I went with a coke as a drink. 

The food came at a good amount of time (approx. 10 mins) and it was good enough for me to devour. I just wish the burger I ate had more ingredients. I also got it with a side of their home fries which were BOMB! I paid a total of $17 (food+drink). 

Would definitely come back when I have cravings for anything on their menu!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-09-15,5.0,"Great service! The food was really good, decent brunch prices for Soho, and the environment was super friendly. I got the guacamole & bacon grilled cheese with a salad which was super yummy. We got a seat on a Sunday afternoon which was nice! I love highly recommend this location!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-02-24,3.0,"First time at Grey Dog for brunch and was a bit disappointed. I've been here before just for drinks later at night and always had a positive experience. Unfortunately the brunch food does not shine.

I went for the omelette and my girlfriend ordered a pumpkin seed muffin and breakfast tacos. The omelette was over cooked, failing to have the fluffy interior that properly cooked eggs should have. The tacos were subpar, soggy tortillas with barely any sausage after ordering ++sausage.

The only redeeming order here was the pumpkin seed muffin. For those reading this, I would suggest sticking to the drinks and pastries. I've had the cookies and muffins here and they are all delicious!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-09-29,5.0,"Amazing place, service is excellent and the food was wonderful 
They explained me about the food before taking order. And once got the food they came to my table and checked about the food, not just one stuff but everyone. The commitment is amazing. Last but not least the place is so cool, very energetic and entertaining"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-06-16,4.0,"Went here for brunch on a Sunday. It was crowded, but the way it's set up makes the wait really doable. They have a decent sized menu with lots of options for breakfast and lunch. I ordered the breakfast tacos and my partner ordered the fried chicken and egg breakfast sandwich. Everything looks really good and the service was quick. The staff were sweet and super helpful. 
The breakfast tacos were scrambled eggs in a tortilla and I got a side of home fries. The sandwich was fried chicken, fried egg and he got bacon added into it. 
The tacos were okay, the were exactly how you'd expect them to taste. The sandwich was incredible though. The chicken was super crispy and delicious. Overall, the place is solid. There are plenty of brunch places downtown, so I wouldn't say it's the best especially for the price."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-05-23,2.0,"I like the idea of this place, but it didn't meet my expectations. The menu is good, and the service is just okay. The prices are fair. I ordered the grey dog's breakfast, which is eggs, bacon, french toast, potatoes. The main problem was that the food was barely luke-warm when I got it, and the french toast wasn't thoroughly cooked."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2018-12-11,4.0,"Went here for breakfast with a few friends on a weekday. This has a nice vibe, cool flags/streamers/plants hanging from the ceiling and lots of wall art. We had no problem finding an empty table, but I imagine it could get busy on the weekends. 

In regards to food, there's definitely something for everyone as they had breakfast plates, sandwiches, salads, and assorted pastries. We tried the Grey Dog breakfast with french toast and sausage, the grey dog club, and a blueberry scone. There was a short wait and then the waiter dropped our food right at our table. Everything was solid, although no particular standouts. But definitely great coffee!

Overall, nice spot to meet friends for a casual breakfast. I liked the selection and the eclectic feel of the cafe."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-01-29,5.0,"What can I say. The French Toast is A M A Z I N G. The fries are really good, their unique butter is a so cute. 
Cozy atmosphere; was easily able to spend 4 hours here. Really sweet waitstaff. 
What more do you want?"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-06-13,5.0,"Excellent place food options fabulous I'm
Gluten free they had nice choices. 

Friendly staff it's like a deli you have to order at the counter but they will bring your food to you"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-05-30,5.0,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in the city! Not only is the food really good, but the hospitality of the workers is always really great and they give off such positive vibes.

Every time I come here with my friends we always have a really good time. This location in particular is in a really great neighborhood, if you sit in the area by the window you get a really nice feel of the environment. Another thing I like about this place is that it's not a wait service restaurant. Meaning you go to the counter inside and place your order there and then pay and then you pick a table and just wait for the food to be brought to you. This is so much more convenient because sometimes it's a little tedious having to flag your waiter doubt it or look for them so you can place your order.

Overall I love food and atmosphere here and always look forward to eating here."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-10-23,5.0,The Grey Dog cafe has the hipster vibe that I was looking for within the city. I've been to many brunch places before but it just doesn't give off a vibe as youthful as The grey dog. There are paintings hung on the wall that are up for sales which kinda amazes me because I've never seen places do that. But overall great environment. The system of The Grey Dog Cafe is to first grab a seat/menu then get online to order the food and a waitress will say your name and bring it to you when it's ready. The food was amazing and tasty as well! I had one of the breakfast platters as well as the warm bowls also can't forget about the French toast! The French toast was nice and buttery and tasted like a glazed donut which surprised me! It comes with a blueberry jam that I BELIEVE is homemade ( I could be wrong). The breakfast plate was tasty and can be shared with two people and still be satisfying! I would recommend this place if you're looking for a spot to just sit and enjoy some nice brunch!
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-01-11,4.0,"Such a great place to eat with friends. Interesting dining option where u order at front and they bring food out for you. Great menu selection. Only complaint is their ""cheese fries"" are disappointing AF. Regular fries are $5.24 and for like 2.50 more u get shredded microwaved cheese on top. Also a small ass portion of fries for almost $8...."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-02-03,5.0,Love this place and everyone so nice there! The food's pretty good too. The mulled wine in the winter is great and great breakfast too!
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2018-09-18,4.0,"Very cool atmosphere with a chill vibe. Stopped in here just for drinks and had a nice time. The frosia was very good and would highly recommend. 
Didnt get any food but everything looked great. Id definitely recommend trying this spot out!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-02-17,4.0,"In my opinion this place is not good for large crowds. Majority of the seats here is for two people. It's very hipster with the crowd being in there 18-29 age range. Music is not overly blasting but it's above average but it suits this place. The music somewhat drown out the conversation so you have a lil privacy. They do have draft beer (limited) with a coffee service too. It stays busy here with at least 8 ppl constantly in line to either order or to be seated. From the outside it looks small but it's spacious in its own ways. Their is a back section but I didn't go back their since I ordered to go. 

Note: chicken tenders only comes with 3 pieces. So if your hungry, order 3 orders of chicken tenders but they are delicious tho."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-03-11,4.0,"I love the atmosphere here. It definitely has a hipster vibe but still very cozy and simple. The food didn't blow me away but it was good. I ordered the upstate omelette which was unique and the ingredients paired well. My boyfriend custom made an omelette with bacon, swiss and onion. The eggs were overdone and the jam for the toast seemed like it came right out of a jar of smuckers. Aside from that, I'm giving it 4 stars for the awesome service and overall fun dining experience."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-02-15,3.0,"The atmosphere is cool and they have some unique options for both food and drink.

My roommate and I popped in on a weekend afternoon and needed some delicious carbs.

She got the burger, which was very good. It was cooked to both our liking, and I would definitely order again.

I opted for the french toast- quite lack luster and un-impressive.
The berry butter was odd and didn't compliment the toast well.

Overall, it wasn't a bad experience but it wasn't memorable. 

3/5"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-03-02,5.0,"If you're looking for an amazing place to eat, you've found it! I went there for brunch with my family and a family friend, and it was outstanding! Such a fun little place. I am gluten free, and was delighted to know there are so many GF options. I ordered the Challah French Toast with Strawberries. Delicious, soft bread with ripe strawberries. Highly recommend!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-02-09,5.0,"This place never lets us down. The service is so sharp and the food is so good. They have small litTle plates and they have big meals.

21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-02-20,5.0,Nikki there is a rockstar.  Above and beyond customer service and the food is killer.  Really rare to find a spot in Soho that has a hometown vibe but Grey Dog does it.
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-07-28,4.0,"We came here for brunch on a Sunday. It was my first time here - and it was confusing that you order first and then someone finds you a table. I don't think it says anywhere, or I just didn't look. But this place is super popular. I got a cold brew and kale spicy salad. My friend got iced tea and croissant sandwich. We both really enjoyed our meal. I'll be back for sure - it's all very casual and easy."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2018-05-09,4.0,"Ate at the grey dog's other location before and this one did not disappoint!

Homey, cozy and eclectic cafe thats good for coffee, breakfast, sandwiches and salads. The place is quite small but can fit a lot of people

Came here on a Sunday for late brunch-lunch. Found a spot as I walked in. Ordered the smoked salmon ray toast with cream cheese, capers and red onions. Was really good! I also ordered freshly squeezed orange juice that was delicious! 

You come in and order up front and then go sit and they basically call your name when everything is ready. Its pretty much self serve as you also pick up your utensils.  

Overall, I had a great time and I will come back!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2020-02-15,5.0,Good coffee and quick breakfast service at 10am on a Friday. Food is good and the vibe/music inside is very chill.
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-10-06,3.0,"My meal was delicious. But, it didn't have a nice & relaxing feel to it. Get my own menu, go to the counter to order,  get my own silverware, napkins, condiments, etc.. If I was in the mood to run around here and there fetching my own things to simply eat, I'd go get fast food. But with that being said, again, the food was very good."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-09-16,5.0,"People were very nice and seems to have positive energy about completing there tasks who h is always a + baked goods are lovely and the rustic feel is nice for a quick beer with a friend, lunch, or weekend bunch/breakfast."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-02-20,5.0,"Breakfast bowl has it all! Butternut squash was out of control good. I'm from LA and this healthy fresh combo was a little taste of home. Hit the spot. Place is hip little joint and the staff couldn't be friendlier. 

The lady friend got the egg white sandwich with avocado and she was a big fan as well. We came hungry we left completely satisfied! Highly recommend."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-05-07,5.0,I loved it here! The only thing that was weird was the salad they gave me needed acidity so badly that I asked for straight balsamic vinegar. I added bacon to the salad I got for more protein and I highly recommend it. The servers were really sweet and answered all my questions! Great place for a salad or sandwich in Nolita. I'll be back!
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2018-11-11,5.0,Good and healthy! They get packed but service is quick. This is a great place for a quick and casual brunch or lunch. The restaurant is also very considerate and aware of allergies. They have many vegan and gluten free options.
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-09-15,4.0,"My first time here I came around 3pm it was pretty packed but it was fast to get seated. When you go in, you order and pay first then sit down. The service was great, all the employees were really friendly and open to giving a lot of suggestions. I got the grey dog breakfast, the home fries were my fave. I also got the iced matcha latte, it was pretty bland, I could barely taste the matcha but my friend got a mint iced tea and that was really refreshing. My other friends got the zucchini spaghetti and guacamole and bacon grilled cheese. COME CHECK THIS PLACE OUT IF YOU HAVENT BEEN YET!!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-04-27,3.0,"I had the Grey Dog Club ($13.50) with fries on sourdough. It's pretty solid but there are loads of more innovative sandwich places in the neighborhood. But, if you're in the mood for just a solid, fatty lunch sandwich, the club is a good choice."

21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-06-22,2.0,"I ordered a fried chicken sandwich. My friends food came earlier than mine though I ordered before them. I thought it might be due to the time it takes to fry the chicken. However by the time I got my food, it didn't fell like it's freshly made. The temperature was almost cold. The chicken's batter was burned, black and dry but not hot. Same with the fries. It makes me wonder if they just reheat it with the microwave. 
They are lucky that I did not complain on the spot because we were really hungry so we just finished the food. 
But with this quality and price I think I could have gone to shake shack and have better stuff."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-10-19,2.0,"I've been here so many times and the food has been really good but today I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and honestly I was disappointed. The bread wasn't soft, the cheese wasn't meland the sandwich was dry. I ate it because I was starving but I know not to order it next time."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-05-13,4.0,"Heard about this place & decided to check it out on a Saturday. It was around 1 in the afternoon. I decided to order in advance via yelp. My food was done in the stated amount of time (30 mins). Restaurant was easy to find but set up was a bit confusing. You basically
walk into a long and rowdy take out line before you get to online/takeout area. Food was decent but definitely overpriced. It was approximately $14 for 3 chicken tenders & a handful of fries. Probably wouldn't go there again for that reason but the food was decent but nothing to rave about."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-02-20,5.0,"Discovered this place randomly, but so glad I did! The staff was so friendly, and they make one heck of a chai latte. Now I just need to find a dog paw stencil to take back to Texas.."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2017-12-02,3.0,"Dang!  Wanted to like this place.  But... they forgot our order. Yup. We paid, they lost it.  We sat for waaaayyy to long before approaching the cash desk to inquire what happened.  

So, thumbs down for the service.

The food was fine.  Nothing spectacular, but edible.  My croissant sandwich was hard to eat- the bottom half of bread was sliced way too thin and couldn't hold the contents.  So, it was a messy bite.

The coffee was terrible!  I can't understand why a few people on Yelp had good things to say on the coffee.

If you are a fan of Michigan (the state and the football team), you may like this place for its tribute to the state."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2018-08-26,4.0,"Some friends from Atlanta came here to chill
So we decided to eat and go get our fill

We are still new transplants, at a loss for suggestions
So we had few options when our friends asked food questions

So we went over to Ruby, on Mulberry Street
To catch up on life, and catch some good eats

But ho! On our way, a sign caught our eye
""Peach Rosés!"" It said, and we hurried inside

The place is real comfy, but you shouldn't settle down
They have lots of signs saying ""no laptops"" around

But the staff was real sweet, and service was fast
This was a fun place to take friends, at long last

The food itself was good but... Let me be heard
The bread/sandwich ratio was completely absurd!

The sandwich was good, I swear it was tasty
But the whole time I thought I was eating a pastry

So for all you bread lovers, wine-os and people meh about trends
The Grey Dog is a great place for a quick lunch with your friends"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2018-08-16,4.0,"A cute place for brunch by Soho! You walk in and order at the counter before finding a table, which could be difficult during peak brunch hours. Luckily, an employee was nice enough to reserve us a table while we were ordering. The interior definitely had hipster vibes with the wooden furniture, plants and wall art. For food we got Challah French Toast ($11.50) which came in a decent sized portion. I loved how the toast slices were thick and the berry butter was delicious. We also tried the sour apple and warm Brie sandwich ($12.50) with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was good, but not anything to write home about. The fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned. Overall, it always a great meal that's affordable for Manhattan!"
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-01-20,5.0,Awesome breakfast! Can't go wrong with the Grey Dog breakfast. French toast was fluffy and flavorful. Great ambiance overall

21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2017-10-11,4.0,"LOVE LOVE LOVEEED the seared tuna salad it was just the right amount of protein to meat and a generous helping of avocado which i love. My friends ordered the salmon tacos which which pretty good but basically tasted the same as my salad (i would order the salad but we tried to order different dishes) but it came with a side salad which was tasty with their dressing and another ordered the locs on toast which they also gave a decent amount of. Between the 3 of us it was pretty filling which surprised me but this is a great little brunch spot to hit up with small groups. Felt super healthy to us which was the goal. 

You basically go to the counter and order then they bring your dish to your table. You need to get your own utensils and water though. Really enjoyed the vibes there not crowded at all but not a big restaurant so you may need to fight for a table depending on day/time."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2018-07-12,3.0,"This is a cool chill spot to grab some food with friends or even something while you're on the go maybe. You pay for your food in advance at the counter. They have a pretty broad selection. I grabbed the Reuben and it was just decent. My friend swears by the Cuban press though.

Overall great atmosphere but the food I had was just ok. Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not but if I'm in the neighborhood definitely don't mind popping in again and trying something else on the menu."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-07-02,5.0,I came here with a group of friends all of us visiting from Miami for world pride. We all felt in love with this place we visited it two times during our stay. The food is fresh all made to order my favorite where the pancakes and I added bananas and love the fact that it actually comes with maple syrup. This places is in my favorite list on yelp for my nyc bookmark. I'm definitely coming back on my next NY visit.
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-10-22,4.0,"I tried the grilled chicken press and loved it! I got the fries with it, they were good but way too salty. I had to get my food to go so I don't know how it is to eat there but I hope to try eating there some time soon."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-09-27,5.0,Really great place for brunch. Servers are nice and the berry butter that comes with their french toast is great. The first visit was a little confusing with the way you order but the food found us!
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2017-04-22,3.0,"Grey Dog is smartly decorated in a homey college casual kind of way.  It has exposed brick walls, whimsical wall art and rustic funky wood tables that creates a produced dive bar theme that's clean, digestible and full of yuppies. 

This swallow-ability spans from the sincere and friendly approachable staff to the very wallet friendly menu - a real shocker for this Nolita neighborhood.   A cheeseburger with fries for $13?    Upgrade to sweet potato fries for $1?  

The gimmicky punch soon came to my table.  I was still surprised to find the burger patties looking Sysco preformed, with the requisite lack of flavor.   I actually almost didn't even eat the burger.   The sweet potato fries were decent.  After tax and tip my burger and a coke cost $19.

This grey dog Location has a fun hyped basic quality that feels touristy but is mostly locals.   

The restaurant is counter order and then served at your table.  It wasn't too busy for Saturday brunch - we ordered and were sat within 10 minutes.  It seems like a good generic safe spot for families or naive college students  - but I didn't think the food was all that."

21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2019-10-18,5.0,Amazing place! Great food and service. We walked in and they were able to save us a table while we stood in line. They also were able to get us extra coffee and orange juice without us having to go stand in line again!
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2018-12-14,3.0,"I stopped in here for brunch today and left a bit disappointed. I ordered a burger which, while tasty, was underweight for my liking and the brioche bun that it was served on didn't seem fresh. The string fries that it was served with were also very ordinary. One thing I did appreciate was the option to put goat cheese on your burger for +$1. This, plus the grilled onion saved it from being terrible. My friend ordered a veggie omelet and also felt that it was just middle of the road, nothing special. Other things to note are that you have to serve yourself salt, pepper, napkins, utensils, water, condiments, etc, and there's only one bathroom in the restaurant. Probably wouldn't return."
21,the-grey-dog-nolita-new-york-3,2018-05-30,4.0,"The way this place is set up makes for faster service. You order first, then sit down and they waitstaff will bring your food. The portion sizes are big at a very good price!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-03-07,5.0,"I have heard about Bibble & Sip for a while now and had been DYING to go if only to see their cute little macarons! I came here for breakfast and got a lavender latte, another specialty coffee, a little tarte, and three little character macarons! I had so much fun getting a years worth of sugar into one little breakfast but it was so worth it. The desserts are so cute and the drinks were delicious. 

The overall aesthetic is so cute, clean, and crisp. They also have a little seating and clean bathroom to use here as well. I can't wait to come back here again and try more of their delicious little snacks in the future. 

12/10 I'm a fan for life."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-03-15,4.0,"Such a cute little coffee shop!

I love the alpaca decorations and the desert collection. NYC is never short of coffee places, but i always went back for Bibble and Sip because of consistency on both coffee and desert. The some-what asian inspiration contributes to a very interesting menu.

What i love the most is the desert selection: the cream puffs and egg tart! Matcha cream puff has been my all time fav. It has a nice crispy layer on top, sprinkled with matcha powder, which provides a nice contrast with the matcha cream inside. it is not too sweet or not too heavy, goes well with a cup of iced coffee.

I love dropping by whenever i walk past this place. it always brighten up my mood."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-03-09,4.0,"Saw their instagram and wanted to come check out the macrons in person!! This place was on my top priority list to visit in NY! 

The location was not very big so there was not much room for seating. The decorations were very nice of course! 

We got a few boxes of the Valentine's Day boxes for souvenirs for family and friends. It was perfect that it came in that container so that it made it easy for travel. The overall macrons in the box were cute in designs, but I was not amazed with the taste. 

The lucky alpaca is a must get!! It's super cute and it tastes really good!!!

Milk Tea Tart: I thought this was very interesting and good! Give this desert a try if you come here and it is still available. 

All the desserts look soooo cute!!! Though the price was a bit pricy it was still worth it if it's once in a while spending. 

Go get some macrons"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-06-08,5.0,One of the best cream puffs I have ever tasted. Love going to Bibble and Sip in Chinatown from the convience of traveling from Brooklyn to Manhattan. I love their cream puffs because they have a variety of flavors that I can choose from. I highly recommend this place. Good quality place to hang out and relax.
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-02-17,5.0,"ALPACAS!!!!! 5 stars for the good taste in mascot/spirit animal alone. 

Joke aside, the cream puffs were amazing. We tried the black sesame and Thai tea ones and enjoyed both. Black sesame was light and subtle; Thai tea was a bit sweeter and topped with a layer of crumb that reminded us of Oreos. 

I think these cream puffs are better than the ones at Keki's Modern Cakes: the size is larger, the crust is more brittle (Keki's is a bit soggy), and the dome is also higher and rounder, allowing for more cream, with which the puffs are filled up generously.

Cute interior, not too big of a place - can sit around 10 people, and has a bathroom."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-01-12,4.0,"Such a cute little cafe in the heart of Chinatown. I attempted to go to another place for ube cream puffs but apparently they wouldnt be ready until 11 AM. Looked on Yelp and re-discovered this cafe I saved previously. 

We went with the Matcha cream puff and Thai tea cream puff. They were HUGE with a light outer shell easy to bite into. The matcha cream puff had just the right amount of match so it wasnt overbearing.  The Thai tea cream puff was the same but had this really nice fudge-like   coating topped with oreo crumbs. Neither were overly sweet which I have a greater appreciation for the older I get.

I noticed the beautiful and intricate macarons in the case. I SO wanted to take some home but I was full and macarons seem to lose their freshness quickly. I will certainly be back to test out how good the macarons are."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-12-08,5.0,"A must try cafe if you're in the area!! 

I've been to the location at 52nd when they first opened and I have always loved bibble and sip since so I have been very excited to try this place since it's closer to where I live!

It's a small cafe but it still feels very spacious. It can probably seat up to 10 people but it may feel crowded. I came around 5PM on a Wednesday so there was no one there. There's outlets near every table which is very convenient if you're looking to do work! 

I got the matcha jasmine latte with soy milk and it was absolutely delicious. Matcha lattes are generally just okay to me but this one blew my expectations. The matcha was not grainy and the drink itself is subtlety sweet. The jasmine flavor is also there but does not overpower the drink. I highly recommend trying this drink out!! They also have a bunch of cute desserts out on display so I will have to go back and try them out!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-02-18,5.0,"If you are looking for a cute little café with desserts and coffee, this is your place in Chinatown. Thankfully when we came there, there was not a line. Since the shop is a little small, majority of the seats were taken but I'm glad we got the last table for two. I definitely recommend the lavender latte, and the cute tarts with macaroons. Service was a breeze, I would definitely recommend coming here!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-10-17,5.0,"I'm in New York purely to eat. This was my first stop - I was craving a matcha cream puff since I don't see them often. I had no idea they also had black sesame baked goods! Why does no one focus on these?! These are even more difficult to find, and I think the flavor is so beautiful - nutty, sweet, and in this case just a hint of salt to make it pop. The lychee mousse was the highlight. Chunks of lychee fruit, matched with delicate berry chocolate, and the tiniest macaroon!! I also tried the pikong duck coffee, made with coffee, oolong tea and condensed milk. It was only alright, the flavors compete, not something I would get again.  

They also have WiFi, so it's a nice place to break away for a couple hours."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-10-22,5.0,"Pure bliss is the state you reach when you bite into a cream puff from Bibble & Sip. The light, flaky, puff exterior easily gives way for the cool, not too sweet custard inside. Flavors like matcha, thai tea, and black sesame each hit just the right notes of sweet and bitter, making for a multi-dimensional flavor profile. I could easily eat a handful of these and feel no regrets.

They make lots of other treats, like mousse cakes shaped like piglets and macarons made to look like llama faces and the Miyazaki character Totoro. The asian girl in me cannot resist. Everything here is adorable.

My passion fruit iced tea was as refreshing as I had hoped, and just lightly sweetened. They have a tasty looking egg sandwich and jalapeno cheddar cornbread that I need to get my grubby paws on stat. Bibble & Sip is such a delight."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-09-22,3.0,"This is a quant little shop, very clean and welcoming so one star for that. 

Another star for the guy who took my order because he was very patient and helpful as I decided which treats to pick up. Customer service is definitely NOT lacking. 

Plus another star for a range of baked goods in unique flavors. I loved their fun and creative macarons too- I saw some  Lucky Alpaca (a character pun of Lucky Cat"" and Tortoro character macarons.


I came here for their cream puffs, unfortunately the quality was not up to par. I brought an Earl Grey and Matcha flavored cream puff today and drove home before eating them. The filling was already watery and runny. I bet they would have tasted amazing if I ate them at the bakery or right after the puffs were made. The shell was soggy, and with no crisp. So disappointed!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-12-11,5.0,"Really happy that they have opened a location in Chinatown as it is more accessible to me since I visit Chinatown more often than their original location. This location has really cute seats and tables for one to enjoy a bite of the dessert or pastry with a drink. 

I have visited this location a few times and have tried the earl grey, matcha, and coconut thai tea cream puffs. Each of the cream puffs are very big and full of cream inside. The earl grey cream was light and refreshing. The matcha cream was not too bitter so there was a good balance of sugar in it. And finally, the coconut thai cream puff was not too sweet as thai tea can be quite sweet at times. Not sure if coconut milk was used in the cream itself, but there was coconut flakes sprinkled on top with coconut flavored whipped cream. I have not tried any of the drinks here yet, but my friend had when we came together and ordered a cup of coffee and didn't have any complaints about it. 

Overall, it is one of the first places I stop by if I want a sweet pastry. I recommend coming here to try their cream puffs and with a small group of friends at most as seating can be limited during rush hours."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-10-07,5.0,"I'M OUT HERE SUPPORTING BIBBLE AND SIPS NEW CHINATOWN LOCATION. 
If anyone ever asks me whats my favorite dessert place is in NYC... It's B&S. 
Every dessert they make is cute AF and not overly sweet. The flavors are balanced, with a little bit of tartness. The pastries all have unique flavors , with an Asian twist added :) 
The matcha cream puffs and black sesame croissants (idk if they still have these) are UNRIVALED."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-10-17,4.0,"Stopped here a few months back after coming across it on one of my MANY yelp searches. The cafe was pristine and modern in decor, at the time I think it might have only recently opened (from the success of their other location). Staffs were very friendly and knowledgeable when asked for recommendations, orders were prepared promptly. 

We ordered the iced matcha latte, and a few of their cream puffs. Firstly, I was disappointed with the matcha latte, especially since it was on the pricier side. It lacked substance, the matcha flavour barely existent, would not recommend it. 

Their cream puffs were rockin' though, I've never come across a cream puff so generous with filling which was so velvety smooth and delicious. The sheer size of the cream puffs were almost overwhelming, I'd suggest sharing it between 2 people or eating it quarter by quarter as it can feel dense sitting in your tummy (....I ate mine solo in one sitting....). Definitely redeemed my initial letdown :)

They have the standard menu of hot and cold beverages and a good selection of cute, decadent desserts (I think I remember seeing a pikachu macaroon xD) at reasonable prices. 

Worth a stop by if you're looking for a trendy cafe experience and are already in the area."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-11-30,5.0,"Pretty late to the hype but I love their cream puffs! I got the matcha cream puff and it was so good. The inside is stuffed with matcha flavored cream that's so soft and not sweet at all. It really tastes like  matcha and the bitterness really tells that they've used good matcha. Also the cream puff itself is so soft and when you bite in it all comes out! 

Highly recommended and the seating is great there are srudents studying and it is good for families as well. The workers were really friendly as well!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-09-05,5.0,"Mmm that creme brûlée egg tart! It's warm and soft and gooey yet surrounded by a flaky crispy crust. It's creamy with a hint of creme brûlée flavor. I love a good egg tart and any twist to the original egg tart..I'm all over it! 

The earl grey London float was the perfect pair to the egg tart. It was sweet but not overly sweet with a taste of earl grey but creamy like a warm milk tea. My favorite foods are anything that has a fusion or a unique twist and both pieces hit those notes!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-01-14,5.0,"Bibble & Sip set their bait on a sucker like me, knowing I would bite. And guess what? I took that bite and I owned it. 

Sure, they have adorable, quirky and beautiful baked goodies and treats. That's what lured me to walk 5 blocks in the first place. But did you know that those goodies and treats are also delicious and fresh as well? 

Well they are! 

My Lucky Alpaca macaron put a lil' extra swagger in my step that day, despite facing down intense winds and 20F temps with a scarf barren neck. I may have come down with a head cold 24 hrs later, but at the time my Lucky Alpaca held me down. 

And the Hong Kong Duck latte is what has been missing in my life. Drip coffee + tea + condensed milk is perfect for a person like me that can't quite decide what I'm in the mood to drink. 

Overall, such a cute spot with lots of personality (and goodies)"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-08-13,5.0,"Look, I'm not trying to waste your time here, so I'm going to get to the point:

I don't even like cream puffs. They are literally something I would never order on my own. But a friend brought a box of these cream puffs to a dinner party, and suddenly...I like cream puffs.

Well, at least these cream puffs."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-11-19,5.0,"Such a cute place! I came here after a long three hour ride back to the city and needed a place to sit at and do work while waiting for a friend. I actually didn't know Bibble& Sip opened a new location here so I was excited to come here because the last time I had B&S was in high school when their first location had just opened. I ordered the matcha latte and earl grey cream puff. You could taste the high quality matcha they use and the cream puff was the right amount of crunchy outside with creamy inside. The earl grey and sweetness is subtle but compliments each other beautifully. Seats are limited but since traffic is mostly in and out, I was able to snag a seat. There were people chatting as well as people doing work. Despite the noise, it was still easy to focus on my work because lighting was great and the aesthetics somehow motivated me to get my work done. 

I would definitely come back again and try out the other items they have in their menu. They also have plugs for laptop and clean bathroom for customers."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-02-03,4.0,This place is really cute and cozy! I love the llama theme they have going and the art work outside the store front. I ordered the lavender latte and I really enjoyed it. The steamed milk was just right and the lavender complimented the coffee pretty well. I wish I went back to try their other drink items.
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-01-25,4.0,Cream puffs!!!! We definitely preferred the black sesame one over the matcha. The puff has a tad too much cream in my opinion. I wish there was a little more puff to balance it out. The matcha one has good matcha flavor. We also got the lychee berry. It was super tart but good. My hubby is obsessed with milk tea so i got him the milk tea tart. He said the top cream part was okay but the stand out was definitely the base cookie/cake part. Everything is super flavorful.
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-09-07,4.0,"New location alert!!

These cream puffs are most delicious when left in the fridge for a few hours, so definitely get (an extra) one to go. ;)

This place is cute and the cream puffs are super yummy. Plus their theme is alpacas. What's not to love?"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-05-31,5.0,Earl grey cream puffs are huge and delicious. Not too sweet and perfect with hot tea!!
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-01-06,4.0,Had the earl grey puff and loved it. It's one of my go-to places every time I visit the city. The filling of the cream puff was delicious. Absolutely love the earl grey one!
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-02-15,4.0,"Came in on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30PM for a mid day dessert. It was my first time at this location - used to the midtown one. It's relatively spacious but the seats/tables fill up quick.

My friend and I split the milk tea tart and lychee berry pig tart after a long deliberation since everything looked so cute and yummy. The milk tea tart was very creamy and had a strong milk tea flavor (really pleasantly surprised) - the topping a dumpling and cracks into a mousse inside with some tapioca pearls and the chocolate cake under is rather moist with an outer shortbread cookie crust. Only complaint is that it is hard to cut through, be careful not to let it splatter onto dirty surfaces - plastic knives aren't that strong. The lychee pig tart was very very cute. The top is a berry lychee mousse with lychee bits/chunks and very thin layer of matcha almond cake under. I was rather sad that there wasn't more matcha cake - the bitterness would have pierced through nicer. However, I preferred the piggy because it was lighter and more citrusy. There is also white chocolate coating at the bottom with a small macaron hat on the pig up top. 

The desserts are very cute, but pricey for $17 for two pieces. I'd like to try their Thai tea & Oreos cream puff next time and the other desserts. Puffs are their specialty but I think the others are worth a (photo) shot to try!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-09-04,5.0,"Came here 3 days in a row! This new location of Bibble and Sip on the edge of Manhattan's Chinatown and Little Italy is a great spot to grab a sweet bite, relax with friends, and do some studying. 
Sadly, there is a smaller selection of desserts compared to their other location on 51st and the cream puffs here are also slightly smaller compared to the other, the taste is still the same! The cream filling is consistent and lightweight and the crust is still light and airy. 
The jasmine matcha drink was not as good as the one I had in the other location; the ingredients were separating.
I also tried their large cookie, apple pie, and macaroons--also delicious. 

The store interior is much more comfortable and spacious than the other. Pretty large selection of seating with a bathroom and charging outlets, this cafe is once again a great spot for studying or chatting. 

I'm happy to say this is going to be one of my go-to spots for desserts and drinks, with its location being much more convenient for those in lower Manhattan!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-08-14,4.0,"Glad to see there's a Bibble & Sip in Chinatown now so I don't have to go so far to their other location.

I just so happened to stroll across them as I was walking in Chinatown one day and noticed they had Apple Lychee Pie and those are two of my favorite fruits so I had to get it. There are lychee pieces in the pie and it tastes like the canned type of lychees as it was really strong and overpowered the apples. I have no problem with canned lychees but it's the season for lychees so I wish they used fresh ones instead. The pie was good and I would get it again."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-08-28,5.0,"Bibble & Sip makes the most amazing cream puffs. I am a big fan of the earl grey ones, but they also have matcha, sesame, and coconut Thai tea. I was super excited to see they opened a downtown location because I'm never near their midtown location. This one has big window doors that open out on to Hester, making it oh so inviting. 

Seats for 14, free WiFi, outlets under the seats. Staff are awesome. Coffee is also good. AND they have a bathroom. So much win."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-12-31,4.0,"I love their original location and stopped by this one too. Everything is still super cute and yummy, but I did feel like the cream puffs at this location were less filled with cream."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-12-30,4.0,"They have good cream puffs. Not like what you'd expect- they're big and worth sharing so you can also try more of them. They're soft but crispy and moist and the filling is delicious and has a great texture- it's buttery and velvety but not overly sweet. I didn't try any of the drinks, just a regular drip coffee and it basically tasted exactly how a coffee should taste haha would come back here again to try more desserts and drinks!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-09-13,4.0,"I really like their puff.
Today I tried the Thai tea flavor, it was not bad.
But the cream was not smooth as other flavor. 
I felt I like matcha or earl grey flavor is better.
I really like their jasmine matcha latte. Usually you can get matcha latte very easily. But you can taste jasmine flavor as well! Highly recommend"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-07-07,5.0,"One of my favorite places in NYC. They're in Little Italy just outside of Chinatown and very walkable. I loved getting coffee and treats for the kids and taking them down to the Hester St. Playground to eat in the shade. Their little macarons and pastries are just adorable, so typical of NYC boutique charm, and tasty to boot! They had lots of options to choose from. 

There's plenty of space to sit, but I wouldn't stay with young children. They don't have high chairs and the decor encourages behavior that's not popular in this type of café. Thankfully, they're very close to the playground.

I'll definitely return here, hopefully every time we come to NYC"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-08-13,4.0,"It was around 11 am or something and I wanted something sweet. My guilty pleasure.

Bibble & Sip is such a cute name! My friend knows I love anything cream so she took me to Bibble & Sip.

I got introduced to the Earl Tea cream puff. It's huge. We both shared it. There were many cute and probably delicious desserts but we opted for the cream puff.

Delicious!! So much cream too! It's not super sweet either and the right amount of yumminess.

22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-01-19,5.0,"I've been to the original location multiple times, so as soon as I saw a new location pop up in Chinatown, I made my friends detour to go in. Of course, I said that we should go and ""just take a look."" But then we saw this adorable ube llama pudding and immediately sat our butts down. The ube pudding was refreshing, with just enough ube flavor to keep the dessert light. The whipped cream and coconut flakes were subtle but did add to its tastiness. The llama cookie was amazing. (Yes, I realize that a lot of this stuff is gimmicky, but can't help it, it's just too cute). Would definitely come back."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-05-26,5.0,"We came here for their light desserts. We have earl grey and matcha cream puffs. Both were really delicious but we prefer matcha more. The crust was pretty crispy. 

They lychee tart was interesting and look so delicate ! We took few shots before we started eating it. It's way too cute to eat! The tart crust was hard to cut half but when biting it, it was not that hard. It was little sweet. 

Anyway we ordered few items and shared so that we won't feel too sweet. The staffs here were pretty friendly to place our order."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-06-03,5.0,"My wife, in-laws and I come here for more dessert as we were kind of left wanting after eating some matcha. The shop was pretty packed, and the line was taking up quite a bit of space inside. We took advantage of the wait to take a look at the goods.

We got the matcha cream puff, lychee tart and earl grey cream puff. All three pastries were really delicious and not too sweet at all. The matcha puff was crunchy mixed with a smooth silkiness from the cream that created a harmonious contrast. The earl grey puff's texture was similar with a tasty earl grey flavor which paired with the lychee tart made the flavors do a complete 180.

As it's right on the border of little Italy, parking for this place is outright impossible so I definitely recommend taking the subway and making your way here by foot. If you're in the mood for pastries, this shop is definitely worth the visit!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-05-19,4.0,"Cream puffs can now finally be attained in their new location - Chinatown, Manhattan.  I always enjoy their cream puffs.  I ordered two different puffs as takeout and consumed it the next day as breakfast which still maintained its freshness and fluffiness.  Customer service is efficient and attentive who speak fluent English.  Cream puff varies in price.  Business cards are available as well as a loyalty card.

Earl Grey Cream Puff $3.90
Filled with earl grey vanilla cream
This crust is very lovely and the vanilla cream is, thankfully, not very heavy nor thick.  The cream was excessively too much which spewed out when bitten into but it very light and easy to swallow.  I cannot swallow thick dry cream.

Hazelnut Cream Puff $4.59
Chocolate and hazelnut cream with white chocolate whipped Ganache
The chocolate coating was very lovely and the the hazelnut cream was also very light."

My two favorite drinks from them are the Roseberry (cold) and the Lavender Latte (hot). The Roseberry is the perfect treat on a summer day. Cold oolong raspberry tea with Roseberry lychee foam topping. Bless whoever came up with this recipe!! 

On to the popular cream puffs! Matcha is everyone's favorite but the Earl Grey is where it's at!!! Hint of sweetness in the cream! They also have really cute macarons, small cakes, & tarts. Also, DON'T SLEEP on the cookie!! JUMBO brownie cookie was SO bomb."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-05-15,4.0,"I've wanted to have a Bibble & Sip cream puff for the longest time! But ever since I graduated college (many, many years ago), I'm hardly ever in midtown. Like ever. 

When I found out they opened a store in Chinatown, aka my hood, I had to stop in. 

I had a jasmine passionfruit tea, an earl grey cream puff, and 2 Totoro macarons. Earl grey cream puff was A+ and the Totoro macaron is super insta-worthy. 

Space is very bright and clean. Huge bathroom is a plus. 

Staff were SUPER nice and helpful. I can't wait to be back to try more things! 

Ps: the matcha cream puffs are their most popular item, so they do sell out."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-06-20,4.0,"Forgot to write a review... I went here about 2 weeks after it opened. This is the newer location whereas, the other one is in Midtown. They didn't have any cream puffs ready when I went at 11am. I was told to come back at 12. I went back at 12 and all the cream puffs were available. 

I got the matcha cream puff. It was decent, not as good as the one I've had in the past. The cream was smooth but a bit bland. It was filled with a lot of cream. My opinion is it's just ok, nothing to be overly excited for."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-06-07,5.0,"This new location of Bibble & Sip is much more brighter and minimalistic than its uptown counterpart. As always, they are in the running for the best cream puffs in the area. The other desserts are delicious as well (like the pastries or panna cottas), but I can't say that they appeal to me more than a bursting pastry ball of goodness.

Having tried all cream puff flavors, I can say that the Black Sesame and Matcha ones are the best, as they are not to sweet so the cream is not overwhelming. I cannot see a scenario where you won't come back to try new flavors :)"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-10-25,4.0,Bibble and Sip us know for their puff pastries and egg salad sammie. I have yet to try the xream puffa but the egg salad sammie is pretty legit. The bread is nice and the egg salad is full a flavor. There is a soft boiled egg squeezed into the middle. Good stuff.
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-12-15,4.0,I ordered the earl grey and black sesame cream puffs along with the very cute Alpaca raspberry lychee tart. I'm a fan of the earl grey already however I was extremely impressed by their black sesame cream puff. It had a nice black sesame flavor. The tart was just okay- it definitely looked better than it actually tastes. The store was quick and I got my order really quick. I wanted to try their black sesame croissant however they sold out.
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-11-24,3.0,"The shop is lovely and clean and the staff is very nice. They have a great variety of funny shaped macaroons and other good looking desserts which is a cute concept.We tried the pig-shaped lychee berry, a plain croissant and the ''lama"" coconut ube pudding--all looked amazing but tasted only okay, nothing extraordinary, and they were rather expensive."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-05-21,5.0,"I've been to both B&S locations now and the one in Chinatown is definitely my favorite. The vibe is very cozy and inviting. It gets lots of natural sunlight in and it's very bright and cheery. 

During this visit I got the matcha cream puff. (Note: these aren't out until ~noon). This is the best damn cream puff I'd ever eaten. It's perfectly baked and stuffed with LOTS of cream. It definitely lived up to its hype."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-05-20,5.0,"2nd chances are hard to come by, and Bibble & Sip did not disappoint. 

The first time I tried Bibble and Sip was a few months after their opening. I didn't really have a good impression with their Matcha Cream Puff. 

However........this new Bibble and Sip near my brother's place is to die for. 

Amazing interior design, outlets for working environments, free WiFi, plenty of seating and standing tables, and great selection of music. 

I ordered a ice jasmine green tea as I was recovering from being sick. The taste was pretty decent. The coffee menu, however, caught my eye. I'll definitely be back to try their lattes, especially the lavender matcha latte. 

Now why the 5 stars?!! Simple - Earl Grey Cream Puff. Wow!!!!! This was like heaven in one bite. The deliciousness and flavors all blended nicely. They also had a black sesame cream puff that I would 100% be trying next time around! 

Definitely stop by here if you get the chance!!! So bomb. Bibble and Sip, I'll be back for sure!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-02-24,5.0,"This is probably one of my favorite dessert spots. I've been to their location in the theatre district, but it's always quite crowded whenever I visit, so I much prefer this spot as there's more seating and it's less cramped. They seem to have a slightly greater selection of desserts when I visited here. 

I ordered the jasmine matcha latte and the peach sunset. Both were delicious! The mango sunset was beautifully crafted from the sweet and tart flavors of the mousse to the impression of a mango's exterior. I've also tried the apple lychee pie and it's amazing! The cafe always manages to capture cute and quirky designs while delivering great flavor pairings. The staff is friendly and accommodating too. This is a lovely cafe to grab coffee and dessert. I'll definitely be returning to try the chocolate orange tart and milk tea desserts. My only complaint is I wish they posted the prices for the dessert selection, since they only have a menu listed for the beverages."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-12-22,5.0,"""Best coffee and pastries in Midtown""

The best
- Unique and super tasty pastries.  Have a slight Asian flair, such as Croissants with Black Sesame or Matcha cream, wonderful scones, and delicious decorated macaroons.
- Solid coffee any way you like it --- cold, hot, and flavored
- well made to go containers.  Sorry but this is a must in NYC

The worst
-  Not much.  Just that it is so popular that there is a line.  Try going slightly off hours 

Eschew then Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and generic place in this neighborhood.  This is the place to go!!!!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-12-21,5.0,"Really cute place to sit down and enjoy some cute snacks and drinks. They have aesthetic tables and seating areas and good places to take photos as well as do work. Each table has an outlet under the seat and many people come to sit and either do work or just charge their electronics before they go back out. The downside is that many people will sit for hours which leads to lack of seats, but there is some standing room by the window. They also have a bathroom.

The servers are kind and patient and will answer any questions you may have. Service is fast. I ordered the earl grey panna cotta and the Hong Kong duck. The Hong Kong duck is coffee and tea mixed together, but the coffee overpowered the tea. The earl grey panna cotta is good, but it was a tiny bit too sweet for me. Overall, would definitely come again to try out other pastries."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-06-24,5.0,"Cute little shop with a llama theme. 
Their lavender lemonade is really good 
Had their pastries & they were tasteful"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-09-18,4.0,"Cutest white and llama themed boba/dessert shop in Little Italy/Chinatown. I really wanted to check this place out right after my friend got boba from Vivi's bubble tea right across the street. There were so many adorable macarons and desserts, but I only ordered the Hong Kong Ducks drink (no, it does not consist of ducks, Idk why it's called that lol). It's mixed with coffee, black tea, and condensed milk and it was delicious!! We sat there for a little bit longer to admire the beautiful decor and steal some AC while we cooled down from the hot and humid summer of nyc."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2020-02-05,5.0,So excited to see this bakery in Chinatown! Now I don't need to make the trip to midtown. The staff seems well rehearsed and prepared on opening day. Drink menu is on the wall
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-04-05,4.0,"My friend first introduced me to this bakery in midtown. Oh boy, the line was outside of the shop and there was a sign that said the cream puffs were sold out and it was like 4pm. So glad they decided to come to Chinatown where there is an abundance of matcha shops.

Store is smaller than the midtown location but there is a bench for standing by the entrance and some small tables and chairs if you are lucky to score a seat. It's grand opening day but it wasn't crazy busy...probably about 10 people sitting and enjoying their treats and a few people ahead of me in line. 

They have some really cute looking bakery goods and I have to come back for the lychee ones and black sesame croissants. Got the signature matcha cream puff which was my favorite. So much matcha cream once you bite into it. They also serve coffee, tea and some specialty drinks. Enjoy!"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-12-03,4.0,"***Drink review only, Quick service, Lots of tea fusion options***

This is a small tea place, with limited seating and one gender neutral bathroom available for customers only. The person who took the order was helpful especially since there were so many options. What I did like about this place is their cups are reusable and good quality."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-05-27,4.0,"Loved the decor of this location's Bibble and Sip. It was open, minimalistic, clean, friendly, and inviting. Perfect for a date or to catch up with old friends. 

My boyfriend and I got the matcha cream puff and the earl grey cream puff. The matcha puff is a classic and a must get when you are here. It was really filling for us as well (definitely share these). The earl grey was a little disappointing. Didn't really taste like earl grey and we could have done without it. I have heard good things about their drinks but unfortunately didn't have the stomachs for them. Would come back again for the matcha cream puff and the drinks. 

Ambience: 5/5
Price: 3/5 
Food: 3/5"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-05-23,4.0,"I've never been to the midtown location. I passed by the chinatown location and had to go in.
I had the matcha cream puff, earl grey cream puff, and a lychee tart. I prefer my matcha to be stronger but overall the cream puffs were great. The lychee tart was so cute! It was decorated with their macrons. I was surprised by the chunks of lychee in the tart. It wasn't too sweet and the tartness of the berries balanced out the sweetness."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-09-30,3.0,"Don't get me wrong, I am in love with this place, it's branding, and desserts. My favorite are the panna cottas, they are the best I've ever had anywhere else. Extremely creamy, thick, smooth, and at the right sweetness. I don't live in the area so I've been buying 3-4 to go and sit them in my fridge for dessert after dinner. But I am concerned about their freshness after my recent purchase which started to mold just 2 days after I bought them Saturday night. (It is now Monday morning) Eek! I"
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-05-12,4.0,"Been to their midtown location several times.  It's located on the West Side (W. 51 St/8 Ave) which is not always convenient for me so safer for my wallet.

After learning that a second location will be opening in Chinatown, first thought is yay and second thought is uh oh - my wallet is going to be in trouble.   

When I first went during the soft opening weekend of April 6-7, they were closed.  What!  Due to the high demand, they were sold out.  I was bummed no cream puffs.

Went back a few weeks later, the employees are friendly and if you need help they will assist.  The location is not big and the selection is not as extensive as the midtown location which is not a problem.  They have the important items: 

CREAM PUFFS - matcha (most popular), earl grey (pretty good), black sesame (not sweet and might be an acquired taste), hazelnut (my favorite -- though a bit messy to eat), and cookies and cream (have yet to try).

MACARONS - lucky apacha (matcha, red bean chocolate with black sesame cookie), baby chick (special macaron of the month) and biggie (aka Totoro is a cartoon character in a Japanese animated film and directed by Hayao Miyazaki -- black sesame, white chocolate, cookie and cream ganache).  Both are good for a snack!

They also have cakes, tarts, pudding, pastries including scones, bars and cookies.

Can't wait to buy some more goodies to try.  If you get a chance, go check it out.  When I went the second time, it wasn't pack which is nice."
22,bibble-and-sip-new-york-5,2019-04-15,5.0,"I am so glad to see Bibble & Sip in Chinatown because it is a convenient location since the Midtown location is such a travel.

Bibble & Sip is an adorable alpaca-themed cafe and has the cutest pastries!

This place is quite small with a few marble tables and a bar table that faces the open out windows. There is a relax ambience and the interior of this place has aesthetic appeal.

I got the Totoro Macaron ($5.28) and a small Iced Brown Sugar Tea Latte ($5.28). The Totoro Macaron was too cute to eat! It was very big for its price and was the size of my palm. The macaron had sesame filling and was fresh. It had the right crunch, was sweet, and creamy.

The Brown Sugar Tea Latte was sweet and pleasant. I could really taste the brown sugar.

Overall, I look forward to making another stop here for a snack since it's close to work and I can't wait to try the cream puffs and panna cotta next.

Plus, I do suggest you to pick up a stamp card because when you buy 10 drinks, you'd get a free one."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-05-29,5.0,"I'm not sure why I never photo op'd this place prior to COVID19 but it was a beautiful little store with plenty of areas to photo op as well as a new tea service that I was trying to try prior to the shutdown of restaurants. I won't know how that is for a while but the chocolates themselves are beautiful and delicious. My favorite combination of things.

I have come here many times to sample their little chocolates of different flavors. I love the art they use on the chocolates and the flavors are on point. They're mild and the chocolate used is usually single origin. Apparently this is a woman owned company that has a partnership with the cocoa growers to help women there. I can't remember exactly but that information is posted in the store itself in soho.

I recently spent a pretty penny on these chocolates for delivery. Okay several dollars. Tis a splurge in these times but oh so worth it. The packaging is beautiful although I preferred the pre covid less wasteful put them in a little bag and avoid the boxes. They're pretty and probably reusable. I'm definitely reusing this NYC box for sure.

I hope they open up soon so I can pick and choose my chocolates again. Until then there's always flat rate shipping chocolate binges."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-05-28,5.0,"I was introduced to this jewel box of a beautifully appointed gourmet chocolate shop by a fellow Yelper (Merci beaucoup, Pamela!)
 
Mariebelle is now my favorite chocolate destination!  It is delightful in many ways. 
 
Mariebelle is high-end of course, I used to be a loyal fan of Leonidas on Madison, Li-Lac and Maison du chocolat, but Mariebelle stole my heart. 

There are all sorts of lovely ganache with unique designs, delicious dark chocolate almonds, berries, chocolate draped popcorn, chocolate pistachios, sublime matcha tea almonds, Fin Du Chocolat, and samples to taste. 

The variety of flavors are exquisite. The designs are beautiful and the shop itself is gorgeous!

Hopefully when the time is right, I can venture back to enjoy their high tea which is my favorite thing to do with the girls in the city.

For now, Mariebelle has delivery service on Mondays and Wednesdays.  Perfectly wrapped and chilled per order. (Thanks, Mers!) 

Let's place an order!
xoxo"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-05-30,4.0,"This pandemic is making me go through all kinds of crazy. Since keeping eggs and dairy away for a year+, my past cravings have resurfaced. But my #1 vice kicked in heavy- and not for the Vegan kind.

At a time when a lot of NYC eateries and specialty shops are closed, I searched high and low anyway for Chocolatiers- and MarieBelle came up. I've had her brick & mortar shop bookmarked for a long time and was nice to know she does mail orders.
I also had hesitations about ordering chocolates by mail: will my ganache squares melt inside the box? Or- should I wait until temperatures cool a bit? Since it's been humid, I kept a closed eye on the weather and melting points. Sure enough, my box of 9 ganache squares was strategically and comfortably placed in a small box surrounded by bubble wrap and two ice packs during arrival. And by the way- there are no outrageous hidden mail fees. 

Taste? The chocolate itself was really good. Infused flavors such as Cardamom, Lavender, Matcha and a few others however- are very subtle. But you know what? My chocolates traveled just fine."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-12-31,5.0,"This truly is a hidden gem. A gorgeous chocolatier shop in the front that makes you feel so fancy and French, there is a hidden cafe in the back area. Today I dined alone and enjoyed their lunch special in which you receive a cup of tomato soup, mixed green salad and a half of your choice of any sandwich, crepe or a small quiche. The soup is served in a delicate teacup. 

The staff: so so friendly, accommodating and pleasant. They offer recommendations and suggestions if you have questions. 

First I was offered a small sample of their white chocolate with matcha green tea.. so delicious! The lunch was amazing, the perfect amount of food. It came with two small chocolates and the end, and I had enough room to enjoy an Aztec hot chocolate. The small size is rich enough. So delicious, you re drinking liquid gold.

Do come here for lunch, high tea or a decadent chocolate drink or coffee. You will enjoy every minute of your experience."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-05-20,1.0,"Charged me $60 to ""overnight"" (took 5 days) 4 hot chocolate tins (costing $68) in a box so poorly packed that the largest tin came all beat up. Wouldn't refund the shipping in full. Wouldn't send a replacement tin. Instead demanded I prove I hadn't been in the tin (I hadn't but ew, in these days esp.) and said when they got it back (ew, again) they'd refund the charge for the tin. Gee, thanks.
How 'bout a full refund for both tin and shipping and a discount code for a new tin? What are you going to do with this bent up one? Resell it? Resell the contents, that has been in someone's home?!
No problem here.... I prefer Fran's anyway. Their chocolate is so soft it melts in your mouth. :)
You win, MarieBelle. (head shake, eye roll)"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-02-04,5.0,Holy hot chocolate. What a cute little place for a date or to catch up with a friend. I got the Aztec and it was straight up hot liquid chocolate.  It's a little on the pricey side for the amount that you get but it's so rich and decadent. This isn't your typical hot chocolate but the type that you sit down and sip on. I also got the lemon tart (which comes with a scoop of gelato)-delicious! The interior of the tart was so smooth. Both the sour of the tart and sweetness of the gelato paired really well with each other and the bitterness of the hot chocolate. Everything looked clean and wait staff was super friendly.
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-01-07,5.0,"wwowowowowowow. This place is truly a hidden gem. If I was not actively looking for it, I would have never noticed it. When you walk in, you first see gift shop. You keep going and you will see a small section to dine in. They have legitimate hot chocolate as well as other things like tea, desserts, coffee, and baked goods. I got the aztec hot chocolate and it was delicious! This has become my new favorite hot chocolate spot. 

I absolutely love this place! Although it is quite cramped, you still get that intimate vibe with whoever youre sharing the hot chocolate with. The cafe is well hidden with beautiful interior decor. I truly felt like I was no longer in NYC, maybe London or Paris instead. I couldnt hear anything going on outside on the NYC streets. The staff were extremely friendly too.

The vibe is perfect for a date or to catch up with a friend you havent seen in a long time. Definitely not good for group settings as most tables only seat 2 people. I came in around 5pm and it was quite busy. Highly highly recommend this unique place!!"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-12-23,5.0,"This review is for the Afternoon Tea. I got a deal for their afternoon tea with wine for 2. Service was excellent instead of tea we got the hot chocolate which turned out to be a good choice. It was some of best not chocolate in the city. The sandwiches with the tea service were warm and delicious . We got to sample most of the hot chocolates and some other drinks that were made for other customers. They have very good chocolate, tea, hot chocolate, pastries and candy. I recommend this place to everyone."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-02-05,5.0,"Part of our series on NYC's fanciest Valentine Day's chocolates --
One of the first chocolate shops that we visited when we first came to NYC three years ago now, Mariebelle remains one of our favourite dessert stops in NYC.  While chocolate is somewhat of an afterthought at Mariebelle's high tea session (which we have previously reviewed, see blog link), that isn't otherwise the case at this lavishly-decorated store.  At Mariebelle, the chocolates are imprinted with pictures of couples in love, dancing, serenading and proposing to each other, as well as with scenes of New York across the seasons.  When presented in one of the store's beautiful vintage-style tin or book cases, the chocolates weave a tapestry of all the different facets of romance."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-05-30,4.0,"Is this the best chocolate shop ever? Yes. I don't even like chocolate! The decor and presentation of everything in here is amazing. In the back they have a cafe where you can get lots of different chocolate drinks, teas, coffee, etc. They had an old fashioned baby seat which my daughter sat in and hated real bad.

You must check this place out if you like sweets in general! Like I said, I don't even like chocolate but their products are amazing. There are a bunch of free samples and they also serve gelato.

If you really want to impress someone, bring them a gift from here! A big box of chocolate can be $150+, so they better be special! MarieBelle definitely brings chocolatiering to the next level."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-04-04,4.0,"Truly elegant, gorgeous, classy, sophisticated interior with a lovely window display of pink flowers in the shape of a heart, along with blue boxes in varying sizes. Upon entering, there is a spacious store area then toward the back is the CaCao Bar by MarieBelle, where there are seats for dining. I loved the fancy chandeliers, pretty displays of chocolate (and samples!), bouquets of flowers and the gold + blue color scheme, with hints of pale pink, red, purple.

The Cacao Bar is exquisitely beautiful and breathtaking, with a crystal chandelier in the center, mirrors all around, display of desserts, framed classic old black and white photographs, single roses on the tables. The person behind the counter was very welcoming and easily answered all the questions I had. Since the place was empty, he allowed my friend and me to sit anywhere.

I had purchased a Pulsd deal that was for High Tea for 2 so the cost was $59 total. This included 2 drinks, with one of the drinks being wine. I don't drink, so I selected 2 non-alcholic beverages. There were several types of hot chocolate that we were trying to choose between: White Hot Chocolate, Spicy Hot Chocolate and Hindu Cardamom Hot Chocolate. We were served samples of each. We both fell in love with the velvety creamy and extremely sweet White Hot Chocolate, which is made with Tahitian Vanillla and had accents of nutmeg and cinnamon. I decided to have the Iced Milk with Hazelnut drink first, which was quite refreshingly cool and delicious with robust taste of hazelnut. I requested the hot chocolate for later so I could savor it with the treats. 

We were served a delightful looking 3 tiered plate filled with finger sandwiches on the bottom, an assortment of cookies, meringue and chocolate in the center and chocolate fondue with seasonal fruit on top. 

Let's start with the finger sandwiches, which were actually a decent size. There were 3 different kinds, all served on foccaccia bread with an olive and tomato on top: Grilled chicken with avocado, ham and swiss cheese and pesto with tomato. I enjoyed all of them. The grilled chicken was tender and tasty. The swiss cheese was melted and there was plenty of ham with it. The pesto was fresh and full of great seasoning. 

For the sweet treats, there were 2 types of each: Madeleines, macarons, meringues, as well as chocolate bark of dark chocolate with almonds and white chocolate with pistachios. The madeleines were perfectly moist and satisfyingly dense. One was infused with lemon flavor and the other had a hint of green tea. The macarons were also yummy with just the right amount of chewiness and vibrant, sweet center. The meringues were light, like spun sugar. The chocolate bark was just okay. I would have preferred cake though. 

The top plate had this amazingly delectable and warm chocolate fondue with strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, raspberries and grapes. The chocolate was oh so smooth and melted in my mouth. However, there should have been more fruit. Also, I think I would leave out the grapes and include apples instead. 

All in all, a luxurious and indulgent experience, complete with attentive service throughout. I would definitely return for more hot chocolate and the Bacardi Caramel Almond Cake."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-03-27,3.0,"If I were rating on ambiance alone, I would be giving MarieBelle 5 stars. It's a chocolate shop and tea house that makes you want to squeal in girly delight. Pastels, gold gilding, generous free chocolate samples, adorable dainty china. 

Me and a friend were participating in this years hot chocolate festival. For a week or two, different businesses in the city offer a specially promoted hot chocolate, and you can go around and try them out. That's what brought us here, but their hot chocolate menu was so extensive that we  just ordered whatever sounded good. The small cups are like something a large doll might drink out of - seemingly minuscule, while the large is served in a normal decorative tea cup. 

We tried a classic hot chocolate with nutmeg and cinnamon, a cardamom spiced number, and an chile spiced chocolate. Unfortunately we weren't able to finish any of them. Each one was overwhelmingly rich. When we stirred them, chocolate ""goop"" clung to our spoons, and would stick to the edged of the cups. It tasted and felt like they just served straight up melted chocolate without much to flavor it and it clung to the inside of our mouths, literally hard to swallow. I think sticking to the smaller tea cups will be fine for most, sipping and even sharing with a partner. Really, it was that rich.

Service was beyond sweet and attentive, our server seemed really happy to work there and to take care of us, all smiles! 

It's a nice place to come for the experience, and if I find that happening I would just try different menu items."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-09-04,4.0,"I found a Pulsd deal with High Tea for Two here and came in with a group of four on a Saturday late afternoon. The seating area is super small and a little tight but I had made a reservation a few days before so we were seated right at our time. The manager, who was also our server, was super funny and made sure that everyone had a good time. They were accommodating to the one vegetarian person in our party but providing options. You definitely get a lot for the voucher, we got the regular High Tea but also with wine! I definitely recommend this for an intimate time out with some friends to catch up in a quiet space."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-03-04,4.0,"Bought the Pulsd deal - High tea for two and had a great evening sipping on some tea, hot chocolate shots, wine and indulging in some amazing treats and sandwiches. 

You have to go through their chocolate shop to get to the café in the back- very pretty, cozy and surprisingly was not crowded when I got there on Friday around 4pm. Best part - they take reservations!

We started with some complementary hot chocolate shots- tasted like we were drinking some rich chocolate syrup, perfect and not overly sweet!

I opted for the Rose Chocolate tea and my friend got one of the coffees made with dark chocolate. Highly recommend both, depends on what you prefer. After that we received the much awaited three tier food stand, which had a chocolate fondue with fruits, assorted cookies including meringues and madeleines, some house made chocolates, 3 Assorted Sandwiches and a complementary chocolate for both of us. Everything was good but the chocolates and the fondue were amazing, I loved them. 

At the end we received the wine- red wine from Spain accompanied by another complementary orange flavored chocolate. The wine was the perfect way to end the evening and surprisingly, it was not a dessert wine but a red dry wine. 

The guy working there was super sweet and friendly. He took great care of us.

The high tea experience was a gift from me to my friend and she loved it. It's definitely worth every dollar and the experience. 

Note the deal does not include tax and tips. Happy Sipping!"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-02-19,5.0,"The place is a real trip.  Located in Soho it exudes charm, classy decor, with a bit of old world panache. Of course seeing the pictures online I had to make a stop for a breather.  I had a hard time choosing between the hot or iced chocolate drinks.  In the end I decided to sway from the status quo and ordered an iced  banana (milk) chocolate drink.  Oh boy was it satisfying.  Sure it would have been better if I had taken my sweet time to drink that drink, but I was in a rush and to be honest the ambiance made up for any time constraints.

I'm not big on chocolate, but they had a plethora of choices to choose from.  The designs are lookers and they also sell tea boxes.  The ""cafe"" is a separate area where customers can order desserts , fine teas, hot/iced chocolate, alcohol, and food.  I love this place as it reminds me of Marie Antoinette and you can't go wrong with anything here. Order a hot chocolate, sip, admire the decor,  and let time freeze before you step back into the frenzy of Manhattan."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-01-30,5.0,"My favorite gourmet chocolates in the entire world! I always get excited when I can pay a visit to this shop. The intoxicating smell of cocoa is the first thing that hits you as you step foot in this gorgeous and stunning chocolatier shop, MarieBelle. There are many gorgeously prepackaged items on display for purchase but my one and only reason for coming here are the individual delicate ganaches at the counter. The counter display reminds me of a jewelry case. What sets these chocolates apart? Each piece is a work of art (literally). The pieces are placed in a beautiful blue box with a dark chocolate colored ribbon.

Here are just a few of the flavors they have this season:
Banana
Cardamom
Dulce de Leche
Ginger
Kona Bean
Lemon
Matcha
Mojito
Passion Fruit
Peanut Butter
Pineapple
Pistachio
Saffron
Whiskey

At the back of the shop, there is a Cocao Bar. With it's European feel, one can relax and enjoy some crepes, finger sandwiches, soups, quiche, desserts, coffee & teas. One of my favorite drink is their Iced Dark Aztec Chocolate. 

During this visit, I purchased their limited edition of their Lunar New Year 25-piece ganache box. They also have a special prepackaged Valentine's Day box. If you can't afford a gift from Tiffany's, get a blue box from here."

When you walk in, it appears to be an adorable chocolate shop with tons of cute chocolate packages to choose from. If you keep walking towards the back, it actually turns into a little sit down Cafe.

I did a hot chocolate tour in soho, and this one was the best. The selection of hot chocolates is huge and they're all fantastic!!!

I got the milk chocolate with a fluffy croissant and couldn't have been happier."

The server continuously brought out samples for us to try and seemed more like a friend that was there with us rather than a staff member. He brought me a chocolate flourless cake with a candle for my birthday, made great suggestions, and was just hilarious and fun in general. We had such a great time here and bought some chocolates to take home (although they never actually made it home)"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-01-21,2.0,"Went for high tea on a 3 day weekend. Chocolate was lovely but food was mediocre (think Costco's pesto on their sandwiches). 
Service was terrible. Had a 2:30 reservation and was seated 40 minutes later. Only 2 employees handling the 20 or so guests, plus the kitchen, take out line, and seating. 
The CaCao bar is extremely cramped; what should be a sidewalk cafe stuffed in the back of a chocolate shop."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-12-09,5.0,"After a recent trip to Paris this is exactly what I was looking for! Mariebelle transports you to old world France with descendant food, opulent decor and great service. I came across a Pulsd deal for a $97 high tea that included wine, sandwiches, pastries, chocolate fondue and choice of beverage. The seating area is small and cozy and we were lucky to get the table in the corner. Make sure to call ahead for reservations as the wait time on a Sunday was 30 mins otherwise. We started with our wine choosing the red (they had Merlot - dry and full bodied) Next came the classic high tea 3 tiered tray of wonderful food. They easily accommodated my  vegetarian preference by switching out the meat sandwiches. The pastries were delectable with a wide range from macaroons to chocolate pieces. The fondue was rich dark chocolate with variety of fresh fruits. We opted for their famous hot chocolate as our drink of choice! Overall, the hot chocolate is EXTREMELY rich and creamy, exactly how they make it in Europe. I chose the milk chocolate with hazelnut and was floored by the taste! You can genuinely taste the freshness of the ingredients and was made very well. My husband chose the midnight hot chocolate which featured a shot of espresso with their regular dark chocolate. It was extremely bitter and perfect for the true dark chocolate lovers. Overall, wonderful experience at Mariebelle!"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-01-05,4.0,"Que c'est beau! This is one beautiful shop and one decadent tea parlor. It's not a place you'll get a scone with clotted cream, however, it is a place where you'll be served a wee dish of chocolate for you to devour your fruit with and in my case, along with them little dessert treats. Essentially, whatever I could dip into that pool of melted dream I did! 

For BFFs to gather and chat the day away, be sure to get the high-tea for two and you'll be blown away by everything they supply in their three-tier carrier. The finger sandwiches are small but adequate due to the fact there is more pressing things to focus on--the irresistible pieces of pastries that lay so beautifully in the middle tier. I normally do not like half the desserts I get at a tea parlor but this place really know what to stock in their kitchen because I inhaled everything, and I mean every morsel went in my belly, no crumb escaped! It's really a spectacular meal when you learn to eat slow and just enjoy the time with that someone across from you."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-12-13,5.0,"Overall I had a really great experience at MarieBelle! I went here with 2 friends for a late afternoon lunch and honestly the place was absolutely beautiful, the store was well decorated, it smelled amazing and the ambiance was great. The cafe portion was honestly a little smaller than I expected so if you don't like tight spaces or have a group or 4+ probably not the place for you. The wait for a table was decent but we went at a slower time so the wait for a busier time would be relatively long I can imagine. Once seated the service was fast and the servers very attentive. The menu has a good selection of food and drinks. I got the lunch special which had a soup, salad and choice of a quiche or crepe. Everything was very tasty and the tomato soup was my favorite I've ever had. I also got a small ganache which was very tasty and a nice little dessert. The hot chocolate was so rich and amazing but I would suggest the smaller size as the larger size got to be too much after a while. Although I didn't get it I saw many people get the high tea and it looked amazing so another great option if you want a more snack option. Overall I loved MarieBelle and will definitely be visiting it again!"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-01-07,5.0,"Love this place even though I'm not much of a hot cocoa drinker. The decor and desserts are insta-worthy! I recommend sneaking chambord in and adding to the hot chocolate. 

Everyone I bring here just absolutely loves the place!"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-11-24,5.0,Just had high tea here with my girlfriends last night and it was great! There were six of us and one of us had a food preference and they were able to customize her high tea just for her. The food and chocolate were delicious and the service was great. Johnny and the rest of the crew were super  involved and made sure we had everything we wanted. The hot chocolate shots were so good. The space itself is small which is my only complaint. If you want to do high tea here definitely make a reservation.
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-03-09,4.0,The best hot chocolate I've had in a while - might be one of the best I've ever had in life. I had the milk chocolate with cinnamon and nutmeg. It seems like it's slow-cooked. Kind of thick (I drank it with a spoon!) and the spices really really come through. Not a 5 though because we didn't really enjoy anything else we ordered. Had a crepe and the baguette with dark chocolate and lavender butter (sounded amazing!) but neither was that interesting or satisfying. I'd skip the food and go straight for the hot chocolate next time I'm here!
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-11-09,5.0,Expensive but beautiful chocolate shop with lovely cafe hidden in the rear. The hot chocolates were essentially fine melted chocolate -- a little too rich and intense for 8 & 11 year old children but the adults appreciated them. Very filling too! Didn't try any desserts (we were headed to lunch!) but they looked fabulous. Wait staff was friendly and sweet. Gave us multiple samples while we decided. Sorry we had already committed to lunch elsewhere and couldn't indulge more here!
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-02-22,4.0,"The cutest little chocolate shop in Soho. This was on my food adventure list for my trip to NYC and I am glad I dropped by. As you can see i the photos the inside is very adorable and classy and has a certain charm to it.

Service: The girl working behind the counter by the chocolate was nice once we started talking about the chocolates.

Chocolates: there were plenty of flavors to choose from. I chose Dulce De Leche and Banana and both actually so delicious, even the banana one and I didn't think it would be. Each piece is $3 and they are actually super tiny. The pictures make them look bigger than they actually are.

Other: I have been told that the hot chocolate is amazing here but I was heading out to lunch right after so I didn't get a chance to try it because it is a meal in itself. But, definitely will try it the next time I am here.

Will I come back? If I am in the area then definitely for the popular hot coco."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-02-01,4.0,Its like a chocolate heaven in thE middle of soho with a parisien vibe. Everything hEre iS decadent came here for high tea. You can try the choccoLates  while you wait for your table at  the back. Service is great although slightly laid back. Only con very  fee tAbLes and set very close together. But i will keep going  back  for the chocolates and dessErts!
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-10-14,5.0,Happy place! Chocolate dream for young and old alike ! Best part for me was hot chocolate and rose gelato
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-08-04,4.0,"Really cute chocolate shop. Fancy chocolates and gelatos you can get to go up front and a seating area in the back if you want to stay. Got the mango and strawberry gelatos, which were both pretty good. Super friendly service. Lots of great gift ideas if that's what you're looking for. Worth a stop if you happen to be in the area."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-03-10,4.0,"Came in just for the hot chocolate and was blown away! Must comeback to sit down & have some pastries!

Word of advice, don't get the 4oz.  That is tiny!!! But it was a delicious tiny treat.  Splurge on the large.  

Delicious samplings of the treats they sell too."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2018-11-26,3.0,"Honestly, I'm torn about this place. I felt partway in a preserved French patisserie and partway in a haunted girl's dream house. There is a small cafe tucked away behind the storefront which lacked the open, dreamy ambiance you would want with French sweets.

Came in on a chilly Autumn day looking for a warming cup of hot chocolate. I got literally...in the form of a $6 mini Dixie-cup sized shooter of basically a semi-solid chocolate bar. It was tasty but not exactly sipping chocolate. Not exactly what I expected and was not wholly satisfied with that expensive ""cup"" of chocolate to fulfill my craving."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-11-25,5.0,Johnny is amazing! He's always been there every time i go. It's a cute place behind the store and sometimes it can be very busy but it's always a hit/miss if you have to wait or not. The hot chocolate menu is insanely big and decadent. The silverware is absolutely stunning - you feel like you're in 18th century France.
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-09-10,5.0,Whenever I get a chance to visit nyc mariebelle's is top of the list. The chocolate is second to none. My birthday was yesterday so I made sure to make a stop. I was treated like royalty. Our server #JohnnyDTroublemaker  (who I've had before) is so good and over the top. Enjoy a small hot chocolate in The shop and get an iced dark Aztec to go. We were hungry so I got the cabbage salad with ginger dressing and chx and that was perfect. Then I tried the champagne ganache chocolates. It was perfection. Don't listen to other reviews that say this plays isn't the best. It is. I thank God for Mariebelle's!!
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-07-02,5.0,"Never have I understood the filmmaker Luis Bunuel until a visit to this shop. If this isn't a trip to old world South America, then I don't know what is!  My  goodness.  The peony and rose on the table really just take the cake.  Authentic South American replica of a Parisienne chocolatier."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-02-26,5.0,This place is so cute and whimsical. My friend and I had the afternoon tea and everything was good from the savory to the sweets. Only thing missing were the scones however they do finish you off with wine and a piece of chocolate which we both enjoyed. It's a small place so make sure you have reservations ahead of time. They also have great gift options for the chocolate lover in your life
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-12-29,5.0,Johnny rocks!  My cousin and I have been twice for afternoon tea and have been treated wonderfully.  Fantastic food and atmosphere.  Will definitely be back!
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-02-17,1.0,Alright hot chocolate but the service was terrible...took them almost 15-20 mins to give us water. The waiters are also inattentive and seems to choose who to serve...will not come back.
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-11-19,5.0,"This place has the best, best white hot chocolate. So amazing. It's what my dreams are made of."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-02-04,5.0,"This place is so beautiful you feel like royalty instantly. The service is impeccable, my waiter was very attentive and made me feel right at home. Will definitely be going back"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2020-02-29,5.0,You have to have brunch with hot chocolate here. Johnny is the best chocolate maker ever!  Very friendly and knowledgeable. Get here early because it fills up fast.
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-02-15,1.0,"If you don't care about the cleanness of their products good for you! I know I won't go there again.

I was in a really good mood to pick up a box of chocolates from this place a few days ago for my bf since it also has been one of my favorites for holiday gifts (recommended by my boss who is French) but the people who worked there totally ruined it for me.

First of all, the lady who was helping me dropped the lid of the chocolate box to the ground but she picked it up like nothing had happened, I instantly felt really uncomfortable but was too shocked to voice my concerns. I normally wouldn't make a big deal out of it if the staff drop products by accident but that is part of the container to hold food, and when incidents like this happened in the past at other stores the staff threw away the box right away and picked up new ones.

Anyway, I eventually asked her to give me a new lid when she was about to close the box and she was like ""okay...?"" and gave me the face like I was overreacting. I apologized when she came back even when I really didn't have to and explained why I asked for a new lid, but she gave me this awkward silent treatment throughout the rest of the experience. Whoa! On top of over-priced chocolates now I have to put up with the attitudes? MarieBelle is too much for the good holiday vibes.

After I gave my bf the box of pretty chocolates I realized there is also a piece of thin layer of protector that they put on top of the chocolates before closing the lid, and I think she had dropped that as well when she dropped the lid ""by accident""... I am now telling my bf to throw away those chocolates and I am buying something from other places that take hygiene seriously. I saw the lady who helped me just put the lid that she had picked up from the floor back to the tack and it has probably been purchased by someone who doesn't know. I also read one of the past reviews saying that they sold expired chocolates and when the costumer reached out they simply asked them to peel off the expiration date label... who knows if their other stuff is even safe to eat.

I will never ever buy their gross chocolates again."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-11-20,5.0,First time here and it was honestly amazing!! The service was the best ever. Johnny the server was wonderful in every way on giving us recommendation from the menu especially as a first time guest there. I would totally recommend this place.
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-04-06,5.0,"Amazing chocolate and high tea place in town. Perfect spot for a weekend girls date. Waiters are sooo nice and brought us different samples to try, and special treats to the high tea. Highly recommend checking it out (ask for Johnny the trouble maker lol)"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2018-04-27,5.0,"Lovely chocolate shop with an attached café. I highly recommend their hot chocolate, and they have quite a selection. I had the hazelnut milk chocolate, which tasted a little like Nutella. It was so rich and thick. I had the shot size, which was around $5. The little café was nice with romantic black and white photos and quotes about how special chocolate is. They serve the hot chocolate in fancy cups, so you feel like you're treating yourself. The little shop has truffles and candy bars and other treats. Kim said the chocolates are all made at the factory in Brooklyn. She introduced me to the owner, a lovely lady from Honduras. Be sure to sample the truffles and other goodies."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-11-04,5.0,"I decided to try this place with a friend yesterday and had an amazing high tea experience. From the moment we walked in Johnny ""The Troublemaker"" had us seated and made us feel completely comfortable. I am heavily pregnant and he accommodated us by immediately changing our seats when better seats became available. He then made some great suggestions for the night such as the guava tea with a bit of honey and lemon. I loved it so much I purchased the tea to try at home. The food was great and the service from all staff top notch. Do not hesitate to visit this location and try the high tea package. You won't regret it."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2018-12-02,5.0,"I come here for one reason, the hazelnut hot chocolate (Nutella). It is thick and creamy and transports you into a chocolate euphoric state. So many other choices in NYC of hot chocolate, this one in by far a top 3."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-03-31,5.0,"The iced white chocolate coffee was delicious. I started off disappointed because they didn't have what I wanted, but the manager came and suggested I get this drink, and it was really good. The customer service was superb. They were out of the raspberry macaron so he gave complimentary chocolate. Def recommend coming here. The high tea looked super cute, though I didn't get it."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-01-21,4.0,"MarieBelle at first glance looks like any other chocolate shop on the outside, but it is taking a step in that immerses you into a different world. The chocolates on display entice you to look left and right, and you're torn between purchasing everything and the anxiety to leave with nothing. I took a trip to the shop around Christmas, and boy were they decked out in holiday decor. 

The charming nook of a place gets infinitely more intriguing towards the back as there is a little cafe with limited seating and a fantastic display of desserts. The prices on the menu are a bit steep, so I would recommend a light bite rather than a full meal. However, the one thing you cannot miss out on here is the selection of hot chocolate covering the last page of their menu. The drinks are broken down by the medium of chocolate darkness: varieties of white, milk, and dark that come in small and large sizes (a few ounce difference). Though the quantity may seem small on the menu, it's the quality of their rich, thick drinks that can make a mediocre date suddenly phenomenal. The server is a bit curt, but the place does seem to have a more pretentious air about it, but don't let that stop you from experiencing the depth of their hot chocolate!"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-09-06,5.0,"A beautiful gem hidden in Soho. When we first walked in we figured it was a typical chocolate shop (more than typical because it was a beautiful place), we were greeted by Johnny (Johnny the troublemaker). He showed us to the small cafe hidden in the back where you can enjoy artisan sandwiches/appetizers, a wide variety of hot chocolates (not what you would typically expect when ordering a hot chocolate, these are NEXT LEVEL) and other snacks. Highly Recommended for a unique experience on your afternoon stroll. We will be coming back !"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-08-03,5.0,"Johnny ""the troublemaker"" has been serving up the menu here for the past 10 years. We walked in unsure of what to order and he asked a few poignant questions and provided recommendations.  We took each one and all of them were delicious (strawberry banana smoothie, finger sandwiches, lemon meringue tart w chocolate and vanilla gelato).  Highly recommend the spot - a New York favorite."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2018-01-09,5.0,"My goodness is this place adorable. Styled like a Parisian cafe, MarieBelle offers absolutely delictible chocolate treats. I came here specifically with hot chocolate in mind on one of the subzero days we had in NYC recently. I wanted to get it to go but they have several cute little cafe tables in the back. There were several hot chocolate options in dark chocolate, milk, and while chocolate. I decided on the Aztec which is on of their dark chocolate choices. You can get a small, which is only about 2 or 3 oz or a large which is about 7 or 8 oz. The small is $5 and the large is $7.50 so you're much better off just getting the large. 

The hot chocolate was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. It was so rich and creamy and full of flavor. It is hands down one of the best hot chocolates I have had in the city. I can't recommend this enough. I will absolutely be coming back with the plan of getting a few of the other flavors in the small size so I can do a bit of a DIY hot chocolate sampling with my husband when he gets back from helping restore power in Puerto Rico! 

The staff here were so friendly and lovely as well. This was a great experience all around."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2018-10-17,4.0,"Samples everywhere!

Got my team gelato/ sorbet. Everybody loved it! One scoop is a little pricey but two is a good value. Some flavors are sorbet so it's dairy free (vegan!)

Lychee sorbet was a favorite. I loved the strawberry. The White Chocolate raspberry looked amazing.

Only down was that since it is October it's the 'end of gelato season' so they're running out of flavors. But I swear they had pistachio gelato even though it wasn't listed as a remaining flavor. Not a big deal tho."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2018-11-28,5.0,Amazing staff and service. Very professional and courteous. They had a very good milk hot chocolate with hazelnut and milk hot chocolate with banana. The staff also likes to serve you chocolate samples while you wait and if you and your guest order different drinks they bring over a small sample for you each to try each other's beverage.
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2018-05-13,5.0,"Amazing!!! Just went for Mother's Day tea with my kids (three) & the patient staff & delicious food was just what I needed to make my Mother's Day perfect... we did the high tea & the kids got an aka cart crepe & it was all SO DELICIOUS!!!
Must try!"
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2018-12-15,3.0,"High tea set is overrated and overpriced.  The service isn't good as well. The place itself is beautiful, but I will just have their a la cart dessert next time."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-07-10,4.0,"This is for both chocolate shop side and the small cafe side review.

I've been ordering chocolates online from Mariebelle for 3+ years now and I was finally able to visit the store.  
Starting from cafe, you HAVE to get the teas, especially the one with rose chocolate ? something with rose and chocolate, iced.  That tea blew my mind.  Food ? ehhh , not so much, it's just ok.  But it's a very relaxed place to have afternoon tea time.  I even saw some lady knitting there.
The chocolate shop itself is very cool.  They had everything that I wanted, from hot chocolate to the guava tea.  The quality of chocolates is top notch.  
Overall the decor seems to be getting old, they should do some upgrades, especially the cafe side.  I saw some wallpaper stains and sign falling off...etc.  But if you're just getting one of the best chocolates in states? you need to stop by."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2019-06-25,5.0,"I ordered a gift to be mailed to relatives and they were completely delighted with the look and taste of the chocolates. Thanks, MarieBelle, for your excellent service."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2017-11-12,4.0,"Aztec King, 82%: mildly sweet, slight spicy and tart undertone with a viscous mouthfeel. One of the few places to get thick hot chocolate that's not overloaded with milk. The powder does have milk powder, so this is not dairy-free.

Vanilla Pineapple Cake: tastes almost exactly like a fresh Taiwanese pineapple cake! The cream is firm--unlike whipped cream--and the center has pineapple filling. It's mildly sweet and tastes amazing with the Aztec King. I suggest eating the cake after the chocolate, or the chocolate will seem bitter and sour.

I also received a complimentary scoop of hazelnut gelato. Not sure if they make it in-house, but it was full of ice crystals as if it had been melted and refrozen. Pass. Same with the whipped cream they offer (cool whip?).

A small cup with dessert has more than enough richness. Lots of other tables had unfinished cups.

Overall, I don't think the hot chocolate was spectacular, but this place is one of the few that offers water-based chocolate, has a cozy cafe ambience, and uses adorable tea sets. It's a good place to meet for conversation."
23,mariebelle-new-york-3,2018-12-12,5.0,"Stopped in on a cold evening just about closing time. However, we were welcomed as if was the beginning of the day. The hot chocolate was AMAZING just like if I was in Paris and the lemon tart was perfect just the right amount of tartness."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2020-05-20,4.0,"I usually come here to get drinks before heading the the D train. Today, we passed by here while heading to the Manhattan bridge and it was open. They only take mobile order, therefore download the app before hand. This makes sense. No one wants to be touching anything unnecessary. KFT Drinks are pretty sweet but I'm a fan of sweet. Even if it's 50% sugar level, it's consider sweet for a lot of people. Funny thing, after placing my mobile order, other people stopped by to get bubble tea."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-07-30,5.0,"I asked one of the many server girls that I love, here, on a date. But then I found out how old she is, or isn't, I should say. So we had to cancel. So it's ""Young Fu Tea.""

Jando is right, it's the Starbucks of Bubble Tea. And who doesn't like rapping about Starbucks. Um. What.

It makes some of the rivals taste like eating cow DUNG FU
It's at the top of the ladder, while you're on the lowest RUNG FU
You'll love if you're easy going, even highly STRUNG FU
So if you want a Lemon Black Tea, you come to KUNG FU

I tasted it and screamed so loud that I collapsed a LUNG FU
I carried on screaming and sounded like Angus YOUNG FU
They played Sting on the radio, but I'm already STUNG FU
By the wondrous Lemon Black Tea they serve at KUNG FU

I went to the toilet, opened Snapchat, then I SUNG FU
Came back, took my pants off, and the girls yelled ""HUNG FU!""
In walked Barbie and immediately I'm SPRUNG FU
And you should come and get a Lemon Black Tea from KUNG FU!

WHAT

So I keep seeing girls (and boys) in miniskirts in this location. Now I know why they call it ""Sprung Fu Tea.""

What to get: Lemon Black Tea With Tapioca!
Or: All the fruit teas are pretty good, especially if you go off menu and get black tea!
Or: Go crazy and order your fruit teas with the very strong Oolong!
Or in winter: Any of the hot milk teas!
Which milk teas are best: Honey Oolong! Oolong! Maybe Taro or Almond!
What else is good: I have a weird obsession with the Milk Tea w/Oreo and Boba. Winter Melon drinks are good too. Even in summer. Gasp.

The Kung Fu Fighters are one of my favourite bands. Their biggest hit was ""Learn To Fu"" but I also really love ""Ever-oolong.""

This is a super cute little Kung Fu tea location with really friendly service, perfectly located in the heart (or rather on the edge of the heart) of Manhattan's Chinatown about two blocks from where little Sammi Puff (the baby cat I found in Queens) hung out for an hour or two while I tried all the different Chinatown stuff before driving her to Stroudsburg and then Buffalo and then all the way down to Houston Texas which is her new home which she loves very much. Did I just digress? But yeah. So for that reason this location has special memories for me, but definitely a great location and super friendly as well and I'll definitely be stopping here on a regular basis.

It is tiny and claustrophobic and often busy but that's okay. They have a couple of counters where you can sit, but that's about it. Some posters on the wall (read, all the posters on all the walls from special offers going back years), and like I said - really friendly girls working here.

Generally speaking, Kung Fu Tea scores 5, which is a huge compliment, considering that it's a massive international corporate chain, whose milk teas don't match up to the best chains: Sharetea, Gong Cha, Tea Top, and Coco. However, they're still really good, and the fruit teas here are among the best. Especially the lemon black tea which absolutely rocks my world. Total addict. If it's not on the menu, demand it!

Other fruit teas (Berry, Orange, Grapefruit) must also be ordered off-menu as Black Tea instead of the meh Green, and some locations won't do it unless you bat your lashes and such. Also the Lemon Black tastes good as a Lemon Oolong, but everyone else hates it that way - because they have bad taste.

The one annoying thing about the chain is the corporate office (they're sketchy, and not in an artistic way) and their rule that no drink can have its tea altered (which I often convince employees to circumvent) (because it gives me an excuse to use the word circumvent).

Anyway let's get some food to go with our Bubble Teas. I'm feeling kung-ry."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2020-02-07,5.0,Staff were really nice the prices are competitive with other places. I got a hot Thai tea with regular tapioca and it tasted a little different (strong black tea taste and not as sweet) than Thai tea that Ive had before but still good. Not really many spots to sit at.
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2020-01-17,5.0,Can never go wrong with Kung fu tea. I always get either the oolong tea or regular milk tea. The bubbles here are good and chewy. You can also adjust the sugar level as it tends to be on the sweeter side but that's what I love about Kung fu tea. They also have a reward system on the phone app. Gotta collect all those bubbles!
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-01-20,3.0,"Let me not bore you with my on-going Brown Sugar Boba Milk journey... I definitely wanted to try as much of KFT branches as possible.  After a gluttony dinner at Grand Seoul, we walked over and grabbed  a large Cocoa Cream Wow... this branch doesn't really deliver the goods.  The boba was not soft, not sweet and way too much milk, lots of ice. Not my fav. 

I wish all the branches are consistent however, it's decent enough to quench your craving."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-02-28,5.0,"Wow! I love boba... and live in Chinatown.

The boba scene is competitive here. You can find so many boba stores spread throughout the area, but Kung Fu Tea stands out. I always go for the Oolong Milk Tea and it's delicious at Kung Fu. Definitely suggest giving this spot a shot. They use real tea and the boba has such great texture."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-08-29,1.0,"Stopped by at this location for the first time this year to give it another try. I ordered the Rose hip milk tea and my boyfriend ordered the winter melon lemonade. After taking one sip of the rosehip milk tea, I immediately taste a bad sourness in the drink. I asked the cashier if the drink was suppose to be sour. She asked the barista if he made the drink and he told me it's rose berry. I then told him the drink taste sour and is there any way I can exchange to another drink. He turned to the cashier and asked ""is it okay? It's your call (in Chinese)"" and the cashier turned around and told me ""no"". I threw the drink away before leaving the store. 

Bottom line is, the drink tasted sour when it's not suppose to, and instead of accommodating a customer's wish to exchange the drink, they refused to show any customer gesture. So therefore, I will NEVER return to this location and support their business."

At this point, I might as well apply for the Guinness book of world records for the number of Kung fu tea places I've been to, or have a documentary about how much impact I've made on the population of honey bees from the number of bubbles I've consumed here."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2018-08-01,4.0,"Kung Fu Tea is such a classic place to get boba. Went with a friend after dinner since we were craving for boba. The tea was good, but there's nothing too spectacular about this space because its what you'd expect for a boba shop. 

AMBIANCE:
Kung Fu tea is a tiny shop! There's a small space in front of the cashier to stand and wait for your order, and theres a small ""bar"" seating area that can fit three or four chairs. Definitely more of a to go place.

PROS:
There are so many options you can choose from! At least 30+ drinks that these guys can make so it definitely can satisfy most if not all cravings people have for boba on any given day or night. I opted for the coconut milk tea medium sized with boba and that came around ~$4.60 ish. There are quite a few toppings you can add to your drink besides tapioca balls, and also you can customize your drink to your personal preferences based on the level of sugar and ice in it. 

I got my drink at 30% sugar and it was the perfect level of sweetness. 50% is usually very sweet. You can watch your drinks get made on the spot at the machine. You can also taste the coconut flavor in it and the consistency was very smooth and not too creamy/milky. A definite plus for me. 

My friend got the Lychee punch and enjoyed it alot. Since he is a die hard lychee fan anything that has lychee in it will score points for him. Definitely lots of different lychee options at Kung Fu ranging from punches to slushies. 

CONS:
Only complaints is that this shop doesn't accept credit cards. Other Kung Fu tea shops do especially as you move north of Chinatown in Manhattan. 

OVERALL:
Great spot to grab a quick boba or milk tea drink. Lots of options and customization here to personalize your own drink. Definitely affordable place as well, so will recommend anyone to check this spot out."

I think the large size is more worth than the medium size.

I got the milk cap honey green tea with no bubbles and I really enjoyed my drink! The cream layer is salty so when you mix with the drink, it's very good. 
 
My friends got the milk green tea and Taro milk tea with bubbles. They both didn't like their drink mainly cause the bubbles were very bad. It was overcooked is what they pressume.

They take card and cash. Minimum for card is not stated."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-03-11,5.0,"I went for chai milk and added bubbles, herbal jelly and pudding to it. Chai milk was really good. I think that is black tea with milk. I can't say that herbal jelly and pudding added much taste to it, but certainly bubbles were nice. This location only has two counter seats, and mostly those are occupied.

I shared a hefty Medium Oreo bubble tea, which was very filling and sweet. It's a bit hard to get all the blended Oreo pieces at the bottom of the cup with a straw, but it's doable. Great treat!"
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-04-19,5.0,"Delicious as always! Definitely a lot of variety to choose from. Enjoy rather it's regular tea, milk tea, smoothies or just any drinks in general! It's definitely delicious and enjoyable. It comes in medium and large size. One of the common bubble tea I usually get is oolong milk tea. The taste isn't to strong as it's delicious. You can always choose fans tell them how much sugar and ice you want in ur drink which they make it perfectly."

24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2018-10-07,4.0,Got the taro milk tea - it was ok. A little too sweet even though I asked for 0 sugar (because the taro mix they use is pre-sweetened)

Atmosphere - casual, doesn't have room for much seating inside. Possibly enough for 2-3 people

Tea - So I opted out for a cold bubble tea & instead went with HOT honey & milk green tea & it was so good!

I got the grapefruit green tea which was incredibly refreshing after I moved into my new apartment. The cashier was focused on several other things and I wanted to shout take my money bi***. Anyways, tons of bubble tea options in Ctown, just checking if this was any different than the Kung Fu Teas in Boston. $10 minimum for credit card use."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2018-06-06,4.0,"Kung Fu in any state/city/anywhere this is the place to go if you want quality everywhere. It's the same everywhere. This is where I frequent when I visit in Atlanta, and now they have one in Charlotte. I did wish they were there where I live, but that's a different story.

This shop is small, but it gets the work done. I always get the oolong milk tea with no sugar, no ice, and the popping bobas. I know, I'm crazy. I do like the taste of the tea more than the sweetness of it, so that's my usual go to. If you're looking for a quick boba spot, and want quality that doesn't change... Kung Fu Tea is the place to go."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2018-05-28,4.0,"Kung Fu tea is consistently good in any state/city I have had it. It still remains one of my favorite boba places.

24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2017-10-23,4.0,"Kung Fu Tea is located all over NY but I've only been to this location. It's located on the corner sandwiched right between Popeye's chicken and my favorite Chinese BBQ joint in all of NYC, Wah Fung #1. Yes, that's how I remember where it is.

They have good variety of fruit teas, WOW milk, which I think is just lactose free milk (NO TEA), and all the usual toppings.

We ordered 2 large Kung Fu MT ($3.75) with grass jelly  and 30% sweet. It cost $9.25x 30% sweet was just sweet enough. The MT has a stronger creamier / milky taste than tea taste. Grass jelly was soft, fresh, and smooth. 

I've also had the green MT here as well and it's pretty good. 

The main issue with this location is that it does get packed and I find myself looking for empty space while waiting for my drink."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-07-18,2.0,"Never try Taro milk tea, I ordered one with 30% sugar and it's so sweet that it feels like they poured half cup sugar in it. The staff said it's because of the taro syrup. Anyway a good taro drink should never taste too sweet. I have to dump it after two sip, a completely waste of money. Other milk tea is okay but never good."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-06-28,5.0,The Taro bubble tea is awesome! Also a very cool location! Staff was nice and the tea was amazing!
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2018-12-13,3.0,Forgot to take a pic of my drink before I started drinking so this pic of my half finished drink will have to do. I honestly love kft but this drink sorta got wanting to throw up. The drink was fine. There wasn't a lot of taro flavor to me. A bit too sweet but that was my fault since I didn't specify the sugar levels. The bubbles were pretty hard though. I opened and started drinking it a little while after I bought it so I'm pretty sure that wasn't my fault. I will still go to kft in the future but probs not this one
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2018-01-23,5.0,My go to drink is usually the passion fruit slush with boba. Their tapioca is always a good topping. I would have to say this and boba guys have some of the best bubble tea in the city. Their drinks are usually very good and they have a variety of quality ingredients that can be mixed in. Numerous stores in NYC and they're all pretty consistent.
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2017-08-28,2.0,"While I like the tea at this place. The attitude is horrible. The girl taking the order seems really miserable and probably needs to not work there anymore. I don't usually take offense but I think other bubble tea places have much more hospitable friendly helpers. They can't just be rushing everyone to order. Otherwise they should ask how much sugar and ice their customers would like. Needless to say, I forgot to ask them to reduce the sugar and got a drink so sugary, I ended up throwing most of it away. And for $$ it was really such a waste.
I really hate this culture of ""if you don't ask then you don't get to change the options"" really good customer service is that they present all the options to you and don't assume! Minus 3 stars just for that. Also boo on the minimum of $10 for credit card use. Who uses cash anymore..."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-01-16,2.0,"$10 card minimum. Went with default large bubble tea, it was way too sweet and too much ice. Boba was also pretty hard. Maybe it was an off day or I should have customized the order, but I've never had this problem at gong cha or vivi"
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2016-07-12,4.0,"Bubble tea is like dessert. Even when you're full from dinner, somehow there's still room for a sweet tea-infused beverage. Kung Fu Tea is everywhere, so you can't avoid it. I don't get boba cravings very often, but Mr. Joy does. So when he orders a drink, I say I'll just have a sip and somehow end up drinking nearly half of it. Lucky for me, a regular size from Kung Fu Tea is plenty, and makes a good size for sharing.
 
The have a good selection of flavors to try including the typical ones and some unique ones. I wonder what 'wow milk' is. 
Kung Fu Tea is one of those tea places that allows you to customize your level of sweetness. I find 30% sugar sweet enough.
Prices are reasonable. The milk tea is around $3-$4 and boba is an additional $0.50.
Service is pretty efficient and polite. Even when we sat by the window and chit-chatted until closing time, they patiently cleaned around us while we finished our drinks, which was very nice of the staff."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-04-23,1.0,Very rude service and they only take credit card if your purchase is over $10.00 which is hidden in very little type next underneath a layer of cards) not prominently displayed on the door or the counter edifice.

The second time was too late when I realized the herbal jelly was missing and I was in a car already! (Note: my order wasn't complicated.. it was a hot milk tea with herbal jelly and 30% sugar level) 

The cashier was super nice don't get me wrong, but I didn't expect the order to be messed up twice lol. I just wanted a hot drink on a cold day after work! 

Maybe better luck next time, but in the meantime, I guess I gotta stick to my usual store!"
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2016-02-23,4.0,"Located about a block away from the Grand St. station stop on the B D line, on Christie St. Its also near the park in Chinatown.

I usually go here after a filling lunch/dinner at one of the many restaurants nearby.

Kung Fu tea offers alot of different flavors of bubble teas and slushes. I usually only get the Kung Fu milk tea with bubbles or the taro tea with bubbles. Both drinks are very refreshing and have the right amount of sugar and ice added without adjustment. (You can change the sugar level and ice to your liking - I just never do)

This place is open later than most of its neighbors. As such, its a good place to get bubble tea at night. Its centralized location in Chinatown, is hard to miss at night, mostly because it's the only thing that's lit up, past about 7 or 8 o'clock."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-10-24,1.0,"This is a problem and they should not be allowed to be here. It's not ""what can we can do for you"". It's ""what we can't do for you""! Pretty much over half the menu is off limits. They didn't even have bubbles that day. But it worked out. I went next store to J-Petal and found my new place that has everything you can imagine. It's a bubble tea place and more. Go to J-Petal. Close Kung Fu Tea! Or fix your menu and be honest."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2017-07-30,4.0,"I've been searching for the perfect bubble tea in NYC. 

While my quest for ""perfection"" is still ongoing, this is one of my top contenders from the long list of bubble tea places I've tried. 

Friendly staff, a lot of drink options, and thankfully their stuff isn't over the top sweet and syrupy. 

I got the lychee green tea with bubbles. The regular sweetness level was sweet, but not nearly as pow over the head with sugar as other places. 

You can modify sweetness level etc here too."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2016-05-30,4.0,"This spot was made known to me when I saw it featured  in an online video. It is a popular boba chain in the New York and New York City area. 

The concept is catchy as is the name. And it does appeal to a wide demographic of growing bubble (boba) tea and even iced tea drinkers. 

Boba originates in Taiwan and the bubbles actually occur when make the drink. Different places use different mixes and different types of tea. In more authentic places you can taste the actual tea. 

This particular location is in Chinatown in a very active area near the Grand street park and subway line. There are an abundance of flavors one can try out which works require multiple trips. This place certainly has its regulars and no doubt does as well as the other franchises. 

I prefer colder slushy type of drinks when possible. So I ordered the Italian mocha. Now with something with that degree of cold, the tapioca tends to get less chewy more quickly. So this is the type of drink you would sip more quickly. 

Service was prompt and courteous. That place at certain times and at peak times can be filled to capacity. There is some standing room and some sitting along the window facing the park. 

Sometimes there is an issue of them opening on time but the employees do seem to very diligent. 

There is an extensive menu to try. Taro is always good. If buying a lot of tea at once I find that ordering without the tapioca balls allows you to store a little longer ( but not too long )."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2015-12-24,5.0,"Great drinks and great service. I'd say one of the best around! I come here with my friends and my boyfriend all the time.
Kung-fu tea is a great brand itself and this branch gives it that extra boost to excellence. 
This specific location is pretty popular. It's always packed but of course that's a good sign. Why else would people crowd over?
There are so many choices! I love their green milk tea, oolong, lychee punch, and passionfruit. Their hot taro is also great, it's made with fresh taro. My mom loves it."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-02-22,5.0,"I've been on a quest for the best bubble tea in NYC since I moved here, and most of my experiences have been ranged from meh to decent. I don't know why I waited so long to try KFT, but I'm glad I finally stopped by because it definitely served up one of the better bubble teas I've had so far.

I ordered the honey oolong milk tea with bubbles, and SO ordered a Caribbean Breeze slush with bubbles. Despite the weird looks we got from the workers when we asked for less honey/syrup, the drinks we got came out at the perfect amount of sweetness, so I'd hate to see what the regular sweetness level is. 

My favorite part about the bubble tea I had here was that the tea taste actually came through. I've had so many drinks where the taste of the milk powder is so overwhelming and actually leaves a weird residue in my mouth. Not here! However, the bubbles were a little too firm for my liking. But that could be because I brought it home to drink instead of drinking it immediately, so I will definitely be back to try it fresh."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2018-03-31,5.0,I always have the signature milk tea. Really strong taste of Kong Fu tea. The taste is natural and simple. No artificial ingredients. Absolutely a fan.
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2015-07-09,5.0,"Lychee punch : lychee syrup & pulp. It's the same as lychee green tea, but they add the pulp. I don't like to drink it sweet so I always ask for little sugar which is 30% of the amount of sugar they normally add.

24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2016-11-14,4.0,"This place is cash only! 

I like how this place is near the grand street train station. They have a variety of different drinks and I decided to get the Honey black tea. It's only one size though since it is a hot drink. 

I recommend the the honey black tea, because it soothes your throats and black tea is a healthy alternative to the other drinks. 

As for seating they only have 4-5 stools. There is a park nearby so you can grab it to go."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2017-06-12,3.0,"Kung fu tea's claim to fame is they use real tea instead of a powder mix. The result is typically a much bolder flavored brew. As with most bubble tea places, you can also customize the sweetness and amount of ice in your drink. 

There are no other frills here, the only thing they serve are the drinks. Personally, I do not prefer kung fu tea at any of their locations. While it's gets the job done, I find that I can have a better drink at less of a cost at most other bubble tea places. This is especially true in Chinatown. 

I used to live a block away from a different location and the bubbles were never fresh because they always stuck together. Fortunately, I have never experienced that at this location. Seating is limited to three bar stools so plan to take your drink to go or stand outside"
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2018-07-09,4.0,"This shop, like many of their other chains is solid. The boba is good and the options are consistent as well. I would recommend oolong milk tea or the earl grey milk tea with jelly. 

The place never disappoints and is in a convenient little spot too, where there are plenty of great places to eat and sit."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2017-12-30,4.0,This is my go-to place for bubble tea if I am in Chinatown. Staff are pretty nice. I usually get the taro milk tea/taro slush or the wintermelon tea with herbal jelly. Also something to keep in mind... $10 minimum for credit card.
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2016-07-27,4.0,"I had $5 in my pocket, and had to choose between getting bubble tea at Kung Fu or getting quarters for laundry on a 95 degree day. Guess which one I chose?

I like Kung Fu because you can choose the amount of sugar (I like 0-30%) and the amount of ice (less please!), they list their calorie information, and it's generally pretty consistent. Much like Starbucks drinks, I don't like downing half my day's calories in one drink, so I like that Kung Fu gives you options for all tastes and diets. My go-to is green tea with 0 sugar, less ice, and of course, boba. Boring? Sure. Delicious? Heck yeah.

This location is more of grab and go since it's so ridiculously tiny, but that doesn't detract from the quality of the drinks or the friendliness of their staff. And the Chinatown park/playground is literally across the street if you need someplace to hang out.

If only they accepted cards, I'd be back here way more often!"
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2018-05-14,4.0,"This is a great place to grab some bubble tea! It  has an array of options. They have one main electronic menu that is displayed in the front and a few paper menus around. This is helpful because I was able to make my choice by the time I got to the barista. The machines were pretty fast, which I appreciated. It's not getting the full five stars for two reasons: it is tiny and the only have three stools. We were able to grab seats, but were still bumping into each other. The other reason, is because of the card minimum. I think it was $10. We ordered two medium bubble teas and had to upgrade to a large to meet the minimum. If you're visiting with just one another person, I suggest you bring cash!"
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2019-05-15,5.0,"I have never tried Bubble tea before but it was so tasty. It is a Taiwanese drink made of tea and milk mixed with fruits and topped off with chewy tapioca balls. It was invented in Taichung in the 1980's. You can customize it in 3 steps: Topping Level, Sugar Level and Ice Level. I ordered mine with 0 Sugar Level and Topping from strawberry jelly. You can have it hot or cold. I am in love with it!"
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2016-05-30,5.0,"My coworker has recently really been hipping me to ChinaTown and putting me on to a couple of spots.  This spot has quickly become a new fav of mine and part of my routine when I visit C&L Dumpling, which is only about 2 doors down.  I tried the passion-fruit green tea with lychee and it was pretty amazing.  I really don't care for anything that has the same consistency as Jello, but I am glad I was willing to try something new. If you aren't crazy about lychee or the tapioca balls then you can request your tea without anything in it.  I promise you they will not look at you as if you are crazy.

The staff is nice and efficient in their job and you will not be waiting a long time to get your drink.  This is a rather small space and I would not recommend bringing large groups to sit down and enjoy your beverages."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2017-10-23,5.0,"Delicious bubble tea! I got the taro milk tea with boba at regular sweetness, and it was perfect in every way. Nice balanced taro flavor, perfectly cooked boba and just the right amount of it, fair price. It might be too sweet for most Asians, but it was just what this Asian with a sweet tooth was looking for. The store is tiny and there is virtually no seating, but there is plenty of space to sit by the park nearby and sip your cup of creamy chewy goodness."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2017-10-04,4.0,"Through and through, for a good bubble tea, this is the go-to. Slight of hand, subtle perfect-ure of powder to milk ratio, KFT knows good bubble tea. I am partial to their almond tea, earl grey milk tea (essential regular mt), taro if the mood suits and citrus smoothies. Best part about them? You can control the amount of sugar, milk, ice and toppings. Yes, a lot of places offer this too now, but KFT has built a loyal following by establishing a solid recipe- their milk/coffee staples are blended well. Or maybe there is such a thing as marketing and striking while the irons hot. I'm no boba expert but I like their consistency, wide and ease of selection and their pudding/bubble/lychee topping. Luck or hard work, or a bit of both, KFT has become the sbux of bubble teas."

The Long:
Kung Fu Tea is a pretty standard boba spot that has even made its way to the west coast and California with success.  Their fruity drinks are where they thrive, with their lychee punch being my go to refreshing drink. Most of their fruit drinks actually have bits of real fruit which is nice.  Their milk drinks are very creamy (a little too creamy for me) and I always go 50% on the sugar to prevent the drink from being overpowering.  But if you like creamy and sweet, this is your place to go. I usually stick to their jasmine milk tea and lychee punch as my go to drinks. Overall, decent and standard boba."

I'm big on Kung Fu Tea but very hesitant on this location.  I've been here twice and both times my drink tasted diluted.  For reference, I've been to several other locations of this chain in both NY and Boston so have a reasonable perspective of what my rotation of drinks tastes like.  Also, cash only?  In the age of Square?  Really?  Never other spot I've been to accepts cards with a reasonable minimum."
24,kung-fu-tea-new-york-31,2018-08-16,5.0,Bubble tea paradise. Holy moly! I got my beloved grapefruit green tea. They were careful to tell me how bitter it would be so I upped the sugar and it came out perfectly...also tried the jasmine green tea with milk foam which tasted like cream cheese and it was so good! I also got mini bubbles - I didn't even know such a thing existed.
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-12-12,5.0,"Such a gem in SoHo! Lots of sweet and savoury creations. Chobani yogurt is smooth, thick and delightfully creamy. 

We opted for a sweet option and ordered the Pistachio and Dark Chocolate half size to share. It was topped with pistachios, dark chocolate, orange, mint, and clover honey. The half size was more than enough to share as a post-meal dessert. The flavours of each component balanced each other out and you can tell they use quality ingredients. 

Such a unique spot amongst all the other ice cream shops out there!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2020-02-14,4.0,"I love going to Chobani! The yogurt bowls are so fresh and great, the salads are awesome, and it's super cute inside. It can get crowded and touristy so seating can be very limited, but I always order to-go. 

I would not suggest getting their bagels.. they are kind of dry and not what you think of when you hear bagel. But everything else I've had here has been amazing!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2020-02-09,4.0,"I stopped by this cafe to have breakfast. I really liked that there were a lot of options on the menu to order. I got the Chobanj non fat yogurt with pistachio, dark chocolate, sliced orange, and honey. It felt light and was delicious. I also ordered a coffee since they serve La Colombe, which I love. 

Service was great. It is a small place, but I did find a place to sit. Unfortunately, the whole time o was sitting a worker was filling a fridge by the checkout and kept banging into my chair. This is the only reason why I give four stars. I get that the fridge had to be filled, but it shouldn't have taken him 35 min to do it and he could have been more respectful wIth the banging into my chair. The fridge is there for those e

I would definitely come back and try to sit in another seat that isn't so close to the fridge.  Who want a grab and go drink or chobanu yogurt."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-10-30,5.0,"This is my absolute favorite go to place for lunch. Lots of vegetarian options of course. 

I typically go for the half simit and half soup combo ($9). I love the tomato and olive tapenade simit sandwich. The simit is basically a bagel but tastes lighter and in my opinion better :). I've found that the labneh it comes with is a great substitute for cheese/mayo - it's very creamy and slightly tangy. I also really like the Turkish red lentil soup. Its also on the lighter side but definitely fills you up and is seasoned very well. 

Cafe itself is nice..it's a small space and gets quickly crowded during lunch hours. I prefer to order ahead via Ritual app so I can easily pick up and not wait in line. 

Will definitely keep coming back to try more items. On my list to try is their hummus/Za'atar creation as well as their sweet items."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2020-01-28,5.0,"Love this unique cafe (yes, from the Chobani brand) when I'm in need of a healthy snack. I believe this is the only location left in the city. They used to have a pop up inside one of the Target stores. Their menu shows the many different ways to create healthy and delicious snacks using Greek yogurt, ranging from sandwiches to fruit bowls. The sweet and savory yogurt bowls are my favorite! Blueberry and Power, Hummus and za'atar, Mango and avocado. In the past, you could keep the glass bowl as a complimentary gift but now it's only about a dollar and some change. Now that I've moved away from the city, these bowls are a fun way to reminisce on my experience and create my own yogurt bowl at home!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-06-10,5.0,"Wow a yummy yogurt/breakfast/brunch place!!! I really loved what I had. Space is very limited but we were lucky to get 2 seats at the window looking out onto the street. Sorry to the man sitting there prior to us, we kept yapping into his personal space but it was so tight so we had no choice. 
It's a little on the pricey side but it seems everything is like that in NYC except some places in Chinatown."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-06-28,4.0,"I got their fresh fruit and granola (half size, $6+). It comes with one choice of fruit (strawberry, mango, banana, blueberries etc). The bowl had yogurt at the bottom, oats in the middle, then top with diced mango. 

For the environment, it's a great cafe with free wifi and tables for working. They have coffees as well!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-08-07,4.0,"I had soup and mango & avocado yogurt set for my lunch but I didnt feel full at all due to their mini portion for each order. 
Their food was good but the set I ordered might be only for snack between meals. 
I love to dine in there since their interior design is really cozy and let you feel relaxed."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-08-02,4.0,"Great spot for fresh ingredients and a light snack! The store is always full with locals and tourists and is a pretty unique spot to lounge at in SOHO. 

Venue has a pretty relaxed feel to it, many different spots to sit and enjoy your yogurt. They also offer more than yogurt, small sandwiches, coffee and tea available. 

The move pretty well to get people in and out. They even have a server floating around to help with order flow. 

Went with the pistachio and dark chocolate which comes with oranges, clover honey, and mint leaves. It's delicious. Full serving recommended over half (only $1 dollar difference) 

Choose to stay and they'll provide with a nice glass bowl and plate. It's really upscale.

Definite must try if in the area and visiting. Also good for lounging around and getting work done if you'd like to beat the monotony of coffee shops. I'd say 4.5/5 stars (only knock is its ever so slightly more expensive than it needs to be but you're paying for the experience and location). That being said highly recommend."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2020-03-04,5.0,Have been to Chobani Soho store many times and never disappointed. Huge selection of breakfast and lunch items that are always fresh. I typically get their yogurt with berries granola and honey so delicious. This time I tried one of their savory creations with mango jalapeños avocado and olive oil so unique and tasty.
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"I didn't think I'd love this place so much. I'm not really a big fan of yogurt or Greek yogurt in general, and I thought this would be kind of like a yogurt place. But this place was fantastic! I had the Simit, which is like a Turkish  bagel. The one I chose had Smoked Salmon + Herbed labne I ended up getting just half because I was worried that I wouldn't like it or that it would be too heavy like a fought bagel. The sandwich was really small and light, and it was a much better deal to get the full sandwich especially because it was delicious!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-07-20,4.0,"I honestly didn't expect this to be as good as it was. They had turkish simit bagels and I ordered the smoked salmon with the herbed labneh. For $7, I don't think the half is worth it, but for $10 the full size is a pretty good amount especially if you're looking for something that's not too heavy and decently healthy. It was surprisingly flavorful and I actually really liked the texture of the simit bagel since it was somewhat crispy from the sesame seeds but definitely chewy enough. 

As for the atmosphere, I definitely think this is a great spot to meet up with people to chat or to even get some work done. It's well lit, has working space, but is also cute. I'd definitely come again."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-07-01,3.0,"I got the toasted coconut and pineapple yogurt ($7.60). I liked the toasted coconut bits in the yogurt and the pineapples were refreshing and sweet. However, I think this is something that I could make at home if I wanted to and I'm not sure if paying almost $8 for the yogurt is really worth it. 

However, this can be a healthy lunch or dessert place!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-04-09,5.0,"Came here yesterday on a whim while walking around Soho and I'm so glad I did! I'm a fan of Chobani yogurts, in specific their Almond Coco Loco Flip and the low-fat coconut flavor (it tastes like heaven!!). It was a no-brainer that I was going to go for their Toasted Coconut + Pineapple Sweet Creation and it was amazing!! It had a nice amount of pineapple pieces, coconut flakes, crushed hazelnuts, mint, and agave nectar - the combination was delicious and not overly sweet. I noted that they have half and full sizes - I went for the former which was a perfect small treat. If you want something other than yogurt they also have sandwiches, salads, soups, breakfast bowls and shakes.

The store itself is super cute - there's plenty of seating and if you choose to dine in they bring your purchase directly to your table. Def. recommend if you're around the area!!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-04-08,4.0,"Super cool location- I love that there's a coffee shop next door. The look of this place is amazing- very Insta-worthy. 

I'm not a big Greek yogurt fan, so I just came here to use the bathroom and then drink the coffee we got from next door. 

If you like Greek yogurt- the food looked amazing."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-04-08,3.0,"Beautiful Cobb salad both tasty and nice presentation. Dressing tasted a bit cheap would love it to be more special given the place. 
Did not like the hummus savory but probably just personal preference. 
Would come back to try the sweet one."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-12-01,4.0,"I love regular Chobani Greek yogurt, so when I found out that there was a Chobani cafe in SoHo, I had to stop by. This is my second time coming here, and I definitely recommend getting the half and half combo. I got the combo with the blueberry power yogurt and the tomato and olive tapenade. For the yogurt, it's basically an elevated Chobani yogurt. There's a wide variety of fresh fruit, granola, and seed toppings to choose from. The simit sandwiches are good as well. They are similar to bagels except they're narrower. A half and half combo is pretty filling for a meal. 

The overall aesthetic of the cafe is very cute and cozy. There's a few tables and some couches to sit on. However, it is small so the cafe can get pretty crowded at peak times. Presentation of the food is nice, and if you get food to go, it comes in a cute paper Chobani bag."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-09-13,3.0,"I got the blueberry power yogurt and it was $8 for a full size. It is basically some topping son plain greek yogurt. I definitely don't think this was worth $8. It is a cool shop just to see though and and has a nice interior. If you come, I wouldn't really recommend any of the yogurts just because they can be made at home for so much cheaper. However, the drinks could be good? I also saw a lot of people getting salads."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-12-10,5.0,"Stopped in for a quick breakfast while waiting to meet up with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. There were a decent amount of people, but not to the point where I had to wait on line (maybe one person was in front of me) or a table. 

If you eat chobani yogurt and you've never been to a chobani cafe, you NEED to get yourself here! I was so impressed on my first visit here. I've never really had savory yogurts before, so I figured I'd choose one from their menu. I got the hummus + za'atar yogurt creation - SO GOOD. If it's your first time having savory yogurt creations, I highly suggest this one! It is served with pita chips for dipping. The yogurts are also filling, worth the price in my opinion! I was satisfied with a half size. Definitely coming back here if I'm in the area.

Service: If you are having your food/drink to stay, the staff will bring your order to you. When I was there, they also took it away from me when I was finished. 
Interior: Clean, comfortable and cute. Well lit. There are seats along the windows with stools and small tables. There is also a larger, rectangular wooden table. Decent amount of seating. I did not have to wait for a seat. Saw maybe two or three people with laptops. 

I will come back to try their other menu items. Their sandwiches and soups look good (esp. the smoked salmon one!)"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2020-01-20,5.0,"Really cute cafe for the famous yogurt brand! I really liked their any two combo (either half salad, half sandwich, or half creation). The roasted turkey and avocado sandwich was particularly good. Also loved the sweet creations we got (peanut butter and jelly, dark chocolate and Pistachio) and it's nice they come in either half or full sized. Would highly recommend for a healthy meal with a sweet and still relatively healthy treat at the end. Interior of the cafe is also very cute! They also gave out many samples of their vanilla and plain oat milk."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-03-31,4.0,"Pretty cool place for breakfast/brunch, although there's limited seating. We were pretty lucky and didn't have to wait around much before two seats opened up. We shared a half order of the Smoked salmon and herbed labneh ($6.95) and a half order of Greek yogurt with toasted coconut and pineapple ($6.35). Pretty good. It turned out to be a good combination and we weren't super hungry then."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-11-04,5.0,"The flavors and selections here are really good and they taste delicious. For anyone just interested in the yogurt it comes in two sizes: half portion ($7) or a large portion $8+). The half portion is a pretty good size and will fill you up, for reference it's about a little more than your standard chobani yogurt you'll find in the grocery store, but the toppings are really fresh and delicious. The base of the yogurt is exactly what you'd buy in the grocery store-the plain Greek yogurt. So theoretically you could make it at home if you wanted to. But let's be real, it's so much easier spending $$$

If you come during the fall season, get the fall special with pumpkin custard, pumpkin seeds, cranberries, and pie crust! It's sooo good it's like you're eating a pumpkin pie. 

Yes it's pretty pricey for a cup of yogurt, especially when you know you can get it cheaper in the grocery store, but I mean it's really worth it! 

There is seating but it does get pretty packed (I passed by this place several times on a Saturday and it was packed for the entire time!). Service is quick and fast. And if you want coffee there is a La Columbe coffee shop attached!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-06-02,4.0,"How great to have stumbled into a shop dedicated to yogurt! We decided to go here on our trip to NY as we could only handle so many bagels for breakfast. My boyfriend got one of the smoothies and I got the breakfast cereal with pourable yogurt. It was really delicious, however I wish the yogurt was a little bit thicker. The place has plenty of seating and even savory yogurt options so that everyone is satisfied!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-09-25,2.0,"The simit and soup portions for the sets are tiny so definitely view it more as a snack vs a meal.  The red lentil soup is pretty solid - creamy and savory and the sesame simit with labneh is solid.  They also have a cream cheese option for those who prefer a creamier spread.  The price is very steep for what you get, though, so your mileage may vary.  The yogurt cups are a nice relatively healthy snack but again the $6+ price point is very steep for a tiny cup."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2020-03-07,5.0,Ordered the turkey and avocado sandwich and it was so delicious and fresh! Very cute spot and great staff! Would definitely come back!
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-05-13,5.0,"My favorite place to grab a healthy snack and it's affordable! Chobani SoHo specializes in yogurt bowls, which are usually comprised of a bowl of vanilla yogurt topped with fresh fruit, nuts, etc. The space is very airy and has plenty of natural light with ample seating, making it a pleasant place to catch up with friends. The other thing that I liked about this place a lot was that it sold Chobani cups for less than the bodegas in the area."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2020-02-21,3.0,"I was a bit disappointed by this place. I was excited to get there, as I eat Greek yogurt almost every day and I loved the idea of being able to order it out. The menu is so limited. I was expecting much more variety in terms of toppings and creativity.  I feel that an a la carte menu would be great....pick your own toppings (fruits, nuts, granola, etc) in addition to the offered combinations on the menu. Also, the portions could definitely be offered in a larger size. The large size is relatively small. A size a bit larger would be nice. Despite my issues, I did enjoy my yogurt, however, I can't say I will hurry back."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-09-12,4.0,"I am a die hard chobani fan anyways! I love going to this cafe and just having the healthiest snack I could ever have! 

They are closed for renovations but not to worry, they have opened a new location inside Target near WTC. This time I tried a sweet and a savory bowl. For sweet I got the Pistachio and dark chocolate, I have had this one before and is always a delight. The combination of the slight sweetness from the dark chocolate and honey against the sourness of the orange and the crunch of the roasted pistachios is a perfect medley! For savory I had the Mango and Avocado. Again a hit! Literally! Coz the Jalapeno hit with the sweetness of mango go perfectly! Abd who doesnt like avocados! My favorite savory creation!

Will definitely keep going!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-08-17,5.0,"First time here and it's such a cute cafe to hang out!   The pistachio and dark chocolate sweet creations' so good! If you're a fan of those two and/or craving for something sweet, definitely try this combination!  Very comfortable, you can do work here too"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-11-10,5.0,"11/10/2019;
We came here for a brunch in the late morning. It was so hard to choose between different breakfast bowls, and I got a toasted coconut and pineapple bowl eventually. The toppings and plain yogurts are really suitable for each other. The only thing is that I didn't expect the half size to be that small haha.
Would like to come again to try more choices!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-06-23,4.0,"Love Chobani! I wasn't aware that Chobani had their own cafes! They had both sweet and savory options to choose from. When I walked in I saw ""labne"" on the menu. Didn't know what labne was; it's a type of yogurt cheese and it's tasty!!! 

I ordered the smoked salmon simit sandwich (Turkish bagel) to-go; the order was wrong, but I didn't realize until afterwards. Instead of the salmon, it was the seasonal preserves labne. It was delicious and probably a lot healthier! 

The tomato soup was also good. It was on the extra small side (combo size). Will go back one of these days to try the salmon!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-05-09,4.0,"This is a perfect spot for a quick and nutritious breakfast or bite. I'm a bit of a yogurt fiend, so I had to stop in here, on a recent trip to NYC. I'm really happy that I did, because the yogurt bowls I tried I liked so much that I had to attempt to recreate the recipes once I got home, because I found myself craving them.  The Blueberry and Power bowl was full of healthy and hearty nuts and seeds like chia, pumpkin and walnut. The Toasted Coconut and Pineapple bowl was so refreshing and summery, and the accent of mint was a welcome surprise. I got both of the yogurt bowls with honey instead of agave nectar. The Pineapple Passionfruit yogurt drink was super tasty, with just the right amount of sweetness. 

This shop was super busy the morning I went, and I'm not surprised. It was bright and airy, the staff were friendly, and it is connected to a La Colombe. If you are in the neighborhood, definitely stop in, but this is a place I would go out of my way for to get my yogurt fix."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-03-24,5.0,"Wow! I didn't even know these little Chobani cafes existed until I walked by the SoHo location today, but I'm happy I took a turn down Prince St.

This is exactly what I picture when you say cafe. It's got cushiony seats situated along the walls of the store so you can just squeeze on in, as well as a few tables around the middle space. If you wanted to meet someone midday and didn't feel like the typical coffee, this is a good snack option with a casual vibe.

I was torn between several menu options, but the friendly cashier helped me decide and even got a second opinion from another employee. I ended up doing a combo with half the hummus and za'atar and half of the ""seasonal salad"" which contained buckwheat soba noodles, pesto, arugula, edamame, and tomatoes.

The star of the show was definitely the pesto noodles. I was hesitant because they obviously contain less yogurt (it's somewhere in the pesto I think?) so I was expecting this to be a less-perfected item to satisfy people who just don't like yogurt. Nope! AMAZING. I'll take a lot of other sauces before pesto but somehow this has me hooked. They gave some extra pesto so I could add more to the drier parts of the arugula and combined with the crunch of the edamame... let's just say I'll be back in like two days.

The hummus was nice too, but it basically just tasted like good hummus/chickpeas and yogurt. Obviously tasty, but didn't blow me away. I didn't eat too many of the crisps that come with it so that might be why I feel this way, but the half portion of the yogurt was significantly less filling than a half portion of the noodle salad.

You can't go wrong stopping here any time of day. I came in at 4pm and spent just over $10 for a combo that ended up becoming my dinner. If you can pop in before the seasonal soba salad gets replaced, I would highly recommend you do so."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-10-24,5.0,"I like the place, it's spacious enough to grab a seat inside and the service is fast enough to grab it and go. Prices are fair for fresh, healthy food (lentil soup and half a simit sandwich for like $15). 

Would definitely want to come back and try their other options."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-04-23,4.0,"I am a big fan of acai bowls. Chobani features a unique use of acai. Since  it is a yogurt company, it has a mixed berry bowl with honey puffed grains, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, toasted coconut, hazelnuts, mint, and acai powder. The toppings come in the bowl and a glass of acai yogurt comes separate. Like a bowl of cereal, you pour the glass of yogurt into the bowl. The dish is delicious.The fruits were very fresh. The grains are good. The ingredient that put the bowl over the top was definitely the hazelnut bites. I love hazelnut in general and the tiny bites of it gave the dish an amazing flavor and crunch.

I also went back to try a bagel with lox. The smoked salmon was very fresh and good. I was not a big fan of the bagel or the cream cheese. In regards to the cream cheese, it had a yogurt taste to it which would make sense since Chobani is a yogurt company. Nevertheless, it tasted a little odd."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-05-29,5.0,"I loved everything about my experience here! 
It was clean, cute, sunny, friendly, everyone was smiling when I visited this nook! 
I loved how creative all the menu options are - it really showcases the versatility of Chobani as an ingredient to a savory or sweet dish. 

I ordered the pistachio and dark chocolate. 
Other ingredients included the orange, mint, clover honey. All of them combined tasted amazing and all complemented one another. 

It's a bit pricey, and you may or may not feel hungry still after eating your yogurt speciality, which is why they offer other food options on the menu, but for me it was sufficient to just order the yogurt speciality.

This is definitely a go-to place when visiting NY, ESPECIALLY if you are a Chobani lover like me :)"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-01-11,5.0,"It is rare to see a grocery brand has a real store. Chobani Simple 100 is one of my favorite yogurt so visiting this place is like going to my favorite singer's concert. I loved the decor, the furnitures and the cute presentation of the yogurt. I had dark chocolate and pistachios, which was very yummy with high quality chocolate, fresh nuts and honey. My friend had figs and walnuts. 
Price is a bit high but still I would love to try all the sweet creations on the menu if I get a chance."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-07-04,4.0,"Everything is great. The combinations are interesting and creative. The choices are varied. The salads are crispy and fresh. My only surprise is the portions are not as generous as the containers suggest.
Otherwise, beautiful and tastefully decorated shop with delicious offerings. Great pre-flight meal for us."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-12-27,2.0,"Really disappointed in this place and how unprofessional it's staff is. I ordered breakfast (2 simit sandwiches) and 2 yoghurt bowls via Uber eats yesterday and more than half of my order was missing, including most ingredients from the sandwiches. When I tried to contact Chobani and Uber eats I was told that we have indicated to the restaurant that we removed all the missing ingredients at the time of the order instead of Chobani canceling the order or letting me know they didn't have the ingredients available. Overall sucky service and this was not the first time this happened either. I will not be ordering from here again. You can have a good product but if your service model is not built around respecting your costumer base, in New York, you won't last long."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-06-29,2.0,"The food was very fresh and the presentation was adorable if you dine in. The atmosphere is also really good, especially in the early morning before the crowd flocks in. 
I ordered a small yogurt bowl, the yogurt tasted good and I liked that it was plain non-sweet yogurt, but the portion of the toppings was very small, just barely there..Also I ordered a side salad, the flavor was okay. Overall, the food is something you can easily prepare at home. If they are more generous on the toppings, maybe it is worth the money."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-07-14,5.0,"It was so amazing to have a chance to meet here with my inspiring leader Hamdi Ulukaya!! As a food engineer and food safety scientist, I'm so proud of the Chobani brand which is a milestone of yogurt based products. 

I'm highly recommending  Chobani Cafe for it's unique yogurt and delicious bowls like in the picture.

We trust in yogurt here"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-07-06,4.0,"I love chobani so when I found out about this place I immediately went. I went with a friend, it's not a big space and we were lucky to find a spot. I got an smoothie and my friend a yoghurt with fruit and chocolate. To be honest I really like chobani but for me it was a little pricey. The smoothie is something that I do everyday, nevertheless it was worth the experience!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-02-09,4.0,"This place is just awesome! It is located in the intersection of Prince and Broadway.
Their menu is very succinct so that customers can make their choices quick. I recommend the combo option of taking half sandwich, small soup or small salad. Among the soup - the Turkish lentil is the best..very smooth! I recommend the quinoa tabbouleh salad with beets in them. When you want to taste something sweet, I recommend the pistachio chocolate flavor on Chobani. Its an ideal way to end your lunch.

One issue is that this place is very small and you may find it hard to get seating especially during peak hours. The staff is very friendly and ensure that you have a good experience.

I will definitely come back to check them out the next time I am in NYC."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2017-10-11,4.0,"The most shamefully yuppie thing about me is that I regularly visit yogurt cafes. Well, second most. Yelping is obviously first.

I first tried out Chobani's brick and mortar cafe when I lived in Soho a couple summers back, and it's become a standard stop when I'm overwhelmed from shopping and sightseeing in this part of town. The interior, white-walled and hip though it is, is not particularly soothing. It's always a little too overrun with tourists and children, though the staff does their best.

The store offers sweet and savory yogurt ""creations,"" as well as some salad and sandwich options. On my most recent visit, I opted for the Peanut Butter and Jelly, which is plain yogurt topped with concord grapes, roasted peanuts, peanut butter, and jelly (duh). At $5something after tax, it's not exactly a steal, but it is a significant portion. It was ready in a few minutes, and I took it to go given the crush of families.

It's good stuff. The sad truth of the Chobani cafe is that you could make any of this yourself, with their products and a trip to the grocery store, so it's hard to get too excited over, but it's good stuff.

Recommended for a healthy improvement over the other options (trucks, cronuts, and macarons) in the neighborhood."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-08-27,5.0,"I ordered honey vanilla breakfast bowls which contains granola, banana, strawberries and chia seeds. I liked the way how it both has crunchy texture and soft texture at the same time. It is not too sweet and not too heavy. Would recommend for a quick lunch"

- Staff 5/5 
- Yogurt 10/10 
** Pineapple - coconut is my go to 
If your looking for a healthy snack, I'd definitely stop here."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-06-13,5.0,"Even though we have free Chobani in the office, I still stopped here for breakfast on multiple days. I love the concept of these pre-made yogurt creations. They're the perfect size for a filling breakfast or a light lunch! Why aren't there more Chobani stores throughout the country? 

It's probably the same greek yogurt they prepackage and sell at grocery stores, but I felt the yogurt served here was much fresher and tastier. They also package it in this super adorable bag with a wooden spoon if you order togo. 

Please open a location in San Francisco! :D"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-08-08,1.0,"Stand there waiting for my take out order for almost 15mins, no one came over ask me if I needs help,  staffs were chatting the whole time instead of take care of my order !!! Won't waste my money here again !"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2017-09-24,4.0,"This place is delicious! I got the granola + yogurt + strawberry full sized combination and it was tasty and filling. Pretty much what you expect - Greek yogurt parfait with fresh fruit. I'm a Greek yogurt fiend so I'll always be satisfied.

The ordering process is annoying - it's hard to see where the line is, and sometimes there are just employees going around the store finding customers who need to order. There's limited seating (Soho problems) but the location / lighting are both really nice. Oh, and you don't get to keep the bowl anymore - it's a few extra dollars, which is disappointing."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-10-19,5.0,"Great place. Great food. Great service. Cheap prices.
Had a combo with half sandwich and half yoghurt creation with red pepper and feta cheese. It was spot on. Would highly recommand to anyone."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2017-08-14,5.0,"I stopped by Saturday afternoon around 2pm and it wasn't that busy. My friend and I ordered the simit sandwich and soup combo which was about $10. It felt a little expensive for the portion. 

I had the salmon and cream cheese which was delicious. I always enjoy that combination. The simit chewy but easy to eat and the labne was slightly sour but not overpowering. My friend had the turkey avocado. I couldn't really taste the turkey cause the portion was so small. It was more of like a vegetable sandwich but still good. We both had the lentil soup which is pureed and very delicious. It wasn't too salty and very comforting."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2020-01-21,5.0,"I work nearby and order take out usually once a week. Prices are cheap considering it's Soho. Inside it's always busy and when I order they prepare fast. Good variety of menu items also. Easy to customize your order, too."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-12-15,5.0,The seasonal pumpkin and cranberry yogurt is my favorite!! Cute location in soho to catch up with friends / take a break from shopping
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2017-04-24,4.0,"It's a glorified Greek yogurt snack shop with delicious--albeit overpriced-- treats. Still delicious!

I had heard about Chobani opening a brick & mortar location near SoHo, so I checked it out one Sunday while walking around the neighborhood. I always topped my Chobani cups at home with granola & fresh fruit, but didn't really see why spending over $6 for that makes sense unless it was for the experience, really.

The staff is friendly, the inside features lots of wooden panels and glass architecture, which is beautiful, and the menu offers a variety of savory treats, sweet yogurt based snacks, and sandwiches.

I had the 
- Fresh Fruit & Granola (seasonal fruits at the time I had were raspberries, mangoes, and strawberries; I enjoyed the treat because the yogurt was plain and the fruits, honey, & granola added the perfect touch of sweetness)

I am not sure if I will be back, but I did enjoy my experience!"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-09-05,5.0,Food was Great.. I Enjoyed it. Place was very nice. Nice people and environment. I would recommend to a friend. I will also return when I'm in the area. Which is a A+ for me.
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-11-26,5.0,"I love this place the food atmosphere, I wish there was one in Miami so I could enjoy on a sunny day. Its refreshing light and satisfied. Mmmm I'm back home and I want one:( I had the popular bowl (sorry I forgot the name). Lots of options to choose from, I bet they are all delicious."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-05-27,5.0,"What a surprise! Our party had a cantaloupe-lychee drink (um, pass), a pineapple passion fruit drink (yum), lentil soup (double yum), and a pressed chicken Brie sandwich (triple yum). Though crowded (and seriously - the dozen folks on laptops without food/drink should be ushered out) it was worth it. I'll be back. But they really should have time limits on people ""hanging out""."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2017-05-21,4.0,"Chobani's brick and mortar cafe is really worth visiting and trying. The interior is very chic and trendy (as are the patrons!) and the menu offerings are quite unique. I was in a hurry, so I went with the basic greek yogurt topped with strawberries, honey, and granola. The quality of the yogurt dish is unparalleled, but the price is quite steep ($6 for a small bowl of yogurt...). 

In addition to greek yogurt, Chobani's cafe/ shop also serves cereals with yogurt milk (interesting!), bagels, and smoothies/ juices. I will definitely be back to try the savory offerings when I have more time to spare."
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2019-08-08,5.0,"i found this place by accident, and i usually don't get such please surprises. the food were very tasty while being healthy. the mixed berry açaí bowl was very fulfilling 8/10"
25,chobani-soho-new-york,2018-03-22,5.0,"I live in rural area where I don't get to eat yogurt very often, so it is usually a food I seek out when traveling.  As ridiculous as it sounds to me to go to a restaurant to eat yogurt, I was intrigued by the idea of a yogurt-themed cafe after reading an article about Chobani's founder in the Costco magazine.  I've visited both Chobani locatins now and the Soho one is definitely nicer--go to this one if you want to get an idea of the experience.  Go to the other one only if you also need to go to Target.  In my case, the Soho location was a convenient breakfast stopping point in between Brooklyn and Queens when I had to go from one to the other.  

I ordered the Peanut Butter Banana breakfast bowl to stay.  It was presented beautifully.  It consists of a bowl of chocolate puffed millet, which are very tiny balls that are crunchy and never got soggy.  There was also banana, cocoa, strawberries, and lots of peanuts.  It is served with an open bottle of a thinned yogurt that also had peanut butter in it.  It was delicious, nutritious, and a filling breakfast.  As simple as it is, it was well-crafted with quality ingredients and I fantasized about a repeat visit to get another one.

I also got the Green Goodness drink to go, which served as my lunch.  This was one of the more unique smoothies I've had, and I really enjoyed it.  It has fruit, veggie, and yogurt in it, and was a nice contrast since it seems to be hard to find smoothies with cow dairy in them.  It had nice herbal flavors as well, and I especially appreciated the mint.  It is something I would order again.

The ambience in this cafe is relaxing and they have free wifi."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,"Boba Guys has ruined all other bubble tea for me. Sadly, there is no Boba Guys close to me, so I make sure to get it anytime I'm near one. 

This is probably the biggest location I've been to. Most don't have any seating, but this one has a couple of tables to sit at. 

This time we tried the Strawberry Cali-Pico, the Lychee Green (with milk), and the Hong Kong style tea. 

I love lychee but it was probably my least favorite of the three. It didn't have as strong of a flavor as the other two (which could be expected since it wasn't a specialty drink). 

The Strawberry Cali-Pico is my new favorite drink here. I loved the tartness that the yogurt provided contrasting with the sweetness of the strawberry. 

The Hong Kong style milk tea was also very good. 

Make sure to add boba as a topping. They make it fresh every day and I've never had boba anywhere near as good as they make it. 

If you're in NYC, the Bay Area, or LA, find Boba Guys."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2020-05-23,1.0,"Terrible and rude service. Wanted to support this local joint down the street from me during these hard economic times. Came up to the window and was told Uber, seamless, etc. apps only. 
Really??? I'm right here and you're making me use a delivery app! 
Won't be coming back here!!!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2020-02-09,4.0,"Our friends from Dc were visiting them and they wanted to know what all the rage was about at Boba Guys so after sushi we hopped in a Lyft to the LeS. 

My first time here was unimpressive, the simple drink choice is responsible for this. Liking simplicity in boba does not match this place. I did make the same mistake getting the ube/last time was taro. Way too much milk, not enough flavor.

My friends got the GOAT strawberry matcha latte and honestly it deserves the reputation. It tastes like a strawberry daiquiri with bubbles.

One of the best things about the location is the patrons, many friendly locals including a shiba inu called Grass Jelly who loved everyone.

This oddly shaped jackanape and his neon hedge was not as pleased with Grass Jelly as the rest of the establishment was and berated the walker for letting the dog near him. What an unlicked cub he was, the whole place fell in silence judging them.

Great bubble and experimental flavors, worth a try! #wboba"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2020-05-07,5.0,"There just is no better way existing bubble tea spot! They have the best  milk choices and great service. Now that we are closed down they sell half gallons of bb tea and although the options aren't many the two options listed taste divine! I am the number one fan of boba guys , all locations are great!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-11-16,4.0,"It's a pricier bubble tea spot but I guess you are paying for higher quality and more unique drinks. It's a small place with only a few small tables so definitely cannot stop and sit here during prime times. 

I usually order jasmine milk tea with bubbles but most recently, I stopped by and tried their seasonal drink - brown sugar hojicha which is a roasted green tea with black sugar syrup. It was slightly too sweet for me in the I-should-be-healthy type way but great for my I-love-sugar-feed-my-tastebuds way. I want another."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-09-15,5.0,"I've never seen so many options for bubble tea. 

I usually get the same bubble tea every time, the classic taro. They actually didn't have it, so they suggested Ube Halaya (which is also a root vegetable) tastes similar and delicious! The tapioca boba was a great texture.

I'm glad knew the flavors in depth and was able to make suggestions. Definitely coming back!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-09-28,5.0,"Though I usually like to check out local milk tea shops rather than the chain places, being from the San Francisco area I couldn't resist walking into Boba Guys when I saw it.

I got my go-to, the strawberry tea fresca with boba and no ice. The drink is fruity and refreshing, perfect since it was one of those warm-not-real-Fall-yet days. The boba is sweet and great texture. Altogether, as good as what I get back in California!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-11-10,5.0,"I was so excited to see they had a boba guys here in the city since I've been to the one in San Francisco. On their menu they have their create your own teas with a large selection of tea base to choose from and they also have their signature teas. One of my favorite things I like about boba guys is the ability to choose your sweetness level in either your create your own or their signature. For the signature teas they do give a recommendation on the sweetness level. I also appreciate the selection offer milks they have to add to your milk tea: regular, soy, and oat milk. You don't really see that in a lot of places!

I got a small Hong Kong Special Milk Tea with 75% sweetness. I thought the sweetness level was perfect to sip on while still being able to taste the flavors of the tea itself."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-12-27,4.0,Cute little place to grab some boba. Only tried one flavor while I was in town which was horchata. I was a little hesitant at first but I was surprised it was pretty good. Wish I could have tried more flavors since they had some interesting ones on the menu.
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-08-01,5.0,"Nothing feels more like home than Boba Guys. I happened to find an apartment 2 blocks away from my apartment. Coincidence? Hmmmmmm .....

This location fits right in the trendy lower east side. It's more of a neighborhood boba joint and definitely has that feel. There's no long crazy lines like the SF locations, which I love. Their drinks are really consistent with their original shop. My favorite drinks are the strawberry matcha, decaf black tea, and banana milk (please keep this one permanently!!!) 

If you want quality ingredients and drinks, Boba Guys is the place to go. They have non dairy options like Oatly oat milk and almond milk. Their almond and grass jellies are also bomb AF. I'll definitely be a regular here and i'm so happy to have a piece of home in NY."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-05-25,5.0,"I've seen the lowest lows and I've lived the highest HIGHS
I've yelped the bad, I've yelped the good, I've yelped my PENIS SIZE
I've yelped about my morning glory, with the sun I RISE
But now it's time to Yelp about the legend: BOBA GUYS

Every time I sip these drinks a small part of me DIES
Les Petits Morts, like group sex where everybody CRIES
It goes right up my nostrils, on my shirt, and in my EYES
And I don't care, I keep on slurping cuz it's BOBA GUYS

It makes the boys whip out their junk, I'm like Dudes, Zip your FLIES
It makes the girls pull down their skirts, I'm like, Girls, that's not WISE
It makes the tourists to NY sever all family TIES
And move to NYC so they can frequent BOBA GUYS

They won the Bobalympics, a Boba medal is the PRIZE
I wanna join the Mile High Boba Club if this drink ever FLIES
I'll suck its straw for hours in the more-than-friendly SKIES
Because the only Guys I wanna do are BOBA GUYS

Some say that Chatime is much better - these are evil LIES
Some say their life is pointless, I say open a FRANCHISE
Some say my Bae should date around, I say, but why DOWNSIZE?
Besides, would any other men take her to BOBA GUYS?

I heard that going 2 days without this can PARALYZE
I heard that strippers get more tips with Boba in their PIES
And if you can't get preggers, Boba can help FERTILIZE
The only guys you should let in your cooch are BOBA GUYS

WHAT

Don't blame me for recycling raps, they take me forever to write, just like you took forever to find a boyfriend.

The greatest Boba shop on earth? Some say yes. I say it's up there. It's possible. It's in my top 10 franchises for sure, and possibly my top 5. When it comes to consistently friendly employees, Boba Guys (and specifically Boba girls) are always near the top of the list, too.

What to get: Any of your milk drinks with Oatly, but the regular Milk Tea is best
What else: The Strawberry drink is exceptional too, not the matcha one
And: Orange one was shockingly yum
And: If they slip drugs into your drink, you'll experience Boba Highs.

Their tapioca is squidgy and perfect. Their Milk Tea is yum and tastes like British tea (the good kind, not earl grey). Your sister is yum too. Oh sorry I meant to think that not type it.

This is my 2nd favourite location of Boba Guys just behind Waverly, even though this one has seats and Waverly doesn't, because that one used to have my girl working there.

As for the drinks, well they have the same menu at each of the locations so I'll just give you a rundown of what I love and don't.

Some of the customers are not very friendly at all though, more so over at Waverly and Canal St Market, really. Here they have been nice.

Products? Perfect. They make a wonderful tea here with reliable consistency.

Imported from Cali, and transforming the NYC boba scene completely! It's very Cali, more Cali than it is Asian, but that's not always a bad thing. It has some damn good drinks, but the Cali-cized versions don't do it for me, I like the traditional stuff, and it's soooooo good so I always give them 5 stars for that. Matcha might be good for insta but mehhh. One Cali-cized thing I do love though is the Oatlyyyyy! It makes it much healthier but so much creamier and tastier!

And omg, their boba is amazing. So squidgy and sweet, a bit like KFT - and consistently perfect!

It'a a small space, so be warned. But so is your mother's bedroom.

This was the third and final location I ever tried, but it was the first ever on the east coast, so there's that special charm as well.

They don't have a bathroom tho. ONE STAR!

More rap now:

So come and try this, quick, before your life is OVER
It's cuter than Elmo, Big Bird and GROVER
It's cuter than my fake tan that gave me MELANOMA
The only guys I want in my mouth are BOBA

They're gonna be so popular from Maine to MANITOBA
They're gonna be bigger in El Mexico than CORONA
They're gonna make you quit High School with no DIPLOMA
The only guys you'll want inside your mouth are BOBA

I wanna witness this, cause it's religious, like JEHOVAH
It'll make you even fatter than Pepsi or Coca COLA
Give you speech impediments it will much worse than YODA
But still the only guys I want inside my mouth are BOBA

WHAT"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-08-07,5.0,"Been seeing Boba guys pop up in photos from friends traveling in SF but I never got to try it until New York and man is it good. It ranks on the top there with my favorite half&half. 

The matcha here is really good and helps the drink not be too overly sweet.

The combo of matcha and strawberry and milk is very perfect. It's a must try if you ever come across a Boba Guys!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2020-03-17,3.0,"Ordered the coffee milk tea with boba. Tasted good but honesty I thought it was about same level as kung fu tea or gong cha. Maybe I didn't order the right flavor but coffee milk tea is what I usually stick with no matter where I go so the fact that this place didn't taste any different or better makes me wonder if all the hype is actually legitimate. To be fair, I'll give it a try again next time in NY and research flavors that they are known for."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-06-01,3.0,"I was pretty excited to try Boba Guys, but after tasting a few drinks I feel that the bubble tea here is really hyped up. The drinks were fine but definitely not the best bubble tea I've ever had. In my opinion the drinks have way too much sugar. I ordered half sugar and the drinks still tasted like a soda.

The workers were friendly. The establishment also has a decent amount of seating. The bubble tea wasn't bad, but there are many other options around the area that are better."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-12-01,4.0,"Quality bubble tea! They use fresh tea (not powder) and their bubbles are always chewy and never stale. 

My favorite is the matcha green tea. The thai tea is also a favorite but a little too sweet for me. The oolong has a slight sweet/fruity taste to it. One of their winter specials include the black sugar hojicha. I love hojicha but it is pre-mixed with the black sugar. They said it is around 70% sweet which is way too sweet for me.  

This bubble tea is a little on the pricier side but you get quality ingredients. Also, I love how you can choose your type of milk (almond and oat milk included) for no additional charge."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-12-09,5.0,"Loved BG! Had the chai w oatly milk. Custom made tea your way all day. This is my first time n this location, available seatings. Bright white walls with their logo."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-03-15,2.0,"This place used to be one of my favorite boba spots in the city, but during my past few visits, I felt that the quality has plummeted. The drinks seem to be either watered down or too sweet. Since I don't like sweets, I would ask for 0-25% sweetness, but 0% sweetness causes the drink to taste diluted, while 25% becomes too sweet. I love places where you can order a drink with 0% sweetness and still taste the tea. 

However, I do like that Boba Guys has innovative flavors and seasonal drinks. Some taste great, but most are great in concept and poor in execution. For example, the Ube Halaya sounded really good, but it was too sweet; we couldn't finish it.

The drinks here are also quite expensive compared to other boba shops in the city. A drink here can be at least $1 more than other places. I'd save my money and go somewhere else. Maybe I'll drop by again and give this place another shot...we'll see. If you do decide to come here due to the hype and positive reviews, try one of their classic drinks and compare if to your favorite boba spot."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-11-24,5.0,"The famous Boba Guys! Just stepping into this place and checking out the beautiful trendy asthetics makes whatever you're going to order taste that much better! Their bubble teas are super delicious because their ingredients are always fresh. You can really taste the difference compared to other bubble tea places. The prices are very good especially for NYC. I've gotten their regular milk teas to their signature drink the strawberry Matcha Latte. You can add extras like grass jelly, aloe jelly, tapioca pearls and much more. The employees here are great especially the manager Piya."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2020-03-08,3.0,"As much as this place is hyped.. it doesn't have any taro milk tea! My friend and I still decided to give it a try Since we were told the ""Ube halaya"" tasted the same as Taro Milk Tea with boba. Unfortunately it didn't taste anything like it! It was very sweet and watered down. I'm still giving 3 stars because the place was very cute. There was only 1 other customer there who ordered a fruitier drink so maybe I'll get something along those lines the next time I have my boba craving around boba guys."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-01-13,1.0,"Boba Guys you're not, more like Boba Duds! After drinking halfway, and that was forcing myself, I threw my drink in the trash. After hearing about this place for the longest time and having it bookmarked, I was excited to finally try it. What a huge disappointment!

Here is what we ordered:
- Classic Milk Tea 
- Hong Kong Style Milk Tea
- Coffee Milk Tea w/Boba

When they placed the drinks on the counter for me to pick up, I already knew that it wasn't going to be good. The milk to tea ratio looked off. Upon first sip, it tasted like sugary water with a hint of tea. I tasted my husband's Hong Kong Style milk tea and his was even worse. Even with 25% sugar for all the drinks, it left a very bad taste on all of our tongues. It's like they put a tea bag with just a splash of skim milk, water and lots of sugar. It was nast-tea! I felt like I needed a Happy Lemon drink to wash away the taste in my mouth.

Being a huge bubble milk tea drinker, Boba Guys ranks the lowest for me. The one star is for the decent bobas. I want my money back!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-10-21,5.0,"There might be a lot of new boba shops popping up in nyc but this one still has the key to my heart. First of all they have oatly as a milk alternative, which I prefer over soy or almond any day. When they arrived in the LES a few years back, they were one of the only places that let you customize the sugar level. Their classic black tea made with loose leaves and the matcha are my favorites. Come to queens!!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-08-10,5.0,Stopped in the Boba Guys and I really enjoyed it! I got the coconut green tea with grassjelly and oat milk. The cashier recommended I start at 25% sweetness then move up if I needed. Glad I did that since I don't really have a sweet tooth. Also got the classic milk tea with almond milk and grass jelly. HopefulIy I can try their other specialty flavors!
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-03-25,4.0,"I went for the matcha latte and was not disappointed. Got it with boba, regular milk, 50% sugar (not a fan of super sweet bubble tea), and it was the perfect taste. They have some other instagrammable specialty ones, with bright colors and swirls. 

Inside of the store is small. I'd recommend grabbing a drink to go and walk around the LES. They have an awesome logo, which I at first thought was an anteater but apparently is an aardvark

Overall I'd say solid bubble tea, on the pricier side. Not as much variety as Kung Fu Tea. Would probably still come back"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-08-05,5.0,"This is the best boba in NYC. They always have a lot of flavor in the tea and the boba is just the perfect texture and sweetness. I always try to stop by whenever I'm visiting the neighborhood. I've tried the Jasmine Green Tea, Thai Iced Tea, Horchata, and Machata. So far they can't do any wrong. This place is a must try if you like boba or previously had a bad experience and think you don't like boba."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2020-01-15,4.0,The neighborhood is very quiet and we were there for about an hour. Not a lot of people came in. It's not as crowded as the boba guys in Chinatown. The drinks are great. I love the black milk tea and the strawberry matcha latte.
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-01-01,5.0,"When you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge for this, das when you know :-) 

After the longest time of wanting to try out this place, I finally got to try it out and boy, did it not disappoint! I get the hype that is boba guys :) I ordered the strawberry matcha latte and I found it to be just the perfect amount of sweetness. The matcha flavor blends well with the strawberry--making for a very light drink without being overly sweet. & that boba!!! Omg truly something else! Very soft and chewy and just the perfect texture. 

Boba guys also prides itself in high-quality, natural ingredients. From my first sip of my drink, I could immediately tell. Their bubble tea is amazing because of their fresh and natural products--which makes it one of the highest quality bubble teas I have consumed in my life (that's quite an accolade if you ask me!). 

As you couldn't already tell, I LOVE boba guys. Everything from the flavor, the texture, and the presentation is an A+ in my book. I cannot recommend this place enough, I can't wait to come back!!!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-01-31,5.0,"Hype lived up to its name! 

I was super excited to finally try Boba Guys after hearing so many positive things from my friends. 

The space is super cute and aesthetic! I love the colors and the decor. Definitely not a space for a lot of people but nice to relax with a small group. 

After asking for some recommendations I got the decaf black milk tea with boba and it was excellent. As someone who is really sensitive to caffeine having a decaf black tea option was really incredible; I have yet to see that anywhere else and was really impressed. Will say for non dairy goers the options weren't that great but there are accommodations! 

The tea itself was really good! The milk to tea ratio was perfect and I could taste the distinct flavors of both. What really stood out was the boba: the texture and sweetness levels were just right. Not sure if I've had better boba quality anywhere else ! I highly recommend getting 50 percent sugar to really taste the tea without too much sweetness :) 

At a different Boba Guys location I got a hot Hong Kong style milk tea with boba and it was just as good. 

Overall super tasty and am excited to rep with a free laptop sticker they handed out :)"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-08-17,5.0,"update:

they do offer large sizes, but i stand by what i said about the steep pricing on these bad boys. 

i now go for 50% sugar, hojicha with oat milk, or matcha with almond milk. can't go wrong."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-05-25,3.0,"Its pretty good tea but I've heard it labeled as the best ever... not the case.  I got the original milk tea with normal sweetness and it was sweet af. The first few sips were great but then it got overwhelming. I don't waste food or drink ever so i had to finish it... but I didn't want to.  

They do have a lot of interesting drinks and flavors, but when I go somewhere new I get the most classic milk tea, and this place didn't deliver on it.  If you come here I would try something else!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-06-30,5.0,"Bubble tea in Boba Guys is excellent. The bubbles are soft and tasty. Without doubt strawberry matcha latte is my favorite flavor. Mix it thoroughly before drinking. For a change, I tried dirty horchata today. I would say it was ok, but no where as good as strawberry matcha. I think it is horchata mixed with a shot of expresso."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2018-10-12,4.0,"Expensive at $5+ for a small drink but so delectable! I'm not a huge sweet drink fan but the glorious part of this business is you can set your sweetness to your liking, for any drink! For example, 50% sweetness, 10% sweetness, etc. 

I get the Rose Black tea, iced, 50% sweetness with boba and a little bit of Oat Milk (they have a plethora of milk and dairy substitute options). 

Mmmmm!!! Try my order. Every person that tries it loves it. Both hot AND cold :)"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2018-11-12,4.0,"It's true, this place makes pretty good boba, but emphasis on the pretty. I've gone here a few times and tried their dirty horchata, muscat oolong and strawberry matcha latte but each time have felt like this place is a bit overhyped. Each time I feel like the drinks are a bit too sugary or icey, but perhaps that's because I get a lot of their specialty drinks which I don't think you can always adjust the sugar level on. I think if I come back here I'd want to go simple and try their classic milk tea at a lower sugar level.

Overall though, I can tell that it is good quality boba and there are a lot of ways you can personalize drinks (type of milk, sugar level, etc). It's a cute hangout spot in a good location near a lot of restaurants."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-04-14,4.0,"My first visit, I was tarnished by this place until someone told me give them another chance. My impression did change and they are a go to boba place when in the area.

I had a lychee green tea with bubble
And milk, and it was actually really good. I was pleasantly surprised, I don't like to step out my comfort zone when it comes to my boba's. They also have horchata's and Hong Kong style tea, which I want to try. I will be back their prices are good and someone told me they make their own bubbles. Know the process and trying myself , it's and intense process. I do have to slash a star because they don't have read bean my favorite although they rank high on my list."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-06-15,5.0,I really enjoyed my bubble tea from Boba Guys! I've had them saved on my list for a while. I tried the lychee green tea and my friend tried the strawberry matcha tea. They both were really good! I prefer clear teas so the lychee was perfect to me. Just the right amount of sweetness with a good flavor. Good pricing and the staff member was very kind and helpful while I decided on a flavor. There's a bunch of locations all over the city. So I'd say it's a must try if you like bubble tea.
26,boba-guys-new-york,2018-11-10,5.0,"Hands down favorite bubble tea in NYC! Okay a bit more hipster with the flavors, not your regular milk tea with or without bubbles, almond, etc. 
I've tried the matcha, horchata, jasmine, and matchata with bubbles or grass jelly. My favorite is the horchata, with the rice milk and cinnamon, mmm. The bubbles are stellar--chewy and slightly sweet--awesome consistency in texture given the half-dozen or so times I've come here. 

They are a bit proved than your average bubble tea joint, think $5.50+ vs $4.25ish, but I think worth it for the quality and non-generic flavors. 

The store is small just maybe 8-10 seats. Order at the front of the store, menu posted on the front left wall with their seasonal specials indicated below on individual laminated placards. 

They also sell some flavored egg custard tarts here tho I haven't had them yet. 

A MUST TRY for bubble tea if you are in the neighborhood."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-05-23,4.0,"Wanna tried out new drinks at boba guys, we got the special drinks passion fruit orange guava which was kinda bland, but the matcha with peach was good. We have tried a few drinks there before, their matcha drinks are the best...esp the one with strawberries"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-11-17,4.0,"Boba ... you would think that by now, people would be tired of boba places, but here comes another one. I've been hearing about Bobba Guys for a while now but the lines have kept me from actually walking in. The place is always packed when I'm around but for some reason today was relatively quiet. My wife and I went inside and it was like walking into a green house. The shop was hot and steamy, which was good in a way I guess because the outside was so frigid. The shop itself wasn't very big and it was still very difficult to maneuver around because you had people waiting on line and people sitting at the tables. There was a huge menu up on the wall with step by step instructions on how and what to order. I found that to be relatively helpful because there were so many options. Since it was a cold day, I decided to go with the Jasmine Green Hot Tea with bobba. My wife ordered the HK style hot tea with grass jelly. The order was super quick and impressed with the efficiency behind the counter. I took a sip of my wife's drink and wasn't a big fan. The taste of the drink wasn't as bold as I would have usually liked my HK milk tea. I did however enjoy my jasmine green tea. The jasmine smell was pretty strong but did not overpower the taste. The bobba was very soft and had a nice sweetness to it . Overall, the place was good but not, wait 20 minutes in the freezing cold food. I would defiantly get again if I'm in the area but would try different options."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-07-20,5.0,"I got their Matcha Strawberry Latte with tapioca pearls. I loved the drink as it wasn't too sweet but also not too bitter. The tapioca was perfect. 

I came around a 2pm on a Saturday and it wasn't crowded and there were a few seats open. The place isn't too small but it isn't really big either. If you're coming in a big group (greater than 4 ppl) it might be hard to find seating. The place is really cute overall and I love the vibe."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-03-25,5.0,"Although I am an Asian girl with blonde hair, I have never considered myself a boba enthusiast. However, according to snapchat, twitter, instagram, etc.. my friends could not get enough of Boba Guys. I didn't quite catch onto the FOMO because I always thought to myself ""how good could a boba be?"" But, I was surprised with Boba Guys as my first taste of New York (ty boyfriend)! He ordered the top two most popular ones- I think Match Strawberry and Classic Milk Tea.
The boba was good, but what made this drink perfect was the tea. I loved the blend of Matcha and Strawberry and the Classic had the perfect balance of sugar, milk, and tea. I think they can justify the $7 price tag on this drink. 
It's been a long time since I've had boba that tasted this good. I'm almost glad that there is no Boba Guys in Texas because I would probably spend both all of my money and calories here. 
I actually decided that my first experience at Boba Guys should be my last because I did not want to mess up my memory of this place in case if the second time I went did not live up to the first. This will forever be ""the dream boba"" to me now."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-01-13,2.0,"Ube Halaya: very, very sweet. Tastes nothing like ube. If you like eating marshmallows, this may be the drink for you. Only comes cold, can't reduce sweetness level. 

I thought to try something new tonight, especially since I almost always get the same original milk tea. But getting the same thing sometimes is for good reason: so you won't regret your $6 purchase. 

Boba Guys as a whole runs middle of the pack in my boba spectrum. If you don't want to be disappointed, stick with their OG menu."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-01-30,4.0,"This is the good location, skip the one on canal st.

Milk tea: more tea than milk. It looks like when they make their drinks, the tea isn't brewed until it becomes a concentrate, so lots of water to dilute the milk.

Bubbles: soft and chewy, sweetened with honey.

Important: 30% sugar, unless you're a sweet tooth

Recommend: matcha strawberry, duke of earl grey, matcha milk tea"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-05-01,5.0,"THESE. COOKIES. ARE. SO. BOMB. Not too sweet and you have a little salty aftertaste which adds to the Earl Grey. I love sweet drinks so the Carmael Milk Tea is always to go! I like drinking it warm because then the boba becomes very soft. Nice for cold days. 

The atmosphere is very nice and chill, the cashier was very welcoming. Even though the space is kind of small, there's always room to sit. It's nice to just sit there and think about the most philosophical questions such as what drink I should try next"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-09-19,5.0,Sustainable boba straw!? I ordered a 25% sweet Duke of Earl iced with almond milk/boba. Staff was lovely. I also bought the straw and they washed it for me before I put it in. West coast vibes on the east coast
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-03-04,5.0,"The hype here is real. Like, real-real. Their milk tea is a perfect ratio between and milk and tea. Most milk tea places have a slight powdery consistency to it. You can tell that a milk tea shop is high quality when they don't have this consistency.

Boba Guys has really light, refreshing drinks. Typically, milk tea tends to feel heavy after drinking a full cup. But here, I feel like I can drink them unendingly. The tea is very pronounced, which shows that the milk and sugar syurp doesn't overwhelm the base of the drink, but rather  compliments it. I got the Jasmine Milk Tea with Grass Jelly so I can compare it to other milk tea shops. I can tell you Boba Guys did it right. I could taste the jasmine tea, complimented by a light amount of milk and sweetener. Very impressed with the quality. My partner got the Machatta with boba, also amazing in both  visual and taste.


Highly recommended, the hype is real."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2018-12-26,3.0,"I made the mistake of trying their new drinks instead of starting out with their classic HK milk tea. For $6 I got a 16oz cup of coconut milk with ube pieces and ube syrup aka ube marmalade. It was good and light, but if I could get twice the amount of marmalade without having to pay extra, then maybe it'd be worth it. 

Service is always fast. I respect the ingredients are sourced smartly but mourn the days milk tea was simple and cheap."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-10-28,4.0,Got the strawberry matcha and the boba was made perfectly. The combination between the matcha and the strawberry was amazing. Would try again!
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-08-18,5.0,"Started with the strawberry matcha latte and jasmine milk tea, will be back to try it all. Perfect boba, flavorful tea and quality ingredients. I usually get it with 50% sugar.

Some good a$$ boba drinks."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2018-12-31,2.0,"I liked the concept. And the options. However, the smell & the cleanliness of this place really turned me off from recommending it at all. Also, there were no snacks because they planned to be closed the next day."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-06-17,5.0,"They've perfected bubble tea. My favorite in NYC!

They have the best, freshest ingredients and tea. Their tapioca pearls are the actual best of any bubble tea I've had in the states. You can tell how fresh they are and it makes a huge difference. 

As a tea drinker, I can't tell you how much I appreciate their tea selection. Also that you can choose how much sugar to add!! I get tea here a lot more often than other places because I can remove sugar from it. 

They've gotten a lot better about managing their lines too, things move quickly."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-06-30,5.0,"These seasonal drinks for this summer all sound so good!!! I've never actually had banana milk before, so I had no idea what to expect. I was worried it was going to have an artificial banana flavor, but it was so good!! I got the banana milk drink with oat milk, so i can't say how it tastes normally, but it paired really nicely with the oat milk :) it was a good balance of banana and milk flavor, and it wasn't too sweet either!! It tasted like a yummy banana milkshake or kind of like banana pudding but all liquid. Def recommend getting the banana milk drink, but also try everything else on the menu!!!!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2018-12-03,5.0,"If you're looking for boba, this is definitely the spot. I'm a huge fan of boba guys, always been ever since trying it in San Francisco. This location does not disappoint either. Service was fast and friendly, the flavor and quality of the boba was perfect. I had the caramel milk tea this time around and loved it! It was a little sweeter than I prefer, but was still very good."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,realllllly good bubble tea. matcha latte was perfect with oat milk. satisfied with the vegan milk options. everything on the menu looked so good. will be returning soon.
26,boba-guys-new-york,2018-05-26,3.0,"I was really excited to come here after hearing all the rave reviews about Boba Guys, but I was fairly disappointed. I got a large classic milk tea with oat milk and boba, which was $5.99 after tax. The tea was really strong and I definitely felt the caffeine, but the consistency was very thin and watered down, even with no ice. The tapioca pearls were good though, sweet and chewy. 

Also, for the lactose intolerant like me, many of their drinks are premixed, including the horchata and Hong Kong milk tea. So options are limited.

There's also no bathroom."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,Great quality boba tea!! I still got some with it being 30 degrees outside. They have good options as well.
26,boba-guys-new-york,2018-06-18,3.0,"Every time I would visit New York, I always made time to get the Boba Guys on Canal Street. Now that I have moved to New York, I found myself even more excited to have Boba Guys. Since we were in the area, we decided to visit Boba Guys on Clinton Street. 

I never knew I would be displeased with Boba Guys's matcha latte, one of my favorite kinds of drinks from one of my favorite chain boba stores. It mostly tasted like milk with a little bit of matcha in it. I'm not sure if that  is how that particular location even just that particular staff member makes matcha drinks, but the drink tasted way too much like regular milk for a matcha latte. On the other hand, the boba was sweet like honey and chewy, and it met my expectations.  

I don't think I would come back to the Clinton Street Boba Guys; perhaps I will just stick with the Boba Guys on Canal Street Market."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2018-12-11,4.0,"Still love the drinks!!! And the new cup designs for hot drinks are just adorable!!! They have a seasonal menu along with their list of regular drinks. Their flower teas (rose, lavender,etc) all tastes great with or without milk. Their housemade almond jelly is a must for cold drinks with milk. A lot of the bubble tea shops in NYC makes their drinks from powders and store bought jams. You can really taste the difference."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-07-14,5.0,"Boba Guys is one of my top favorite bubble tea places in NYC. Even ordered boba for my wedding through them and it was a HUGE hit. 

Staff is super professional and friendly, and drinks are consistently delicious! This location has tables and seats so you can hang out there too.

My go-to favorites are: strawberry matcha lattes, strawberry cali-pico, and strawberry tea Fresca. Love that they have multiple milk options - my go-to is oat milk.

Highly recommend!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-08-10,3.0,"While Boba Guys does have interesting and innovative flavors and a cute mascot drinking bubble tea, I left feeling decision fatigue and a little underwhelmed with my lavendar bloom tea with oat milk. Head in the clouds was certainly a new flavor, but not necessarily in a positive way."
26,boba-guys-new-york,2018-02-04,5.0,"Have I been living under a rock? I just learned about this popular SF chain (thanks instagram!) and instantly bookmarked then on Yelp. Less than 24 hours later I stumbled upon their Clinton St shop while on a walk in the LES. It was meant to be. 

After taking in all the options I decided to try one of their signature specialty drinks. Their strawberry matcha latte was calling out my name. You honestly can't go wrong with fruit + matcha + boba. 

The verdict? The reviews don't lie: the mixture of the smooth matcha, sweet strawberries, and creamy almond milk is so satisfying. Definitely swing for the boba, it's the perfect level of chewiness. My boyfriend went for a dirty horchata which was tasty and not overly sweet, but not out of this world good. Although they serve top notch coffee, I'd stick with a tea based drink. 

If you're looking for a sweet treat in the LES Boba Guys is an awesome option!"
26,boba-guys-new-york,2019-04-01,4.0,"Heard a lot of good things about Boba Guys so we had to stop here on our little New York getaway. We got the strawberry matcha, coffee, and Thai tea  all with tapioca pearls of course. All three were perfectly sweet. The pearls cooked to our liking. We enjoyed the strawberry matcha so much, we had to get a second cup before we left. Friendly service and smiling faces. Hopefully we'll be back one day!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-04-09,5.0,"Next to Taiyaki in Chinatown, the Dough Club offers 6 different mochi donut flavors in addition to a few drinks and shakes. The place itself is a small but cute cafe with limited seating - though the donuts are perfect to take out with only a minimal wait (they're made-to-order).

If you've not had a mochi donut, they're slightly less sweet that most of the donuts I'm used to (like Krispy Kreme) and a bit chewier (because of the mochi), but I love the texture and the flavor! Plus, the flavors are very light and not overwhelming or too sweet, which is an added plus.

Definitely worth trying if you've not had it before, and it'll certainly satisfy a sweet tooth if you're not looking for a major sugar overload."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-04-17,5.0,"I wrote a review of this bakery last month but only now have gotten around to posting it.  I can't believe it's only been a month since I visited this bakery.  So much has changed in that short time.  I pray that someday, when everything goes back to ""normal"" they'll be able to reopen.  Below is my review.

The Doug Club is a tiny bakery with about 4 small café tables that opened in late 2019.  The shop is very cute and inviting. 

They make these Japanese ""pon de ring"" style mochi donuts in small batches and you can clearly taste the freshness.  Due to the amount of foot traffic they get, the donuts do not sit long on their shelves. In fact, my donuts were still slightly warm with the glaze still very gooey.  The donuts had a fluffy and slight chewy texture.  I ordered the half dozen in each of the flavor that were offered.  

Purple Pebble--had purple glaze with fruity pebble cereal toppings.  

Cruncha Matcha--these were definite my favorite.  It had matcha glaze and bits of rice crispy toppings.

Berry Lovely--had strawberry glaze with bits of white chocolate.  

Cookie & Dreams--had vanilla glaze with Oreo crumble and chocolate drizzled on top. 

Bacon Miso Happy--had miso caramel glaze with bits of bacon.  I wished that the bits of bacon were crunchier and saltier to help balance the very sweet glaze. 

Go Nuts--had chocolate glaze with bits of hazelnut.  Flavor wasn't as complex or unique as some of the others, but I still loved it.

The mochi donuts are lovely to look at and the Dough Club does a good job of offering interesting flavors.    These would be a great treat to bring to the office, dinner parties or as gifts. The presentation and packaging makes it very unique. And the shape of the donuts make it very fun to share.  You can pull them apart into small pieces with ease."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-05-13,4.0,"When mochi decided to marry donut and they had these wonderfully chewy donut babies, they really did bring something beautiful into the world. Not too sweet and just the right amount of chew, these mochi donuts are a delightful treat. 

The only conundrum is deciding between these and the Japanese froyo next door. I can't say it's an easy choice!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-04-28,2.0,"I stopped here before COVID-19 shutdown all of NYC.  It's located in Chinatown and a small space that is aesthetically popping to the eye for those who like to take photos.  However, other than that nothing stood out for me.  

I got the Cruncha Matcha and the Purple Pebble.  It was my first time trying mochi donuts and it wasn't too bad.  They were tasty, but not on the caliber of blow your mind.  The place is probably a fave for those craving simple sweets, nothing complex.

The service needs some serious work.  The customer service was blasé and it surprised me when I called later on after my visit.  When I returned home I realized I had left some items at one of the store's tables.  When I called to ask them to hold it for me for a few days -- their response was that they usually chucked things in the trash and I could not understand the harm in holding it for a couple of days.  I don't live in the area and would they do the same for all salient items? 

Just thought that was something to note as most businesses would try to establish a repertoire with their customer and appreciate their business and therefore reserve their items.  It was only about four  days later and I was in the area and tried to retrieve my items, but alas it was too late.  I think it's important to have a certain relationship with your customers and if you can't appreciate that and their business - you've lost me."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-09,5.0,"Just say donuts and you have my attention. These are not your typical old fashion donuts. These are Mochi Donuts with exotic flavors like Matcha, Berry, Miso and more. I had to look up each ingredient because of my allergies. 

The Dough Club is easy to access from the Upper East Side by either the Six Train or the Q Train. I take the Q because it's only 8 stops as opposed to 14 stops on the Six Train. You should plan to arrive shortly after they open. That's when you're guaranteed the full selection. 

You're sure to see their sandwich board sign out front on Baxter Street. The sanitation inspection is prominently displayed in the window. It's such a cute little Pink Donut Parlor. Everything about it is photo worthy. I am usually very early so everything is clean. I like to be seated to eat and rest from my trip getting there. 

On duty are very pretty smiling employees. Employees are very knowledgeable about their donuts. I leave a tip which is unusual for me. The donuts are very reasonably priced so a tip won't damage your wallet. 

My favorite thus far is Berry Lovely. I enjoy the donut texture and taste. These donuts are huge and very filling! I take half home for the next day. 

The atmosphere is cheerful, good music playing, sweet employees, and sweet reasonably priced filling donuts. I advise you to go out of your way for the experience. Plus if you like Mochi Ice Cream (like I do) they have those too. At $1.38 each it's a deal!

27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-09,4.0,"Thanks to Yelp, I finally joined the bandwagon and tried mochi donuts for the first time! As the name suggests, mochi donuts are made of sweet gluttonous rice, so they're inherently gluten-free. The donuts are not heavy or overly sweet at all! In fact, each ring was lightly crispy on the outside but slightly chewy on the inside. They sometimes offer animal-shaped donuts but sadly weren't available when we dropped in.

The interior store is small (only 3 small tables) and minimally decorated besides the neon string of words on the wall. We came around Sunday noon, and the was an unsurprising number of tourists who stopped by for desserts. They also offer coffee/teas and milkshakes. Would definitely consider coming back next time I'm craving a mochi donut!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-04,3.0,"Not a big fan of this mochi donut even with the unique flavor of bacon added to the mix. The way they mold it might possibly make it a little drier than my previous experiences with these special gluten free donuts. They're like individual rounds stuck together which makes it classier and easier to share for sure. 

It's definitely a trendy thing which doesn't always translate well or last long. Still I can see the appeal. I definitely enjoy me some mochi donut on occasion from another establishment which I won't name here. It wasn't bad, I just had my bacon donut and didn't even want the second one. Not usual for my demanding sweet taste buds at all. 

Maybe drinks are the way to go here? Try a donut though, you may like it more than me. I've had too many donuts in my life..."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-05,5.0,"I really like this place. I came here for a yelp elite event where I got 2 free doughnuts to try. 

Although this place is small, it is clean and welcoming. The staff is super patient and friendly. I ended up ordering the chocolate and hazelnut flavor and the cookies and cream flavor. On my way out, I dropped one of my doughnuts on the ground. I particularly appreciated when I went back, told the staff member what happened and showed him the doughnut that had fallen, he threw away my fallen doughnut for me and replaced it with a fresh one. 

The texture of the doughnuts is great. It's a bit springy on your teeth as mochi should be, but is also pretty light, which makes you feel guilt-free about the sweet treat. My favorite of the two was the chocolate hazelnut one. It was plain and simple chocolate icing and chopped hazelnuts. The cookies and cream is more of a party in your mouth with chocolate icing, white icing and crushed oreo cookies on top. This one was also really good. 

I really enjoyed the doughnuts and my experience here and will definitely return."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-15,4.0,"After going to Japan and having mochi donuts, it's been hard to find a good place that matches the chewyness and consistency states side, until now.

The Dough club churns out some pretty good chewy mochi donuts with some interesting flavors.

My top choice would be the matcha and fruity pebbles donut.  The sweetness level is a bit on the sweeter side, but good when you match it with a cup of coffee with no sugar.  The donuts are a bit on the smaller side and it makes me craving for more.  I wished the thickness of the donut was a bit denser and bigger for the price you pay.

Staff are quick and nice about recommending what to get when it's your first time.  Towards the end of the day, the flavors you want may not be guaranteed, so it's best to go early or noon for some fresh donuts."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-01,4.0,"The Dough Club is a lovely small cafe located in China Town, Manhattan. It's knows for its mochi donuts. We misunderstood mochi for ice cream and thought the donuts will have ice cream stuffed in it. However, they explained it to us that mochi is a kind of rice flour and the donuts are made of its dough. Unlike regular donuts, the donuts are light and fluffy. For convenience, the donut is shaped in a manner that it can be easily broken and shared with everyone.  


Berry lovely donut:
Really loved it. Nice taste of strawberry and white chocolate. It is not too sweet and thus I could easily finish the entire donut. 

Go nuts chocolate:
Chocolate and hazelnut flavored donut. Couldn't taste the hazelnut much as the flavour is mild. It's more like milk chocolate on a donut. If you have a sweet tooth, this one is for you!

Drip coffee:
Drip coffee with less milk. A nice regular warm coffee. Perfect when eating the donut as it doesn't make the donuts too sweet for taste."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-04,4.0,"So cute and fun! Love the circle/pull apart complex of the donut - made it a lot of fun to eat and enjoy. 

Ordered: 
- matcha crisp 
- Cookies and cream 

MATCHA CRISP:
- this was my favorite one. The matcha frosting was sweet but not overpowering and the matcha flavor came out just enough. I'm a big fan of matcha so this really hit the spot! Definitely recommend!! 

COOKIES & CREAM:
- it was ok. The frosting was definitely sweeter than the matcha - a little bit too sweet for me (but tbh I'm not the biggest white chocolate fan). However, if you are a big white chocolate fan, then this will definitely be more down your alley."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-05-16,5.0,Amazing donuts. Clean and very cute I guess they recently opened up. I mean I have tried few good places for donuts but this one just exceeded my expectations. I just went Waow when I took a bite. It's just so soft and yummy and their . It is a clean cute place. Great for pictures and the price is okay. Definitely will go again.
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-06,5.0,"After seeing these cute insta-worthy donuts all over my social media, I HAVE FINALLY TRIED FOR MYSELF and they did not disappoint! The donuts here are chewy, light and airy-like, and come in unique flavors. My favorites are the purple pebble and cruncha matcha, but the other flavors are great too! I really like how they decorated the interior of the shop. It's small but trendy, the lighting is perfect for your food photos, and they have a decent number of tables. This place isn't suitable for large groups but it's a great post-date dessert spot for you and your plus one! 

A must try if you are in the area!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-05,4.0,"Came here after receiving a coupon for free mochi donuts and was not disappointed. They have savory and sweet options (one of the savory options was something with bacon on it and I wasn't thrilled about the idea of that lol). I chose the strawberry and matcha flavors.

The texture of these donuts were perfect. Not too chewy at all (which is what I was afraid of). As someone who doesn't LOVE mochi, I still enjoyed the donuts here. They also have a good selection of beverage options to pair the donuts with. I was tempted to get the frozen matcha milkshake but decided to save it for next time.

The aesthetic of this little shop was very cute and pink. Not too big but just spacious enough to comfortably work on your laptop or just lounge with some friends.

I'll definitely be back here, grabbing a dozen of these donuts would for sure make a unique gift for coworkers or friends."

I've tried mochi donuts once before in Texas and was surprised how few shops sell them in NYC given the wave of desserts, and specifically Asian desserts, throughout the city. Alimama is another amazing option. 
 
I tried the berry lovely donut (strawberry glaze with white chocolate) and the purple pebble donut (purple potato glaze + fruity pebbles). I loved the texture of the donut. It's a deep fried mochi and feels like a chewier-than-normal donut. The texture is what makes The Dough Club amazing, not necessarily the flavors themselves. I loved the berry lovely donut flavor and found the purple pebble donut decent."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-02-17,3.0,"Mochi donuts are exciting for their crispy exteriors and stretchy interiors reminiscent of well, mochi. The donuts here had none of that sought after flavor and texture. These donuts tasted a lot like funnel cake, which is a relatively tasty treat but largely forgettable. 

The matcha glaze was not very sweet, which is the case for most pastries catering to an Asian demographic-- we like our sweets a little less sweet. That part I did enjoy.

The space is cozy, which made it difficult to navigate past all the diners taking pics of their donuts held up against the neon sign. Dessert shops with the same social media friendly decor are cookie cutter images of each other but continue to draw the crowds. I think I'll finally stop taking the bait."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-02-29,4.0,"It's a cool concept for sure, but I'm not one for too sweet things, so this place just wasn't for me. I was also very full from lunch, so my stomach probably wasn't craving sweets as much. 

I came for an event, and we ordered one matcha donut and one purple pebble donut. The purple mochi donut tasted like pure sugar; it was definitely too sweet for me. The matcha donut was very sweet as well, but it had a strong matcha taste so I wasn't too bummed about it. 

The donut itself was airy and had a great texture, I probably would've enjoyed it without any glaze. Overall a good experience, but as someone who doesn't really crave super sweet things, probably wouldn't come back."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-02,4.0,"I noticed mixed reviews and differs from my experience. I got the ube and matcha flavor. I actually think they're lighter and less sweeter than a regular doughnut which I prefer...I think doughnuts r super saturated in sugar. The dough has a slight chew to it but it's definitely light. I love how the balls separate in each bite. The green tea was lighter in flavor than the ube but I was also drinking HKmilktea which is kinda sweet...could have offset my tastebuds. 

Overall really enjoyed the experience. The store is small but a few seats to eat in. It's really pretty for insta tho. @eatsumbap"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-15,3.0,"Similar concept to Alimama's mochi donuts in Chinatown.  These donuts are less chewy, more donut.

+ cruncha matcha (most popular): chewy texture, but the matcha flavor wasn't strong :/

+ berry lovely: so sweet it's borderline saccharine, and I taste no berry

The texture of these donuts are alright, but flavors need to be stronger."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-02-10,2.0,"Mochi Donuts are all the craze right now and Instagram has done such a good job promoting them that my friend and I finally caved and decided to check this place out. These donuts are uniquely shaped with 8 little dough balls, which make them  super easy to share. Unfortunately, I wish these donuts were as tasty as they were fun to eat.

Reasons why I was disappointed
1. The frosting stuck to the paper wrapping-It just isn't appetizing when all of your frosting is getting smushed by the paper wrapping. I tried to avoid the mess, but my efforts were in vain.
2. Artificial tasting flavor- I got the purple ube pebble flavor and while it did look cute, it tasted VERY artificial. Kind of like boba syrup or the sweetness of medicine syrup. I didn't enjoy it very much, but I finished it nonetheless (A GIRLS GOTTA EAT). My friend who tried mine was actually repulsed by it.
3. Lack of mochi texture- I loooove mochi and was looking forward to a chewy texture, which I didn't experience at all! Maybe I was just expecting too much, but it just seemed like a slightly drier/tougher dough. None of that chewy, ricecakey goodness.
4. Lack of a restroom- This is a small shop but a restroom would've been nice.

Overall,  maybe I would give this place a try again. For $3.21 a donut, it's not too expensive but personally, I rather spent the extra dollar or two and head to Dough for some really soft and substantial donuts!!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-03,2.0,"I love the chewyness/bite of mochi and the density of a good cake donut but the mochi donuts at The Dough Club really aren't my thing. Each donut breaks into 8 small balls, and each ball is hovering between the bite of mochi and the fluffiness of a yeast donut. Yet for me it doesn't really hit the mark on either. Perhaps it's the fact that the bites are so small - even a little bite of a dense piece of good mochi feels super satisfying - but these just don't.

Over 2 trips I've gotten the Purple Pebble, the Cookies & Dreams, and a Go Nuts. I thing I hate the most is how thinly and lazily the glaze/toppings are applied. After you break off a ball and take it out of the wrapper they provide, half the glaze/toppings have wiped off.

Also note that they don't continuously make every flavor through the day, which is shocking to me, since each flavor is the same donut only with a different glaze. It seems like each batch of newly fried donuts all go towards one flavor. When I went the second time around 5:00pm on a Saturday, they said they only had 3 flavors available. However, we saw them making a whole tray of Cookies & Dreams fresh in the back, which we ordered. The freshly made one definitely did taste better, and maybe that's part of the problem too."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-11,4.0,"Got to try 2 of these donuts on the house thanks to Yelp. Thank you! 

I really liked the strawberry one and cookies and creme donuts. These are better if you eat it on the spot, but not bad if you take it home too. Service was pretty quick. I do like these donuts more than regular donuts, the texture is more enjoyable. I wasn't a fan of the matcha donut, surprisingly."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-01,3.0,"Not my cup of tea, but a great place if you're looking for that instagram pic. The cafe is aesthetically pleasing and pink! Along with the cute decor, you'll find a  creative menu and friendly service.  Walking in you'll find tables are often filled with people snapping photos away.

 The menu has 6 donut options to pick from. My party and I tried 4/6 those donuts.

What we ordered & what I thought 
-Purple pebble, the icing was sweet. You couldn't taste the purple potato. I'd pass on this one. 
-Go nuts, this was okay.
-Bacon miso happy, we were not fond of this flavor combination. I felt it didn't go together, there just wasn't any balance between the sweetness and the savoriness. I would pass on it.
- Crunch Matcha, my favorite flavor there. The matcha was rich, and perfect for anyone that loves matcha. I would pass on the crunch, that texture was needed.  I think, this is the only flavor I would get again if I come back.

Overall chewiness- A little chewy but could be a lot more chewy.

Final thoughts: I honestly would have preferred it if there was a plain option and overall more chewy. Out of all the flavors I would only get matcha again."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-02-04,4.0,"I try my best not to crave donuts, but these mochi donuts from The Dough Club were simply irresistable. Mochi donuts are a mix of mochi and a regular donut giving it a crisp outer texture and a somewhat chewy interior. My first time trying a mochi donut was at a Dunkin Donuts in Thailand believe it or not. The mochi donut in Thailand was slightly more chewy than these ones at The Dough Club. We tried every donut flavor here, but my favorite was the Bacon Miso Happy. The others tasted very good too, but this one had bacon.. real bacon. Each donut costs over $3, but you get a discount when buying six donuts.

I also ordered their Earl Grey Toffee Milkshake and this thing was delish. Tasted exactly like an earl grey plus some sweetness, but not too much. The bits of toffee throughout the milkshake added a nice crunchy texture. They also offered two other milkshake flavors: Matcha Pebbles and Cookies & Cream. Would definitely come back here again!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-08,4.0,"A new doughnut spot! I decided to try this spot as part of a Yelp Elite event since it's right around the corner from my office.

The decor is definitely instagram friendly, so if you're a food blogger this is your spot. There are a a variety of flavors available, but I decided to go with the Go Nuts and Cookies & Dream flavor.

The doughnuts are shaped in circles, so it's easily shared amongst your friends (or just save it all for yourself!). The texture of the doughnut was perfect and had a springy texture inside. The toppings and frosting were delicious too.

I'll be bringing my friends next time!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-10,5.0,"The Dough Club is a cute new spot next to Taiyaki. They offer 6 different mochi donuts, ice cream mochi, shakes, and other drinks. It's small, but bright and they have a bench that can seat 6-7 people.

I tried the matcha donut (cruncha matcha) and the chocolate donut (go nuts). These seemed to be some of the favorites from what I read, and I really loved both! The matcha is crunchier and lighter. The chocolate is slightly denser and chewy. But neither was overly sweet. 

Would love to come back and try the other donuts and shakes!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-04-30,5.0,"Cookies, Oreos, Doughnuts, you got me. I can't resist. Right next door to Taiyaki which means double the fun in your stomach. Clean space with limited seating, but it was late at night so we were able to sit and enjoy these wonderful creations. 6 different mochi donut flavors, but that's all you need."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-05,5.0,"I've tried these Pon De Ring donuts before in Asia and absolutely loved it, so I was really excited when they're now in New York!! 

I actually got the Berry Lovely first just to try, and I liked it SO MUCH!! The donut is made of 8 little round balls, so it's really easy to bite into (without making a mess, or having the glaze stick on the sides of your mouth). It's chewy and spongy in texture, it's also not overly sweet. I liked it so much I decided to buy a whole box of all the flavors to bring home! They're such great snacks and every flavor is good!!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-17,4.0,"The Dough Club is one of the latest additions to Chinatown's ever-growing trendy dessert scene and its main specialties are its Japanese ""Pon de Ring"" style mochi donuts. They offer 6 different flavors and each one is quite unique, ranging from some traditional flavors like their Cookies & Dreams (Cookies & Cream) to ones popular in Asia like their Cruncha Matcha (Matcha Glaze) and the Purple Pebble (Ube/Purple Potato Glaze). The interesting thing about these donuts are the shape, which makes them easily sharable, as the donut is made up of 8 mochi balls fused together.

I tried the Cookies & Dreams along with the Cruncha Matcha. Both are quite good, as the mochi is soft and chewy while the glaze is not overwhelmingly sweet. I prefer the Cookies & Dreams, as I do like the crushed oreos on top of the donut, as it does remind me of eating Cookies & Cream ice cream in donut form. The matcha donut has crushed rice krispies on top, which give a nice crunch in contrast to the chewiness of the mochi. The best thing though is that even if you're not sharing the donuts with friends, eating one or two by yourself won't make you feel terrible about how much you ate, as the donuts are not heavy at all compared to regular donuts.

However, I did find their Earl Grey Toffee milkshake really good. There are bits of toffee in the shake that add a bit of crunch as you drink the shake and if you love earl grey in desserts, I'm positive you'll like this. The earl grey shake is sweet and not too thick, which is great as you can enjoy the shake without needing a spoon.

Overall, the Dough Club is a nice place to try if you love mochi or just have a sweet tooth. In an area densely populated with trendy desserts, the Dough Club makes their mark."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-04,5.0,"I came here with my partner, iiamjelly and we really enjoyed coming here for donuts. ""The Dough Club"" and its sister business, ""Taiyaki"" are both opened by the same owner. 

To start things off, the lighting and the layout of the shop. I say this because I enjoy taking photos of my food and sharing them with my followers, friends and peers. The Dough Club definitely has one of the best Mochi Donuts in Manhattan. I've had a few different types of mochi donuts. and I enjoy how the dough is fluffy light, and not too dense which makes it easier to chew and eat. 

I tried the, ""Cookies & Dreams"" as well as the ""Berry Lovely."" I love the flavor as well as taste of the doughnuts. The Cookies & Dreams tasted just like what I was expecting it to taste like and it was delicious. The Berry Lovely was my favorite doughnut because it was a unique flavor and the glaze was not too heavy. 

Overall, I left The Dough Club wanting more and not too stuffed. This would be the perfect place to go to after dinner for dessert and/or snack. 
I look forward to coming back and bringing my friends to check this place out as well.

Environment: very cute. Perfect Instagram spot. 
(Pro Tip: come before rush hour (maybe before 3:45PM) if you want to take photos with less people in the place.

I had the ""berry lovely"" and ""go nuts."" My favourite was the berry lovely because the glazed was not harden. The texture was perfect soft with a hint of crunch. The go nuts is perfect for the chocolate lover. They are very cute and easy to eat since they break off of the balls.  

My hands were a bit sticky to take photos so plan accordingly"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-11,4.0,"Is it just me or do they keep changing the price?

Friends and I were in the neighborhood and stopped to taste some mochi donut. There was only one occupied table at the time which was really surprising. We shared the Berry Lovely for $3.21 +tax. It was freshly made and I loved the mochi texture of the donut.

Ugh I wish I could have gotten some kittens but too bad it's only after a certain time. 4pm?"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-03,3.0,"Shop is cute. The decor is fun and vibrant. The staff is really nice. Small location with a few tables.

There are generally 6 flavors to choose from, 5 on the day I went as 1 was sold out. Berry Lovely, Go Nuts, Purple Pebble, Bacon Miso Happy, Cookies and Dreams were the options available - Cruncha Matcha was sold out. I chose the Purple Pebble & Cookies and Dreams. I liked the texture of the donuts. They are not overly sweet. Most of the sweetness comes from the icing, the donuts themselves are the same. They were good. I liked the uniqueness of the donut - not your typical super sweet donut, but it's not something I would go out of my way for again. There was nothing that made me feel like I would want to come back here for another one - it was a one and done for me."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-01-26,5.0,"I was meaning to come here to try their mochi donuts, but before I knew it they started a new hype - the animal shaped donuts. They are only available after 4PM and so I arrived a little bit before that, but there was already a line. I ordered one white and one pink animal donut with two additional mochi ice cream (matcha and strawberry) to surpass their $10 dollar credit card limit. I ate the mochi ice cream on the spot and thought they were not bad. They were priced at around $1.38 each if I recall correctly, which is about standard pricing for mochi ice cream. 

I took the two animal shaped donuts to go and had them when I got home. I was actually pleasantly surprised because they are so delicious. I had the pink one first and the base had just the right amount of chewiness. The animal ears are actually made out of nuts (I think almonds) and the donut itself wasn't too sweet. I found the white one a bit sweeter, but overall these were fantastic donuts."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-10,3.0,"A nice pick-me-up Japanese mochi dessert store in downtown !

Went here to get some of their 'talked about' mochi donuts. Their menu is a dessert menu - consisting of 6 flavors of mochi donuts, a variety of mochi ice creams and coffee/milkshakes. It's a tiny dessert shop with a couple tables - mostly suitable for take out or shorter stays.

The mochi donuts were nice soft and chewy. Slightly more dense than regular donuts and not too sweet. The best part about them was that they could be broken into small bite sized pieces (& shared or eaten in parts). The purple pebble one was better if the two- nice sweet potato glaze coated with fruity pebbles. The go nuts was more basic (kinda like Nutella on donut) but still was good.

I would recommend this place if you are around canal street for a quick sweet bite."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-04-23,5.0,"Heard about this place through Elite perks, I've never had a mochi doughnut before so I decided to give it a try. Turns out it's right next to Taiyaki in Chinatown, it kinda has all the typical instagram friendly Asian store features: pink walls, plants, fluffy pillows, white marble tabletops etc. I ordered the matcha pebble doughnut and the purple pebble doughnut, the shape of the doughnut is really cute, like several small spheres clustered together. Compared to regular doughnuts, they are more chewy and less oily. I enjoy the texture and how light they are. You can choose the flavor glazed on the top. I think the purple one is Ube, purple sweet potatoes. It's topped with colorful rice cereal, tastes very good in general. They also have other doughnuts in cute shapes, mochi ice cream pieces and drinks."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-02,4.0,"This is some of the cutest donuts I've ever had! :-) I posted a picture of it on Snapchat and many of my friends took screenshots. 

They might've put too much sugar inside, however. I felt faint after eating. The dining space is very small, there weren't many people inside, however, it still felt cramped for space. No one had clean the tables so we had to sit at a dirty table with other peoples crumbs and other food. They were sticky and we I didn't like that very much.

The animal designs that they had were very cute and I'd like to see more than just the cats. Please do this!!! :D"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-01-21,4.0,"I gave it 5 stars until I tried the coffee, which had lots of coffee grounds. A memorable taste. They offer hot coffee which is sold for $3, or free if you check-in. I would not have paid $3 for a hot coffee with coffee grounds when I could visit a bakery. I received the coffee for free after asking the staff about checking in with my yelp app, she was kind and helpful with it. She was also quick to have my order ready even though there was a good amount of customers. The inside has 3 tables for seating and is clean. 

I have tried all 6 flavors and their holiday peppermint flavor and my favorite would be Purple Pebbles with Match following. This is a little bias since I love fruity pebbles and matcha, but I think all their flavors taste good so I would recommend all of them. I haven't seen them anywhere else so I wouldn't mind paying $3.50 for a mochi donut as a cute, delicious occasional treat. 

tl;dr - don't get their coffee unless it's free from checking in on yelp, Donuts are delicious and have a great mochi and dough proportion."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,"First visit here today, and I'm now believing the hype! The cute interior of this mochi donut shop adds to its appeal as a prime dessert spot. Pink walls and marble tables make for perfectly instagrammable shots with the stars of the show, the donuts. 

They have a 6 for $16.33 deal, so I sampled a variety of their flavors. By the first bite, I was stunned by the amazing texture of the donuts. They are both chewy and soft, but not so chewy that each bite requires overworking your jaw, or tearing the dough away ferociously. The bubble ring shape is ideal for sharing. The dough is slightly sweet. My favorite flavor so far is the matcha, a light green tea flavor that isn't too sweet. The purple ube frosting is good too, and you can actually taste the yam in it. Bacon miso is a pass for me, but that might be because I don't usually like bacon flavored things. 

Verdict: These donuts are now my favorite dessert! I love American donuts but these won me over with their unique texture and lower sugar content."

On a gloomy, rainy day, I trekked for 25 minutes in my high heel ankle boots hoping that these Mochi doughnuts would blow my mind. The things I do for Yelp. I've heard so much about them and I couldn't wait to see for myself what all the hype was about. As expected, it is a tiny shop. I didn't hesitate and I ordered all sex (I mean six) flavors that they offered. Always check your typos. 

- Purple Pebble 
- Cruncha Matcha
- Berry Lovely
- Cookies and Dreams
- Bacon Miso Happy
- Go Nuts

I liked the berry flavored ones the most. The bacon, caramel and miso one confused me. All my companions including myself did not enjoy that one. Then again, I'm not a fan of bacon. If you were to blindfold me, I wouldn't even be able to tell you what flavor it was. I was told by a fellow Yelper that Mochi doughnuts should be bouncy and chewy. Ummm...I didn't get bouncy from these doughnuts but tastewise, the inside sure reminded me of those Dunkin Donuts crullers.

I know all Mochi doughnuts taste different from place to place. I will continue on my quest to see what the differences are. Till then, would I come back to this one? I'm afraid no."

Only complaint is that eating the donut is a little messy and they don't have a bathroom / anywhere to wash your hands. There's no public bathroom if you're thinking of sitting down in the cafe."

First off, they do not make them FRESH. I went around 8pm and I asked when the last batch was made and the cashier said 4pm or so. I appreciate his honesty, but the staleness of the donuts really come through with each bite. There's not much of a bounce to the mochi, it's very dense and overly sweet. The toppings don't add much to the taste, although aesthetically pleasing. 

For $3.50 a donut, I'd expect a lot more.

These ""pon de ring"" style mochi donuts are the first I've had in America, and they are true to the original Japanese donuts.

Texture is everything with these donuts, and they completely nail it. They're fried to the point of being just crispy on the outside while retaining that nice mochi chewiness inside. Flavors are excellent as well. I recommend the chocolate hazelnut and berry flavors."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-01-20,4.0,"I gotta say I did enjoy these mochi donuts quite a lot. They have a great balance between a regular donut and mochi. I like how it has a chewy texture but not too much. I ordered 3 types: strawberry, matcha, and cookies and cream. The strawberry is my favorite out of the 3 as it has white chocolate bites drizzled on top which topped off the flavor for me. 

I also loved the aesthetics and will definitely be sure to stop by for some desserts if I am ever in the neighborhood."

To sum up: so greasy I wanted to exfoliate my face and garble some minty mouthwash immediately after eating. Yes, I know I'm eating a donut, which is deep fried. I knowwww. But this was insane. I can sorta forgive that, but for something hailed as a mochi donut, there was definitely no mochi texture. Minimal at best. I ate a donut, okay? Not a pon de ring. (Also not my first mochi donut, so I know how these should be done, when executed well.)

Frosting/glaze is way too sugary. As other reviewers have also mentioned, you can't taste the difference between any of them except for the bacon one, because bacon. 

For a donut, I'd probably eat it again. If it was free. But then again, I'd eat anything for free, so not too high a standard"

To be honest, I don't really like mochi-style donuts. I'm simply not a chewy donut person. However, these aren't as dense as the mochi donuts I've had in Japan and are more on the airy side. Unfortunately, they are not completely gluten-free.

I bought a box of 6 to try all the flavors and the total came out to be $18 including tax. That's $3 a donut, oof. My favorite was the Cruncha Matcha because it's actually strong in taste. I didn't really care for the others too much and the Bacon Miso Happy was my least favorite."

Seating for maybe 4 small groups. Donuts are made-to-order so sometimes there can be a small wait but worth it. Given the texture of the dough, this is definitely meant to be eaten fresh.

I had the matcha and maple bacon. I love the shape of them - makes it easy for sharing. They are warm and have the right amount of chew. I've tried other mochi donuts that are just too sticky and get stuck in your teeth. Though the texture was great, the flavor only comes from the topping. 

Down side is the price - a small donut sets you back $5. You're really only paying for a small donut with a different topping. It's more instagrammable than something I would want everyday."

Each donut is $3.50 after tax which is an exorbitant price to pay for a donut that leaves the taste of rancid oil in the back of your throat. It's very sweet but perhaps that's because they're trying to cover up the old oil they used to fry it in. The matcha one had unnecessary rice krispies thrown on top and was nowhere near chewy enough to be comparable to mister donut. 

I had half a donut and decided to throw the rest out because of the taste of the bad oil. Unfortunately it was too late and I still taste the bad oil in the back of my mouth as I'm writing this review."

The inside was so cute, customer service was good, and most importantly, the donuts were yummy!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2019-12-29,2.0,"This is NOT the first mochi donut in NYC, so I'm not sure what the hype is about. Two stars for the cute store decorations and the cute pink marble paper box you get if you order 6 donuts. 

We only tried the taro fruity pebble donut and I'm glad we didn't try all the flavors. The flavor itself was okay, not terribly sweet, but the texture of the ""mochi"" donut was very disappointing. It was only slightly chewier than normal donuts, but that is because it is just denser than a normal donut, dough-wise. 

The store itself is really small and gets crowded. They are affiliated with Taiyaki (next door), so customers from Taiyaki come here to take advantage of the few tables that they have. For $3.50 per donut, I guess it's not a bad idea to try it, but just don't have high hopes like I did. 
Oh, also $10 card minimum (no sign but standard)."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2019-12-29,4.0,"I'm so glad there's a Mister Donut counterpart in NYC now! I had my first pon de ring donut in Taiwan and instantly fell in love with its light chewy texture. 

The signature donuts are a good buy if you're looking to try a little bit of everything. The six donuts came out to $18 after tax, which are a bit pricey but still not bad for a dessert splurge. 

I enjoyed all the flavors but my top three would be the Purple Pebble, Cruncha Matcha, and Cookies & Dreams. These donuts were the ones that were most packed with flavor but they weren't rich or overly sweet. The sweetness level was similar to that of a French Cruller so my friend and I didn't feel too guilty eating them. 

One caveat is that the donuts weren't warm and were a bit cold. I think some donuts were made to order but it depends on what they have in stock. The only warm donut was the Bacon Miso Happy so it all worked out since that had a meat topping."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2019-12-22,5.0,"This place is a godsend. Each donut is $3 after tax and though small, is worth it. I've been yearning for a place like the popular mister donut chain in Japan for over 3 years and the dough club literally tastes almost the same, texture wise. And texture and consistency is the most important aspect of a good mochi donut. People are saying this place is trying to give alimama a run for the money? Oh please, this place IS! Alimama is overpriced, pretty IG garbage if we're talking legit mochi donuts. You can barely chew those hard chewy things. 

Their donuts are the perfect mixture of mochi chewiness and donut softness/ fluffiness. The level of sweetness is also not overbearing and the flavors I had were on point - matcha and cookies and cream. The donuts are also not oily and one can essentially have a few and still not feel too guilty."
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-01-02,3.0,"More mochi donuts land in NYC! Before coming to The Dough Club, I had mochi donuts at both Alimama and Win Son Bakery, but never tried the ""pon de ring"" style.

The store itself is quite small, with only a few seats and a tiny standing shelf along the wall. You order at the counter and they will bring your donuts out when they are ready. I think they may assemble the donuts to order, but it was hard to tell.

We ordered a box of 6, and tried the purple pebble (ube with fruity pebbles), cruncha matcha (matcha with rice crispies), berry lovely (strawberry glaze), and the bacon miso. All of the donuts were very light and airy, and didn't have a heavy chew like I was expecting. They also were room temperature, which threw me off a little as I was expecting them to be warm.

In terms of flavors, the matcha was definitely my favorite; it had that earthy matcha tone without being overwhelming. I found the berry lovely to taste very artificial, while the ube was very sweet (and sticky). The bacon miso donut had a great blend of sweet and savory.

Overall, I'm glad I tried them, but this probably won't replace my favorite mochi donut in NYC. The ring style is perfect for sharing with friends though, and I liked that they were on the lighter side. $10 card minimum!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2019-12-09,4.0,"I'm loving these mochi donuts! However I did think that a few of these donuts were a bit chewier than others, so maybe the batter isn't 100% consistent or maybe some donuts were just fresher than others.

Flavor-wise, I thought the strawberry and matcha were the best and the miso bacon is good for those who love a sweet & savory combo. The fruity pebbles ended up tasting too sweet for me, though it was a fun nostalgic treat. I had higher hopes for the nut one - there isn't much nut flavor, and probably could have done with more nuts in the glaze or on top of it. The cookies & cream tasted standard but was still good.

Although I wasn't absolutely in love with all of the flavors, I still thought the mochi donuts were overall a great treat, especially since there aren't many places like this around here. I'm still holding my breath and hoping Mister Donut (from Asia) comes to NYC, but until then, I'll be looking forward to coming back here!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-03-24,4.0,I actually enjoyed my mochi donut rings. It tastes just like the ones I had from japan. I'm probably one of the few that love the chewy texture of the donuts. I got the green tea with crisps and the maple bacon. The green tea was really good with a nice blend of matcha and sugar. The maple bacon was not as good as it sounds. The maple bacon left a really weird aftertaste and was just a weird blend of sweet and salty. This is slightly more expensive than your average donut and would consider this an indulgent treat. But I do like how the dessert scene is growing in nyc.
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2019-12-26,5.0,"They offer a buy 6 and get 1 free deal so I ordered 1 of each flavor. It came in a marble rectangle box with a christmas bow on top (festive for the holidays!). I love the presentation of their display case and the packaging of the box. The box was so pretty that it felt like a waste to toss it.

Their donuts are uniquely shaped in a way that you can share with friends because you can separate it into individual balls. For mochi donuts, I was worried that it would taste hard and chewy. I was pleasantly surprised by how soft the texture was. It was also not dry. In terms of flavor, it was the perfect amount of sweet. 

My favorite flavor was the purple potato one. It tastes like fruit loops! The bacon miso one was interesting because the saltiness from the bacon pieces was a nice contrast with the sweet donut.

Overall, if you enjoy donuts definitely give this place a try! It's aesthetically pleasing and also delicious. I'm hoping they'll come out with more flavors such as something with filling!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-01-07,4.0,"To be completely honest, I came in expecting these mochi donuts to be not that good but I was pleasantly surprised! 

I didn't have a good impression of mochi donuts due to a past experience from Alimama (also around the same neighborhood) so I expected not to like it.

These mochi donuts were light, chewy, not overly sweet (in my opinion) and overall very tasty. The pon de ring style makes it easy for you to share since you can easily rip off a piece. If you've been to Mister Donut in Japan, then you've seen the concept before.

My favorite flavors were the strawberry one and the matcha one. Matcha tastes like matcha and has a strong enough taste; same goes for strawberry. I did not like the purple sweet potato one which comes with fruity pebbles on top or the one with bacon bits. The milk chocolate one and the oreo one were okay but did not stand out to me.

Very cute and Instagram-able decor and interior!

They have a buy five, get 1 free deal or you can get them for $3.50 each after tax. Are they pricey, heck yeah but what isn't these days?

I'd go back time to time for a donut and that's a win in my book!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-01-09,4.0,"The Dough club specializes in Mochi based doughnuts, and carries 6 flavors of them.  While I am not a mochi doughnut expert, only having tried one other place in NYC that sells them, I would consider myself a doughnut expert as someone who eats them multiple times a week hah.

The mochi dough at this shop resembles yeast dough very closely in both texture and flavor, only very slightly chewier.  It's also very light and just fun to eat due to the shape.

I tried two of their doughnuts, the berry one and the purple one with fruity pebbles.  The berry one was above average, but didn't wow me.  The glaze is fresh and strawberry flavored, but the flavor just doesnt come as through as I'd like, it reminds me of dunkin except a much thinner glaze.  The purple one on the other hand, they knocked out of the park. It is really delicious, the glaze nice and thickly layered on, and the flavor really good (purple potato flavor, assuming that is ube).  I'd def. Get more of that one, and plan to come back to try other flavors. 

Note, they also sell milkshakes, which I want try eventially.  The shop is cute and modern.

Way to go Dough club, I'm a fan!"
27,the-dough-club-new-york,2020-01-23,4.0,"I've had my fair share of mochi donuts from various places (Alimama, Oh Mochi), but I find myself coming back here for their donuts. 

The mochi donuts here are not very dense. They were the right amount of chewy to taste like a donut yet like a mochi at the same time. They were sticky, though, so not the easiest to share despite the fun shape. And they are also pretty pricey, with the price tag steadily increasing. 

But nonetheless, these are what I imagined mochi donuts to taste like. So go here whenever you're craving for some! The Berry Lovely one's my fave!"
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-04-28,5.0,One of my favorite bakeries in this city. My go to cupcakes whenever I pay this place a visit. Strawberry shortcake and chocolate chip cookie dough. Absolutely amazing. It's still open during quarantine.
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-02-17,4.0,"Got strawberry cake, cookie dough cake, banana Nutella cake and vanilla birthday cake.

Strawberry cake tastes too artificial. 
Cookie dough cake is super dense but bits of cookie dough are a nice surprise. 
Banana Nutella cake tastes like a really moist banana bread with chocolate chip cookies. Can't go wrong!
Vanilla birthday cake was surprisingly above average. They turned a really basic cake into a light, airy, perfect vanilla confetti cake that isn't overwhelmingly sweet."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-01-30,5.0,"My favorite place to get cakes from in NYC. 
Banana Pudding is perfect ratio of wafer & banana to pudding. 

Dreaming Princess is an almond based cake with raspberry filling and a vanilla bean merengue icing. DEELISH!!!!

Second Best chocolate cake in NY- with the first best going to two Little Red Hens Bakery on the UES. 

The blacknwhite cake tastes just like an Oreo cookie dipped in marshmallow. Mmmmmmm

So many cakes to choose from.  There are also a
Few locations but the Prince Street is my favorite. 
They also make their own icecream."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-01-08,4.0,"They've done it.  Impressed me.... The Brooklyn Blackout cake lived up to the accolades.   When you arrive there's plenty of signage to declare that they've been voted the best.   I think they have the right to own that!   My daughter and I split a piece of cake so we could make the final call.  I kid.  However, she's a chocolate person and knows her chocolate cakes.   We were both in agreement that The Brooklyn Blackout is amazing!  

From now on, this will be one of my go to recommendations for anyone traveling to NYC."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-06-02,1.0,What is this? This is absolutely terrible. This is my first time ordering a cake cup cupcake online and by far the worst I ordered this cupcake cup about 2 weeks ago I received the email that it had been ship about a week ago so it took about a week to get to me. First off if you're going to sell cakes and then ship them in a little tiny glass make sure that it's fresh once I receive the Cake Cup in a cup it was terrible it was dry and mushy and not edible at all I end up throwing both little cake cups in the trash what a waste of $55 at least I got a tiny cup out of it which I could have bought from the 99 cent store and just paid $55 for two little tiny glass cups totally not worth it.
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-12-11,5.0,"Alright alright. I'm on a CrossFit diet and I REALLY REALLY was just going to have a small black coffee. But how often do I get to meet with my friend who just moved here? (Not often, I could be better of a friend, but I won't analyze my friendships on Yelp). 

Anyways, he told me that he had some great memories eating here while he was in grad school and couple of years ago and he was excited to take me here! 

He asked me what I wanted - I told him to pick to desserts he wanted to try and I would have one of them. He chose:

Blueberry Cheesecake
Brooklyn Blackout (voted best Choco cake in the US! What a sell!)

Anyways, my guilt over eating some of the cake subsided as soon as it made its way on to my tastebuds. Delicious, not too sweet, cake tasted fresh. 

Thankfully, my friend also ate his cheesecake and most of my chocolate cake. 

I've earmarked this and have to go back to have their vegan treats!!"

It is practically inviting you in to the little cupcake bakeshop which packs a big flavor.  You really cant go wrong with cupcakes!  This place offers a variety of cupcakes, cakes, cookies.  I opted for a chocolate and strawberry shortcake cupcake.  Both were ultra delicious! I really loved the strawberry shortcake flavored cupcake.  It was moist, it was sweet, and I might even say the best cupcake I have tried!  If you are on the fence, definitely go for the strawberry shortcake.  The chocolate was just as good not overly sweet as once would imagine."

Enjoy it there or take it to go, either way, it's a must experience!

So many flavors and choices, with many gluten free and vegan options, everyone can enjoy a treat. The cupcakes all looked so beautiful but I've always been a cake person. Love that they serve slices and they are definitely  big enough to share! While the cookie dough cake was soooo tempting, for my first try I went with the Brooklyn Blackout cake since it was voted Best Chocolate Cake in the Country. 

The cake itself was super moist with dark chocolate ganache filling and a dark and light buttercream chocolate frosting. Yum! So good! 

Since I was in the City just for the weekend, and there are so many food items that I grew up on and can no longer get now that I live in Portland, we resisted the overwhelming temptation to buy more. It will have to wait until next time!"

28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-02-27,5.0,Awesome bakery! The Brooklyn blackout cake is chocolatey and moist. My favorite. The mini cheesecakes were delicious- cookies and cream were a favorite- also liked the blueberry cheesecake. The banana Nutella cake was good but I prefer the chocolate cake! It's very small and crowded but people seemed to eat and leave pretty quickly so we got a table and enjoyed a taste and took the extras home to enjoy later! Service at the counter seemed pretty friendly too! Definitely will be back!
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-11-02,5.0,"We tried a mini cupcake as part of a food tour. Later I went back because the cakes look amazing (and I like cake better than cupcakes). 
So glad we went and I will have to go back. The coconut cake was delicious. The cake was a perfect texture and the layers of coconut custard (guessing) added even more coconut flavor. The frosting was more whipped cream texture than buttercream. It worked nicely with the cake. Husband said the pumpkin spice cupcake was great as well. So many other cakes and the peanut butter cookie looked good. Very yummy place!!"
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-04-26,5.0,"Everything is delicious at Little Cupcake Bakeshop. Had the confetti birthday cake, very moist and sweet- just the way I like it! Highly recommend coming in for a slice of cake or cookie."

I came here after hearing about the Brooklyn blackout cake, and it did not disappoint. I've never been a huge chocolate cake fan but I literally could not stop eating this slice. The fudge filling was to die for and the chocolate frosting is some of the best I've ever had. I also got two cupcakes (I ordered vegan ones on accident) but they were awesome! I can't wait to come back."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-08-01,3.0,"I tried the brooklyn blackout cake today. It wasn't bad per se, and the cake was moist, but the cake was definitely lacking flavor. It was quite bland, which isn't exactly good, especially for brooklyn blackout which is supposed to be hella chocolate-y.  Probably not coming back.  

Also something I noticed was that some of the chocolate cupcakes had frosting falling off of them, as if they'd been sitting out for a while and the frosting was like drying out?? That's never a good sign. Maybe the cupcakes aren't too fresh."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-06-22,5.0,"I feel like I'm on a sugar rush writing this review just because of how excited this bakery gets me.

I fell in love with Little Cupcake Bakeshop for so many reasons. Their Brooklyn Blackout cake was voted best in the country, so I simply needed to go. Walking in, the display place is literally overwhelmed with gigantic cakes and cupcakes of every flavor you could every imagine: oreo, carrot, red velvet, brooklyn blackout chocolate, peanut butter and jelly, and my FAVORITE cookie dough. Literal gobs of cookie dough stuffed in between thick layers of soft, moist cake and thick, creamy buttercream with chocolate chips. It's going to be my wedding cake, I've already decided, as a 21 year old dating absolutely no one. 

This is the best place in NYC to get an over-the-top-amazing sugar fix. Best slice of cake I've ever had, and serving sizes are absolutely huge. Definitely could have shared with at least two people, but that cookie dough cake was alllll mine. Can't wait to come back."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-12-04,3.0,"My recent trip to the Little Cupcake Bakeshop did not live up to the memories that I had of the late-night dessert spot.  The old fashioned soda-shop decor, gluten-free offerings, and creative treats still remained, but the freshness of the pastries was questionable.  I could not even attribute this flaw to our post-dinner time visit, because most of my previous trips had been at a similar hour.  

In order to satisfy each of our cravings, we decided to share a few desserts.  The German Chocolate Cake had layers of fluffy cake separated by a coconut-pecan frosting that was way too sweet to enjoy more than a few bites of.  The Chocolate Chip Banana Bread Bundt Cake was flavorful, but slightly burnt and crispy.  Its Nutella frosting did little to help the dryness of the cake.  Lastly, the seasonal S'mores Bar was tough and impossible to cut.  The graham cracker base and dark chocolate filling were tasty, but hard, and the marshmallow topping was way too sticky.

Overall, the desserts I sampled on my recent trip to the Little Cupcake Bakeshop were flavorful and had potential, but were poorly executed and preserved."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-05-30,2.0,"The 2-star review is strictly on cupcakes. Popped in here after seeing the sign outside that said ""best cupcakes in NYC"". Sad to say that it WAS NOT. I tried the red velvet and the cookie dough. The cupcake wasn't moist and the frosting was WAY TOO sweet and had the consistency of a cheap store-bought cupcake. 

I'll definitely come back to at least try what they claim is the ""best chocolate cake in the US"" because the service was great (4 stars) and I pass by the spot often enough to warrant another visit."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-04-22,4.0,"All four stars goes to the strawberry cupcake! It is seriously one of the best cupcakes I've ever had in my life (and I eat a lot of cupcakes) even when I'm done with it, I think about this strawberry cupcakes for days!!!

It's not the most pretty.. but it tastes very good!!!!! The cream is tasty, and the cake is soft, with bits of strawberries. It tastes very fresh, and good ratio of cake to strawberry. It's mixed well together. 

The red velvet and vanilla bean cupcakes were unfortunately just ok. The strawberry one was mvp, and carrying the whole team"

My dude said he knew just the place, even though he's only been in New York for less than a year. He brought me to this spot, ignored all the cupcakes, and went straight to the chocolate cake. It was rich, it was moist, it was sweet without being overly sweet. It was the chocolate cake of my dreams! It was so good, as soon as I happened to be in the neighborhood (I happened to park right next to the place -- it's destiny!) I had to get another slice of the chocolate cake of my dreams. This time they had a sign advertising the fact that Wine and Country voted their chocolate cake one of the best.

The marshmallow was difficult to eat/cut if I cut the bar in pieces. I didn't dislike it but just overall feel it would've been a better dessert option with oooey gooey marshmallows and melted chocolate. My friend tried the pumpkin spice cupcake and he said it was really good. If I were to ever come back, which I would, I'd definitely need to try some cake. The cake looked incredible."

However, my friends got their other popular treats (such as the Brooklyn blackout cupcake) and they were very pleased. 
So cute on the inside as well, just to sit and enjoy your treat. I also ordered a little cup of soy milk and it only made the experience so much better.

Was expecting to like German chocolate since that what the bakery is known for. My mom and I actually preferred the cookies and cream. Definitely worth a stop in if in the SoHo.

We ordered the Brooklyn Blackout and the banana oatmeal chip cookies. My friend said the cake tasted similar to a chiffon with perfectly sweet chocolate frosting. The vegan and gluten free cookies weree okay. I wouldn't get them again.  Their coffee drinks were fine. It provided a nice break to satisfy a sweet tooth before wee were on our way.

However, they have the best chocolate cake that I have ever had in my life. If you know me, you know that I am OBSESSED with chocolate cake. I am peculiar and specific about it. Little Cupcake Bakeshop blew me away. The slice they serve is big enough to share between 2-3 people. I could never finish it on my own in one sitting because it is so rich.

28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2018-12-12,3.0,"Little Cupcake Bakeshop was never a place that stood out to me, probably because I'm not really a cupcake person. However, I was in the area for other reasons and in the mood for a latte so I decided to stop in and see what I could find. 

For a bakery in Manhattan (in Nolita no doubt), Little Cupcake is quite spacious. The space is very open with a bright color scheme and a few tables set against a grand showcase where all the cupcakes and such are. I decided to get a hot chai latte and since I was in a bakery I chose an apple crumb pie for a little sweet. The latte was smooth and had good flavor, and the apple crumb pie was quite tasty. My only complaint with the pie was that because it was in a refrigerated display case it was a little tough to eat with just a fork - it would have been better at room temperature. 

Service was fast, and overall this is a nice little bakery (ooh name tie-in!). Granted I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back, I enjoyed my experience here and if in the area would be keen to return."

I recently placed an order over the phone in advance for a custom birthday cake with lettering on it and paid for it over the phone. When I picked it up the next day they gave me the wrong cake, spelled the letters on the cake wrong, and the letters were very messy like if a child did it. The receipt that I signed showed exactly what i ordered but the cake that they gave me in my hand was nothing that I paid for. I pleaded with them for days to give me a refund or an exchange because it was at their fault, but they refused. They didn't care of what they did and just wanted to make a profit.

- ***Brooklyn Blackout: We love this in my household. We have order this cake for numerous birthdays. It's rich and decadent and the frosting has a bit of a buttercream/salt taste to it. Make sure to let it sit out for a little if it's been in the fridge before serving. 
- ***Strawberry cupcake: You can really taste the strawberries in the frosting. 
- Cookies and cream: Not as good as the other two. Still sweet and delicious, but nothing super standout about the flavor.

Atmosphere: 4
Cute little cafe where you can sit and hang out for a bit."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-07-10,5.0,"Absolutely delicious cakes and cupcakes. The flavors are so awesome too, ie- Banana nutella, cookie dough etc. I tried the Strawberry shortcake and finished the entire thing on my own. The cake was the perfect texture and had the right amount of cream to cake ratio. My mouth is watering just thinking of the cakes now... @traveleen_gurl"
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-04-22,3.0,"When you go to dinner and across the street is your besties favorite Nolita cupcake shop and it's her birthday, you decide to get a dessert each to try everything. 

I love dessert, but didn't love any of the options we ordered. 
The nutella cake looked great, but it was dense. The banana pudding was top notch, but not as good as my favorite at sweet little sunshine- could have had more banana. And last but not least, we ordered the s'mores bar, the ooey gooey marshmallow had me excited and tasted so good after being heated up."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-01-26,5.0,"On a cake / sugar craving journey at the moment and the siren call of their neon sign drew us away from the cold Milk bar walk up and into a warm cafe.  First off milk bar didn't even have any slices of cake at 9:30 pm (so odd, we tried to find some raspberry limited thing, anyway they didn't have it). BUT (and right across the street) our cravings were answered.  Good selection of cakes and cupcakes. Fun shop with neon lights. Plenty of tables . Open late . Big sign claims best chocolate cake. Definitely a top contender."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-10-29,5.0,"oh. my. goodness. let me just start by saying i am a cake LOVER. yes i am an adult and yes funfetti cake is my all time favorite dessert. and while i like cupcakes, nothing beats a good ole slice of cake, so i love bakeries like this that sell cake by the slice. i was in new york for only 48 hours, so you best believe i did my research as to which cake shop i should be stopping by. there a lot to choose from, but i settled on little cupcake and i was not disappointed! i walked a mile in the rain (literally, umbrella in hand) i ordered a slice of vanilla funfetti and a strawberry shortcake cupcake to eat over the course of my trip

PROS:
- moist soft cake in both the cupcake and the cake slice
- the cupcake surprised me, perfect ratio, delicious strawberry flavor, frosting was to die for
- the cake was phenomenal, a nice big slice with the perfect ratio of frosting to cake. i wasn't planning on eating it in one sitting but not gonna lie, i did
- the shop is cute and spacious with lots of seating. it's lit up a fun pink color and stands out at night
- there are SO many cakes to choose from (and i went at 8pm!! they were pulling a fresh cake out to put in the trays even then!!)
- fun, creative flavors
- other baked goods if that's your jam
- friendly quick service

CONS:
- none other than there was TOO MUCH to choose from! so amazing so many options so little time to try it all"
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-03-18,4.0,"This is a really cute cake shop. I am a reformed cake lover and don't eat quite as much cake as I used to but still appreciate a good slice every now and then.

My sister, brother-in-law and I came here after lunch to get a slice of cake. There were a ton of different varieties of cakes, cupcakes and mini cheesecakes -- all looked really great (especially the cheesecakes!) but we ultimately decided on a chocolate cake with merengue-like frosting. 

The cake itself was very light and fluffy and the frosting was a lot more whipped than buttercream-y. I actually really liked the merengue frosting since it didn't taste quite as overpowering as most buttercream. 

My sister and BIL both loved the cake as well. I'd like to try some of their other stuff, maybe the next time I'm in town!"
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2018-08-23,3.0,"This place was hopping on the weekend, and I decided to give it a shot. I ordered a coffee w/ 1/2 n' 1/2 and a slice of their nutella-banana pie even though it's a cupcake place, the pies were so enticing and it appeared that nearly everyone on line was ordering a slice too. 

They had over five different kinds of pies and several cupcakes. I'm really not a huge fan of cupcakes and was considering one because before I walked in, there was a girl having an orgasmic experience over the cupcake she was biting into and her boyfriend seemed a little embarrassed. He then asked her how much for it; the orgasm was and she replied with $4.25. :) 

I thought that was quite a high price for an orgasm, excuse me, a cupcake. The pies were nearly double that, soooo.... yeah. I didn't experience multiple orgasms though. There wasn't even a hint of wow or a cherry popping. It was too much banana for the chocolate. The nutella spread was only on the exterior of the banana-nutella-banana pie. That's what it should have been called. Seriously, so much banana. I don't even think nutella is the right kind of chocolate to add. Something more chocolately and less hazelnutty may be better. I'm not a bakexpert, so... you cannot rely on me for that, but my taste-buds know the truth. 

Also, the pie slices are way too big for one person. I think they should think about creating a slimmer slice at a slimmer price for the individuals who dislike wasting food. I wound up tossing 1/2 of my slice in the trash. Aside from the fact that it was hard to eat from the taste, or lack there of w/ the overwhelming banana, it was still edible. Very mushy in fact - of course... relating to the banana. 

The coffee was alright. It smelled good upon walking in, but it didn't have that umph of yumm. It was more bland. The milk helped me drink it. 

Happy eats! Don't go bananas!"
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2018-11-03,4.0,"Strawberry short cake. It's my favorite and I keep coming back to it. Little Cupcake Bakeshop's located in the heart of Nolita and there's a ton of places to eat nearby. So if you're in the area, come here for dessert. 

Since Little Cupcake Bakeshop is famous, it does get busy. However, the servers don't try to rush you like they do at Magnolia, and in fact they're very helpful. When you walk in, you'll notice a slew of different cakes. They're all made with excellent quality. 

I've tried a few. They're known for their Brooklyn blackout cake. It's a rich, chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. It's incredibly dense and rich. If you're a fan of chocolate, this is a must get. For me, it's a little too rich. The nutella banana cake is one of my favorite. It's moist from the banana and the nutella brings in more sweetness. 

Let's get to my favorite one - strawberry short cake. I don't know what they do with it, but it's the perfect texture - soft, moist, light - and the flavor is there - you taste the strawberry in the cake and frosting. It's so good that I have regular dreams about this place."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-01-06,5.0,I loved the over all experience at this bakery. The staff was very friendly and helpful when it came to helping me pick from their array of pastries. I ended up choosing the Cookie and Cream Cheesecake and I didn't regret it. I also got the Chai Tea Latte and they have a selection of alternative milks which is very nice. I would over all recommend this shop to a friend.
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-05-05,3.0,"Called 1st because I wanted to know if they were open during this crisis and since this would be my 1st time trying out their stuff. Idk if the girl who answered was just a dingbat or if all the attitude she gave me was a joke but if I didnt have a craving the conversation would've REALLY turned me off!
Me:  ""is there a website where I can view the menu online""?
Her: ""yea"" (without further conversation)
Me: ""okkk where is it""?
Her: ""it's online""
Me: ""duhhn I know that, what's the website""?
Strike 1. Poor customer service.
Ordered a strawberry shortcake and carrot cake cupcake and oreo cheesecake. Let me tell you when I took out that carrot cake cupcake that thing was hard like a rock at the top. I took 1 bite and then threw it smh. I'm sure it was STALE! 
Strike 2. 
The strawberry shortcake was good. The oreo cheesecake was fair. Not sure if I'll go back and if I do it will be for the strawberry shortcake."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-10-19,4.0,"Had never heard of this place and after having a slice at Nolita Pizza, I cruised over for dessert and took a gamble!  Claims to have the best cupcakes according to some magazine.. forgot which. Tried the pumpkin cupcake and I thought it was simply delicious! The cake was light and flavorful, the icing was perfect.  Only gripe - the price.. a little steep for how small the cupcake actually is."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-03-03,4.0,We found our way in this small coffee and pastry shop. There are a couple if small tables inside but it does get a but crowded when trying to order and ait down. Pretty basic menu with coffee and tea choices. I had the hazelnut decaf latte and my wife had the cinnamon spice tea.. the shop is located between soho and chinatown.. would recommend trying it out.. for tru coffe lovers maybe not the right place..
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-11-15,2.0,"Pretty cupcakes, but honestly, they aren't very good. The outside rim is crunchy, not much flavor and the frosting isn't that flavorful. They were packed though, so others must love them. They also have a nice selection of vegan treats if you'd like to give them a try."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2018-07-30,2.0,"Why oh why did my friend have to spontaneously find this picture of a strawberry cake on IG and make us go here to try it. 

The store is pretty cute and looks like a diner with its interior. They have many cakes on display which can be tempting, I understand. But do they actually taste good is the question. 

The cake was first of all $7 due to its big size, which is just forcing buyers to share the diabetes with their friends. 

My friend ordered the lovely ""Good Humor"" Strawberry Cake she saw on IG. They should change their name as it tasted nowhere as delicious as the Good Humor ice cream strawberry shortcake. For one thing, Good Humor didn't jampack their cake with insanely sweet frosting. 

Their cake part was actually pretty good, as I could taste the strawberry taste. However, that frosting was just too overpowering as we could barely finish due to how ridiculously sweet it was. 

Food on Instagram ususally always look a lot better than it tastes! And this is one of them."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2018-08-23,3.0,"Went there with my cousins. They recommended this place so went in to give it a try. 

Service: I can't say much since I didn't really order but the staff seems friendly. It does get crowded quickly and they are trying to juggle everything. So I think it was okay on my end. It is a self-seated joint so finding a table you might have to wait or stare at one for people to get up. 

Food: It was okay. The good humor strawberry cake is not bad but it is definitely sweet. I think the sweetness should be tone it down with whip cream or mascarpone. The icing is what makes it way too sweet. It does take like the ice cream that they were going for but just dipped into sugar overload. The cheesecake was delicious. I got the blueberry cheesecake and it was a good dense creamy cheesecake. It had a subtle taste of blueberry, it isn't overpowering which I personally liked. My cousin had a PBJ and banana ice cream. I was able to get a taste of banana which is great. I didn't get to try the PBJ but he seems to like it since he finished everything.

Overall: It was good. Some things were a little too sweet and need to tone down. Getting a seat can be challenging especially if there are squatters not buying or eating anything.  They did have a strawberry mascarpone ice cream that we wanted to try but it was only sold by quart containers according to the staff which we didn't want that much ice cream. So that was the bummer and I do think they should put a note on that instead of making it an option to pick. I wouldn't be back right away but only if I'm in the area or my family wanted to go back."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-02-27,5.0,OMG the cake is so good! I'm a huge cake fanatic and have been wanting to come here for so long. When I finally got the chance the cake did not disappoint! I i tried the cookie dough cake.. it was so moist and had the perfect amount of sweetness... I'm just mad I didnt try more flavors. They sell their cake by the slice.. it's about 7 something dollars which is kinda pricey but was so worth it. The shop itself is cute. If you're getting your treats to go they put it in a nice take away box. They also serve variety of other desserts including cupcakes and cheesecakes.
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-09-30,3.0,"everything here to me was just ovvvverrrlly awfully too too too too sweet. 
out of the items we purchased, i preferred the carrot cake cupcake the most over red velvet, then blue velvet, then the brooklyn chocolate blackolut...something lol. The blackout had no flavor really. the blue velvet just tasted like straight sugar. Dream bar was also boring. if anything i liked their cream cheese frosting, but i think sprinkles does it better because its a bit stiffer. 
I was gonna try a chocolate cake (which they tout as the best chocolate cake ever) but our bill was getting higher than i'd like it to be for a midafternoon treat. maybe next time.
staff here however is incredibly sweet and answered all my questions. line gets pretty long."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-03-03,4.0,"These cakes were super satisfying! I went in around 11am and the cakes were a little dry, but the frostings were amazing! My favorite was the strawberry cake, a little pricey but worth it! Their staff was very friendly even though I was taking a while to decide on the order!"
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-07-03,3.0,"Little cupcake mgmt - if you're reading this you need to hire new staff or train your current staff better. The staff on July 3rd at around 12pm - young blonde and a older Spanish lady. Terrible. Both. 

I have been coming here for years and my last few visits were terrible due to the the staff. They make you feel like you're bothering this. No hello, Hi or welcome. No smile. Just saying what do you need was too much of an effort for them. They get every order wrong then show clear annoyance when you correct them. A place of business should be welcoming and the little cupcake shop has lost their ""special"" due to their employees."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-02-23,4.0,"Boyfriend and I shared the caramel pecan cheesecake, banana pudding, and s'mores bar. I wasn't impressed. It pretty much solidified my realization that all ""Instagram-famous"" food spots are not actually any good. Little Cupcake Bakeshop consistently shows up on nyc foodie pages. So much so that I decided to try it. Since we didn't have any of the highly rated chocolate cake, I can't speak on that but the cheesecake was extremely rich to the point it wasn't super enjoyable, the banana pudding was nothing special compared to Magnolia's version, and the s'mores bar was tasteless."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-08-18,2.0,"The  first thing that amused me as I was trying to order was the two people taking pictures of cupcakes (like  they look any freaking different than any other cupcake! )
One person was actually trying to stick her face next to the case with the cupcakes. 

I got a cookie dough cupcake and a raspberry bar. The United States judge
Held up a score card with a 3.2 but the Russian judge Gave it a 4.7. Someone must've paid her off. 

The portion & the quality made  the 475 price tag seem even funnier. I got my final good laugh when I went to the register to pay and they were selling a five dollar tote bag with their name on it for $45. I almost laughed  here as Much as the comedy club that I was at the night before"
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2020-03-02,5.0,"Delicious food and wonderful service. 

Another customer was being very unruly and rude to the staff and other patrons though. The staff was exceptionally hospitable and considerate, and very much deserve any accolades they can get. They were patient, even though the customer was loud and angry for no clear reason.

This was March 2 around 9p."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-09-02,5.0,"Delicious little cupcake shop. A group of tried a selection of baked goods. The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, creme brûlée cheesecake, German chocolate cake and the carrot cake were all scrumptious!!"
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-06-15,1.0,"This place has amazing cupcakes but I will not be returning. I went in to try the Brooklyn blackout ice cream on a hot day - I had read rave reviews about  it. 

I ordered one scoop- they charged me $7.50 for two, and I clarified that I only asked for one and they insisted that two was correct, claiming it was the minimum. Fine. 

I was handed a comically small cup of ice cream that would be fine as 1 scoop anywhere. I looked at the cashier and said ""I was charged for two scoops, this cannot possibly be two scoops"" 

She looked around helplessly as if she had never seen their ice cream portions and didn't know what to do next. Another girl at the counter just said ""I didn't scoop it, I don't know"". It seems as if none of these people had been trained on scooping ice cream, what was standard practice, etc. 

Little cupcake bakeshop management- if you're reading this, please adequately train your staff about ice cream. The women working behind the counter this Saturday June 15 at 2 Pm were clearly incompetent."
28,little-cupcake-bakeshop-new-york-2,2019-07-15,5.0,"Great spot for a treat! Quick and easy to order. Everything looks delicious (esp. the German chocolate cake!)

We ate the coconut custard bar (gluten free) and the strawberry shortcake. Both were amazing! Will be back for sure to try other items.

29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-12-24,5.0,"Yummy bubble tea. Excellent location. Also try their ice cream rolls.

Got the popping bubbles with their classic milk tea and really enjoyed it. Definitely reccomend."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2020-02-19,2.0,"We were here at end of January weekend, Chinese New Year night, in fact.  We missed the parade but there were plenty of remnants of firecrackers and such on the street.  We had eaten dinner the other street over, took a walk over part of Brooklyn Bridge and wanted a snack . . Okay, I wanted Bubble Tea and kept checking on Yelp for places but every one was closed or closing as it was 10 pm.

We continued walking back towards Chinatown and excited to see this place open and many people inside.  We went in as well.

It was crowded.  It took awhile before we could place an order - I did Taro milk bubble tea and my colleague had ordered the hand curled roll cream that we've all been hearing about . . . AND apparently that is what people are ordering and what takes so long to make.

I feel sorry for the one guy though fascinating process to watch.  See photos of it.  She felt bad as I was able to get my Bubble Tea in the typical expected time yet we were waiting for hers (after all the others who ordered the curl cream too).

The reason for the low rating is the Bubble Tea tapioca was so hard, not soft nor chewy, so definitely not fresh and maybe all day long or even longer?  Probably the worst one I've had which was a bummer.

Then again, wouldn't be surprising since most of the orders were for the curl cream.  I didn't try it but it's pretty.

If you expect to order and get it quickly, it's much more than 30 minutes wait on a busy night.  Don't order the Bubble Tea unless you ask how fresh first.  Perhaps the thing to order is the hand roll curl cream!"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-04-23,4.0,"Cute, casual spot in one of the narrow streets of Chinatown. For $7+ for a rolled thai ice cream, this is a great dessert to share between 2-3 people. I got the matcha green and black sesame to share with my family. Really liked the black sesame as it held true to its flavor.

Takes a while to make but good for ice cream. It comes with standard condensed milk and mochi. Extras for additional toppings. They take card."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-09-05,4.0,"I tried the sweet life drink (lychee and mango) which was really good. I would definitely come again for this tea. I can't say the same for the lychee popping pearls however. It was really sweet and I wasn't really a fan. One of my friends tried the Thai milk tea and said it was good, while another tried the strawberry mango fruit tea and said it was very sweet. Decor inside the store was nice and service was quick. Parking may be difficult to find however as this is in china town!"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-10-02,4.0,My friends and I came here while we were in Chinatown on a Saturday. It wasn't too crowded and our boba orders came out in ~4-5 minutes. I ordered a fruit green tea (I think strawberry and mango?) and asked for less sugar and it still came out EXTREMELY sweet (to my taste at least). If you prefer your boba on the less sweet side then I would ask for minimal sugar probably. Otherwise it was good with a wide range of unique flavors.
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-11-22,5.0,Very clean cafe! I got a the juicy fruit bubble tea and it was very good with lots of fresh fruit! Cant wait to come back!

29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-07-14,2.0,"Quality of the drinks and ice cream - 4/5
Staff - 1/5

Like I would talk about the drinks a bit more but all in all, they're okay. Nothing special or to brag about (or for the fact that they messed up my drinks on one occasion) but the ice cream is pretty amazing. Definitely would go for that if the opportunity arises.

Now for the staff... at the register they don't fully know what's going on. Only some know that they can do Samsung/Apple Pay and others adamantly exclaim they don't. Take forever on orders even when I'm the only order there at the given time. Forgot one of my drinks in the order last time and then tried to say I didn't order it (receipts come in handy people), and expected the cheese drinks to have the foam on top not nowhere. Then they always work in friend groups which is fine but slows down the process so so much when someone actually walks in to order.

Gave them a few tries, but now I've given up with them big time"

We tried the ""Watermelon Lychee"" - comes with cube pieces of watermelon, mochi, condensed milk drizzle and granola...  it was... nice.  Good texture, thanks to the granola crunch... while the lychee flavor (mashed into the ice cream) did not overpower the rest of the ingredients, it wasn't very strong. 

Cozy space, cute, nice staff - a few tables for you to sit in.  Located on Pell Street, a very ""old school"" Chinatown street... crazy tight!  They are literally just around the corner & a few steps away from their competitor 10Below.  Game on. 

On a personal note: I think I'm over these ""trendy"" ice cream stuff...  however it wouldn't be right if I ""ding"" them just because my taste buds retired these Thai Roll Ice Cream from my brain.  From memory Juicy Spot and 10Below - about the same.   I'm now very in-to my purple yam addiction... preferably Hakkaido... PLEASE!

I ordered cookie n cream which came with the ice cream, whipped cream, sprinkles, one Oreo and chocolate wafer. Overall, i personally didn't  like it. The ice cream itself didnt really taste like cookie and cream. It reminds me of that one time i bit into a cookie and cream ices cream which tasted like it stood in the freezer for a long time with the wrapper open  I would come back but not for that flavor."

29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2018-06-17,4.0,"An innovative way to get your ""iced cream"". I didn't even know this place existed until my friend dragged me inside. Apparently they hand make your ice cream with whatever flavor you like from their menu.

It takes roughly 3mins to turn the cream into iced cream, and you have a chance to watch the process while you wait. 

I am not the biggest ice cream fan but we shared the Black Sesame and it was good. I really wanted the Watermelon Lychee but you can't mix flavors, and we didn't need 2 orders. 

It's a fun process."

29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-05-06,4.0,"We stumbled upon Juicy Spot Cafe after eating at Joe's Ginger. We were  full from lunch but were interested in trying rolled ice cream, so we split one. Upon first glance we were not sure about the process so we decided on one of the predesigned flavors, Cookie Butter. 

The concept of rolled ice cream is pretty cool. It is truly worth it to go and watch the process. The texture is smooth and silky. I can't compare it to other rolled ice cream places yet,  but it tastes good. Next time I would try another flavor as the cookie butter was a little sweet for my taste. It seemed like the lychee was very popular. 

My one complaint would have to be the wait. There were only a couple of people ahead of us and it took forever to get I ice cream. I guess that's what happens when each ice cream is made individually. Looking forward to trying more rolled ice cream. I see one is opening right near me in South FL!"

Great service and great atmosphere!"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-09-02,5.0,The boba is terrific and refreshing. I'd recommend the matcha bubble milk tea. The topping choices were delicious and they have quite a variety.

Clean and friendly spot. Has seating and feels welcoming and Homie. The staff is nice and sweet. And they make the food really fast.10/10 recommend"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-09-14,5.0,"Clean, cold and cute cafe. The prices aren't too high for city standards. My favorite boba spot in Chinatown!"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2018-12-31,3.0,Something unique about this rolled ice cream shop is their use of yogurt in some of their ice creams. Not thinking much about it we ordered the fire cracker. I couldn't stomach a full bite between the yogurt and the condensed milk but that is because I al not a fan of dairy taste. My husband however really enjoyed it so O decided to tree the cookies and cream. It was better but I felt aside from the toppings the ice cream itself was pretty bland compared to other shops I've tried. Service was good and the shop itself had more sitting/standing room than others so you could come with a small party.
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-02-08,4.0,"I went here with a few friends after dinner celebrating Chinese New Years. I've been to a few rolled ice cream shops, but this one offers rolled yogurt too. My sister and I tried the firecracker, which was one of the selection of pre made combinations you can choose from. What made this one interesting is that they had mixed in the pop rocks into the frozen yogurt that had a strawberry base. I loved how you can hear the pop rocks crackle in your mouth. 
If you are feeling a bit more adventurous to make your own creation, there are a great number of options. As a tip: if you check in here on Yelp, it give you one free topping."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-11-16,4.0,"Even after all these years, juicy spot is still my favorite Thai rolled ice cream spot!!! I love that you can customize your own flavors and honestly they all taste sooo good and sooo fresh! I love getting the green tea dragon fruit combination.

Over the years I've tried other Thai rolled ice cream places and if you like light refreshing flavors, you'll love this place! Other places that I've tried were either too milky or too sweet and/or they did not offer any fresh fruit to mix with the base. I find that the ice cream here is just right. 

For those who are lactose intolerant like I am, I'm able to eat a whole serving on my own without experiencing any pains haha."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2016-10-15,3.0,"CASH ONLY.

Torn between 3 and 4 stars, it's really more of a 3.5

WAIT: There were 3-4 groups in front of us for a Saturday around 2:00 pm.

ATMOSPHERE: There are some seats on the side, which is nice and the location is fairly large where if it got super crowded you wouldn't feel claustrophobic.

FOOD: What I like about this place versus 10below is that you can customize your rolled ice cream and do dual flavors.  They also have a lot more asian options like black sesame and asian toppings like grass jelly.  We opted for the dragon fruit pre-made option but subbed watermelon instead of dragon fruit.  

DRAGON FRUIT - since it's yogurt based it has an interesting taste, almost like a sour milky taste, which I guess makes sense since it's yogurt based.  It's also softer than the ice cream base.  Overall, very subtle dragon fruit flavor.  I feel like the texture wasnt as cold and solid as 10below and the serving size seemed smaller? The rolls didnt fill the cup up all the way (but maybe the cup was smaller).  Toppings are kind of measly, but I did like that they chopped them up for easier bites than huge chunks. 

Overall, I would probably come back and try the regular cream base and maybe make my own.  I did try someone's black sesame and it had a good flavor."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-06-29,5.0,Great boba! Nice interior too took my girlfriend here and she enjoyed it as well. Its good because they don't put sugar in their powder
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2018-08-29,5.0,Came into this place on a hot summer day while in NYC and visiting China Town. Super cute and trendy atmosphere. Was super caught off guard to see a wall of pics of celebrities with Leonardo DiCaprio in this shop. Got the milk bubble tea with boba and it was refreshing and delicious.
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-06-01,5.0,Visiting NYC and heard about this place so I decided to get Cookies & Cream.. it was amazing! Definitely recommend to those chocolate lovers!
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2016-08-12,5.0,"I hope this place stays as relatively secret as it possibly can... this is my favorite rolled ice cream place that made me a fan of the fad!  There is little to no wait - skip the insane 10 Below line and come to Juicy Spot!  

The ice cream, in my opinion, was much better at this location.  I like the combinations more and you are allowed to make your own creations.  My first rolled ice cream place was at 10 Below and honestly, I was hardly impressed with both the texture and the lack of flavor and boring combinations.  Juicy spot puts tons of ingredients in the ice cream mixture (not just a single strawberry like some places... cough cough).  It's jam packed with flavor, except for the dragonfruit one which I would suggest you skip because it tastes like nothing.

They offer yogurt and regular cream bases with a plethora of toppings to choose from if you choose to build your own. They also have premade combos which are more worth it because you get lots of toppings that you can substitute.  Actually, the last time I went, they said it was unlimited toppings!

My absolute favorite is their watermelon lychee.  It's an original/regular cream base with lots of diced lychee mixed in, topped with fresh watermelon, mochi (yum!!), granola (I always switch this out for something else), and condensed milk.  The texture is rich and oh-so-smooth and it bursts with flavor. You can pretty much add any topping on this and it would taste amazing.  Definitely up there on my all time favorite cold desserts, and that's saying a lot!

Note that there is little seating/counter space here.

Juicy Spot is also cheaper than some of it's competitors.  All the combos ring in at $6.50 + tax."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-04-19,5.0,Great place for bubble tea!  Very clean and cute inside. And they have those cute lightbulb shaped glasses:)
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-09-02,4.0,Great ambiance and selection. Lighting is very nice especially on a rainy day! Decorations provide a modern and friendly atmosphere.
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-12-31,3.0,"I have no reference points with rolled ice cream, but I am absolutely fascinated by the concept. My girlfriend and I both got the lychee watermelon and were pretty content. With that said, I gave it three stars because I do not see myself making a priority to go back. 

In our frozen desserts, it tastes more like vanilla, even though they're were lychee minced into the ice cream.

To summarize, the shoppe is just a plain ice cream (or plain frozen yogurt) base with fruit and toppings sprinkled in. It would have been ideal if they had XYZ flavored base, other wise you're just eating sheets of vanilla ice cream with whatever toppings you want.  You won't be paying for the flavor or anything, but more so for the novelty of the  idea."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-03-30,5.0,Great spot! Good Ice cream and loved the bubble tea.  Good follow up to Joe's Shanghai
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2018-09-29,5.0,Shout out to matcha rolled ice cream!! I love the thickness of the ice-cream. And some sesame seeds mixed within the ice-cream. The toppings are also very yummy. The whole thing is around $8 so on a little pricier side (but it's a lot!
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-06-07,4.0,This place has very yummy bubble tea! I got the taro milk tea which was only $3.75 for a 16 oz. but to upgrade to a 24 oz. would only be a dollar more! Their taro has a very good and sugary taste. I would definitely come back to have more - their bubble tea tastes very similar to ice cream. I love it!
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-09-15,4.0,"I'm still loving the rolled ice cream movement and this place was great. It's located on a small side street that if you didn't know your way around Chinatown, you may miss it. 

They have 10 pre-made flavors to choose from or you can create something on your own. My problem with that is I always end up creating something that's quite disgusting because not everything I like goes well with one another. 
I love their watermelon lychee combo. I honestly think it's very refreshing and definitely taste less like ice cream because it's not overly sweet. If you like really sweet ice cream, this might not be for you. One thing I don't like about this place is how little toppings they give you compared to other roll ice places."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2016-07-14,5.0,"FYI: UNLIMITED TOPPINGS FROM 7/11/16-8/11/16!

I remember seeing an instagram post saying that they were offering unlimited toppings. 
I've always wanted to try this place too and I was in the area, so I had to stop by. 

I came to the store yesterday around 4ish. I was surprised at how empty it seemed. There were people who were seated, but no line. So I immediately got my order taken. 
I ordered the ""create my own"" (cheaper than custom ones) with yogurt & strawberry. 
I do like 10 Below's strawberry flavored ice cream better, but I did enjoy this one. I could definitely taste the yogurt flavor and I love the strawberry mix in. Good combo! 

For toppings, I took advantage of this exclusive deal. If I were only allowed to get 1 other topping, I might have rated it differently because so many other rolled ice cream places now offer unlimited toppings and it would definitely compare. However since I did choose the toppings that I wanted, I was satisfied. 
{Btw, this location does not have churros}

The price range ($6-7) is not bad and it's similar to other rolled ice cream places like this one. 
The only thing is that this place is CASH ONLY."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2018-08-05,5.0,Never had the rolled ice cream before so I decided to try it here. I got the cookie butter and it was wonderful! You got a lot of ice cream and it didn't melt quickly like traditional ice cream. The inside is clean and cute and the workers behind the counter were very nice
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-07-20,5.0,"I think Juicy Spot has higher quality than other rolled ice cream places in the city.  The dragon fruit flavor is so good! It's yogurt based, so not overly heavy; combined with dragon fruits nature subtle sweetness, it is the perfect fresh flavor for the summer. Also it's a pretty good-looking pink color, perfect for your Instagram posting ;)

Usually there is no line when I come here, which is always a plus. Topping options are are limited compared to some other places. But the taste and quality make up for that"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2016-09-13,5.0,"This place is hands down my favorite thai ice cream roll place and I have tired 10 below and Frozen sweet. I love how quick I can get my ice cream here, I never had to wait longer than ten minutes (even when it was grand opening), everything moves so quickly and everything is extremely efficient. 

I have tired a whole bunch of flavors; Cookie Butter which tastes amazing. The Ferre-Roll rocher is a must have if you love hazelnut, all my friends who love hazelnut all rave about this flavor. The good crazy matcha is absolutely delicious and the lychee gives it a good flavor boosting and makes it special compared to all other matcha flavors. My personal favorite is the Firecracker, which has pop rocks in it but not too much where it is annoying. The strawberry ice cream is so creamy but yet it isn't too thick and heavy tasting. I would love to try out their other flavors and would def. be coming back in the near future! 

Although there is not much seating, I usually do manage to get a seat and the price is around $7.08 with tax!"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-07-18,4.0,"I personally like this place better than 10 below. Their line is shorter in general! Also, Juicy Spot's ice cream is more chewy and their toppings are great as well.
I had the ferro rocher flavor and it was so goood.
(if you like hazelnut, i would recommend this menu)
Also, dont forget to bring some cash since this place does not take credit card just like many other stores in china town."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2016-05-30,4.0,"Originally went to 10 below ice cream around the corner but the line was ridiculously long and was not moving. I decided to use yelp and found many other places around that served thai rolled ice cream. Since JS was the closest and gave 1 free topping for checking in, we decided to ditch the long line and came here instead.

We made our own order with the original base, mango flavor with dragon fruit, strawberries, lychee and mango. It was good and refreshing to eat and the mango flavor was not too sweet.  It doesn't taste much different from regular ice cream but it's a cool concept to see how they make the ice cream rolls. 

This is the first place I've eaten rolled ice cream so I have nothing to compare it to but I can't imagine standing in line at another place for a hour is worth it. 

Oh, and cash only! I didn't know until I got up to the register."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2018-07-10,4.0,"The ice cream is really good and the flavors are so much better than 10 Below's, but it takes forever. I went around 8PM once and the place had maybe five other people, but I waited around an hour to get my ice cream. I've had much more luck in the middle of the day, but it still takes a good while. 
If you have the time, the ice cream is worth it! Huge fan of Watermelon Lychee!!"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2016-06-27,5.0,"I usually go to 10 below, but decided to try this place out! I had a wonderful experience here. The staff were all very friendly and as for their ice cream, it was super delicious!! 

I wouldn't compare them as much to 10 below one of their direct competitors because they both offer their own special flavors and specialities, so I'm now a fan of both of them! 

What I really loved about Juicy Spot was the number of options I had which made me have a hard time picking what I wanted. So basically you could either choose from their ice cream + toppings combinations or you can basically build your own which is something different from other places. So my combo was a yogurt base + strawberry, then added 3 toppings (Oreo, sprinkles, and condenses milk), and got free whip cream to top it off. I thoroughly enjoyed my ice cream. It was super creamy and delicious! Yay! 

As I said, you gained a fan. Woo~"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-11-15,4.0,"Fun texture with solid black sesame flavor and toppings combo!

Food: novel and fun to see the thin rolled ice cream being made, and equally as fun to chip away and eat the thin sheets. Black sesame ice cream base was pretty good in flavor and mochi + condensed milk + grass jelly made added other fun textures and flavor. 
Space: small, clean shop with limited seating. 
Service: okay - a little unprofessional (was arguing with the other servers about whose turn it was to make the ice cream and was annoyed even as he plonked the ice cream onto the counter), but the cashier was lovely and friendly.
Price: Reasonable price for reasonable size and novelty. 
Overall, would come back to this chain for the rolled ice cream combos."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2016-04-04,4.0,"Great Thai ice cream roll place!  Admit, my first time having it and employees were friendly and patient so that's a score for me.

Had the espresso chocolate and they threw a real shot of espresso in the milk base which they pour onto an anti griddle so it freezes right away. Relaxing to watch them make it and after they flatten the ice cream they roll it up.  Also got a make my own, tart yogurt base, dragon fruit, herbal jelly, pop rocks and Mochi.  It was so fruity and fresh tasting!

There was no line when we went.  No line = pure bliss.  Haven't been to 10 below but I plan on checking it out for comparison sake.  If you don't feel like waiting in their jam packed store, walk a few blocks down and check out juicy spot!"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-11-03,2.0,"Not bad.

My friend and I first went to 10Below Ice Cream, about a minute away, but turned it down because of it's long line. We yelped nearby rolled ice cream shops and found this one. It was both our first time having rolled ice cream, so it was fun to watch the staff make the ice cream in front of us. I wasn't too impressed with it and thought that rolled ice cream was overhyped. I think I'll stick with regular ice cream next time because rolled ice cream is mostly empty space."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2019-10-15,5.0,I like this place it was good and really yummy. we ordered the rolled ice cream and a classic milk bubble tea. were impressed with both. a cute no frills dessert place.
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2016-03-16,5.0,"I love coming here for ice cream rolls!! They make it in front of you so you can watch the magic unfold. They only accept cash though (atm). You can make your own with whatever flavors you want or you can order ones they came up with (especially great for indecisive bunches like me).

Overall, their ice cream tasted super fresh. Will definitely come back for more!"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-04-12,4.0,"I'd recommend rolled ice cream 100% for the novelty and experience, 40% for the actual dessert. It's super fun to watch it get made but it's awkward to eat (and even harder to split!). Plus the toppings just sit on top and you can' really integrate them into your bites very well.

The atmosphere is nice here, though. It's clean and bright and each different flavor option is clearly spelled out which is helpful for a first-time consumer. (Full disclosure: we had gone to a very well-known rolled ice cream place down the block initially and had been driven out by the loud aggressive music and long line). A senior staff was training a newbie on our order and explained to her ""just apologize and smile if there's a problem"", which is pretty decent advice. The problem, that they had forgotten our free topping with Yelp check-in, was very easily remedied. 

If you're in the neighborhood, check Juicy Spot out."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2016-04-27,4.0,"I'm a fan!! 

I had bookmarked the LES location and didnt connect the dots until I was already in line and placed my order. 

Juicy Spot is a great alternative if you don't want to wait on the long line at 10Below. I actually like the flavors here because I feel like there are more fruit options, which appeal to my palate more than the overly sugary options at 10Below. 

We had the Dragonfruit option and it was so good! Actually a lot more tastier than any other Thai ice cream that I've had before. The dragonfruit was a bit sweet but not overly so. The chocolate drizzle really brought out the flavor of the dragonfruit - it sounds like a weird mix but it worked out really well. 

Service is typical of a Thai ice cream store - these things take time to be made!"
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2017-03-22,2.0,"I would always say juicy spot can never go wrong and it's my favorite one out of all the Thai ice cream rolls places in NYC, however after the visit to the Chinatown location, I can't find myself saying that anymore. The other location on Ludlow St. always does it right and has friendly staff.

This location is more expensive than the other location. I ordered what I usually order, the lychee watermelon one. It was almost $1 more than the Ludlow location. Is there a reason why there's a difference in prices between the two locations? I also checked in on yelp and was supposed to be honored a free topping, he suggested that he'll just give me more of everything that's in the lychee watermelon. I said sure, but when I got it, it looked the same as usual, where's the more/free topping? My friend got her usual too, the papaya one. It all tasted good and fine until I was almost done and I see hair in my ice cream roll. And when I say ""in"", I mean it. The hair was a part of the ice cream roll so it wasn't me nor my friend who accidentally dropped a piece of hair in. Please refer to my photo regarding this hair issue. 

Since I was almost done, I didn't want to make a big fuss about it. I just left it but I really should've told them and regretting it more and more. It really is disgusting and gross and unacceptable. I saw that piece of hair so I was able to avoid it but imagine the ones I didn't see. Who knows what the hell we are putting in our mouths. 

The place was empty when my friends and I walked in and that should've been the hint despite the fact that it was night time and cold. Small groups eventually came strolling in but it seemed like a chill night for the two guys working there. They were constantly on their phones. I even realized when I found the hair in my ice cream roll and I took photos, one of the staff was looking and he definitely heard me. I guess he didn't want to put trouble or responsibilities on himself for the mess up he did. 

I really do like how juicy spot's ice cream rolls taste and I've been to the Ludlow location many many times. And this one is not bad until I saw the hair. That's a turn off and definitely a big no no in the food industry. I would not return to this location."
29,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york-2,2016-04-10,5.0,"YAAAAAS so happy Juicy Spot finally opened up a new location in Chinatown. It's just as good as ever with some cool new flavors and other items on the menu. I got the yogurt base with lychee flavor and strawberries on top. The tartness of the yogurt was perfectly complemented by the sweetness of the fruits. Looks like you can also order acai bowls and a bunch of other great alternatives. 

I can just tell I will be tempted to come here so often!"

30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-12-07,3.0,"The coffee here seems about average for NYC. But the service is something that made it stand out for me personally. It (sometimes) doesn't hurt to smile.

The coffee cane quickly and was overall, good. The texture was there along with quite the espresso punch. It always disappoints me a little when coffee shops don't offer signature drinks or additional flavouring."

There's only 3 tables, so you're probably out of luck when it comes to finding a place to sit."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-06-23,4.0,Great cafe for working! They have free wifi and air conditioning as well! There only have 3 tables so the seats are very limited.

I think I'll come back and try some more and sit down in their small dining room.

Cute.
4/5"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-07-24,5.0,"Definitely one of the most notable coffee spots in the borough. Doesn't feel like you're a block away from the crowds of Little Italy when inside, especially during the Feast of San Gennaro. 

I still want to say this is probably the ideal coffee spot if you play hooky or you happen to be free in the hours of 9-5pm during weekdays. It's a small spot, with a friendly barista each time I was there, and they have some books to keep you occupied. Instead, I found myself staring into the great beyond a.k.a the skylight. 

It's like the little light in the end of the tunnel. You see that they're actually some sky framed by fragile walk ups of yesteryear. During the day, it seems as though the former tenements display a bleak past, while the bright blue atmosphere in the distance promotes a promising future. Once you realize that you've spaced out for some time, you'll notice the irony and beauty of the shelving and interior of the Atomic age.

I'd say the breve was out of this world, but that's over-the-top. It's as good as you should expect it!"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-07-29,4.0,"Teeny tiny coffee shop in the heart of Little Italy, steps from a dense plethora of shops and commerce. The baristas are highly trained, and their product is top quality, ensuring a perfect drink every time. The minimalist interior is flooded with natural light, and makes great use of the small space with a bar and bench for maximum seating. There are just three small table tops, so this would not be a good place to work, or linger for too long. 

The menu is concise but inclusive, offering every classic espresso drink one could hope to enjoy. They have almond and hemp milk as non-dairy milk options. Additionally, there were a few vegan options in the baked goods case, including a banana bread loaf, a chocolate chip cookie, and raw energy balls. In full vacation mode, I opted for the cookie, which was not very good. It tasted stale, and lacked any prominent flavor. My Iced Americano on the other hand, was fantastic, and worth returning for. A safe bet for coffee lovers."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-03-24,4.0,"Another great coffee shop to add to the list. I ordered an iced coffee and pistachio cake and managed to grab a table one weekend morning. The cake was a tad on the expensive side, but was delicious, and the coffee was great."

Know what you're getting yourself in for - a great cup of coffee on the go. Really tasty, strong and smooth. I thought everything was fairly priced for the location.  

While I probably wouldn't make a trip exclusively for the coffee again (so many great coffee shops all around NY), if I'm in the area again I'd definitely pop in to get a fantastic flat white."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-10-12,4.0,"One of the many Aussie coffee shops that seem to sprout in Nolita like Pizza Rats in East Village. 

You'll encounter very cool creative types here with sipping flat whites and munching on Underwest Donuts. The sliver of a space often spills out onto the bench outside where on nice days, but there's also room to enjoy your caffeinated beverage inside as well. It's not the type of place you'd feel comfortable lingering for more than 10-15 minutes, but it's still worth a break to stop and smell the coffee. 

They sell Underwest Donuts here currently, which saves you a trip to the Westside Highway for one of the city's best."

It's all good, Happy Bones NYC had an expensive coffee machine front and center along with their Counter Culture roast makes me feel good in my bones.

Nothing really to report because of the small space, ordered two Flat Whites and said peace out. It's good to know if I'm driving out of Manhattan, I can swing by and get good coffee"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-04-13,5.0,needed coffee fix and Happy Bones NYC is just the place with friendly staff. I had latte and cappuccino (both are very good)!!!  I will definitely be back to Happy Bones if I am in the area again!!!   The only negative side is this place is very small (seats 4-5 people).   See you soon!!!
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-11-02,5.0,"This quaint little place is a hidden gem! It's very white and clean, and for those who don't want to have caffeine, they offer latte options with all the organic teas they have. Loved it!"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-03-05,4.0,"This is a great place to relax and grab a cup of coffee after shopping in Soho. They have a really minimalist interior! They only have three small tables lined up, so seats fill up quickly. I came with a friend here around 10 AM on a Wednesday and it was pretty empty when we got there. There were plenty of people coming in but getting coffee to go. 

I ordered the cortado and my friend got a tea to stay. The coffee was strong - it wasn't watery at all like some other places. Our total came up to $7 which is a pretty fair price for the city. They also carry a variety of pastries which I will be trying the next time I visit Happy Bones!"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-04-01,3.0,"Got the filter coffee with soy - very watered down. Not good at all. Also don't like that they add the soy for you so you can't control how much to put in. Probably would have had a better coffee experience using my French press at home...

Space is also small with just a couple tables so not a reliable place to meet up and expect seating for coffee with friends."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-01-09,3.0,"I'm well aware of my funny bone (i'm an undercover comedian, y'all); I've had sore bones (thanks clumsiness) and broken bones (thanks, again, clumsiness) but unfortunately, until today, I've never had HAPPY BONES. 

After much consideration (after 2 sips), my body and I have decided that HAPPY BONES is our favorite kind (of coffee) and (of bone). 

Let me explain: 

HAPPY BONES peddles some of the strongest, smoothest espresso/coffee I've had in my long history of purchasing ~trendy~ ~independent~ ~overpriced~ coffee. I had a macchiato with almond milk. Upon first sip and subsequent swallow, I immediately felt like my happy had been activated.

This may be my favorite place to spend $6.00.

I liked:

+The coffee: Obv. They even offer ""oat milk?!"" 

+The space: This is clearly not a shop for you to hang around in all day. It boasts limited seating (3 tables, a few stools and an outdoor bench )but ~cold~) and enough standing room to just catch a whiff of your neighbor's coffee breath.

The shop is clean and crisp, and somewhat industrial. It literally looks like an Instagrammer's perfect shot. It is so modern that I didn't understand the art (in the coffee ""table"" books or on the wall) and my iPhone outfitted in its hot pink case, felt so out of place, I sheltered it in my pocket. Because life is so uneventful without a phone, I was forced into thought (kinda). It is here I came up with my smartest, most ridiculous idea: I should become start taking all my Instagram's here and get paid for my ~minimalist~ style. 

Annoying:

+Outlets: Like I said, they don't want you to stay. There is ONE outlet (from what I saw). Get your coffee and be on your way. Good day, sir. 

+ No bathroom. 

+The Tea Menu: Kinda hard to read against that uber-colorful background but mint is always good right? 

+ Why does a leopard print spoon cost $12?! 

Annoying but Worthy:

+The Pastries: There were no prices listed but just an FYI, I'd pay upwards of 5$ for that gluten free peanut butter cookie. Apparently all pastries are GF. 

What you should do: 
+ Stop in, get coffee, get out. 
+ Go get the cookie. Idk how much it costs but whatever, it's worth it. 
+ Get the coffeeeeeeeeeeeeeee and then come hang out with me because my coffee-high still hasn't worn off."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-11-20,5.0,"Finally got to try this tiny coffee shop after seeing it a thousand times on Instagram (seriously, the same picture of coffee cups from above with perfect lighting x1000). It lived up to its hype. Love their latte. Only 3 tables, a few short stools by the window. Everyone had Macbooks out when I was here. Felt a little left out being the only one without a screen to look at. Gotta come back with my Macbook next time. LOVE the minimalist decor, like everyone else has already said."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-06-16,3.0,Pretty good coffee. Ultra hip reserved staff-so no thank you of course. Accepts cash. No artificial sweeteners. Whiteners on request or added when ordered.
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-11-13,3.0,"I ordered an iced coffee for $4 and thought the price was a little steep, but surprisingly the amount Happy Bones gives you is a lot. I will say, this coffee is strong AF. After drinking it, I was wired for about 3-4 hours. 

The café is cute, but really small. Seating is limited and there's only 3 or 4 tables available."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-01-05,5.0,"I love this little coffee shop. It was recommended to me by a friend when I first moved to the city in his NY eats and drinks list. I stumbled upon it one day recognizing it from his list and have been back several times now, with family and friends too. It's a small coffee shop but it has a very retro urban minimal atmosphere to it which I always really enjoy, aside from the good coffee of course."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-07-22,5.0,"Come here if you want an excellently brewed shot of espresso. The timing of the shot, along with the crema, was on par with the best shops I've had in any part of new York. My barista, Lucas, went above and beyond with his in depth approach to the preparation of my shot, and the results of this were evident in the quality and flavor of my shot.

I will definitely be returning, often."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-03-06,5.0,Very very good coffee! I took my friend there and he is usually a snub when it comes to coffee but he absolutely loved it as well! They had almond milk as an option which is always a plus and the aesthetic is the space was so nice it made for a great instagram!!
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2016-09-08,5.0,"I'm a regular at Happy Bones. I get my coffee there practically every morning before going into work. I don't classify myself as a coffee expert but I've gone to many cafes for coffee and this is by far one of my favorites. 

Of course, everyone prefers their coffee differently so not everyone may agree on their quality of coffee. But any how, their espresso is very good and I like their lattes a lot. I get an iced latte with an extra shot practically every time I'm there and it never disappoints. 

Their pastries and breakfast foods are pricey but they all taste good. As for the cafe itself, as many have said, it's small, simply decorated, hipster and makes hella good Instagram pictures. 

The staff are all very nice, polite and friendly there as well!"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-01-01,3.0,"Got a flat white and a choco chip cookie. I thought the flat white was decent but my sister didn't like it at all. Cookie was okay. Would stop by if I am in the area but wouldn't really go out of my way to come here.
Cafe is cute, but space is very limited."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-05-29,5.0,"Best coffee spot in the neighborhood. Great staff, quick service, addictive coffee. I send everyone who asks me where to get coffee here. Definitely a regular spot for myself and my neighbors. Love the iced red eye, but really anything in the menu is fantastic."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-01-10,4.0,"The only downside to this amazing coffee shop is it's small size. This is definitely not the place to go if you need a guarantee on seating or a place to work. 

The coffee is delicious especially the espresso! They have soy and almond milk for non dairy milk options. 

The prices are also very reasonable for this area and the service is so fast. They are also open fairly early, 7AM.

Happy bones is the perfect stop for a coffee on the go."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-04-28,4.0,Nice place to get a quick espresso. Fast service and good ambiance. Very tiny though and no bathroom.
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-08-12,2.0,"After a disappointing first visit to Happy Bones, I decided to give it a second chance before imparting judgement. Third time's a charm? To be honest I don't think I'll be back to find out. While I can't speak for any of their speciality drinks, expect very watery Americanos (both hot & iced). 

Misc: 
- The space itself is small, so expect to have to order your drink to go.
- They have stamp cards at the register (8th drink is free)"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-06-27,5.0,"They sell Counter Culture coffee, have white brick walls, and it's located in SoHo. What more could you want from a coffee joint?"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-08-09,3.0,"Their coffee is so strong. After I took my first sip, I felt like I hit a wall. However, my friends thoroughly enjoyed their coffees. I took a sip of my friends ice latte, which was very milky.

It's located in a very convenient location in Soho, and definitely has a lot of people coming through! There are a few seats were people were doing work, and overall it was a nice small coffee shop feel."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-08-06,5.0,Cute little coffee shop near little Italy! Reasonably priced and good service. This shop has some donuts and cookie with drinks like coffee and latte. Seating are available and is self service. Definitely would revisit to catch up and relax with friends and family
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-09-14,4.0,Pretty small coffee place but super cool and serves awesome flat white coffee. Coffee Beans from counter culture coffee
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2016-01-04,3.0,"Minimalist place. Everything is industrial white and uber hipster looking. It doesn't have too long of a line for such a small spot near the high-traffic Soho/Little Italy area. 

But the coffee was just OK. Very friendly barista though. He took time to answer my questions about the neighborhood and their different coffee options (mostly Counter culture). I ordered the cappuccino. It was too much milk and cream for such a tiny cup -- like drinking warm milk! Eee, no thank you! Needed more balance in flavor.

Unfortunately more style than substance."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-03-04,4.0,"a little embarrassed that I liked this space so much, but my friend and I also had the advantage of grabbing one of three tables before the noontime rush.

Happy Bones is insufferably trendy: r&b beats, cosmic paint, fake marble tables (someone pls analyze this new trend for me, I've seen this everywhere), exposed lightbulbs, obviously. The people watching isn't as great, sort of an odd area not quite at the edge of Chinatown/little Italy, but on Saturday there was a good crowd of yuppies/rich students talking about their drunk mistakes of yesteryear, so why not eavesdrop.

The drip's worth it, not too dark but also not totally light and fruity, and at $3 for a large, cheaper than other joints in this area. Warning though: you'll have to ask for milk, they don't have jugs of it out, which is kind of a bummer because personally I like to add milk after drinking straight black coffee for a bit.

Would come back to read alone early in the morning and soak up the sun. Though someone do pls explain this marble trend."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2016-06-22,5.0,"I'm so jealous of NYC and the mind blowing coffee shops on every block. We had just left one coffee shop and my sister insisting on checking out the coffee shop with tortoise shell spoons. And since she doesn't drink coffee, I was once again shelling out $4 for a flat white. At least Happy Bones didn't disappoint me with their espresso. 

The interior was tiny and simple and hipster. There's limited seating but we had no problem grabbing a small table. Everyone inside the shop seemed to know each other in some way or other, which was unexpected. But I'm sure there are probably more than a few regulars here. 

My sister was super disappointed that my drink did not get served with a tortoise shell spoon, because that was all she wanted in life. In Happy Bones. Do it for the Insta!

The flat white was smooth, the latte art was on point. Overall, a successful coffee adventure."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-01-27,5.0,"One of my favorite coffee shops! I can only speak for the hot drinks, but everything I have tried so far has been excellent. The space is quaint and perfect for a quick coffee before exploring Little Italy. Definitely a must-try in Manhattan."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2015-11-06,3.0,"As many others say, I would like to give Happy Bones 3.5 stars but it's not incredibly spectacular that it deserves 4/5 stars. 

Perhaps it is because I've seen and heard of Happy Bones many times whether it be on Instagram or a NY city guide. 

I came on a Thursday afternoon around 2 pm and got an iced coffee for $4. I usually like to drink iced coffee black, but it was very strong. Granted I am not a usual coffee drinker, I went back and asked for milk which they were polite about giving me.

I had to wait a bit for one of the three tables to free up as well. There's nothing bad I have to say about Happy Bones but it's not a place I would rave about!"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-03-12,5.0,Nice place to go on a rainy afternoon. Cute minimalist environment and quality drinks and snacks. I really like how they brewed the tea.
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2016-12-26,3.0,"I've been to Happy Bones maybe 3-5 times, but mainly for the clean interior aesthetic. I've had lattes and cappuccinos here, which were very mediocre. At one point, I thought I was drinking milk... the espresso-milk ratio is so off here.

There's free wifi here, but no bathrooms available. The store itself is very small with only three tables and a small ""bar"" where people can sit and chat. It can get pretty crowded and claustrophobic if you come at the wrong time, like on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. Personally, I don't think this coffeeshop is conducive for studying or working - I would only come here for social purposes.

The one thing I absolutely love about Happy Bones though is the interior, which has a clean white minimalist aesthetic that's perfect for my Instagram feed (instagram.com/mbkimchi). If you're on the hunt for some high-quality coffee, I would stay away... but if you're on the hunt for some new pictures, I'd highly recommend stopping by Happy Bones!"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-07-05,5.0,"Cute shoebox size coffee bar on Broome between Mulberry & Centre Street. They have top notch coffee, a few tables and local art on the walls. I would take advantage of their loyally card if I lived closer. Instead I take home the coveted Counter Culture Beans. Steep, but worth it."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-12-05,5.0,Incredible mocha. Best in the city. Small space but in my favorite part of soho. Get a haircut next door if you need one that spots fire too.
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-11-03,2.0,"Happy Bones does play good music, the employees were fine, and has an enjoyable atmosphere... so if they had good coffee, it would be a lovely cafe! 

Albeit I will admit that I'm a coffee snob, there are certain features I consider essential for an adequate americano or latte. Sourness typically tends to be a sign of high-quality beans...but the espresso at Happy Bones was practically undrinkable due to how acidic and sour it tasted. The espresso I bought at Trader Joe's for my personal percolator was by and large so much better, if that tells you anything. 

I would NOT recommend this coffee."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-12-30,5.0,"5 stars for their espresso. My cortado had amazing flavor, aroma and wasn't bitter in the slightest. This place is tiny, but adorable. Perfect place to grab a drink if you're in the middle of shopping."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2019-01-09,5.0,Stumble upon this cute little coffee shop on a rainy day. Ordered a cup of mocha. Tasted so perfect! Not too sweet perfect for my taste. This cup of mocha just added to my one of the favorite mocha in the city!
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-02-24,5.0,"Love their espresso drinks, it has a strong enough espresso taste to my liking. Haven't had just a regular cup of coffee though. I agree with someone else that the only downside is the size of the place. I wouldn't come here expecting a seat with the limited amount of tables and seats they have. Great if you just want a cup to go though. They also serve bellocq tea which is one of my favorites brand of tea leaves that source their tea leaves from around the world I believe."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-12-03,5.0,"Cute little coffee shop with an amazing latte. They only have a couple tables but if it's not crowded you can sit and enjoy your coffee. Next time, I want to buy some of their Counter Culture beans to grind at home. Definitely recommend this place for a great cup of coffee!"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-01-02,4.0,Ordered an extra hot latte. Latte was pretty good and staff was friendly. There's not that many seats here if it gets crowded. Didn't see a space for charging either.
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2015-06-02,4.0,"Extremely cute interior! The people there are very nice. My friend and I ordered flat white and latte which came out to 8$. It's a very decent price but it was a small portion.

The place is very small and it gets packed fast. 

However, I would come here again."

NY: Manhattan: SoHo
2pm Monday 20th 2014
Four Stars

After buying a new suit from the suit supply company, I happened upon Happy Bones which sounds more like a pet store than coffee stop.  There were four two-top tables with chairs on one side and a banquette on the other. The white color scheme provides a modern eco friendly environment and the large street facing window provide for plenty of sunshine and warm. I ordered a cappuccino to stay which came in a 10 oz clear glass. The espresso had mellow flavor with nutty finish. The milk and foam had a nice weight on the tongue and tasted balanced and slightly sweet."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2016-05-15,4.0,"Yay Sunday run! So happy to run into this cute little bone in little Italy. Seems to me that every single one of the coffee shops in this neighborhood never failed me before and this one kept on this consistency.

Menu was simple yet clean, and cups adorably designed - they even featured special paintings in the cup during special holidays. 

Originated from NZ, happy bones naturally present a feeling of freedom and happiness. I would love to return and try their flat white!"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2014-04-30,5.0,"This coffee shop was conveniently located a few blocks down from where we were staying, in Little Italy. I loved how this coffee shop was so not complicated with their flavors or their decor. It was simple and modern. I knew I needed some caffeine to fuel me up for a day of sight seeing and adventure exploring the city. The staff was friendly and welcoming even though I am sure they knew we were tourist. I ordered a simple Americano while the husband ordered a flat white. I did not add anything to my drink, just drank it as it was and it was delicious. The coffee flavor is strong, pure and will help you make any day brighter. I had a few sips of the flat white which was also really good, tasted sort of like a latte. They also had a few baked goodies that I later regretted not trying out.

I did not take a seat at the shop but I know this place would be awesome to hang out and catch up with friends or with a book. I will admit, I feel even more in love with this place when I saw the cute cup designs. No lines for coffee was a big plus too."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-06-22,5.0,"I've been looking for cafes with good coffee, free wifi that's not limited to an hour, and space to sit and do work. Happy Bones has all three! It's not the biggest space, but it was surprisingly not crowded on a Thursday. There are 3 tables and short stools on the side that you can pull over if you're there with a friend. Most people came in for coffee to go, or if they sat down, only stayed for a little while. There's also a bench right out front in case you want to soak up some sun instead of the AC (I'm assuming this is seasonal, so it probably won't be there in the winter).

I got an iced latte which was good and reasonably priced. They also have Counter Culture beans for sale which is great since I've been looking for a place that sells them. Overall, it was a good experience, and the staff/baristas were friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back!"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2018-07-10,5.0,What an attractive cafe! From the tortoise spoons to the modernist cups to the punch colored donuts! I highly recommend their passion fruit and hibiscus donuts. Happy Bones is a great place to go when you need a pick me up.
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2017-05-23,4.0,"When you need a caffeine fix, this shop is the cure. The cold brew is super tasty and perfect for a warm day. Service is super friendly and really quick for a small coffee shop. The baristas know the craft here and it shows in the delicious coffee."
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2015-01-20,4.0,"First time trying a ""flat white"" which is a drink reminiscent of a cappuccino, but with more espresso and velvety microfoam. It is bigger than a cortado but smaller than a latte.
I ordered mine with almond milk and it was delicious!! The texture was creamy and the espresso flavor was bold and pure. Perfect size to hold me over as we were on the way to dinner.
My bf ordered an iced coffee ($4?!) and the coffee was also delicious, you can taste its inherent flavor even with cream and sugar added into it. 

Very limited seating here; more of a grab and go shop. They also offer pastries and tea!"
30,happy-bones-nyc-new-york,2016-03-27,4.0,"Small gourmet coffee shop in Little Italy! In love with the book shelf across the wall, and the white brick walls! 

Their menu is small and simple; ranging from coffee to Chai, and they have a separate menu for teas. Decided to go with the iced latte, cause you can't really go wrong with a latte!  The coffee is strong and not bitter, which is always a plus! The milk makes it super rich and smooth. 

The prices are normal for a small coffee shop like itself. The iced latte was $4.50, and you can customize with different types of milk or add mocha syrup. In addition, they have Dough donuts!

Though the space is small, they make good use out of the space. There's only three tables and seats along the window. The atmosphere is chill, the workers are friendly and were quick in making my order!"

Last time I went, I ordered a classic tiramisu and a peach sorbet.

The classic tiramisu was as good as any tiramisu you would expect. It had its fair share of creaminess and fluff through its lady fingers and mascarpone.

However, it was the peach sorbet was what caught my taste buds and inclined me. The sorbet was served inside a peach, which I have never had before. What was amazing about this treat was that the sorbet was not overly sweet nor was it bland. It literally tasted like a frozen peach that you can shave off with a small scoop! I was so pleasantly surprised by how good this sorbet was that I am interested to try their other sorbets contained in fruit!"

11 Little Italy stores participated in the Netflix promotion of the Irishman that happen this past Friday and Saturday, it became a treasure hunt/food tour for me.  

Little Italy has a lot of places and most of the time I am not looking for desserts.  When I am, my friends and I have tended to go to places we have been especially on a Friday night.

I haven't been to this store so I am excited to try it.  Also, it was a bit crowded since a small tour group stopped by the store.  The tour guide was asking the employees to make sure the tour group was taken care of first.  There are tables though it's a bit tight to navigate until you get to an aisle where there is more space.

When it was my turn, I mention that Jimmy sent me to the employee.  The employee handed me a mini cannoli.  Great for a snack.  The cookie is crisp and the cannoli cream is good.

Thanks Caffe Palmero and Netflix for the treat."

It's like eating a little bit of heaven in each bite. 

I wish I could have these cannolis for breakfast, lunch and dinner they are truly amazing and now this place has become my staple cannoli place.  Check them out if you're ever in the area !"

The coffee is good, the other pastries that I have tried are all tasty and I think the service is great (there is one waitress whose name I don't know who is really just terrific, i've had her several times and she is always fast with a joke and has attitude to spare in a good way) but above and beyond all their cannoli is just obscenely good.

A few people from my group got up to order at the front counter because they felt it would be easier on the waitress and we would not have to worry about splitting the tab. The waitress asked that my friend go sit back down because they have to charge extra tax for sitting down; I guess that's normal in NY to be tax extra tax if you sit down in a restaurant however we were not fond of that. 2nd I order the Oreo cheesecake with the waitress she brought me a piece of cake out; it was not cheesecake at all, I had one bite of the cake and the taste was definitely not cheesecake, I told the waitress and she said we do not have Oreo cheesecake. I asked her "" why when I ordered Oreo cheesecake did you not say it's not cheesecake and it's just a regular cake???"" 
She did not say anything I gave it back to her and I decided to leave. There is another dessert restaurant literally right around the corner off of grand so we went there and it was delicious and the service was great."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-11-24,5.0,"This was an excellent place to stop in for coffee and a sweet treat! They had over four pages of desserts...FOUR. It was tough to pick with so many delicious options. I started with an Irish coffee (decaf, because I'm a crazy person and trying to nix caffeine) which came piping hot and topped with whipped cream and cinnamon. Excellent. We then shared three desserts: chocolate truffle, chocolate caramel crunch (GF, but wow, so good) and the limoncello swirl. Everything was so good. It's a tight space and loud so be prepared for that kind of atmosphere, but we just loved it."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-10-01,1.0,"Not sure why my affogato was $9.95 and ""iced cappuccino"" as your waiter called it was $7.75. 
Your cannolis were old , cream was disgusting. Eclair was barely edible and I choked on it. Four things and the bill came out to $35. Talk about tourist trap. 
Also, try not to use stock photos from your cake suppliers on your menus."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-09-24,5.0,"Caffe Palermo has the greatest cannoli I've ever eaten. It looks like an ice cream cone and the shell is covered in caramel. It's to die for. Phenomenal. I've only tried this so far, but it blew me away so much that I've given it 5 stars. I'm so looking forward to going back to The Cannoli King."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2020-03-20,5.0,"Tea, cakes, cannolis, what more can you ask for in this family run Little Italy cafe? Friendly atmosphere, great pasties, and a lot of love."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-10-24,2.0,"For those prices they could have better service. 2 pieces of cake, 1 reg coffee and 1 cappuccino, $30 before tip. I get it. This is NYC, but on not busy at all day, and empty tables to be seen everywhere, the wait staff could be a little nice and perhaps more attentive. The cakes were ok, but nothing to brag about. The coffee was coffee. It is truly a fact that Little Italy is become something for tourist and not New Yorkers. I can't see myself going back there with those prices and that substandard service."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-10-21,5.0,"I can only rate the chocolate covered cannoli that my husband bought me from his trip to the city. 

Anyone familiar with my reviews knows I love to write a novel, but, for this I only need to write one sentence. 

It was the best cannoli I've ever eaten."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-03-13,4.0,"My kids love Cannoli's and we managed to dissuade them from joining the masses of tourists in Buddy Vs - which we have back home anyways - and into Little Italy as we continued our exploration of NYC and happened to stumble across this place.

We originally just intended to grab a Cannoli and Lobster tail and go on our way but I was seriously hankering after an Expresso so we grabbed a seat - enjoyed a great dose of caffeine and a delicious slice of NY Cheesecake !

The service was so nice, the lady was like an old family friend and was super sweet, we had our desserts within minutes and they were rich enough to serve as our lunch!

All three items were delicious and fresh, Expresso was perfect and the price was more than reasonable. Glad we stopped by"
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-02-18,3.0,"Was on a hunt for yummy cannoli in the city these days. Although the signs says ""cannoli king"", it has way more desserts selection that just cannoli. How could I pass by this one without checking it out? Pretty spacious cafe in the heart of Little Italy.

Decided to get a chocolate one and an original one. Both were decent although I'm more of a chocolate lover. I also got a pistachio biscotti and chocolate chip biscotti. Very crunchy and flavorful. 

Would like to check out other items next time and enjoy the treats at the bakery."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-09-23,4.0,"I will admit like most I was drawn in by their claim of best cannolis in my but their cannolis live up to that standard. The shells are the perfect crispness and the cannoli cream is to die for. But the real star for me was the cheese cone which featured that similar cheese cream surrounded by a almond spun cone. In addition to these dessert, they serve so many more. Make sure to check them out when you are in Little Italy!"
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-01-09,4.0,"Adorable little caffé in the heart of little Italy. Every time I come to NYC, I must make a trip to Little Italy for these kind of places. 
You can tell this place has been here forever... in a good way. 
I ordered a cannoli with a spiked hot chocolate and it was really the perfect pair. My friend ordered strawberry cheesecake and it was delicious as well! The Cannoli King offers so many desserts, there is something for everyone! 
I would recommend Caffé Polermo for both locals and tourists!"
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-01-02,4.0,"Located in Little Italy, Caffe Palermo is an eclectic spot where you'll probably find what you're looking for. While searching for a coffee shop in little Italy, this is the closest thing we could find to not being in a restaurant. 

+ Cannolis - they're big and delicious. About $6-$7 each. You can also get mini ones. 
+ Cozy - There are tables for groups and it's usually busy, but I like the buzz of the place. 
+ Meet the self proclaimed cannoli king himself - he's usually wandering around. I've met him both times that I've been to this place. 
+ Great location in Little Italy. 
+ They have a bathroom for customers. 

- As per NYC standard, it's expensive. 
- The Italian soda wasn't great. Just syrup that fell to the bottom of the cup and soda water."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-06-11,5.0,The BEST cannolis in Manhattan!  Seriously.  You will not be disappointed.  Service at their streetside counter was also courteous and friendly.
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2020-03-23,1.0,"Buyer beware. They deceptively snuck a 3.95% ""service fee"" on the bill, which they apparently do for all credit card transaction regardless of the amount you spend. And not only that but also they don't even come close to Ferrara Bakery, literally just around the corner from them, which has much better atmosphere and doesn't jack up your bill with a scumbag tax.... Umm, I mean credit card service fee."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-11-06,4.0,"Walking thru Little Italy I jumped in here to try a quick cannoli and keep exploring.  It was so good I had to order more, have a seat, and a glass of Prosecco.  I can't wait to go back.  So good...so good!  Staff was so friendly and I can't stop thinking about the cannoli!  Please try it."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-11-05,5.0,We had dinner in NJ and a concert to go to in Brooklyn. But told my wife we had to stop here for deserts and coffee. Been bragging about this place for years because I used to go here since the 80s and they never failed me with their delicious cannolis. And they didn't this recent visit. Thank you guys
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-02-09,4.0,It's cash and $5 for a cannoli but it's probably one of the best cannolis I've had. The shell had that fresh crunch when you bit into it and the cream was thick but not too heavy or sugary.
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2020-02-17,5.0,Honestly the almond cheesecake cone thing I had at San Gennaro was the single best thing I've ever eaten in my life and I'll dream of it always.
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-01-09,4.0,"Best cannoli I've ever had, hands down. 

Missing a star because $7?!? For a cannoli?!?"
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2018-12-12,5.0,"Whenever I visit NYC you'll be sure to catch me in Little Italy en route to Caffe Palermo. They have by far the best cannolis I have ever tasted and I wish I had a Caffe Palermo of my very own! The small, family owned business represents all that is great when it comes to Italian dessert and you can't go wrong trying everything on the menu.

Located in the heart of Mulberry Street, Caffe Palermo serves up cannolis, gelato, and other traditional Italian treats with beer, wine, and espresso. The glass cases line one side of the restaurant providing a great view on on the wide selection of menu items including traditional cookies and cakes. Everything is made daily and is always fresh! You can take food to go or sit down for table service. Don't be intimidated by the line. There is plenty of staff to move people in and out. In the summer they even have an outside cart set up to serve cannolis in bulk. Cash and card are both accepted.

There are lot of dessert places to go in Little Italy, but make your way down Mulberry and look for the giant hanging cannolis. You'll be in the right place!"
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2020-01-28,5.0,"Best strawberry cheesecake ever, it wasn't dry as some other fancier restaurant. Will be stopping by every time I'm in NYC."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2018-01-18,4.0,"Decent place if you're in the area and want something sweet or even a hot coco. After having dinner, my party of six and I decided to walk over to Caffe Palermo not only to warm up, but to have a bit of dessert too. 

I ordered a hot coco with apple pie. The coco was great..not too thick and not too watery, but the pie was too cold and lacked a lot of flavor. Around the table, there was creme brulee, tea, coffee, cookies, etc. and I heard no complaints. 

Cute little place in the middle of Little Italy."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2018-11-22,5.0,Quick counter service for grabbing a cannoli to munch on the road. We took care of our cannoli craving by ordering a chocolate cannoli for $2.50 and scarfed it down right outside the storefront. The cannoli shell was essentially a waffle cone dipped in chocolate. The sweetness level was off the charts; these cannolis are not for the faint of sweet tooths.
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-08-31,5.0,Still the Best Cannoli on Plant Earth did the past 46 years !!! The coffee tasted great as well.
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-06-14,4.0,"I came in to order dessert and coffee. I asked for dessert and the gentleman kindly asked if I wanted a seat. I said sure and he offered up any open seat and to order dessert from one of the servers. I ordered a chocolate cannoli and americano. Both very delicious. The cannoli was just sweet enough to take the coffee black and no sugar -- the perfect paring. 
I ordered a tiramisu, almond and original, and a red velvet to go. It was about 40 bucks with tip. A lil steep, but the night and ambiance was lovely ... definitely would come again!"
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2020-02-22,5.0,The staff was attentive and kind. We had lattes that were so delicious. Not too strong which I love. We also had a lobster tail and a dream bomba. Yummy.
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2018-09-27,5.0,The cannoli I cannot say enough how they were. It was rich and creamy and the outside layer of frost was very crispy and fresh. I was not worried about becoming a diabetic I probably would have Had two of them.    This was truly an authentic Italian establishment. if I had seen the Tara Massou first I would've definitely had it
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-03-22,3.0,"The only reason this place is getting three stars is this: 
1. The cappuccino truffle - undeniably an amazing dessert 
2. The cannoli was good 
3. I have a soft spot for supporting family owned businesses 

We just left here at 11:30 pm, we ordered a cappuccino and one truffle and then two desserts. One being a cannoli and one being a slice of cheesecake - for my boyfriends birthday which he wanted to save for later. 

When it came time to pay the waiter told us the credit card machine didn't work and we didn't have cash - the lady behind the dessert counter said it hadn't been working for over an hour, and they asked us to go outside and get money for them. We only had credit cards on us and the only thing our ATM Card let us pull out was a $20. 

These people told us to give us back my boyfriends birthday cake so we could afford the dessert LOL. mind you we also had to pay the atm fee. Awful customer service and lack of compassion when it was their own mishap that we had to deal with. C'mon man."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-02-20,5.0,"Every Christmas for years, my late uncle would send us cannolis and cookies from ""a special cafe in NYC"" that I never knew the name of. Those cannolis were the best cannolis in the entire goddamn world. 

I ended up here by pure serendipity after having lunch at Umberto's next door, and I had no idea this was THAT cafe until I tasted my cannoli -- it was unmistakable. I texted my mom asking her if this was the cafe Uncle Dean used to send us stuff from and she confirmed that it was. 

To have a cannoli so good that you can actually RECOGNIZE it the second you put it in your mouth is a really special thing. Caffe Palermo is truly the ""cannoli king,"" as their cute oversized-cannoli sign promises outside.

I tried a slice of plain cheesecake too - plain cheesecake being the ultimate test of a cheesecake's true quality. No flavors, no toppings, just straight up cheesecake. It was just as outstanding as the cannolis. 

I hope this cafe exists forever, not only because of the sentimentality, but because I don't think their cannolis could ever be duplicated. I might even carry on my uncle's tradition and start sending my family baked goods from here for the holidays."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2018-10-20,4.0,"Great spot for a late night bite. This is always the place that's open when I find myself wandering around Little Italy. In the summer and winter. They have a ton of great desserts, and aren't as expensive as other well known cafes on the street. 

I've had cannolis, Oreo cream cakes, coffee, cappuccinos and more from this spot. Great people watching when you sit outside in the summer."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2020-01-01,5.0,If you're searching for the best tiramisu in Little Italy NY..you should definitely try this place out. You will not be disappointed! So fresh and full of flavor.
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-09-04,3.0,Wasn't impressed by their cheesecake at all.  Nice clean place to sit and eat. The cheesecake was powdery and crumbly.  We walked down to Eileen's cheesecake and it was so much better. I don't know what the hype is about this place. I feel like it is overrated and just not special. Wish we'd skipped it.
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-06-16,4.0,"I ate here to escape the sun and tourist traps in Little Italy. I shared the 3 Mini Cannoli Taster Plate with my mom. We received a regular cannoli, a chocolate cannoli, and a cheese cone thing. My favorite was the cheese one. It was cool inside and we were the only people in there. The cannolis were tiny and expensive, but it was a good experience."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-04-28,4.0,very nice​ place. had some​ cheesecake​ cappuccino​ and   ​lobster tail. You got to go here if you are ever in New York​
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2020-02-24,4.0,Stopped in to pick up some cannolis after dinner. We got the chocolate covered and plain ones with powdered sugar. Very good! The cream was the perfect amount of sweetness and the outside was nice and crisp. Could have used a bit more filling though. Overall was pretty good though.
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-01-24,5.0,"Caffe Palermo is the best spot in Little Italy to sit down, relax, and enjoy any great Italian dessert.  Of course the cannolis are famous but practically every other dessert we're had has been phenomenal and extremely fresh.  You can get drinks and coffee too which makes this place our ""go to"" after a meal on Mulberry."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-11-25,5.0,How this place has anything less than 5 stars is beyond me. We stumbled upon Caffe Palermo yesterday while browsing Little Italy. Ordered 4 desserts to share among our party. YUM. Everything was incredible. We liked it so much we went back today and it's not a small trek to Little Italy from our hotel. Highly recommend and will definitely visit again!
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-10-13,5.0,Cannolis are BOMB! I also tried the cheese rolls which taste like a cheesecake rolled into a sugar cone. Also DELISH!
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-09-06,3.0,"The name in the front says ""Cannoli King"" ..well with a name like that you'd think they'd have a huuuge selection AND display of different kinds of cannoli but we saw typical cakes & pastries and a small section of regular cannoli that honestly l can get anywhere. So I've asked if they had other flavored cannolis. The waitress showed us a little card on the counter that had 4 other flavored cannolis besides the original one. A little disappointing to see that a place named ""Cannoli King"" only has 4 & not even displayed for customers to easily see. Had we not asked we wouldn't have noticed that lil'card on the counter. Anyway we noticed on the walls it said ""the best cannoli in country"" if I remembered correctly. We were like let's see for ourselves.. So along with 2 cappuccinos we ordered a regular sized pistachio cannoli & a hazelnut cannoli. The pistachio wasn't bad BUT we really wished we could taste the pistachio more. It had only a HINT of pistachio mixed in with the original ricotta cannoli cream ""meh"" ..then the hazelnut wasn't bad either, honestly didn't stand out from the hundred other places that I've had cannolis from. If they weren't ridiculously expensive, we'd go back to try the other 2 flavors, which l believe were chocolate coffee & caramel. The service was good, but again the prices were ridiculous!! I mean I know we're in a touristy area but $7.50 each Cannoli?!?! Come on. I can get a cannoli in Brooklyn for $2.50. They were ok, not the best like they claim. I can definitely make better ones at home in fact, this inspired me to make'em again! At least our waitress was nice & quick."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-05-08,5.0,Amazing cannoli & creme Brûlée!! Definitely worth the stop!!:) caught our attention when they were telling us to come in! And we turned right around and came right in and took there offer! Not a single regret :D
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2018-06-30,5.0,"Maybe the best cannoli I've had in NY, and I have had many good ones.

Normally I would be skeptical when a place itself claims to be the best but in this case I think I have to agree. 

If there was no such thing as getting fat, I would probably buyout the whole tray lol"
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-01-03,4.0,"First time trying Cannolis in NY! We ordered two mini cannolis. Was a fine dessert! Also had the strawberry gelato. I must saw, I will not be having normal ice cream again! Took one star off because the staff seemed tired and wanted to go home."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-06-19,1.0,"Very expensive and poor service, server not nice at all, I won't recommend this place"
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2018-07-08,3.0,Ordered a cannoli.  It was good.  But for $5.......... maybe won't order it again.  Rent is high.  So I kinda get it.
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2018-03-31,5.0,I don't even care for cannoli's much but it's a winner here ! I would def go back for the cannoli's. The macroons not so good. Latte's were good
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-09-07,5.0,"Baby John is an exceptionally warm and funny person. He is personable and really takes care of his customers. 

We had some great dessert at his place and he recommended a few great places for us to have dinner at. 

We will definitely be back to see Baby John and have some more desserts!"
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2018-02-16,1.0,"Horrible service! She was extremely rude! She was so caught up on being rude and saying no that she wouldn't even take my order till after I repeated it the 3rd time. Then after all of that, I finally got my one cannoli based on their advertisement that it was the best, it was ok, woody nasty after taste, it was too heavy and sweet, it tasted like the bad local cannoli I have back at home at Florida. 
Ferrera I think it was called? It was around the corner from this place and it tasted 100 times better!! A 100 times! Let alone, better and reasonable customer service.
I recommend ferrera for the cannoli lovers out there over this place. Ferrera has the best cannoli I've ever tried in my life! 
This place has nothing going for it and the waitress would wanna ruin ur stay while ur there if u decided to stay
Good luck!"

31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2019-03-13,4.0,"After walking through Little Italy, we were craving some cannolis. We decided to try the restaurant/bakery titled ""The Cannoli King"" to serve our cravings. It was found that we were not disappointed and definitely left extremely satisfied. There was a perfect ratio of cream to chocolate chips and outer crust. Along with the cannolis they had other yummy treats available from many gelato flavors to cookies and cakes. If you're looking for a yummy treat after dinner, this is definitely the place to stop."
31,caffe-palermo-new-york-2,2018-03-16,2.0,"The place was cute and clean. The service and the people were nice and so helpful and everything looked delicious, however the desserts were very underwhelming.

I got two macaroons which were stuffed with icing and tasted way off, not bad, but definitely not a macaroon by any means. I also got a cannoli which i wasn't too impressed with, one bite and i was fine. I have had tons of cannolis in my lifetime, and this one wasn't even worth finishing. Super sad."

I get that it's super busy in the mornings and not making any eye contact or showing any semblance of care to the customer might be an efficient way to conduct business but if I wanted that, I'd just go to Starbucks or Dunkin'."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2019-09-30,4.0,"La Colombe is an iconic coffee shop in NYC, and more often then not you'll get a coffee that is really satisfying.

La Colombe is known for many things, but my personal favorite is the draft latte. It comes out a bit foamy, super cold, and has a barely there sweetness that I love. It reminds me a little bit of melted ice cream, but lighter and more delicious. If you haven't tried the draft latte, you haven't lived.

Tip: the draft latte comes without ice, so if you'd like ice make sure to ask!"

I had a cappuccino that did not mix well with milk at all. Somewhat watery and on bitter side."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2019-11-30,5.0,"Coffee is insanely perfect! Smooth and divine, this place is the real deal.  However, the barista had a bad attitude. But I'll take good coffee over a bad attitude anyway."

32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2019-08-19,2.0,"LOVE La Colombe Coffee and would give that the 5 stars it deserves. However, this particular location was super small. Just a few very uncomfortable tables and no outlets to plug in and work. They definitely seem to be a ""to go"" business only. I needed to participate in a web-meeting while on vacation. Really was excited to see La Colombe around the corner from my hotel. However, had to run back to the hotel and take the call there. Bummed that I didn't get to enjoy my La Colombe coffee drink in the shop itself."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2020-01-19,1.0,"I live on the same block as this La Colombe and work across the street.  Despite there being a  a Starbucks in the building I work in, I would trek over to La Colombe on Church st. sometimes 2-3 times a day for coffee.    That will stop immediately.  Prices on some items they sell have been raised 33%.   I can expense my coffee to my employer, but I feel a raise in prices of that degree is not okay. The girl behind the counter tried to justify the price increase as the same items they sell are from a new vendor, but that type of raise in costs has incentivized me to hire a coffee vendor for the our office and give a 100% reduction in business to La Colombe.."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2018-11-25,5.0,"This La Colombe is in the heart of Tribeca and a block south of the hotel I stayed at. It made the morning routine very convenient. I came in each morning for an oat milk latte, each time brewed to perfection. The strong espresso woke me up and doubled as a cozy hand warmer/ essential winter accessory. For the instagrammers, just a heads up that the latte art here is hit or miss (very inconsistent)."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2019-08-16,5.0,Has an aesthetic feeling & they do latte art which was super cute when I went. Workers are very friendly and it's a quiet environment to sit down and read a book while sipping coffee
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2019-06-15,5.0,"Loved it. 

Great place to meet friends in Tribeca.

32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2019-06-08,2.0,"Sorry folks, I don't get it.

The coffee is mediocre, the service is aloof and snobby, and the lines are long.

Ok, you don't like Starbucks; I get it. But don't pick this because it's not Starbucks. Evaluate it on its own merits and you'll agree it's nothing special and mediocre at best.

The only thing I can come up with is that it's yet another example of the Tribeca Distortion Reality Field effect."

After a quick lunch at Humble Fish, I stumbled on La Colombe right down the street. I had tried their Noho location just a couple days earlier and had loved the espresso, so decided to stop in for some fuel for exploring.

This time, I went with a shot of espresso made with Workshop Windrush, from Kenya. It was a bit lighter, but still very smooth. It came out quickly, and in the cutest to-go cup. Availed myself of oat milk and agave to make a tasty short cup.

Recommended, though I think I'll return to their Nizza espresso."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2018-12-07,4.0,"This was one of the first coffee spots we found on our trip. Really great coffee with quite a few places to sit (Which we found to be pretty rare amongst coffee shops in NYC).

I loved the Black&Tan and will continue to get it anytime I need something cold and caffeinated to drink."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2019-11-10,4.0,No WiFi - limited food options. But that's my fault for not researching more- Staff was super nice and recommended options.
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2019-11-10,1.0,"SCAM! They advertise a $2 Americano but will charge you 3$. The extra dollar is for the rude service. Worst staff ever.

Tips: prefer Matto coffee, 1 block away."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2018-12-29,5.0,"Love this spot. La Colombe is the best coffee in NYC as far as I'm concerned and the price is on par with every other coffee spot. Fast service, great interior, and perfect temperature for coffee always. Get the Corsica, a great afternoon/evening dark roast."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2018-12-14,3.0,"I'm not a big fan of their coffee. I prefer a darker, richer roast than what they offer here. The espresso beans used seem light to medium, and too sour for my taste. And, be forewarned that if you like a strong Americano, be sure to request less water ahead of time. I assumed they wouldn't put a double shot of espresso in a 12oz cup filled with hot water, but I was wrong. And while the shop is cute and convenient, there's very limited seating and usually a line to the door. With so many great coffee shops in the city I don't think I'd return to this one."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2017-09-07,5.0,"Awesome coffee that became a daily staple on our trip! First of all, how super lucky were we that this place was literally behind our hotel! 
So in the few days we were there I managed to try an iced latte, a Black and Tan, a coconut mocha draft latte in a can and a coconut draft latte in a can. I have to say they were all amazing!!! My fav was probably the coconut mocha because hello it's like a liquid mounds with coffee lol. As much as NYC isn't hubby's cup of tea  like it is mine. We 
seriously both agreed this place will be THE thing we miss most !!"
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2019-09-24,5.0,The draft and canned latté is a must try. It's naturally sweet and frothy. The customer service is superb in this location

However this cafe is located on the corner of Church, not that crowded, with a lot of open space inside. I purchased their popular heart-sweeten pound bag in retail, the Nizza, grounded into #4 so that I can use in between the espresso maker and my plunger. 
The servers at the counter were delightful and helpful, I got the help I needed!

Next time, I will consider sitting inside, definitely will have one of these fancy coffees!"
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2019-01-02,5.0,Great coffee and cute place it can get crowded but there is a big turnover so you can always get a seat. Loathe tables and stools.  They make probably the best latte in the area.  Staff is friendly.
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2017-05-07,5.0,"We made a quick stop for a cortado, before beginning a full day of food tastings! Yum!

Give them a try! Great taste and good value!"
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2018-04-06,5.0,"Was introduced to this coffee chain by my uncle before I took my NY trip and this place did not disappoint. If this place was rated a 9/10, Starbucks would be a 4/10. There are a variety of coffee beans you can purchase to take home (what I did so I can take the beans back to cali). Unfortunately, the expiration date was a bit too close to purchase date for me. But they did give suggestions on how to extend the life:
-keep the beans in the fridge when the package is opened 
-do not grind the beans until you are ready to drink them to get the best flavor and caffeine content

On the plus side, with the boxes of beans I bought and chocolate, I scored a free coffee! Thanks La Colombe!"

I was excited to find out that they had cold brew on tap, and was intrigued by the latte option. Unfortunately, it seemed like it was all milk and foam and not much coffee. I'm not lactose intolerant but it made my stomach hurt after a few sips. I asked if they could add some coffee to it, and they were nice enough to do so, but with a warning that I should have expected a latte to be very milky."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2017-07-17,4.0,"Seriously aromatic and strong cold brew. I expect nothing less from one of the best coffee roasters.

Five Stars Update

It has been two years since I reviewed La Colombe. I have been here at least 15 times according to my checkin history. This is one of the best coffee shops in the city. 

First, the coffee is fantastic. They roast and sell their own coffee. Their cold brew includes a default shot of espresso which adds that kick of caffeine and flavor. All of their espresso drinks are expertly made. They now have a draft latte which is sugarless milkshake wh in combines cold press coffee and frothed milk to create a naturally sweet, full bodied beverage. 

Second, they have great pastries that will sell out everyday. I particularly like their croissants. 

Third, the price point is a dollar cheaper than any of their competitors. 

Fourth, the staff is always friendly and professional. 

Lastly, the space is small with limited seating but I always seem to find a place to sit and relax."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2018-04-20,3.0,"5.50$ for a cappuccino but they gave me a latte - meaning way too much milk. 

Strictly high end coffee, a tea menu, and a few baked goods. 
But nice vibe in there."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2017-05-02,5.0,Stopped by on our way to tour the city. Quick service and tasty coffee makes for a good start to the day. Their seating area was full but it wasn't overcrowded. Check them out!
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2018-06-16,4.0,"Iced Latte was $4.50. 
I thought they put so much milk when I first saw the drink but the flavor was very good. I put syrup for sweetness."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2017-09-21,5.0,"I love this place! It's very quaint and their coffee packs a good punch. Lots of times, in the morning, the line is literally out the door... and honestly, it's for good reason. The coffee is always delicious and so are their baked goods. My favorite order is to get is the draft latte and a zucchini brownie. The staff here is pretty friendly and the coffee and goods are pretty consistent. I've been to a few locations, but I go to this one the most because it's near where I work. There aren't a lot of tables but you usually are able to find a spot after a short wait."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2017-01-03,4.0,Great coffee! This location is less packed and has more seating than the one in Soho. I grabbed coffee with a friend here and I enjoyed the environment very much. I had a latte and my friend got a hot chocolate. Both were great! Their latte art is on point!
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2017-03-26,5.0,"Yes! Yes! I love this cafe so much and I must say, they are doing everything right.

Shout out to all the baristas in there for making me feel comfortable and perfecting my drink. I ordered a cold brew ($3.50) and for its price and taste, it's a steal! They roast their own beans and I believe they choose the Nizza blend which I never heard of before. It tasted very refreshing and arguably my favorite cold brew in New York.

I loved the atmosphere inside and I had a great time hanging out with my friends inside. If I ever come back to New York again, you already know I'm going to be back here."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2015-01-21,3.0,"The lattes ARE as gorgeous as pictured!  It's just a busy, open space, not necessarily ""comfortable"" seating.  I wouldn't consider it a ""destination"", unless i just happened to be abound.  

My friend ordered black coffee, which she thought was bitter and didn't drink it."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2015-06-06,5.0,"The last time I had La Colombe was about two years ago in Philly and ever since I've missed their cold brew. 

This location is great! Family friendly with a big lobby space for a cool temp. The seating style (tables & chair) are a bit awkward and can be uncomfortable but it works. 

I just basically missed this cafe a lot. It's bold brew taste is something to try. Not to mention the bottle itself is spectacular!"
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2014-12-12,4.0,"Frankly, I was blown away by the quality of the espresso in my latte. It was absolutely fantastic and reminded me of Intelligentsia [my gold standard for coffee]. My latte was inherently sweet. I didn't even need to add sugar. 

The chocolate walnut cookie was mind blowing. It was gooey and uber chocolate-y. This speaks volumes to the freshness of their products. 

Apparently, there are a few locations of La Colombe around Manhattan. The TriBeCa one has seating along the windows but it's really not ample, even on a Friday afternoon. I was lucky to snag a seat. I don't see how people could feel good about planting themselves for hours reading a book or using their computer there. But alas...

The to-stay cups and saucers are super cute, they're like little knick-knacks/china you'd find in your grandmother's house.  

$7 is a lot for a latte and a cookie, but so so so worth it."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2015-04-09,5.0,"I came here every morning that I was in NYC. They had wonderful lattes! 

I really like the staff here. They were really friendly and seemed to enjoy their jobs. 

The chocolate chip cookies are wonderful here and worth getting as a treat. 

In addition to the lattes, they have wonderful organic coffees that you can purchase as beans or grounds. The organic blend called ""Rouge"" has a subtle taste of currants. The ""Bleu"" has a lovely taste of milk chocolate and maraschino. Both are wonderful for morning coffee."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2014-04-07,4.0,"For a consistently great shot of espresso - whether you're here in TriBeCa or elsewhere - La Colombe is always a great choice. Fast, friendly, deliciously acidic - it's a little slice of Europe in the heart of Manhattan.

This particular location is tricky for hanging out in (there are very few seats/tables), but it's perfect for a quick pit stop during a low energy portion of your day."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2018-01-25,5.0,Delicious coffee and cute quaint coffee shop. Not a lot of space to get work done but perfect to chat with a friend or catch up on a good book.
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2016-10-15,5.0,"Probably most consistent with their lattes the staff has perfected their craft in pouring, doesn't get packed compared to the other locations they have. A lot of space and very low key, great to read a newspaper o book with a drink."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2014-06-16,2.0,"I am surprised by all the great reviews for this place. All the positive hype was why I woke up early to check this place out. Maybe it was an off day or the coffee is just not my style, but I am not a fan.

Around 8AM, most of their tables were actually full. I hopped online and ordered an iced coffee. They only have a small size. The coffee came out on a glass plate with a glass spoon, which is actually very sophisticated. I proceeded to the area with straws, sugar, etc. I searched for the milk, but none in sight. I had to ask for it. Of course, they brought out my preferred whole milk right away but I'm unsure why they have the sugar out for self-serve, but the milk you have to ask for. Doesn't make sense. It should be either all or nothing.

The coffee itself was extremely bitter and I had a hard time finishing it."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2014-04-07,5.0,"Heaven on earth for coffee lovers.
La colombe just reeks of roasted coffee beans, steamed milk and cinnamon. It's what my glutinous dreams smell like, mixed in with the scent of the almond croissants from lafayette!
Too delicious and sinful. 
One of the few coffee shops that are worth the wait in line for your $4 cup latte.
No fancy frilly coffee here, no fraps or double mocha caramel lattes just straight up good coffee. Please do yourself a favorite a just order a cappuccino. It will be the creamiest must indulgent cup of coffee you've ever had. No exaggerations ( maybe slightly, but it's worth the extremities)

Even though this location is always crowded, the line moves relatively fast and if you have time you just must have your coffee to stay. 
Sitting down by the windows with my paisley cup and saucer and my almond croissant may just be one of my favorite things to enjoy by myself in the city."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2015-11-29,5.0,"I know La Colombe doesn't need my review, ya know, with all of their raving fans, but I don't care!

So I didn't know a lot before going. A family member said we should check it out. I decided to not cross reference with Yelp since it is a coffee. Just a coffee. I can take a chance here, right?

Glad I did. No menu? I was intrigued. I thought. Wow. Is this going to be my first $10 cappuccino? Nah, it was the normal $4-$5 cost. Phew. 

It was delicious. I savored every sip. Rich. Bold. Just the right amount of milk. 

I would definitely go back! I even noticed later that Dominic Ansel serves La Colombe in his cafe. There are so many good coffee places in NYC, I would put this in the top 5 for sure."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2014-09-26,5.0,"I absolutely love love love their coffee!!! One of the best artisan coffee shops I've been to and definitely on my top list. 

La Colombe is a must stop for me each morning that I am in NYC."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2016-05-23,4.0,"I love La Colombe coffee. It's one of my favorites, and I'm a bit of a coffee addict. My iced mocha was expectedly good. My coconut muffin was fine, a little bland in my opinion.

This is a pretty small location (but equally pretty) compared to its NoHo spot. I did appreciate that I was able to get a table on a Sunday afternoon. *praise hands emoji*

A few downsides for me: small tables, only one outlet, no bathroom, no wifi (unless you have TWC and then you can log in to their hotspot), and perplexingly very cold. And I mean shivering cold after a few hours of working on my laptop there. Maybe not the greatest place for doing work but always dependable for a great cup of coffee."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2017-09-27,4.0,"So the business is still 4 stars. But....

After hearing someone behind me ask for a macchiato yesterday, I asked the barista before leaving if they made espresso drinks and finally received the menu, a take-away menu, I was hoping for when I first when in this place and asked if there was a menu but was just shown the coffee bean and chocolate menu on the counter. I'll assume this person was either new or ""having a day"" as opposed to being catty; he and his partner in crime were both really sweet to assume the worst in them.

Anyway, their drink menu is standard so it's still smaller than the mega cafes we're all familiar with. They keep it basic with lists seven or eight espresso drinks, hot chocolate and drip coffee, loose and bagged tea (which I forgot to mention before even though you can see it on display to purchase like their beans which I also forgot to share...along with their small pastry selection), and their ""on draft"" drinks; the latter of which will take a while to get with because, to me, ""on draft"" is and should only be beer vernacular. Snark and close-mindedness aside, they remind me of my beloved Peet's Coffee & Tea back home before their drink menu started branching out. I really like this place.

So, if you ever go into a La Colombe and ask if ""there's a menu"" and are just shown the drip coffee/hot chocolate/espresso board, get literal (which I don't like doing 'cause I know it might sound a certain way) and ask for their drink/espresso menu."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2015-12-05,3.0,"Location: la colombie is basically everywhere.  This one is right on church street. Very close to neighborhood where luxury buildings are located. Inside, the decoration is minimized but with few seats

I had americano. Americano helps you determine their coffee bean quality. Needless to say, it's not good. I guess next time I will go for the black blah blah 

Btw, is it because of me or they really don't have a menu?"
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2015-04-20,2.0,"Look, the coffee here is great. The staff is friendly, etc. I also wouldn't do this sort of thing if they didn't already have like 200+ positive reviews... BUT

This location doesn't have a bathroom and that's kinda messed up. I can understand if the point is to not make people hang around all day, but it's also like man, let's just be adults and allow people to pee when we're feeding them diuretics.  

No wifi? Sure. Screw that, come for a cafe not to check your email, I can get behind that. 

No menu? Er, well... I guess I already know I'm going to get gouged so I may as well open my wallet and embrace the darkness of uncertainty.

No bathroom? Nah. That's just wrong.

Whatever Colombe, just because you name drop Leonardo DiCaprio on your whole bean coffee doesn't mean I don't want to take a DiCrap-rio on one of your tables out of spite for not having a fricking bathroom.

Properly steamed milk, delicious coffee flavor, fast service. The ambiance is casual but nice. Lots of glass and steel and wood. Could use a touch more design love to make it really fab but perfect for meetings, chats, or take away."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2014-03-18,4.0,"La Colombe Torrefaction is a really cool spot for a really good cup of coffee. The coffee is delicious. The cafe itself looks very chic. They sacrificed functionality for style though. There isn't much seating, and the seating they have is just a few tiny tables/stools. (like the desks you get in college. Why do desks shrink as you go up in education?) I would have stayed and ordered another latte if the seating was better. 

They don't have a posted menu either, so you better know a little something about coffee so you can actually order. The lack of menu also hides the fact that it's pretty pricey.

Their latte art is on point though. And I love the cups they use. Things are just more enjoyable when they're presented well."
32,la-colombe-coffee-new-york,2018-05-29,4.0,"It's a nice coffee shop, I usually order soy latte but they only have almond milk or oat milk. Never had an oat milk latte before so I ordered that and it was great! Tasted like oatmeal and coffee"

This is my second visit to the chain, I've been to both the NOHO and the SOHO locations. Pretty much where the HOs are, I'll show up with my cup in hand.

I waited on line for Cronuts on Sunday morning with my son. I had my Cronut, Now I want my Sunday coffee. Enter La Colombe Torrefaction.

The line at the SOHO location is mind numbing, this location had no line? On Sunday morning?! Yay!

I didn't want to get too crazy, I wanted to see how they make their latte. Perfectly.
They know how to steam the milk to get the proteins rockin' and working with the espresso makes this a fine cuppa coffee.

Mokaya : look just like a  choco pie, but it taste great the chocolate was very smooth.
Mille crepes: have very strong earl grey taste. If you love earl grey you will love it. But I was hoping it will be a little soft. Kind feel a little hard for a crepes.

The restaurant isn't that big but it is super cute. 

We came in for the tea service and boy oh boy those scones and clotted cream took me to another planet.

With tea service, you all get a pot of tea, macaroons, cute citrus cupcakes, sandwiches(heck ya for that cucumber sandwich), scones, clotted cream, and jam.

It was a lot but it was wonderful. 

I wanted to try their crepes but they were out kinda sucky:(. I saw people eating full-blown meals which looked very yummy I wouldn't mind coming back and trying.

If you know someone who is a fan of tea and wants a cute experience this is the place to be."

I'm just upset because my boyfriend got me a pastry to go because he knows I love dark chocolate. So we saw one pastry without a label so we asked what it was. We were told it was the same as eclipse just in red. Which is suppose to be dark chocolate with like something caramel. So I got him and I tried it, there was no dark chocolate or caramel. It was strawberry and something. I felt lied to, everyone should definitely know what everything is before telling customers what they think it was :("
33,bosie-new-york,2019-10-05,5.0,"New location, increased prices, but still my favorite teahouse. Although I miss their previous small, vintage feel, it's great that they were able to move to a larger location.

The tea service for two has increased to $75, but the quality remains outstanding. The tea service consisted of 2 small pots or 1 big pot of tea (our choice of any tea from their menu), 4 sandwiches of our choice, 4 macarons of our choice, 4 scones, 2 mini cupcakes, and 6 mini pastries of their choice.

For sandwiches, we ordered:

Ham with Orange Marmalade- My favorite sandwich. I've never had marmalade before, it really complemented the ham so well! It was savory and perfectly sweet at the same time. I know I'm going to have strong cravings for this every now and then.

Dill and Cucumber- So refreshing! Each bite felt so cool and soothing.

Egg Salad with Shallots- Like any other tasty egg salad sandwich, but the fried shallots gave the sandwich a nice flavorful crunch with each bite.

Lemon Chicken- Pretty good.

For macarons, we ordered:

Rose- My favorite macaron. It was so fragrant and delicious!

Pistachio- My second favorite, it was very tasty.

Raspberry Dark Chocolate- Pretty good.

Passion Fruit Milk Chocolate - A bit too tangy for me.

The mini cupcakes and other pastries were good; some of them tasted better with jam. I absolutely love the scones with their housemade cream and jam.

For tea, we chose two small pots instead of one big pot. Each small pot was enough to fill up 5 teacups, so it was more than enough.

For tea, we ordered:

Organic Tibetan Wild Lavender- It smelled so pretty! We asked for honey and milk on the side to add to it. It was delicious!

Apple Berry Bliss- Tasted like warm delicious fruit juice. I only added honey to this; I didn't like it much with milk.

They offered complimentary sweets at the end of our meal which were a nice treat.

The customer service was excellent as always. This will always be one of my favorite restaurants to go to."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-11-17,4.0,"Brunch in the village. Overall a nice and different establishment

ENTRANCE- greeted and seated under the condition we could finish by 2:00. The place is small and another group of 4 had reservations at 2

SERVICE- generally nice but not very engaging 

MENU - very small but lots of quasi French style variations for brunch. 

FOOD - everyone had different dishes that came with an egg on top. A trendy thing these days. Food was delicious so worth a try. 

VINO - I had a house glass of the burgundy that was OK

PRICE - For brunch in manhattan with tip for 4 people about $135 so not cheap but worth a try. You call it for yourself"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-11-27,4.0,"This was my first time visiting the new location. It lacks the charm of the old location and also doesn't have my favorite items on the menu (like the tofu panini) anymore. 

It's more spacious and has more of a cafe bistro vibe rather than a cozy tea parlour.  The chef is different and the food seems more French now. The quiche and side salad were fine for a light lunch. 

I guess I'm just sad on the passing of another era... To me it's 3.5 due to my nostalgia, but the actual service and quality are a 4."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-11-19,5.0,"Came here for my first afternoon tea with a few of my friends, and we had a really good time!

Food:
Because there were 4 of us, we order 2 sets of the Afternoon Tea Service for 2. It came with 1 pot of tea, 2 full sandwhiches, 2 macarons, and other shared little pastries per person. They also came out in an adorable tiered platter, which looked lovely.They have so many tea options in a whole booklet. I ordered the Kyoto Cherry Rose green tea, and it was perfect. The food itself was pretty filling since it came with a lot. (The scones were amazing. I've honestly never had scones that yummy.) Most Afternoon Tea in NYC is super expensive, but Bosie offers a great experience without the outrageous price tag.

Service:
Employees were very attentive and accommodating.

Atmosphere:
We came here on a Saturday afternoon and didn't have to wait for a table to open up. It wasn't too packed or loud, so it was a nice place to chill and catch up with friends. The cafe is quaint and bright."

If I were to dock the place on anything, it'd be on the extremely limited café seating up front. If you're not coming for food, but just want to stay and work in a coffee shop with your cold brew, you might be out of luck when the 3 small tables up front are filled. 

However, if you do grab a seat, man is this a great, quiet place to work. Oh, and the coffee is no slouch. 
They also have free wifi for customers, and outlets at each of the tables up front."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-05-11,4.0,"This is a cute and quaint tea parlor! I've had a pleasant time every visit thus far. :)

Loves:
+ Lovely staff
+ Yummy pastries
+ Reasonable prices (most teapots are $7 small/$11 large)
+ On quiet street in West Village

Not so love:
- not a ton of seating inside; best for parties of two

Surprisingly I have not come for high tea yet, but that just means an excuse to come back in the future! :)"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-12-30,4.0,"What a charming spot to spend an afternoon at! The layout of the restaurant features a bar, an alcove area, and a more open dining area towards the entrance. My boyfriend and I were enjoyed our tea service in the cozy alcove area. We chose the $75 tea for 2 option, although it probably would have been a better idea to just order tea for one. Don't let the photos fool you; The sandwiches and pastries may seem tiny, but consuming the entirety of the tea tower will over-satiate. We each chose our own pot of tea and 2 flavors of macarons. Each person also gets 2 mini scones, 4 tea sandwiches, 2 madeleines, and 2 mini cookies. 

There is a separate booklet showcasing their immense tea selection, organized by tea type. There are green teas, oolongs, earl greys, black teas, herbal teas, pu-erhs.. you name it, they have it. It was an almost dizzying selection, but I decided to play it safe and choose the Creamy Earl Grey. I love the citrus and bergamot notes of Earl Grey, and I love milk tea so I figured I would like it. I was right! The tea had a milky aroma and rich flavor. I almost filled my stomach with tea before our picturesque 3 tier pastry set arrived. Out of all the pastries, I enjoyed the tea sandwiches and the scones with clotted cream the most. The scones were divine! Each bite surprises you when you taste the soft, slightly crumbly center. The clotted cream prevents it from tasting too dry.  I loved all the sandwiches I ordered (Smoked Salmon, Egg Salad, Radishes and Lemon Chicken Salad) but I was especially fond of the smoked Salmon and the Egg Salad, with crispy shallots. The other pastries were okay. They didn't taste that fresh. My lemon praline macaron had a strangely savory aftertaste.The madeleines were not as soft or buttery as I would have liked. The mini cupcakes, brownie cookies, and shortbread cookies were yummy. The waitress was kind enough to substitute my rose macaron for an Ispahan, since they ran out of the flavor. I really enjoyed the fragrant blend of the fresh raspberries with the lychee and rose buttercream filling, although I would hesitate to pay $8 for it on my own. 

Service was attentive and friendly throughout and the noise level is perfect for relaxing. Definitely an experience for the books."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-06-04,5.0,"Never anything bad to say about this place. I've been to many high tea restaurants around the world: Shanghai, New Zealand, New York, etc, but this has to be the best. I think it even trumps The Plaza's high tea. 

Walking in, you'll see a soft yellow glow on dark wood tables and chairs. It's a small parlor and reservations are unavailable under 6 people. They not only have high tea, but also some tea and meal services available.

I've only ever come here for high tea so I will talk about that.

Generally (I say this because the menu changes ever so slightly year by year), you are allowed to pick a small tea with your high tea service order. I believe it's around $60-$80 per person. The tea menu is humongous. There are so many teas from Asia I've never heard from. On the regular menu for high tea, you will receive scones with butter and raspberry jelly. You will also receive 3 sandwiches with 2 of each kind. There are options from salmon, crab, cucumber, cheese, etc. The time I went last week, they also had an option of choosing two macaron flavors. The last few desserts are seasonal. I received tiny Madeleines and cookies this time around. 

Bosie is my favorite tea parlor simply because of their varieties of teas and classy silverware. The selection of desserts only further proves its quality as the best high tea restaurant for its price."
33,bosie-new-york,2020-01-16,2.0,"Came here for the afternoon tea set and brunch and I was really disappointed as I have heard about their afternoon tea for awhile now. First of all, they didn't let me know they don't serve one serving afternoon tea in 3-tier set but on 2 flat plates... In the menu, there's a picture of 3 tier afternoon tea set... so I just assumed we would get that so we ordered just one serving and a brunch item.. When the food came out, then the wait staff explained 3 tier set is only served for 2 servings and plus. Had I known, we would've ordered the minimum. I was not happy they didn't explain that and the picture in the menu was misleading. 

The $39 afternoon tea consisted of 4 little tea sandwiches, couple of cookies, macaron, mini muffin/scone and a tea pot... Totally not worth it. With tip and tax, it's almost $50. There's nothing unique about their food. I was not impressive with the price and the presentation here."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-10-21,4.0,"This place is a very chic European-esque cafe. There is a pastry bar and a sitting area where patrons can sit and order tea or other pastries.

We came in pretty late on a Saturday night -- around 9. We had a show later on and were looking for some time to kill so we stumbled on in. We ordered the Black caramel tea to share. It was delicious and just what we needed to perk ourselves up. I wanted to order a pastry, but was not hungry enough and my group was unwilling to share with me. Next for sure though.

We spent about 2 hours there enjoying the ambiance and warmth before heading out. 

Overall, a great place and I will be back. One star off because the service  was inattentive at times, which was great for what we were going for at the time, but there were times where assistance or a water refill would have been great."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-11-05,5.0,"I came here on a late Saturday night with a friend. I had wine and tea. He had tea. We shared a dessert. 

The tea was delicious. We had the apple berry tea which was uncaffeinated. There was a dessert menu and many more desserts in the front case. We had a hazelnut dessert which was delicious. It was so authentically French and one of the best chocolate desserts I've had in Manhattan. 

Others in the restaurant were eating the pre fixe which smelled delicious. 

Will definitely be back"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-02-14,4.0,"This was lovely. I always enjoy tea houses, and this was not a disappointment. I liked how they keep the decor simple and unassuming, whereas others are more in-your-face girly, so men feel welcome here as well. I tried the southern green tea, which was awesome, because it had a pecan and caramel taste. Tried the purple tea as well, which was super subtle in taste. 

They also have an impressive food menu. I tried the vegetable soup, which was delicious, but more on the oily side. 

The French waitress was great. Not pushy at all, but attentive to everyone. 

Even though it can get crowded, it's still a relatively very quiet place, so keep that in mind."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-01-29,3.0,"A cute afternoon tea place in the West Village. Not the best I've had, but it was quality for its price. Ordered the tea for three. We actually asked for the tea for two and wanted to just add in an extra tea, but the waitress wasn't really paying attention and didn't understand us clearly. Think the tea for two would've been better for three girls.

The tea service comes with a pot of tea, 2 mini scones, 2 macarons, 2 madeleines, 2 mini cookies, and 3 tea sandwiches. You can choose which macarons and sandwiches you would like. The three of us ordered the Egg Salad, cucumber, Chicken Breast, and Smoked Salmon sandwiches. They unfortunately didn't have some of their more popular, unique macarons like rose, cheesecake, and passion fruit, so we ordered raspberry, pistachio and lemon. The food and tea weren't anything special. The scones with their cream and jam were my favorite; their delicious jam and cream weren't too sweet and were a good balance with the scones."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,"Great place for afternoon tea offered many hours a day, any day of the week. I went on a Monday afternoon and got the tea service for two with a friend--each person gets to choose 2 sandwiches, 2 macarons, and a pot of tea, and is additionally given 2 scones and a variety of cookies and pastries. The tea menu was extensive, and I enjoyed my pot of peach white tea. All of the tea sandwiches we chose (cucumber, smoked salmon, egg salad, and lemon chicken) were delicious, the scones were served warm with clotted cream and jam, and the sweets were all tasty too. Though the tea service is more expensive than it used to be, it still felt like good food for the value. I loved Bosie in its old location and am happy to find that its new spot has the same quality and charm."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-06-11,5.0,"4.5 stars rounded up 

Unassuming & modestly decorated, Bosie Tea Parlor is located on a West Village street with relatively light foot traffic -- a true hidden gem if there ever was one. 

For the Bosie Tea Service ($34 for one, $66 for two), choose a tea, two macarons (I chose Rose & Salted Caramel), & three sandwiches. My party of three indulged in three tiers of carb-heavy goodies. Their dry scones were the only negative; the sweets (a chocolate brownie cookie, sugar cookie, mini madeleines, & macarons) were as tasty as they were adorable, & the crustless sandwiches (I chose cucumber & cream cheese, egg salad, & chicken breast w/ golden raisins & curried mayo) were well made & substantial in size. Couldn't have been more please with their Earl Grey selection; my Dorian Grey, in particular. 

Male patrons (or rather, males that are dragged by their lady friends) will feel welcome here, as there is a lack of the usual frilly, overdone Victorian decor pieces (that I so appreciate!) at other tea houses. 

Looking forward to my next visit!"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-02-10,3.0,"Boise tea Parlor is a cozy, elegant and extremely popular brunch spot in the West Village. It's quite hyped at this point, and we came here to see what all the fuss was about. In the end, we left pleased though not blown away.

Inside, the place is nicely done with old-school decor elements. Gives a very classy, elegant and refined sort of feel to the place. We picked a nice strong classic black tea that went well with milk and honey. We also got the crab and cucumber sandwiches and some mini scones to eat (Mini because they were out of the scones we wanted, and our server offered to substitute them with mini versions instead). The sandwiches were tasty and the mini scones were good but a little dense. We also got a rose macaron dessert which came with lychee and raspberries, which I found a bit too sweet for my liking.

A big let down here was the customer management. They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. When we went on a Sunday at around 2pm there was an hour's wait for two persons (!). We put down our names and got a small bite in the area - deciding that we will do tea and scones here. It took nearly the whole hour before our table was ready, and once seated, they were out of scones! We would have definitely appreciated a heads up before we put our names down, so we would at least be aware we might not get the main thing we were coming for.

I left with the feeling that Boise is very typical of this part the village - nicely done up, fancy looking places that generate a lot of buzz and subsequently lead to long lines and wait times. Was the food good otherwise? Yes, definitely, but not outstanding. Worth a try for sure but I doubt would do this again, given the number of otherwise excellent spots in the city."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-12-29,3.0,"I was here with my family few days ago and no reservation was needed for party less than 6. We waited for about 10 mins and got seated, it was pretty nice. The place is quite modern and clean. The afternoon tea service cost only $39($75 for 2), you got to pick one pot of tea and 2 sandwiches from the menu. I was not very impressed with the food, the macaroons tastes very similar from costco, the Madeleine was burnt and quite hard. Sandwiches is huge and tasteless. When we asked for another pot of tea, it was an additional charge of $11, unlike the other afternoon tea service, they steep your tea in the kitchen and bring out the ready to drink tea to your table. The service was lame, nobody came to check on us and we waited a long time for that extra pot of tea. I was not impressed and won't be returning for sure."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-06-14,5.0,"I absolutely love this place! I was visiting New York from Los Angeles on a recent trip, and had to visit Bowie, being obsessed with all things tea. It was nice and quiet, on a weekday late morning. Had the cucumber sandwiches, raspberry montebello, and pot of black tea and everything was so tasty. The raspberry montebello was drool worthy- the perfect chewy/soft texture, and perfect amount of tartness/sweetness. I'd eat it everyday. Service was great. Attentive and helpful without being suffocating. I wish Bosie was in Los Angeles!"
33,bosie-new-york,2020-02-26,4.0,"I'd give a solid four. The macaroons, sandwiches and pastries were scrumptious! I had strawberry black tea, and my friend had chocolate black tea. It was so aromatic and yum. I was not crazy about the beet sandwich.. not a fancy looking high tea kind of place but a cute joint. I would come back!"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-09-04,4.0,"Want to start by saying I came for dinner. Unexpected I was just going to get tea and a small bite but they have a full menu for dinner which is divine. I got the scallops and my friend got the pork and we both licked our plates clean. We also got tea which was obviously amazing. the desserts sound great but we arent into sweets so didnt get to try those. maybe because it was a slow day, we got complimentary polenta with olive tapenade which is divine and some cookies at the end as well. Service is great, a little pricey but nothing out of the ordinary. definitely want to try their tea service and it's lovely to see that it's not overly busy. Definitely has that romantic lighting feel so I would recommend it for a date or a girls brunch/dinner even."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-12-01,5.0,"Love. Love. Love. We've been visiting Bosie since 2012. We loved the old venue. Cosy, quaint and delightful, but always busy and hard to get a seat. The new venue still holds the charm and rustic nature, but is bigger. 

The staff are delightful, as regulars we know their names and are dlways greeted with a hug. 

The tea is like tea should be and the tea service is the perfect afternoon tea. A great way to spend a few lazy hours."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-03-03,3.0,"This is based on the Afternoon Tea service I had for dinner. If I came here just for the tea and scones, then it'd be more of a 4.

The place is cute, and the service was attentive but I was disappointed that the tea service I had wasn't in a cute multi-tier presentation. For $36, I also expected the sandwich bread to be soft and not dry.

It comes with 3 sandwich choices & I picked:

- Chicken Breast with golden raisins and curried mayonnaise on multi-grain
- Farmer's Egg Salad with thyme blossoms on whole wheat 
- Cheddar Cheese and Branston pickle on whole wheat 

The egg salad was the best, then the chicken. I thought I was stretching it with the cheese and pickle, but I didn't like that one at all. I couldn't finish the sandwiches because of the previously mentioned dry bread :( 

My first 2 initial choices for macarons were sold out so I settled for the Matcha and the Lemon Praline. Matcha was fine but the Lemon was too sweet for my liking. 

The included mini madeleines and cookies were fine but my favorite out of everything was the mini scones as the clotted cream and jam were delicious.

Overall a cute place, but would rather just have the tea and scones instead of the full service. 

Note: I sat in the back near the restroom, and there is a cylindrical pipe that runs from top to bottom of the wall. This is HOT. I almost burned myself by leaning against it and there should really be a warning sign. Beware!

BONUS: I didn't know until too late, but there is a 10% off your first visit on Groupon. Remember to claim it before you pay the bill!"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-03-21,4.0,"This place is so cute! I came in with my friend to do the Bosie Tea service for two. It was pretty crowded for Saturday and waited about 30 - 45 mins until a table was available. There is an assortment of tea you may select, all which are lovely. The sweets and sandwiches were good overall, but not mind blowing. It was also the right amount of food in my opinion; I got full easily. Definitely a solid place for tea service.

I also ordered the caneles (a Bordeaux specialty) to go. These are certainly one of the best in the city. Grab some if you can!"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-10-10,5.0,"I came here at 12pm on a Monday for lunch and we were seated right when we walked in. The high tea is $75 for two people, and you get four small scones with clotted cream/jam, an assortment of sweets, and a selection of two tea sandwiches and two macarons a person. I loved the selection of sandwiches, they were all really classic tea sandwiches and we were able to get all our favorites! We got the cucumber cream cheese, lemon chicken, egg salad, and smoked salmon. They were all so tasty, although the egg salad was a bit heavy on the mayo and light on the egg. The macarons were okay, although I found the rose macaron a little too sweet. The scones were really nice, and were even warm when they came out! The tea menu was pretty extensive, and I loved the tea that I got (the Golden Tips tea). Service was great as well. I love the classic high tea experience, and that's exactly what Bosie provides."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-11-20,4.0,"This place was so cute! My friends and I had never gone to high tea before so we decided to get the whole experience with the Bosie Tea service. We went around noon and didn't have to wait at all. You each get to pick your one teapot, 2 different types of sandwiches and 2 different types of macarons. I really wanted to try the Milk Oolong, but unfortunately they were out of it at the time. I settled for the Island White, which was actually light and super yummy. I tried all of my friends and they were delicious as well. For the sandwiches, I had the Egg Salad with Shallots and Smoked Salmon with Watercress Cream. Both came with white bread and were soo good. For the macarons, I had Vanilla Cheesecake and the Raspberry Dark Chocolate. The vanilla cheesecake was better in my opinion as I loved the inside filling. I also just love cheesecake so I may be biased on this. They also come with these amazing scones with some sort of cheese and jam spread. The other mini pastries that were provided with the service weren't that impressive. Overall, a really fun experience though!"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-09-07,3.0,"2.5 stars really I think for the brunch/afternoon tea experience. Came with friends at 11am Saturday, the place was pretty empty. Having heard good things about their scone, I wanted to try the afternoon tea set. My friend and I ordered a tea for 2, and the other friends ordered the omelette. The scones were good, but the entire tea set portions were extremely small. The omelette as well was not much food and from what my friends said nothing special. I did get full but ended up being hungry way before dinnertime. Service was good. Will not be back for brunch."
33,bosie-new-york,2020-03-06,1.0,"I used to like Bosie's- their tea selection is great and the finger sandwiches and desserts were great but I had a strange experience a little while back. I walked in and requested the table in the back- the waiter asked if I would be okay waiting for it, and of course I was. Finally got the table, and then a female waitress came over and said ""I need this table"" in such a curt and rude way, didn't wait for me to respond, rushed me, grabbed my menus and moved me to the front. It was the rudest thing I've ever encountered. Had she asked, I would've said sure, or if I hadn't specifically requested that table and waited for it, it would've been no problem. But now I will avoid this place for good."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-03-18,4.0,"Came here for a tea service on a Saturday night.  Our server was very helpful in recommendations and knowledge about the tea's they served. 
 With that said,he tea was absolutely phenomenal here! I had the milk oolong tea and was blown away on how they got such an amazing aroma, and milky taste with no milk.  I also tried the ginger beer which was pretty good too. It almost had a LIT taste to it more than a beer.  The sandwiches and desserts came out on a multi-tier display and were all pretty delicious.  I think in terms of value, you're better off ordering what you want off the menu. I don't think the value was quite there at the tea service prices. I would absolutely go back though^^"
33,bosie-new-york,2020-03-03,3.0,"Disappointing. I went to the previous location a few years back and looooved it. Idk what happened, I assume new location, new owners, etc. but sandwiches were lacking (egg salad WAS NOT good and chicken was just okay), pistachio macaron was off (too crispy) and scones fell a bit short. The best thing were the Madeline's and other little cookies (shortbread and chocolate chip). The tea was great, the service was great, atmosphere and decor were cozy and rustic, reminiscent of a log cabin and a retro diner. I thought this was a solid afternoon tea location but will have to search for something better."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-08-14,2.0,"We came here on Sunday August 11 and --
1) They were out of 7 flavors of macaroons from 10 available flavors in the menu. For high tea, you can get 3 flavors so we were stuck with whatever was available. - huge disappointment. 
2) Unlike Taj Pierre high tea where you get a whole pot of tea and milk with your order, Bosie offers only a cup of tea. (No pot tea)
3) Our servers were very transactional and not at all warm/welcoming.
4) Restrooms are not baby/kid friendly - they do not have changing table. For the price tag, you expect a decent place?!?
5) Quantity of sandwiches, macaroons, etc was small as compared to other tea places. Their chocolate chai latte was below average. (I am a huge tea person and this was a total disappointment)
I would rather go to Taj Pierre than Bosie."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-12-09,5.0,"Came for Sunday brunch.

If you like scones, you got to try their chai scone and don't lather it with jam -- you'll be able to taste the delicate flavor of the chai more.

Come here for good service and good food. Prices are reasonable for the area"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-10-04,4.0,"Cute European-style cafe - definitely overpriced and service was a bit slow considered I was one of only two people in the whole cafe at 10am on a weekday.

Come for the ambience. They have oat milk which is always a plus. Their pastries are adorable but will set you back $7-8 without filling you up at all. I stopped in while waiting for a spot at the nail salon next door. I might get coffee to go next time, or might stay and work if I'm in the area for longer. Didn't quite work for a quick breakfast stop, but lovely French atmosphere!"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-03-19,5.0,"My friend and I came on a Monday holiday and got in for brunch right away. We did the tea service for two with Shrangi-la tea (I forget the other one we had). It was a ton of food, definitely worth it. We did an assortment of sandwiches; the best ones were cheese and cucumber, and only one I didn't care for was the egg salad. As for sweets, the Madelines were just ok, but shortbread and biscuits were great. The macarons were also delicious - my favorites were the caramel and passionfruit. Service was good."
33,bosie-new-york,2018-07-15,4.0,"Came here yesterday after my yoga class to meet my friend.

We ordered Boise tea set for two people 
- a small tea pot per person ( any tea that are 6-7$ are consider standard tea selections, anything that are more than that are extra price) 
-3 sandwich choices per person ( for both of us, we just got one of each 6 flavors they have)
- 2 macaroon flavor per person ( I got pistachio, salted caramel and he got lemon praline and earl grey)
- some pastries and scones 

Total was around 70 dollars ( not include tips)

Overall it's a quite decent place. Wait time is like 5 mins. Service is really nice, they keep filling my water. I finished my tea, I got Kyoto rose green, I thought It was really nice, I really enjoyed it. We were there about 3 hrs, we just had a lot of talk about lol and kind forgot about the time. Staff there are very kind, so We didn't feel being rushed or any complains. 

Scones for our plates are to die for. My friend loves their sandwiches. I think they are ok but I loved their scones, and cookies. Macaroons are ok. 

Would totally come back again! Love it"

33,bosie-new-york,2018-08-14,4.0,"I have never experienced a tea parlor place before. It was quite a unique and fun experience for me. 

Got the tea service for 2. You get 2 cup pot of tea, 2 mini scones with cream and jam, 3 portions of tea sandwiches, 2 mini tea cakes, and 2 macarons. 
The teas are refreshing, soothing, and top quality teas. All the food I can eat in like 1 or 2 bites, but they were good quality well made bit size food. I love the presentation of the tea service. It made the experience really fun and unique. 

Who doesn't want to spend an afternoon just chatting over tea and bite size food."

My picks for the day were Rosemary caramel Black tea with Paris Brest. Amazing and great value. 
Will definitely be back :)"
33,bosie-new-york,2018-03-25,5.0,"By far my favorite tea shop in the city. $66 tea for 2 people is an awesome price, and you get your money's worth of delicious tea and pastries.

The tea menu is extensive, with options I haven't seen before. We tried chocolate hazelnut and almond with caramel and absolutely loved them. Food wise, the scones steal the show. They were warm, buttery and melt in your mouth good. Also really liked the lemon macaroon and chicken curry sandwich."
33,bosie-new-york,2018-03-20,4.0,"Mommy daughters tea party is a quintessential NY experience for me. We chose Bosie for all the good reviews on Yelp and were not disappointed!

The tea service for 2 was $66  ( reasonable by NY standards). Each person could pick one tea, some sandwiches and macaroons. Scones with clotted cream and jam and Tea cakes, cookies are standard.
While I enjoyed all the sandwiches and cookies, the scones are the stars here.Served warm, fresh and yummy!
We added an order of Darjeeling tart which had a hint of tea flavor- loved it. 
Taking off 1/2 star for lack of interesting China and not so quaint ambiance.
Must say the selection of teas, pastries and macaroons makes this my favorite tea place yet!

Overall-4.5"
33,bosie-new-york,2019-04-16,3.0,"Had some time to kill before picking up a rental car just down the road.  Stopped in to try some tea.  Place is definitely popular, we grabbed a couple of bar seats but the rest of the place was full.  We had a matcha tea, matcha tea latte and an almond croissant.  Teas were good, as was the croissant.  I would try it again for proper tea service if back in the area."
33,bosie-new-york,2018-02-05,5.0,"Tucked away in one of those confusing but adorable West Village alleys is this gem. Although it seems like the portions are dainty, and you won't be full from ""tea and biscuits"", that's just simply not the case. I would advise you come not ravenous, but with an appetite. 

A few food things really worth getting here (basically all the things we ordered):

-FRENCH TOAST!!!!!! Probably the best French toast I've had to date. Three slices of brioche cooked in a lightly sweetened, vanilla studded custard served with fresh blueberries and strawberries. It's soft but not soggy- and you don't feel heavy or gross after eating it. You really don't need the maple syrup. We ordered it pre-fixe and it was accompanied with a lovely almond croissant, pot of tea, and orange juice.

-Salmon Benedict (butchering the name)- the eggs were poached beautifully, and I loved the fresh and lemony, tossed arugula it came with. Again, this was ordered pre-fixe and it came with a fresh chocolate croissant, pot of tea, and elderflower sparkling thing. 

-Tea tower, I guess you really can't come here without getting this. For starters, it's absolutely beautiful to look at. The scones, for me, surprisingly stole the show. They were warm, tender but with a loose crumb, and a served with clotted cream and strawberry preserves. 

I came with two others, and we actually ended up packing up half the tea tower to go. 

I don't think I need to mention this, but they have a kick ass selection of teas. And you can purchase them as well. ($6 for a small tin- a great souvenir for someone who's visiting NYC!) 

Additionally, I've been here previously and had some pastries. They are on the same level as Lauduree (though eerily similar).. so if you're feeling indulgent, be sure to finish off your carb-heavy tea sesh with one of those."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-06-18,4.0,I came to this shop on a rainy day and thoroughly enjoyed it. The rustic feel of the shop and the calm music in the background made me feel so relaxed. I hope to come again and drink another cup of Kyoto rose tea and taste another bite of the cucumber sandwich.
33,bosie-new-york,2018-09-27,1.0,"While the Afternoon tea was great and the food was alright for such a location, what really bothered me was that the waitress straight up lied to us about getting our teapots refilled after we finished it. 

We weren't asking for a new flavors but asking for more water since we were a group of 8 people and everyone wanted to try everyone else's teas. 

So when our pots became empty the waitress came back to us saying oh you cannot get a refill on your tea at all and it will cost extra. When in the beginning we specifically asked her can we get FREE refills once we run out of water and she stated few times yes and that we cannot change flavors.

Welp maybe if you come here alone and want one single small pot serving of tea this is the place for you... otherwise don't come as a group and beware of lying staff."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-09-10,4.0,"Great place if you're going for a British afternoon tea feel. They offer multiple tier snack plates and a wide variety of teas. They offer both small tea pots and large. Not really a great place if you're hungry. All snacks are pretty small, even for their dinner plates"
33,bosie-new-york,2018-01-12,4.0,"Neat little afternoon tea place, actually...it covers all kinds of meals. They have brunch, dessert, a bar (mostly wine), and it opens until 10pm. You don't see that often but hey, you can get a cup of tea anytime of the day as you wish! The main downside of the restaurant is it's a bit small. The bar can sit 6 people and there is about 6 tables total with only 2 4-people tables (obviously can be moved around for bigger party) You can only make a reservation for a bigger party, of 6 or more. So I recommend you going in with no more than 4 people. 

Four of us ordered a Bosie Tea Service for Two ($66) and 2 more pastries. We were all planning to eat a big dinner so the portions were pretty good. The sandwiches filled us up. They have six kinds and you have the choice of trying all 6 or pick the same flavor more than once - flexible. The scones were really delicious with the jams. They were made fresh because they fell apart when you cut into them. The macarons were okay, nothing special but they do offer many flavors (they pick the flavors for your Tea Service). 

The pastries we ordered aside from the Tea Service for two stood out much more: earl grey mille crepe was really creamy and if love earl grey, you would enjoy it. It's probably one of their popular pastries to try. Personally, the winner went to the Darjeeling tart. But between the four girls, it was 50/50 for the two pastries. The Darjeeling tart had a full, solid taste of the black tea. That flavor just couldn't get off my pallet. It's almost like you are drinking a cup of Darjeeling. The only comment for the piece was the bottom crust of the tart was a bit hard, too crunchy, not preferred to all the 4 of us."
33,bosie-new-york,2020-01-14,4.0,"Charming little high tea cafe with scrumptious scones, freshly in house made cream and jam. Vast variety of teas. Make sure you get here early because they do run out of scones by 3pm. Can't wait to visit again."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-04-21,4.0,"Quality afternoon tea experience that doesn't break the bank. Extensive tea selection. Their scones are probably the best I've had in quite a while, like the ultimate buttery smell and texture of shortbread wrapped in a little warm pocket. Also very good cream and jam. Standard tea sandwiches, nothing too special. Cookies and madeleine are below average to be honest, macaroons are way too sweet. I was actually considering giving it a 3 star since no free refill of the tea... seriously?"
33,bosie-new-york,2018-11-04,3.0,"I was so excited to come here! My friends and I came after work for some tea. They have a huge extensive tea menu and a pot of tea is pretty reasonable. We started getting hungry so we decided to munch on a few things before heading to dinner. We ordered the earl grey crepe cake and the 3-cheese plate. Tiny must be a theme with the food because both items we received were very small portions. The earl grey crepe cake was delicious, but again, wish I had more of it. The cheese plate was just so small. It wouldn't even fill a rabbit! We each had like two bites and the plate was done. I recommend coming here for tea, but definitely not food."
33,bosie-new-york,2017-11-23,2.0,"Cute environment that's ideal for hosting private events. The food and service could be better. Value wise, for hi tea lovers, it's a must try but honestly not worth the value. 

When I came in, I asked for a table for two. The waitress offered me the bar instead of telling me how long for a table for two. Then another party of two came in and I watched as she sat them at a table. Keep in mind no reservations, then during the time I was there. I watched her give other parties tables. Not worth the 20 percent tip I gave her. I found her to be rude.

Anyways, I wanted to leave but decided to give it a chance since I was meeting a friend here. 

My friend and I did the tea for two. I got the salmon sandwich, chicken sandwich and crab sandwich. Daejing tea and earl grey macaroon along with a pot of cherry green tea. 

Chicken sandwich- I like the curry flavors, just not fond of finding a chicken bone fragment in there

The salmon sandwich - the bread was dry and awful. 

Crab sandwich - was too salty 

the macaroons were most redeeming part of the service. 

I will not be returning again."
33,bosie-new-york,2019-02-12,5.0,"Highly recommend Bosie Tea Parlor! I came here last week with a friend and can't wait to go again.

We had the Bosie Tea Service for two during a weekday afternoon. Very cute and affordable for afternoon tea!

I chose the Jiangsu Jasmine Green for tea, 1 Earl Grey Milk Chocolate & 1 Salted Caramel for macarons, and 1 Chicken & 1 Salmon & 1 Cucumber for sandwich choices. Absolutely loved everything!

I was also very happy with the service. My friend was running a bit late, but I was able to sit at a table and browse through the menu before she arrived. We were also unable to finish all the baked goods because we were too full, so we were given little baggies to pack up the rest to go! Really appreciated that."
33,bosie-new-york,2018-10-22,5.0,Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. We had to wait a little bit to be seated but so worth it! The Prix fix brunch hit the spot.
33,bosie-new-york,2018-08-28,5.0,"Boise Tea Parlor is everything you can want in a tea room. It is quaint, spacious, affordable, and serves a wide selection of teas. The staff is helpful and would never rush you. A great place to have a quiet day with your friend(s) and chat with some tea.

I've also tried their Chef's tea service. It was absolutely delicious and beautiful. You do have to book 48 hours in advance (Any other tea service is not required) but they will gladly accommodate you. This will always be my go to tea room. I really wish you can find a tea room like this in Brooklyn. 

Downside: Because they give their customers such a wonderful experience, those on the waiting list cannot wait in the parlor. This place gets very packed and you have to search elsewhere to wait for a seat."
33,bosie-new-york,2018-11-20,2.0,"This place is alright for their huge selection of teas and plenty sweets to choose. However, the portions are really small and the sandwiches were not good.

34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,"This is a neighborhood gem not a lot of people know about! I found this bakery walking around and decided too stroll in to check it out - which ended up being a great decision.

There is a variety of pastries available at this bakery, but I went with a Matcha Crepe and Matcha Latte, which came out to about $11.50, which isn't cheap but I was excepting it.

The matcha crepe was delicious and had a red bean creme filling, which was a great compliment to the soft crepe dough which was springy and had a nice texture. The matcha latte was pretty good, nothing crazy to talk about but it's high quality.

I'll definitely be back again soon!!"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2020-01-01,5.0,"Came in needing a break from the rain and I'm glad I found this gem! My recommendation is their matcha crepe. Their crepe is not overwhelmingly with their crepe and their matcha is not too sweet. They also have a balance in their assuming beans so not every bite has beans but you still get the flavor throughout the crepe. I didn't see the item posted on the board so you might have to tell them you want to try their matcha crepe when you meet them at the stand. 

I also tried their green tea with honey. It's rudimentary and simple but it was really refreshing and the amount of honey was perfect as well."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-12-16,5.0,"I love sweets. I love coffee. I love Takahachi Bakery. The cassis noir..I don't think I'll ever be able to enjoy a peanut butter and jelly without thoughts of how the cassis noir c o m p r e h s i v e l y shattered my nostalgia by trouncing even the premise of a PB&J and dethroning its place in my heart with a robustly distinct and unique mixture of everything I used to enjoy in my youth and then some.

The iced vanilla latte? Just that. Great coffee. Real vanilla. Not some sugary syrup. Not even the watering of the ice could hope to mask its excellence. 

This place is dope. I'm not sure I could realistically want anything else from a cafe. It'll be difficult to find a spot whose love for what they do is as apparent in what they offer. Can't wait to try something else when I'm back 


Update-

New York was an intimidatingly new place for me personally this past April when I started working here. Takahachi Bakery and it's comprehensively wholesome vibes, menu and staff which await anyone who's fortunate enough to find their way to its doors were waiting for me too back then. 

Now nine months later, I find myself promoted and off to work in New Jersey soon enough. The cassis noir has somehow managed to enrich my day even more divinely than the earth shattering moment earlier this year when I bumped back into my old friend PB&J, all grown up. The comforting value of this places' existence can't be overstated in the slightest. I'll be forever grateful for the good times~"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2020-02-22,5.0,"Absolutely delicious. My fiance picked up the Kyoto Matcha Mousse Cake on his way home and it totally made my day. The real matcha from Kyoto is strong but not too powerful. It perfectly blends in with the cream and red bean... It is not overly sweet but just the right amount. It's so yummy...mouth watering. I immediately made a comment when I took my first bite and said, ""It tastes like Japan."" I have a sensitive and picky taste in baked goods and sweets and will generally say it's either too sweet or all tastes the same. But not this one! It is one of a kind. Very unique and worth every penny.
I also tried their baked breads including the tuna croissant and ham and cheese croissant, so buttery and good. I wish I worked in the city or lived closer so I can get it more often. It's very hard to find good Japanese bakeries."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2020-06-04,5.0,"I love this place!!! It's authentic Japanese bakery in the middle of TriBeCa. Their lunch selection is so yummy. Sandwiches, salads, and pastas. All very yummy. Coffee is awesome too. And don't forget to buy their famous white bread to take home, it's unbelievable."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-12-13,4.0,"Longstanding bakery in an area that needs cheaper alternatives for quick meals. Wednesday afternoon, only a small line for the lunch crowd, which the bountiful staff kept moving.

After the rave reviews, had to go for the Matcha Crepe and a small Latte ($9ish altogether). Food comes out incredibly quickly, while the coffee came out shortly afterwards. Crepe is smaller than anticipated, as well as freezing cold (I assume they make a lot of these and keep them in the fridge). That being said, the pastry is soft and the filling hits just the right amount of sweetness. It felt like I was biting into a soft cannoli (in a good way). Coffee is your standard fare.

Like the options they have here; with even more pastries than similar Asian bakeries. Definitely warrants a return visit."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-11-15,5.0,"Okay, the matcha crepe - while not what I expected since it was in the shape of a burrito - was seriously killer awesome.  It was close to closing time so it was really sold out of a lot of items, but the atmosphere was cozy, right in Tribeca, a great walking distance (when it's not freezing) from my house.

Matcha Crepe (burrito):
PROS
- great quantity but NOT shareable -- it's too good! 
- not too much cream: this makes or breaks the crepe to be honest
- not too sweet with adzuki bean paste: I'm not the biggest fan of this paste, but the amount that they put in it was just the nicest balance.
CONS:
- if you do not like matcha, this is not for you -- it's dusted moderately with fresh matcha powder.  I LOVE match so this was perfectly fine with me.  

I will DEFINITELY be back, and I really want to try the cakes and pastries!  I'm going to Japan for two weeks in two weeks and I definitely want to compare.  My memory from 2 years ago is pretty hazy but this place seemed as close as I could find to a Japanese bakery in Japan."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2020-02-02,4.0,"I came here with a couple friends recently. We were able to grab one of the tables in the back (there is a decent amount of seating). We tried the green tea crepe and one of their buns (I think we got the red bean filled one but I don't really remember). The green tea crepe was quite good - really thin and enough matcha flavor, even if I didn't love all the whipped cream in it. The bun was just meh. I also got an iced yuzu tea and loved it. I would come back!"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2020-04-19,5.0,My favorite bakery in Tribeca with Japanese influence. Love the buns and the small lunches to go when you don't want to eat a fancy Tribeca meal. Great place to sit if you need a bit of rest. Love their matcha lattes!
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-08-13,4.0,"Don't come here for the bread.

Come here for the pastries, especially the cakes. The cakes are nice with that homemade feeling. 

Strawberry mille crepe- the dry cake layer at the bottom was unnecessary since it made the crepe cake drier than it should be. The strawberry paste had a nice strawberry taste and I really liked that it was made with real strawberry bits 

Matcha crepe with red bean cream- this is the real standout!! The matcha crepe was not bitter and was cool and refreshing on the palate in conjunction with the lightness of the dollop of red bean cream in the roll. The cream did not have a super pronounced red bean flavor but it was just enough to give that perfect zen feeling. This is a MUST try!!

Strawberry shortcake- nice and light on the palate

Matcha latte- tastes better when it's hot and made with regular milk and less sugar. So good and the matcha is a pretty good quality one: nice vibrant green color and grassy taste."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-07-02,5.0,"Best Matcha Cake in NYC!

If you are looking for a change from the matcha crepe cakes, this is definitely one of the best matcha cakes I have ever had. The signature Kyoto Matcha Mousse Cake is the perfect combination of matcha and mousse without being overly sweet or overpowering and a bit of texture from the pieces of red bean throughout. I am not a huge dessert person, so I am always looking for a different birthday cake from the norm and this is it. Reasonably priced for a cake (only $32)!

Will definitely be adding this to the rotation of birthday cakes or for any matcha lover!"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-09-11,4.0,"Adorable. I popped in on my way to the Path around 5:30pm so there were just a few left of each item. I snagged the mochi en pan and the sweet red bean bun. Delightful. It looks like a calm place (at least when I was there) clean. A bit hidden by the ever-present scaffolding in NYC, but it's there! 
The drinks menu also looked good but alas, no time. 
There was a sign stating they only take Visa if you pay by cc so all you haters with the AmEx can leave your snide at home."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-12-29,4.0,"My boyfriend and I stopped in here this past weekend in search of a yummy dessert. Pleasantly surprised!! We had the truffle cake, lattes with almond milk, a ginger cookie, and the matcha crepe. Everything was excellent. The ginger cookie had a warm ginger flavor and spice. It was a soft cookie, my favorite! The truffle cake was delicious and fluffy. The cocoa powder on top was a nice touch. The matcha crepe was light and creamy. The matcha had a great green tea flavor. Highly recommend everything we tried!! It's a little on the pricey side, but worth it."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-11-09,4.0,"I love Japanese pastries and bread in general and this place definitely does not disappoint. I know everyone raves about the matcha crepe with red bean cream but I personally didn't think it was all that special? However I really enjoyed all the bread and buns that they have in there. I really like all the different tuna filled buns that they have and the ones with sweet cream and red bean inside. Price is slightly higher but I don't mind paying a bit more for delicious and higher quality baked items. 

Service is always quick and friendly."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-10-08,4.0,"The Matcha crepe is interesting. It's similar to a mocha roll (obviously not the flavor) but the texture. But it's much thinner. Sort of like a thin pancake layered with cream then wrapped into what looks like a wrap. It's light and airy, not too sweet and not at all heavy. It was something different and I'm all about that! Dessert in different and unique ways..can't beat that."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-06-15,3.0,"Nice little Japanese Bakery with great bread. My pro tip for you is to come early in the morning to snag items on sale in the sale basket, which bundles an assortment of breads, buns, and pastries for a cheaper price.  

For $4.75, I was able to try popular items. Overall, Takahachi is very subtle with flavors.  

- The wasabi bun was oily on top but had a manageable wasabi flavor, quite unique!
- Black sesame loaf had a disappointingly weak hint of black sesame
- Chocolate baguette was my favorite.  It wasn't overwhelmingly powerful in flavor, the chew was good. 
- I also tried the much raved about white bread (also known as milk bread) with its soft texture and crisp edges. Bring it home, toast it, and smear some butter with drizzled honey and sprinkle of salt. Perfection!

The staff is a bit unhelpful. They won't toast anything for you, they charge 25 cents if you ask for some butter, and when I asked if they had their milk bread (also known as white bread), the guy at the counter said it was only available Monday, Wednesday, and Friday..  Well, that's incorrect because white bread is sold everyday??"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2020-05-17,4.0,Plenty of delicious Japanese pastries to choose from. You can also see the bakers at work.
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2020-02-07,5.0,"Wow what a hidden gem (maybe it's not hidden, maybe I just never come downtown...) Anyway, they have a really nice selection of both sweet and savory items and the prices are super reasonable. The soba noodle salad was nice but has a lot of dressing on it. The matcha crepe was also rich but super unique and had great flavor. The winner for me was the miso almond cookie. Super sophisticated and nuanced flavor, perfect texture, would be great with tea. If I was in  the area I'd come back!"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-05-11,5.0,"A petite Japanese bakery shop. The glass between the kitchen and the shop is transparent so you can see what's going on in the kitchen--and I noticed that most of the bakers are dedicated Asian women :-)
My matcha brûlée was freshly made with caramelized sugar by one of the women bakers and it was so good! There was this nice balance between the flavor of matcha and creaminess and it was the right amount of sweetness. 
The famous matcha crepe was wrapped in a newspaper style parchment paper. It was so soft and sweet, just like on the cloud...
We also enjoyed their danish toast, pineapple bun, and matcha brioche. The coffee was pretty good. My least favorite is the matcha latte, it was too heavy in matcha which made the drink kind of bitter!
Overall, you would not be disappointed by most of the items in the store. But their matcha series cakes definitely worth a special trip!"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-11-01,3.0,"Ehhh..your typical bakery. Nothing was too impressive for me. I came to get their signature cake but after waiting for a long time, was told they were out and not making it for the rest of the day.

Got the usual pastries..but agin nothing significant to make me want to come back."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-02-09,5.0,"Came here for the green tea crepe, and it did not disappoint!  It was so soft, and I loved that it wasn't too sweet.  Our group got a variety of drinks and pastries, and we loved everything!

34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-02-01,4.0,"Bookmarked for a while and finally was able to haul some pastries ;)

Sweet lady at the counter, a few tables at the back, clean bathroom and fresh water provided.

Cod roe + potato + mayo bread
This was okay, because of the cod roe it's more of an acquired taste. I like cod roe in general, but this was just okay for me. Potato was definitely pronounced. Bread itself was soft but still had density, but the not a fan of the combo.

Mochi an pan
One of their famous offerings. This was good, but not great. The red bean provided some sweetness, mochi some texture.

Cream cheese + custard 
The bread looked like a flying saucer as the middle was puffy :) but inside was delicious goodness. Rich and creamy and yet not overly sweet, the bread had some chew to it reminds me a little of pie crust. 

They also have a lemon cream one which I will be trying next time :)

Matcha crepe $5.50
This may be their most famous offering and yes the hype is real! Fluffy crepe wrapped around a light and slightly sweet cream and red beans, perfectly tempered by the bitterness of the matcha. This is a great dessert!!

Matcha latte $4
One of the better matcha lattes I've tried! It's not overly milky nor overly bitter. The flavors were blended well. Not sure if they already include a sweetener as I tasted some sweetness, but it was a great latte. Worth it."

I have tried their almond croissant, coffee swiss roll, matcha swiss roll. They were all very delicious. My friend really like their coffee. 
They serve Lunch sandwiches and soups as well. 

Seating Area is quite small but I got the table whenever I visited.

Price - affordable
Ambience - cool
Staff - Friendly

I want to try their chocolate mousse which looks absolutely stunning. 

One thing to worry if you have Amex - they dont take Amex cards."

It was just sweet enough without being over-sweetened. The red bean filling was delicious. I think it would taste even better if it was warm and freshly-made. Aside from this, the shop had a lot of other bakery items. Friendly staff and there were enough chairs and tables to sit several groups of 4."

While I've had a hit-or-miss with other products, these two have been consistently great and I occasionally make a trek downtown for them. 

On the other hand, the iced peach green tea tasted gross, so definitely do not get it. You're better off getting the iced tea lemonade at Starbucks."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2018-12-08,5.0,"Was on a mission to try as many of their cakes as possible. I've noticed that there's more options in the afternoon versus noon and I went at 4pm 

Overall I have to praise that Takahachi flavors are subtle yet have depth. Love them!! 

Cassis noir 
Cassis is actually black currant. The base feels interesting, not exactly cake. It tastes like it's made with coco butter, kinda wet. Between the black currant mousse and cake case there's a creamy layer which I'm thinking is also coco butter. 
This combination is very interesting, refreshing without being tart and overpowering and the coco butter base grounds the flavor

Opera 
It's a coffee chocolate (mocha?) cake. It's not a hunk of chocolate but still has strong flavors. The layers make it less of a ""mouthful"". I like how the coffee is not overpowering. There's no stinky coffee breath afterwards.  
When I ate half of it two days later the chocolate taste came out stronger. Maybe the the coffee evaporated or oxidized after some time. 

Matcha mousse 
There's so many layers to this: the pudding on the top, the matcha cream on top, the matcha mousse in middle, the cream mousse in center, almond flour cake base. The pudding and cream center is relatively sweeter like white chocolate type of sweet, but I'm ok with that. I appreciate how many components are in this tiny cake. 

Matcha burrito
This is a simple dessert, just rolling up matcha crepe in red bean cream, yet it is so satisfying. The bitterness of the crepes along with the thick layer of cream makes each bite a mouthful, and I love that feeling of stuffing my face. If I was eating this myself, I would love to munch on it like a burrito instead of being civilized with a knife and fork. 


Cheesecake
The bottom is more smooth like cheesecake while the top is more cakey like sponge cake. Not special. 

Strawberry shortcake 
This is such a simple cake yet they make it SO WELL!! The cream is super milky and fluffy. The strawberry is super fresh, not too sweet not too sour, and it's not even in season. The cake base is as fluffy as it needs to be!!

Eclair
Maybe because it wasn't eaten immediately after buying but it got a bit soft. The cream is hazelnut 


Also got buns!!

Melon pan 
I like the smell of it but I have to admit i like the HK pineapple bun more than this. It amused me seeing various colors and brown level of each one

Green bean $2.25 
I like how the outside is brown to the taste of like white bread. Tbh idk why people don't like crust, I like the brown flavor. 
The green bean itself is so interesting. The texture reminds of of lotus paste in mooncake, but it's not sweet at all. Also love how much filling is inside. Each bite has plenty of bean paste. 

White bean walnut $2.25 
Idk what white bean is hahaha but it has the same texture as the green bean paste minus the green bean taste"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2018-12-17,4.0,"Visited this nice cafe after a lengthy walk along the Brooklyn bridge. Wanted to find a place to sit comfortably and just rest my tired legs. The bonus is that they have a clean restroom which is tough to find in  Manhattan. 

They have a good selection of drinks here. I ordered the matcha latte and it was bomb! I have been always a fan of matcha so I have what I consider a ""matcha intuition"" and this cafe passed the test haha... The latte did not overpower the matcha taste and it was a good blend. You could taste the subtle bitterness of the matcha as well...

Ultimately, this cafe is cozy for a 30 minute sit down while sipping on a hot beverage. It's a good place to do work too but I don't think there are power outlets."

We bought the last cheese cake and a few others like the matcha/red bean crepe, strawberry cake, and raspberry cake (forgot the actual names). The matcha red bean combination was interesting, but I would not be ordering it again."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-06-27,2.0,"I was excited for a Japanese bakery nearby especially in the downtown area. Unfortunately, the hype for this bakery falls short in terms of expectation. I do love that there's a weekly schedule for daily baked fresh bread. There are different flavors available depending on the day of the week. I haven't tried it so I can't say if the quality and consistency is good.

I visited on a Saturday evening right before they were closing. Unfortunately, the staff did not appear friendly or helpful. Not sure if it was towards closing or they were ready to end the day. I had to approach one of the cashiers to ask if they had the Japanese strawberry shortcakeイチゴのショートケーキ available. Fortunately, they were baking a fresh batch in the kitchen. She asked to wait a few minutes. While I was waiting, Hub picked up an assortment bag of pastries. The label was noted only available on weekends. It was filled with a mini croissant, hot dog bun, and melon pan bun. It was ok. Nothing that resembled even remotely close to what you get at an authentic Japanese bakery or even Japanese standard. I was expecting a somewhat similar quality. 

The most disappointing of all was the actual cake! Japanese strawberry shortcake main centerpiece is the sponge cake itself. It gives an airy and light texture. This was not the case with Takahachi. Sadly, their version uses the ""boxed"" American cake batter. Their only saving grace was the whipped cream and fresh strawberries. 

Unfortunately, without the proper cake texture, it just ruined the highlight of a traditional Japanese dessert. It felt dense and heavy instead of the moist and airy feel of the cake. 

It was not worth the visit. Also, the poor service and unauthentic quality of the baked goods attributed to the two stars."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-05-26,3.0,"Quality has gone down or came on an off day. Their green tea crepe cake doesn't have enough cream-red bean filling and has become visibly skinnier. Strawberry Mille crepe was quite bland. Really hoping that it's a one time, off day as I love this place and recommend it to friends/family who come to visit."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2018-10-21,4.0,"Cute and quaint bakery with Asian style desserts near the subway. The sweetness level doesn't overwhelm my palate, but flavors are more subdued.

Japanese cheesecake - Moderately sweet, vanilla, texture is lighter than an NY style cheese but not as airy or souffle-like as those I had in Japan. Pleasant, but overall unremarkable.
Green tea rolled crepe cake - Lots of matcha flavor, a light texture, moist, subtle cream and red bean. I could eat the entire thing, not feel bad because of how light it sits (but probably lots of calories anyways) It's half the price of a Lady M cake, and while not as delicate in consistency and texture, just as if not more tasty - the red bean is an interesting touch!
Red bean bun - Heavier than the cakes, a sizable portion with a dense, sweet but not terribly so filling."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-09-10,5.0,"Thank you Takahachi! You making my early mornings so much better. 
Always great coffee and delicious croissants."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-04-11,5.0,"This place is great for a light lunch and/or the pastries. The Kyoto match moose is my absolute favorite I always get it; so far, for the last three years it was my birthday cake. The matcha crepe roll is a must have too. I also really like the strawberry shortcake and their selection of French macaroons are great. 

They have salads with delicious dressing that's perfect every time. They also have cold already prepared sandwiches, as well as my favorite hot beef teriyaki sandwich that's absolutely yummy. It also comes with a side that changes. The ham and cheese croissant and the beef frank are both spectacular. You can't go wrong with with the ham and scallion or well anything for that mater. I've tried a lot of stuff here and I've had and had a bad experience.

So I wish there matcha lattes were a bit better. Not the biggest fan of their matcha powder they use for their lattes. 

The staff are all really nice. There's even a window so you can see the chefs creating their beautiful pastries. Or if you prefer you can watch their mini- TV and enjoy the seasonal chalk drawings on their walls. The space is a bit small, but it's quaint and comfortable."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-05-24,3.0,"Came here on a Friday afternoon with my dear friend for some dessert. I've heard a lot about their matcha crepe so I was dying to try it as the combination of azuki/red bean and matcha is a golden combination. I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed.

The matcha crepe was definitely tinier then I expected - it was probably a bit larger than the size of my hand (but yay for me because that means I have more space for more desserts!). 
Overall taste though was alright. The filling is a bit sweeter than I would've preferred and the amount of red beans in it wasn't enough for me. But otherwise the crepe was wonderfully cooked and there was a good amount of matcha powder there to really being our the matcha flavor.


I also got their Sweet Lemon Cream Puff Bread as it looked hella appealing. The first thing I noticed though was that the bread was pretty burnt on the outer crust, which was really disappointing as it definitely affected the taste. The texture was great as well as the filling. The filling was very tangy of lemony flavor and was very silky and smooth. But the burntness of the bread really affected my overall experience and I hope this doesn't happen again.

I'd be down to give this place another try once they start taking better care of their pastries! But in the meantime, Takahachi has lots to improve upon."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-12-13,4.0,"This is the place we always go to for birthday cakes and desserts. It's our go-to neighbourhood bakery and we've been coming here for nearly 10 years. Their matcha crepes are just sweet enough with the fresh cream and azuki beans, a nice change from the cakes at Lady M down at WTC. We always order their matcha mousse cakes, though recently, we have branched out to their opera cake and strawberry shortcakes. The opera cake is good if you prefer lots of chocolate while the strawberry shortcake is light and fluffy with lots of fresh strawberries. The cakes are made fresh, so you can't just pick up a whole cake. The buns are good too, but they are a bit more expensive than Chinatown bakeries that aren't too far away. If you eat in, you can watch the bakers make the goodies through the giant window into the kitchen."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-12-05,4.0,Cute little bakery by Brooklyn bridge in Manhattan. Has a few seats and the staff is nice. There's not as many bread options but their desserts are good. I tried the matcha crepe and it was good! Not too sweet and the cream wasn't over filled. I also had one of their drinks and it was made well with the right amount of matcha where it wasn't too watery or over powering with matcha. I'm in the area often because my dance studio is nearby and I'll definitely come by again!
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-05-06,4.0,"Really delicious matcha mousse cake. I called ahead the day of to see which cakes were available. The lady was very helpful, she said that if I went in an hour, they could make the matcha mousse cake for me -- it was delicious and they birthday girl enjoyed it ! I'll be back to order the strawberry short cake next time. I thought the pricing was also reasonable for the city as well, I believe I paid 34 for the cake."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-05-22,4.0,"I loved the matcha crepes. It's one of the desserts to go to. However, my experience today was not as good. It's smaller than usual and the filing is lesser. Hence, it's not as satisfying as before. I'm not sure if they are cutting on the filing or because it's done by someone inexperienced. Hence, it's-1 star."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2018-10-23,4.0,"It's been a while since I came here.

Overall I really like this place, I like the simplicity interior design, good enough seating area and also a restroom. 

I've came here many years ago, tried their matcha crepe wrap, matcha creme brûlée, buns and macaroons! Everything is so good, not too sweet and very fresh. 

I came here around 3pm basically all their cakes, macaroons are pretty much sold out. But they still have a good amount of buns and savory food left. 

Some things never change, there's always that one employee with a attitude of what you want and a friendly one. Also some things never changed is their ""Mochi ah pan"" $2.50 basically a red bean bun, also have a few bits of Mochi inside ;0 and a dust of the matcha powder. It's so delicious regretting why I only bought one! It was super fresh because when I ate it the bread still have a little crisp and it's warm! So many texture but it all work so well together. 

I also got a iced matcha latte $5.00, first sip is so good the continuous on the drink was just okay :)"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-04-07,5.0,"Have gotten two cakes from this bakery, always deliver great customer service and high quality cakes :)

Recently got the strawberry shortcake and previously tried the Kyoto matcha cake. Both were beautifully made and tasted great :) my personal favorite was the Kyoto matcha cake"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-10-06,4.0,"3.5 stars. Given how tough it can be to find good eats around World Trade Memorial, my friend and I were pleasantly surprised to come across Takahachi Bakery. The spot is a small Japanese bakery with homey vibes and a good amount of seating. A variety of small bites, salads, and baked goods are available on their menu. My friend and I grabbed several pre-packaged items and tried the Matcha crepe with red bean cream that we saw other Yelpers rave about. It was great! Light and not too sweet, but still matcha-licious. Only complaint is that the actual crepe ended up being a lot smaller than I expected. All in all, I don't think Takahachi is somewhere worth trekking downtown for. However, would definitely recommend checking it out if you happen to be in the area!"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-11-20,4.0,Came here to the the matcha crepe and it was delicious. The filling is delicious and not too sweet. This would pair perfect with a coffee or warm beverage. The service was friendly and quick. It may look small in the box but it's definitely just the right amount and satisfying. They had abundance of other Japanese pastries and breads that are moderately priced.
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2018-11-05,4.0,"I work in the neighborhood and this is one of my go-to places. I love Asian bakeries because of the measured sweetness of their creation, and Takahachi is no exception.

They excel in pastries: matcha creme brulee, the signature matcha wrap, mango mousse, yuzu mousse, opera cake- everything has such a refined and artistic touch. You can see the bakers working just beside the sitting area, and they're so quietly graceful.

The coffee products aren't too good, the matcha can be too light for some people. The savory stuff are just okay. But seriously, if you're having a hard day, just go there and get something sweet. Instant inner peace :)"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-03-27,4.0,"Cute small Japanese bakery in NYC. 

I tried some of their pastries and they were delicious. I love the almond paste. 

Matcha crepes were delish and everything they have in matcha are my favorite. 

There hot lattes are good!

34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-04-28,5.0,"This is such a cute bakery! It's very hidden though so if you're walking you definitely wouldn't notice. 

They have a great weekend sampler for $6 which has like 5/6 different pastries -- great for families! 

I also got a green tea mousse to go and a cheesecake and it was delicious one of the best I've had! 

I can't wait to come back and try more desserts. This place was clean, spacious and authentic. If you love asian bakeries this place is for you!!"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-03-12,3.0,"Cute and spacious bakery with a variety of baked goods and buns. We got the mango custard bun and melon pan around lunch time. Unfortunately, both buns were cold. Keeping to the original, the melon pan does not have any melon in it, it's a sweet and crunchy topping spread on a bun. While the bun tasted great, the fact that it was cold was off putting. The mango custard bun did not have mango or custard coming through in flavor and we would not recommend it. Maybe we went at an off time or an off day."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-03-24,5.0,"This is a cute Japanese bakery with a nice selection of both desserts (cake slices, crème brûlée, crêpe, etc), breads, cold salads, sandwiches, and take home bread and cookies. 

They have a lot of matcha on the menu - both drinks to dessert, so yay for being healthy! 

We went around 3pm and there was a limited selection of dessert, but luckily got to try the matcha crème brûlée, which was yummy. It had a mousse-like consistency instead of the traditional brûlée consistency so that was special. 

My mom had the matcha crêpe and it was quite satisfying for the sweet tooth. I get why a lot of people post about this."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2018-08-14,4.0,"So good. This place really speaks to the chub chub in me. Deftly Japanese flavor tinged French pastries, fresh and tasty.  They manage to make a lot of premade hot foods like breakfast and lunch but prepared in a way or using a material that doesn't go bad quickly.  An example are there awesome egg sandwiches they use this nice brioche which seems to absorb the cheesey eggy goodness and not get soggy. 

I like their lunch cute lunch specials as well when one is not in the mood for a big lunch and their pastries are terrific."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-04-17,4.0,"This is a great place to grab a quick bite and to satisfy your sweet tooth.
I had the green tea crepe and Yuzu tea. The crepe has a nice dusting of match powder on the outside, while the crepe itself was light and had a slightly chewy texture, but still maintained a nice soft texture. The crepe was filled with a generous about of whipped cream and red beans. I could have done with even a little less whipped cream as I felt that there was a little too much whipped cream. I could have definitely ate more than one, as the portion is a little on the smaller size. Not overly sweet.
Tea had nice flavor."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2018-08-08,4.0,"Why didn't I come here sooner?! It's right outside of the Park Place/Chambers Street subway station and the perfect place to pick up a quick breakfast.

When I first walked in all I saw were loaves of bread and a sale basket with some bread too...until I turned around and saw a wide assortment of different types of pan! I may have ordered six different types of buns in one go...

-Mochi an pan: it is definitely better if it's freshly eaten! Better yet, I managed to pick some up as a farewell gift for my workplace and it was still warm when I bought them! The cashier was nice enough to pack them each into their own individual plastic bags after I asked her to! I like the chewiness of the mochi and that the red bean paste wasn't too sweet.

-Red bean pan: to be honest...I don't even remember asking to buy this pan. So since I've had red bean buns before this one wasn't too memorable

-Lemon pan: it's like lemon jam bun. It was a little bit sweeter than I expected but it was still good. I loved the crunchiness of the sides and that the shape of the bun kind of reminded me of a turtle. My favorite one of the bunch.

-Mango pan, banana cream pan: Not that sweet which is how I like my pans but flavor-wise these weren't that strong. The mango one especially I could hardly taste the mango flavor.

Shout out to the awesome cashier who helped me pack my mochi an pans in individual baggies because I had to gift them to my coworkers!"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-02-16,4.0,"Takahachi Japanese bakery is a great find in the area. Everyone must get the green tea crepe. The matcha crepe has a red bean whipped cream filling, which is nice and delicate, not too sweet or overwhelming.  It's their signature dessert, so it's a must have! I've also had their yule log cakes (during holidays) and matcha roll cakes, which are also quite delicious. 

Not only can you get desserts and baked goods here, but you can also get a variety of their salads including their classic seaweed and hijiki salads, sandwiches and other prepared food.

And don't forget to get their matcha lattes - they are made perfectly! The hot is comforting and iced is refreshing. It's just about the right amount of matcha and light sweetness to it, without the bitterness. Yes, this is a haven for you matcha  lovers!"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-02-06,5.0,"I loved the matcha products here. Prices were reasonable and the place was very clean. Matcha crepe with red bean paste was the best. There was a lot of loose matcha powder sprinkled on top of it. It was very flavorful. Kyoto matcha mousse was also really good. Matcha latte came very hot. It had a lot of matcha in it too, which was what I wanted. I did not try not matcha stuff, but it looked good."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-11-23,4.0,The matcha crepe was nice and fluffy. It wasn't too creamy. The portion size was just enough for a quick snack without being too filling that you can't try the other awesome-looking buns in the bakery. Kuromitsu latte is made with black sugar and soybean powder. The taste of the soybean powder is overwhelming so it might take a little getting used to. The use of black sugar in the latte is intriguing because it isn't too sweet and it's not too faint that the coffee becomes bitter.
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-08-13,4.0,"Such a cute Japanese bakery! I came in to meet with a friend, and was surprised at the efficiency of the workers as well as how the food was prepped and laid out to be sold. I ordered an iced matcha latte made with oat milk and it came out to be $6.45 which was quite pricey. I like how there's a huge window that separates the seating area to the kitchen, so you're able to see them freshly making the bakery goods. When I was there, I also saw that there was a basket of baked goods on sale for $2.75. It seemed ironic that a bag filled with 4 bakery goods were cheaper than a drink. I'll definitely be back to try the matcha crepe roll, although I'm a little hesitant because of its sweetness level."
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-01-20,5.0,"This place is still so on point!!!!! I love the cakes here. As a special treat celebration for us two, just picked up small slices so we can have bit of everything again :)"
34,takahachi-bakery-new-york,2019-09-08,4.0,Great asian bakery in NYC. We went late in the day for a coffee and a snack and were not disappointed. Service was fast the the food was good. You can see the bakers on the open kitchen preparing the food which is neat too.
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-04-29,5.0,"Noticed that they are open during quarantine and I sort of needed a doughnut. Theirs are called ""doughyaki's"" a hybrid of creme brûlée and doughnuts. What appears to be on the smaller side, is actually the perfect amount of a very rich and custard doughnut.

The spot, a minimal approach to decor making it an ambience where staff, including Chika are there to provide a home like atmosphere. 

A beautiful wine selection is available and menu offering for a dessert and wine pairing. 

Staff made you feel that you were welcomed to not their home ensuring appropriate playing and preparation for dessert was in place and attentive through our experience. 

Chika we love you !"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-06-03,4.0,"Been wanting to try this place for so long and was finally able to make a reservation for Saturday in the fall at 3pm. The shop was pretty empty when we got there and it looked like a few people managed to get walk in spots but the place is very small and it filled up very quickly. Definitely recommend a reservation if possible.

The entire experience is very unique and while it's pricey, it won't break the bank. It's essentially a small course-meal of just desserts. Everything is extremely elegant and dainty. There's a lot of care and thought put into each plate and it's a very delightful experience that reminds me of a fine dining meal crossed with a light afternoon tea.

For my desserts I got the following:
1) Creme Anglaise with fuji apple sorbet (amuse bouche): In terms of flavors it's like an apple pie a la mode. It hits all the flavors and still retains a richness in its own sense from the creme anglaise but the sorbet gives it a much lighter and fresher taste.

2) Asian Pear Tart Brulee over almond cake and lemon verbana sorbet and cranberry agar agar (main): A beautiful plate full of light flavors that span from fruity to nutty to herbal. The brulee gave the otherwise light dish a wonderful deep caramel flavor while the lemon verbena brightened the whole thing up. Extremely well balanced dish but not something that I was dying for more of.

3) Marshmallow w/ coconut, Chocolate Tart, Pumpkin 5 spice over cake w/ roasted pumpkin seed  (petit four): A nice little end to the meal. As far as flavors go there's nothing that super stuck with me besides the nice bit of extra nuttiness the roasted pumpkin seed gave. A nice edition to the meal but nothing spectacular.

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here. While the desserts didn't necessarily blow me away they were still delicious and a nice elevation of normal sweets. I don't know too many places that do these course-style dessert menus and the price is well worth the collective experience."
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-02-25,4.0,"I've wanted to come to this dessert bar for such a long time, and I'm so glad I did. One thing about me is that I prefer larger portions of food, and I really dislike overpaying for food when it's served in tiny portions, so this is where it lost a star for me since the desserts were incredibly small. For the unique environment and taste though, it's understandable. 

From the service to food, it was all exceptional. The menu is pre-fixe, so you choose desserts and are served additional petit fours. I can't remember the names of the dishes, but I must say, they exceeded my expectations. The tastes were so unique and unlike any other dessert I've tried. Chika and the other chefs worked on each plate with such delicate care, so it was really interesting watching them and how they make their desserts. Just unfortunate that my dish lasted 4-5 bites! 

Don't think I'll be back for awhile, but I do think it's worth the experience!"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-12-31,5.0,"I am so in love with this tiny hidden dessert bar in lower Manhattan. It is a really small french cafe with only a couple bar seats and tables so they only serve a few customers at a time, kinda like dessert omakase. We got a table spot as a party of 4 because all the bar seats were full, so we didnt get to watch the dessert chefs make our desserts. They are only open four days a week in the winter so check their schedule before going. 

Nonetheless, the dessert experience was like no other! The menu price is fixed at $19 per person, where you get to choose an ""entree"" (one dessert item) that comes with an 'amuse-bouche' (appetizer) served before the entree, followed by a petite fours after the entree! Literally fine dining but dessert style. You also have the option for wine pairing for an additional $9. Their menu changes daily so they keep you coming back for more!

We ordered the signature Fromage Blanc Island, the Apple Trifle, the Cappuccino Panna Cotta and the Pecan Tarte. Everything is so careful created in a way that you can taste an amazing blend of flavours in your mouth with every bite! I was most blown away with the Fromage Blanc Island (cheesecake) which is not your typical slice of cheesecake. This one is so soft and light, you need to try it out to know what I mean! 

In one of our petite fours, we had this super light marshmallow coated in cocount flakes that just melted in my mouth. We also had this chocolate bite that was so smooth and flavourful I wish we had more! 

I will definitely come back the next time I am in NYC to see what Chika and her team have created! 10/10 would recommend and worth the $$$"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-08-16,5.0,"I had just come out of a local tapas restaurant with a friend craving some dessert. We browsed the selection, Van Leuwen, a solid choice, a couple of other places, insomnia cookies crossed my minds. But then I stumbled upon ChikaLicious. We rolled the dice and soon enough we were waiting on a line about 6 people deep. We both questioned each other's motives and intent. Did we actually want to stand here and wait for this? Would we be let down? Would there be a quenelle that couldn't satiate our Ice cream hunger!? Lucky for us we stayed and were treated with dare I say one of the best dessert experiences I've had in a long time. 

Getting a seat at the dessert bar is by far the way to go. Watching these artists paint their desserts on the blank canvas of plates is in itself worth the $18.00 price tag of admission. Watching chef Edwin plate a quenelle, for it to slightly melt as he prepared everything else then seeing Madame Chika crack a smirk and replate everything, shows the extremely high level of standards she has for her kitchen. Surgical precision. The conversation with total strangers, mingling with the staff, seeing my friend Natalya finally be excited to be out eating this late was just the pièce de résistance. Everything was opulent and served with such attention to detail. 

Highly recommend this place. Hands down. Come get some dessert and leave amazed and in awe of how a precision dessert bar is run.  

Cash and credit accepted, sit at the bar if you can!"

The desserts weren't to die for but they were good. I can tell lots of time went into prepping it, however it didn't amaze me. 
We had the cheese dessert, apple crumble, and the cheese cake. The chocolate ice cream that accompanied the crumble was delicious."

After walking by this sleek establishment for years, I finally decided to pop on in. To my surprise, we got two seats at the bar immediately. If you can, try to sit there, rather than the tables. If definitely adds to the experience!

Chika is the lovely lady who runs the place, and you get to watch her delicately make your desserts with a passion and attention to detail that is awe inspiring. Yes, this place is very instagram friendly. But I would recommend putting your phone away and really taking in the experience around you. It's that good. 

We split a brown sugar - apple tart platter, which comes with two other small courses.  Every bite was savored, so tasty!! This is an appropriate amount to feed two, without making you feel gross. They do charge an extra $9 to split. 

This place is expensive, but you are paying for a high quality dessert, that is put together by hand. I think it is definitely worth it. If you are looking to blindly pound some sugary calories into your stomach (I'm not judging!), it's best to go elsewhere."

We got a price fixed dessert, which comes in three courses and you pick 1/3 of the desserts. Lovely idea."
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-12-31,5.0,"One of my absolute favorite finds since I moved to NYC. Chika and her team have created such an warm, inviting and intimate space for themselves to just create and share their incredible, delectable confections. 

The concept is a simple, but enticing one... select one (or more) of the seasonal dessert offerings and then sit back as you are treated to a 3-course dessert tasting menu which includes an amuse bouche, your selected ""entree"", and a round of petit fours to finish. 

The menu mostly changes with the seasons, but everything is made fresh and Chika's flavors and meticulous attention to detail are unrivaled. If you can, snag seats at the bar so you can watch the master at work. One mainstay on the menu is the crustless cheesecake, which is unwrapped from its cloth immediately prior to serving and is presented on a tray of crushed ice. Light as a cloud, and with just the correct amount of sweetness - this is a cheesecake to convert even the most staunch of cheesecake haters (which is exactly what happened when my cheesecake-abhorrent friend ended eating like half of mine!). 

Pro tip: Go early (i.e., prior to the post-dinner rush), as the space is small and the line forms quickly!"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-08-07,5.0,"We went to chikalicious dessert bar and did the dessert tasting for my husband's birthday.
We sat at the counter and got to see chef chika preparing the desserts.
We had the butternut squash icecream brulee ajd brown sugar pannacotta.Both of them were delicious.The pannacotta had a nice wiggle to it(this is what happens when you watch lot of masterchef on tv).
Definitely going back when we want to indulge in some amazing desserts and will be taking all the dessert lover friends visiting us in new york."
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-06-30,3.0,"Tiny space full of ambiance and yes, it is perfect for a date, but you do sit really close with other people (at the counter seats) so it might vary for each person. When we were ushered to the counter seats, I was pretty excited because silly me thought that wow, I would actually get to see some cooking/baking action!

Boy . . . was I wrong. What you get to see is the chef plating the desserts. There's no cooking involved. You watch them take out plates, take out cartons of pre-made filling/dessert, and then scoop it out on a plate. Then they hand said plate to you and explain the components. Well, this is no Japanese cook-my-yakisoba-in-front-of-me-experience haha. Which I totally understand, as rolling dough and baking in front of me would've probably kept me there for two hours!

The tasting, for $18, comes with petit fours and you pick an entree. First course was this lime sorbet in a condensed milk. Very refreshing start to the tasting!

Second was the entree course, which I picked panna cotta. THIS alone deserves 5 stars. BEST panna cotta I've ever had. It was soooo rich and so freaking creamy. But it is essentially two scoops of panna cotta. While I enjoyed the star of this plate, the two green scoops of basil and lemongrass ""sorbet"" really ruined the the flavors for me. Unnecessary addition to the panna cotta, and I couldn't eat it together as the flavors were too weird together for me. 

Finally, the remaining petit fours came, and we ended with a bang of sweetness. WAY too sweet. Everything was really soft (especially the marshmallow) and the cookie was super buttery, but these last three things made my teeth cringe. 

I do think it's a bit on the pricier side for something that wasn't all spectacular, but that panna cotta was pretty heavenly. Would I come back again to try something else? Nah, especially because the petit fours weren't that great"

Love the concept. But it's too expensive. I think it's fun to try once or visit for a special occasion (if you have time). It's not a regular place where you quickly grab dessert and leave. It's a whole experience. I had no idea what to expect when I came here. I was a little confused by what was going on when I first walked in. It's a 3 course dessert menu. 

We ordered the cheesecake fromage. It came with lychee sorbet (my fav of the night) and petite fours. I can see the dedication to the presentation and respect the time put into the art. 

However, I just don't think that the desserts were up to par in terms of taste. With the steep price of $20 per set, I could have eaten a 2nd dinner! The cheesecake fromage was placed on top of a bowl of ice. I mean I get that this place is about presentation... but ... I feel like the ice was a waste of time and doesn't really add much to the presentation nor taste of the dish. Unsure about how I feel about coming back. Some of the other things looked interesting though. I also believe there are seasonal things. Maybe I would have enjoyed another plate more."
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2020-01-26,5.0,"I am of the firm opinion that dessert is the best part of the fine dining experience. 

Chikalicious, a cute omakase-style dessert bar run by Chika (for which the bar is named after) and her husband Don, caters to people like me by offering only the dessert portion of a Michelin Star french/American fine dining course for a very reasonable $25.

My favorite thing about Chikalicious is its ambience and that you get to watch professional chefs make such artistically creative desserts. I first learned of this place in 2015, and an experience that still sticks with me to this day is watching one of the dessert chefs peel an orange and chop it into tiny, perfect cubes, and then transfer them into a little tupperware container for mis en place (it is an open kitchen where you watch the chefs prep the food).  There was absolutely zero mess or spill, and the work area was kept so clean. It's almost mesmerizing to watch how so much food can be prepared with zero accumulation of mess.

The shop is very cozy and plays a groovy playlist, and my sister and I were lucky enough to get a counter seat at 9pm on a Saturday evening. 

I ordered the Grapefruit Brulee, which to my surprise was not really a firm egg custard but more like a sabayon draped over the grapefruit, with the top torched for 5-10 seconds. Nevertheless, it worked well and was a very refreshing dessert, with a good mouthfeel from the warm creamy sabayon, the acidy squishiness of the grapefruit, and the smooth, cold grapefruit sorbet on top. This was preceded with an amuse bouche of a bourbon-molasses ice cream on a fruit jam, and was followed up with a petit fours of various sweets. 

Totally worth it, and I will make sure to come back again next time I'm in NYC."
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-27,4.0,"Coming here constitutes splurging. The three-course dessert was not what I expected when our group of four plopped down at the counter corner spontaneously after dinner one day. The bonus before- and after-dessert desserts justify the price point, $19 or so.

It's a whole experience not to be taken lightly, but it's done with oh so much care. The desserts are complex, thoughtful, and fresh. Any time you see high-level chefs dabbing single drops of sauces and tweezer-ing garnishes onto spoonfuls of ice cream, you know you're in for a ride. Every detail is spot-on, from the temperature of the ornate dishware, to the crunchy garnishes on the frozen treats, to the coconut marshmallow at the end. 

Indirect endorsement for the warm chocolate tart, which my friend reordered after a good previous experience."

I came in and took a seat by the bar when shortly one of the rude waiters approach me and ask me to leave!! I felt confused and so offended because literally everybody was just staring at me when this happened, and sometimes Im not confortable being the center of attention- This place has a bad and awkard energy, plus the lighting is horrible and the vibes even worst !!!

The desserts are so unique and each item I ate was well done.  I could have licked my plates clean!  Chika is very nice and serves each dish with a smile too!  I look forward to returning.
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-08-10,5.0,"For an upscale dessert bar, I've never had trouble getting seated here. One summer Sunday evening, the four of us were able to just walk in and be seated at the bar right away. Another time, there was plenty of room for two of us on a Monday night.

Anyway, the food. Everything is done to perfection here. Very artisan, very molecular gastronomy, very creative, and very, very tasty. The Fromage Blanc Island ""Cheese Cake"" (Il Santo Zari) wins best dessert for being this perfect soft, spherical circle of tart, dairy perfection. The Pluot Terrine is such a lovely tribute to my favorite genetically modified fruit. The Corn Ice Cream and Pound Cake will please those who want a savory edge to their dessert, and the Cantaloupe Panna Cotta is a refreshing treat made for hot days and nights.

I've been fortunate to meet Chika herself a couple of times, and she's delightful. Throw in the elegant, minimalist decor, and you've got the perfect dessert bar to impressive your companions with."

I got the chocolate tart with sorbet on the side as well as a dash of red wine sauce. I was AMAZED on how the chocolate tart was so warm and melts in your mouth. I could not describe the amount of fireworks in my mouth as I ate that DESSERT. The petit fours were really fun to eat, as the coconut marshmallow was so jiggly and sweet. My friend got the cheesecake, WHICH in fact was also just as amazing. It was so light, a cloud in fact, and it melted like cotton candy. It was breathtaking literally.

The service was 100% excellent. Our waiter always was so attentive and refilled our glsses with this cool water jug. Everyone was so nice and passionate about what they were doing. 

I do so want to come back to try more. Thank you so much!"

Both counter and booth seating. The counter seating is by far better however as you can see Chika in action. The majority of the seating is first come, first serve. They also have reserved seating a couple of times throughout the day, but you can't be more than 5 min late or else you lose your spot. You order one dessert off the menu, and it comes with a couple other sweet treats for 18$. Also have a few drink options. The desserts are delicious, but tiny. They are beautiful tough and are more like art than food. Great service as well.

It almost seems European to me? The dessert was wonderful. I absolutely loved the unique combination of flavours and presentation of the dessert and think it's well worth a visit to this hyped up dessert shop. 

As far as the menu goes, you get a prix fixe set for $18, which comes with a dessert of your choosing and petit fours (four small desserts). Everything on the menu changes seasonally, and I believe the petit fours changes more often than that. My prix fixe set started with one of the petit fours - it was a coconut ice cream with burnt pepper jelly and other stuff. It was soooo good...seriously so genius to mix the creaminess of the coconut ice cream with the pepper! I ordered an earl grey panna cotta as my main dessert, and my friend ordered a chocolate tart. I tried some of the chocolate tart, and it was very good, but it didn't change my life. The panna cotta, on the other hand, changed my life. The texture was so smooth, and the flavor was so rich! I almost wanted to order seconds right then and there! The ""meal"" ended with the last 3 petit fours, which were small, tasty, but not the highlight of my experience. I thought it was well worth $18. Yes, it's pricy for the portions you're getting, but the presentation, genius of Chika, and overall experience is well worth it. Definitely a good treat yoself dessert. 

The staff was all around so friendly. It was awesome to see Chika up close working her magic! She may also be the cutest/sweetest person ever. The wait can get long here, but the staff gave reasonable time estimates. 

I will be back for sure! TRY THE EARLY GREY PANNA COTTA."

Chika- the owner also the chef, prepared passionately almost every dessert for the guests! I found many other places make  very sweet dessert (i guess ppl in NYC prefer sweeter dessert) . And here the taste is just perfect, well balanced.

I ordered 2 desserts: cheesecake & white chocolate mousse ( the one in the pic).. So yummyyyyy!!!

Its 18$/dessert plus free petits four ( 4mini  desserts). Its a bit pricey for having just dessert: but from what chikalicious gave me: the delicious dessert, the passion from the owner to the staff, the warm & friendly ambiance , it totally worth the price!!!

I would love to recommend this place to all my friends and u as well! Come and see if im telling you the truth ;)"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-10-29,5.0,"I think if you live in NYC or visiting this is the type of place you visit once as it was more of an ""experience"" then the best desert I've ever had. For the experience potion it's worth every penny. The deserts are not overtly sweet which if that's your thing then you'll love it here. To watch the magic of chika and Erwin was worth every penny. They work very hard and take a lot of effort and passion into plating and enduring perfection in each dish. I personally loved the tea addition for $9 and the cute little teacup but like I said was it the best tea ever, no. Unless you highly appreciate tea and know which region it came from then maybe. The cheesecake was ok I wasn't a fan of the texture but the presentation was beautiful. I liked the chocolate tart a lot, but I'm more of a sweet person and nothing was very sweet but still was delicious. The banana ice cream they give you to start is out of this world to me the ""amuse"" portion or whatever you call it was better than the desert. Service was excellent and professional I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING BAR SEATING! If you don't get bar seating personally it's a completely different experience"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-03-30,5.0,"My boyfriend reserved a seat for a date night about two weeks in advance and it was so worth it. You get to watch as Chika works her magic up close right at the bar and service is friendly and quick! Ambience was fun and lighthearted even if it wasn't the most intimate setting for a date (worth it to watch our desserts being made right before our eyes).  

We started with a sorbet over a ginger creme (that I didn't get to photograph) and it was the perfect balance between creamy and sweet with a light icy tartness.
Then I got the orange pound cake which equally danced between a tangy sorbet and a fluffy cake and sweet creme. My boyfriend ordered the grapefruit creme brûlée which was refreshingly fruity.
The petite fours were a coconut marshmallow that was very light unlike most heavy, thick gelatinous marshmallows; a pound cake with a walnut for crunch; and a rich cocoa creme cookie. All of which were not overly sweet and played with various textures.

I ordered an espresso in case it was too much sugar and too much sweet (they even let me pick out which tea cup I wanted!) - a good perk but not necessary since the sugar is not overwhelming as a three course dessert bar might threaten. Chika works with creams, sorbets, cakes, and chocolate by making each difference stand out through their contrasts from one another. Wonderful experience and will go again for another date night."

The chef is really detail-oriented and devotes a lot of time on everything. From the decoration of the restaurant to the plates, everything is perfect. 

Quick tip, wait in front of the restaurant before it opens. If you come here after it opens, it'll be very hard to get a table. Also the prices are not bad at all. The whole experience is worth every penny. I highly recommend this place and it's truly a gem in NYC for dessert."

We had 3 lovely desserts and asked her how often the menu changes. Apparently daily! The cheesecake and the chocolate cake are always on the menu though. 

As someone who usually doesn't eat sweets I can say that everything here is interesting and not cloyingly sweet at all. Definitely stop by if you're in the area!"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2018-04-01,4.0,"I have to say that my finds in the city keep getting better and better-thanks to Yelp! 

I went out to dinner at Ikinari (again) and decided to venture further for some awesome desserts. My friends and I walked to ChikaLicious only to realize there were TWO locations right across the street from each other! Not really knowing which one to go to, we split up and waited in line for both to scope out the place.

The one that I waited in line for was the LEGIT dessert bar where it looked like it offered a pre-fixe menu-pretty much FINE dessert dining. It's a tiny place with a bar that sits about 10 on the right hand side and that's pretty much it. The chefs prepare the desserts in front of you and you wait until people leave to get seated.

On the opposite side was the more 'on the go' type of dessert..which is what we opted to do. This was where we wanted ice cream on those churros cones! Again, a VERY tiny place with a small little booth to side on the right hand side (maybe about 6 people), this location offers ice cream of different flavors on churros cones (already f*king amazing). 

There's other desserts like their cheesecake or doughnut/croissants, but I'm pretty sure people come here for the ice cream.

Anyway, the line goes by pretty quick but because it's a small place, the amount of people waiting in that place is awful. The desserts doesn't come out right away and people end up crammed up at the front waiting because people don't know how to move outta the way to let others order. Names are taken for the order so waiting outside for your order isn't the worst thing in the world. 

I ordered the black sesame ice cream (you can get the churro cone with or without cinnamon) and my husband ordered the s'mores flavor (pictures to follow). Black sesame is probably one of my favorite ice cream flavors other than mint chocolate chip and this place makes mouth watering black sesame ice cream. Drizzled with white chocolate and little cookie flakes on top, the flavors combined gives you a crazy party in your mouth. My husband's s'mores ice cream was a bit messy since it comes with a graham cracker and a melted marshmallow on top...from that and the warm churro cone, the ice cream melted a lot faster than others...so if you're ordering this flavor, be sure to have a lot of napkins and hand sanitizer with you cuz it WILL get deliciously messy! 

I LOVE finding these hole in the wall places because they offer the BEST of the best. I gave this place a four star only because the person at the register kept taking orders while everyone was crammed at the front waiting for their orders -it seems like they could've told everyone who already ordered, they should've waited outside to clear the line to order. 

Regardless she was so friendly and nice and no matter how busy they were, she always had a smile on her face! I would totally come back to try the other flavors. If it's this popular during a cold, windy, 'spring' night, I can't even imagine how it is during the summer!"

The experience may have been slightly more elevated if the pastry chef who was preparing our desserts were engaged with us, explaining what she was doing while it was happening.  However, in her defense, she was fresh out of school and four months into the job. It was like pulling teeth to ask what certain techniques were or why certain flavors were picked for the amuse (palette cleanser).  I know we aren't there to see a show or listen to a pastry performance, but for $18 per dessert dish, it would have been nice to be a little more engaged, especially since we were immediately seated at the bar even though there were two full tables that were ""reserved."" 

She was alone in assembling the dishes while the other chef who was standing by and correcting her fluffing technique of a sauce that accompanied our dessert.  The host popped occasionally to serve tea, but seated himself a few minutes later at one of the ""reserved tables,"" to go over receipts and tally the bill for the day.  I guess those things occur during business hours instead of after?  It would have been nice though to have the host and 2nd chef refill our waters and make sure we were enjoying our dish, but neither came by until I asked repeatedly, and when the host was trying to rush us out with the check because a group of four had arrived.  Note - his tally table still had no one there sitting so would have been nice to not feel too rushed. 

All in all though - the new pastry chef, was working hard to fill all orders so left an 18% tip to help keep the dream alive."

The tiny chocolate cake was supplemented with pink peppercorn ice cream (holy moly what a combination not an ice cream fan but i loved this so so much they should be selling pink peppercorn ice cream everywhere.. tho doubt they could do it as well as chika)... and then there's also red wine sauce, put it all into one bite and your mind will explode.

My two friends and I got here pretty early (7pm on a Friday night) and JUST beat the crowd. We were seated at the bar and had a good view of Chef Chika. The menu consists of an amuse, your choice of dessert, and some petits fours at the end.

We tried the Fromage Blanc Island ""Cheese Cake"" (the most unique in appearance and texture but not amazing flavor), the Brown Sugar Panna Cotta (not very pretty but good flavor), and the White Chocolate Mousse with Kiwi and Coconut Sorbet (cutest plating but not the best combination of flavors).

Our amuse was coffee agar with banana sorbet (okay) and our petits fours was a coconut marshmallow, chocolate cookie, and pecan cookies. None of these particularly impressed me.

It's sad because for such a pricey dessert experience in the heart of East Village, I would expect their desserts to be rich in flavor and presented in the cutest way possible. None of the dishes were any better than something I could get at Spot Dessert and would only have costed me half the price.

Definitely would not come back again."

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago on our latest NY trip, we finally stopped by and were able to get a seat immediately. This place reminds me of Sweet Raku in Vegas.

For a $18 prix fixe, you get a 3-course consisting amuse bouche, your choice of main dessert, and a plate of petit fours. I studied the menu for a long time and still couldn't figure out what I wanted, so I asked Chika herself for a recommendation and with no hesitation she recommended the cheesecake. But just so you know they rotate their menu ever so often that what you see on yelp might not be the one that's available that day but the Fromage Blanc Island Cheese Cake (Il Santo Zari) is the one that they always have on the menu. 

It's so fun watching all the chefs work and prepare the dessert in front of us. It's a work of art is what it it is. Our amuse bouche is a coconut milk lemonade sorbet that was simply refreshing and not too sweet at all, very enjoyable. My guy ordered Orange Watermelon Sorbet and Cantaloupe Melon Sorbet in Chilled Tequila Custard Soup with Cilantro Agar Agar (Quady Essensia Orange Muscat 2015). My cheesecake was very enjoyable, taste good with somewhat a mousse texture. Our friends both ordered the Basil Sorbet on Strawberry Brûlée with Cointreau Sabayon and Frosted Pistachio (Malvasia di Casorzo Dolce 2016). I was very taken back with how good the basil sorbet was. It was incredible. Our petit fours were coconut marshmallow, lemon cookie, and dark chocolate.. all three were pretty good as well. I didn't order a drink here since we were going to a bar but they have good selection of wine and other beverages. Items were ready at a good pace and oh I thought it was a little funny that the busser call you papi or mami at a French dessert place lol.

In a nutshell, very good desserts at a clean modern place with classy ambience. It's a good experience and would love to return if we are in the neighborhood again but only if it's not too busy (the place is quaint so it can get pretty crowded), though they do take reservations for before 7pm."

35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2018-11-08,5.0,"Amazing 20-seat walk-in-only prix fixe dessert bar, every dish personally overseen by Pastry Chef Chika (we've been here perhaps half a dozen times and she's never not been in the open kitchen). The prixe fixe is described as American desserts, French Presentation and Japanese tasting portions. Lovely wine pairings available too. 

Immediate to 60 minute wait times for tables (line starts getting long around 8PM, after dusk). There is also the ChickaLicious Dessert Club nearby, the a la carte counterpart (also tends to have a long line) with a completely different menu. $18 prix fixe ($9 wine pairing, $22 prime wine pairing, $9 prime tea pairing), great value!"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2018-03-04,4.0,"This place is a great experience, albeit a bit overpriced. Chika is a great and sweet human being! 

Each item include an amuse, the main dish, and petit four for $18. 

I ordered the classic fromage blanc ""cheesecake"". The texture reminds me of a very light an airy panna cotta with a slightly tarte yogurty cheese flavor. It was good but I was not blown away like I expected based on other reviews. 

Also tried their kiwi lavender tartare with coconut cream and etc. this was surprisingly really good! It was also beautifully plated. 

The amuse was a pineapple mouse and rosemary sorbet. Delicious!

Petit four: mixed opinions. I was offered the coconut marshmallow which was okay. Not mind blowing. The chocolate biscuit was very dark chocolatey in a good way. The shortbread bite was delicious!"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-05-19,3.0,I've got a massive sweet tooth so when I heard of this place I just knew I had to come. While I enjoyed the revolving menu and Chika blending unusual flavors together it just all seemed pricey for what I was actually getting
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2018-02-15,4.0,"Understand why the line here is long along with the wait for great dessert! Small dessert place but Chika makes it all her herself and we got to meet her too! 

Came here with friends after dinner and even though we waited about 30 mins to get in, it was worth it!  We went for the Prix Fixe - Amuse, Choice of Dessert and Petits Fours and specialty teas. Had a great time and wasn't rushed out! Thanks so much Chika! 

Wine pairing with dessert: Malvasia di Casorzo Dolce  
Course 1: Amuse - Brown sugar panna cotta, Green apple sorbet
Course 2: Fromage Blanc Island ""Cheese Cake""
Mango-Blueberry Tartare with Creme Anglaise on Kataifi and Jasmine Sorbet
Vanilla-Honey Parfait in Strawberry Gazpacho with Balsamico Agar Agar and Lace Tuile - delicious! :)
Course 3: Petit Fours: Coconut marshmallow, Chocolate rum ball, Pecan cookie

Note: The menu changes so each time you come you try something new."
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2018-08-17,5.0,"Even though their prices have gone up from $16 to $18 for the core prix-fixe dessert experience, this is still quite a good value.

As the name implies, the venue consists of a diner-like bar that seats about 10 people. The core prix-fixe experience consists of an amuse bouche, your choice from the main dessert menu, as well as a set of petits fours.

My amuse bouche was a yellow tomato genre with basil sorbet - absolutely refreshing and cleansing for the palate. I chose the pluot terrine on pecan wafer with buttermilk ice cream and maple syrup as the main dessert; the fruitiness of the pluot terrine complemented the buttermilk ice cream surprisingly well, as did the chewy and creamy textures, respectively. To close, the petits fours consisted of a coconut marshmallow, chai tea pound cake, and dulce caramel pudding; all looked extremely petite indeed, but packed enough flavor in them to give you enough of a sense of each.

Service was fairly generic and mechanical here, which is perhaps the only drawback as they can't possibly make a lot of money without a lot of volume. Still, this is a fine dining experience without a fine dining price tag. Thanks Yelpers for an excellent find!​"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2018-11-04,5.0,We tried the $18 prix fixe 3 course dessert. The entree is pretty good but with small portion. I regard it as a one time experience.
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-12-27,5.0,"If someone were to ask me: ""What is your favorite Dessert place in NYC?"" Hands down it'll be ChikaLicious Dessert Bar. This might even be my favorite dessert place on the planet. I've been coming since it opened in 2003 and it's still going strong. CLDB only holds a maximum of 20 people so it is very intimate and you're seated around an open kitchen. Watch Chika do her magic from the counter and be prepared for some of the best desserts you'll ever have. The Concorde grape sorbet is to die-for and only made in season. I absolutely Love this place!! You will not be disappointed and will only crave for more."
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-06-18,5.0,"I will give a 5 out of 5 to this dessert bar, the chefs are making the dessert in front of the customers, which is nice and special ! The Kiwi Tartare With Lavender On Crispy Kataifi combine the taste of kiwi, cream, and lavender, which is special, but not bad! The warm chocolate tart is amazing! The shaved ice on the top and then the chocolate, peanut, cream on the bottom, which brings me a very rich flavor! The ice cream is great, which is sweet and sour, but just enough and the cookies are great, too!"
35,chikalicious-dessert-bar-new-york-3,2019-03-14,5.0,"I don't have a big sweet tooth except for may be a weakness for dark chocolates ... well who can keep a lady away from amazing chocolates. So then why go to or review a dessert bar. 

Firstly because this place is absolutely a must go. Chika makes the best dessert prefix and each and every dish is gorgeous looking, irresistibly delicious and made with so much care it's unbelievable. The presentation is so beautiful you sometimes don't want to touch it ... but can't resist ;)"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-02-11,5.0,"Came in on a Tuesday night around 8PM for quick dessert after dinner at Veselka nearby.

They let you try a lot of flavors - I opted for the marionberry cheesecake which was the late winter special at the time. It's definitely on the richer side given the cheesecake and graham cracker chunks. I'd opt for earl grey tea or honeycomb if you want something lighter. They're pretty generous with the servings but $6 a scoop is hefty as well.

Definitely a good pick me up at the end of a long day!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-03-23,2.0,"I was very underwhelmed. As a dairy-free eater, I was so excited to try Van Leeuwen because they have so many vegan flavors. The server let me try as many flavors as I wanted, which was good because I really disliked many of the flavors I tried. They either had no taste or were very overwhelming. Some were far too coconuty - for example, the cookies and cream caramel swirl just tasted like coconut ice cream with a few mix-ins. 

We ended up getting the Mocha latte and the peanut butter chocolate chip to share between the 4 of us. Just okay - this place is very overhyped. For midwest people, do not expect this to be anything like Jeni's."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-03-06,4.0,"I got the mocha cookies n cream flavor which was very delicious! The service was quick and pleasant. I can't wait to come back again and try more flavors!

The place itself is very small but there's a small area near the window where you can stand."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-02-17,5.0,"If you are looking for dairy-free ice cream (also vegan), Van Leeuwen has one of the best selections anywhere in NYC (maybe in the whole nation). Their dairy-free flavors go far beyond standard chocolate and vanilla options: at Van Leeuwen, you can order super unique flavors like Churro Fudge and Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter. They also have vegan hot fudge and vegan cookies, which were super yummy. While there was a good sized line, it moved pretty quickly. The only real downside to our visit is they were out of almost 1/4 of their flavors, but we still found some we wanted. All in all, a great place to grab dairy-free ice cream, sundaes, cookies, and other sweet treats in the East Village!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-01-13,5.0,"One of the best ice creams ever. So smooth. So creamy.

The flavor is literally shocking your taste buds. 


Earl grey ice cream. Omg. I dream about you.



Doesn't look like much. But it is prob my number one choice for icecream in NYC"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-01-07,5.0,The kids were worn out from our pub crawl so they definitely deserved some ice cream.  Stopped into Van Leeuwens and they had such a great selection it was hard to decide.  Luckily we were able to sample a few flavors.  We ended up with cookies and cream & their seasonal flavor peppermint (OMG this flavor was AMAZING!) prices are a bit high but the quality of ice cream is excellent so it's worth it IMO!
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-05-19,3.0,"Just weird. I bought the salted caramel at a local supermarket. I love caramel, and this was a salted caramel. I envisioned streaks of caramel with a few salt crystals.  What I got was an odd-looking beige-colored ice cream, heavy, unctuous and loaded with salt. Totally unappetizing. I hated to throw away a $7.99 pint of ice cream, but I knew that if I couldn't past the first spoonful, it would die in back of the freezer, and I admit that the color beige threw me off at the outset. Never again. I will say the the ice-cream is rich, which is why I gave 3-stars, but no more, thank you."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-07-02,3.0,"Another solid Van Leeuwen location, but limited seating and limited flavors. Service was fast and friendly even though the line was out the door.

The vegan sundae I ordered was delicious - cookies and cream with chocolate sauce. I devoured the whole thing.

Bathrooms are not available even to customers so wash your hands somewhere else before you get that ice cream cone lol"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-01-14,5.0,"Probably my go-to ice cream spot in the city. They offer a wide selection of enticing flavors, including extensive vegan options. I would generally scoff at eating vegan ice cream, but the vegan flavors are just as delicious as the classics! 

My overall favorite is the classic earl grey, which I can't help but order at least once a month. Smooth, fragrant, delicious, and not too sweet. And actually reminds me of real earl grey tea!

It's also definitely worth checking out their specials. Recently they offered a vegan early grey and cookies flavor which I would highly recommend.

As with any Van Leeuwen's, there is very limited seating so just be aware that it's not really a place to linger and chat with a group of friends. Expect to pay around $6 for a single scoop, which is about average to a bit above average for the city."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-08-01,5.0,"Consistently impressed with Van Leeuwen's vegan options, and their addition of a nut-free, oat milk base does not disappoint. 

I tried the Oat Milk Chocolate Crunch, which is a chocolate base with sugar cookie dough bites and the famous honeycomb sprinkled throughout. It was not their most cohesive flavor; the mix-ins did not compliment each other in the same way that they do in some other flavors (like the Strawberry Rhubarb tart...) but the base was undeniably rich and creamy, and the honeycomb added an excellent touch. 

I am excited to see the future of Oat Milk ice creams for Van Leeuwens!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-03-04,5.0,"This is the best ice cream I have ever had. The world stopped with each bite, nothing else mattered. Can't wait to go back."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-04-07,4.0,"Loved all the flavour choices at Van Leeuwen, all the ice cream flavours I've had there have not been disappointing. The London fog ice cream I had was creamy and tasted richly of Earl grey. I also appreciated that they didn't have a limit on how many flavours I could try since I'm more on the indecisive side."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-07-08,4.0,"I always have a difficult time looking for decent non-dairy dessert alternatives but Van Leeuwen really delivers. They use oat milk as the base and the consistency of their ice cream is nearly identical to that of dairy ice cream. I had a sample of the honeycomb and early grey tea flavors and went with the early grey tea. The honeycomb has a hint of honey but the caramel was pretty overpowering. The earl grey tea was very fragrant which I loved. 
For a single scoop, my total came out to be around $6. It's on the pricier end but I would recommend Van Leeuwen to anyone who's looking for a non-dairy alternative. Hopefully they'll have more flavors in the future because their menu seemed a bit limited in my opinion."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-02-06,1.0,"I have tried more than once to buy ice cream from these classist gentrifierers, but since they REFUSE to take cash, they should be boycotted.  The staff has always been incredibly nice, but on principle, I still refuse to support this place. I have  a debit card and a couple of Credit cards,  so it's not because I can't pay.  This whole cashless thing is a scam so credit card companies can make more in interest,  and I refuse to pay interest on Ice Cream.  Credit card companies are actually giving comp bonuses for going cashless. 

I also refuse to support an idea that is ruining a city that I loved.  Once upon a time you could be as  immigrant without a bank account,  or a street punk with some change, and you could have some ice cream.  Now you need a debit card,  or good credit.  R.I.P. East Village.   The good old days of buying icecream without dipping into your rent money or paying interest are GONE. 
Thanks for being neighborhood ruining gentrifierers. I hope your lovely staff find better jobs for better companies."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-02-17,4.0,van leeuwen is my favorite ice cream shop in nyc!! they have a great assortment of flavors and they cater to special diets like vegan and gluten free. the workers are super sweet and patient with customers that want to sample new flavors but the line always seems to move in an efficient fashion. my only gripe is that the line at this shop is confusing because there's people who stand around in the middle of the shop so it can be hard to find the end of the line
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-11-15,5.0,"Honestly, I am just in love with Van Leeuwen Ice Cream in general, although my go-to is the honeycomb flavor. I love how I can ask for 1 scoop of honeycomb but the employees are nice enough to squeeze in a second scoop for me. 

Van Leeuwen is also cashless, so make sure to bring a credit/debit card or you can use apple pay!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-09-21,5.0,"Really good ice cream, lots of choices, and reasonably priced. Always happy to have this spot in the neighborhood--and open late!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-04-06,5.0,"A late review for sure, since I've already been here countless times. I found myself coming back here for dessert or recommending friends to come here whenever we're in the area for dinner. It's almost become like my staple go-to plave for dessert in east village. Surely that alone probably shows how much I like the icecream here. 

My usual go to flavor is the Earl Grey or the Honeycomb, which both are amazing. They also have seasonal flavors that come and go, as well as other unique flavors. Moreover, if you're looking for vegan icecream options, no worries they've got you covered too!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-01-19,5.0,Earl grey tea ice cream. Thats all I have to say. It's amazing!!! Soft ice cream and creamy and flavorful. I got the pint of ice cream to bring back home and it's my guilty pleasure. The honey comb ice cream is also really good there too!
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-08-21,5.0,Favorite ice cream ever.So many interesting flavors.The ice cream is so creamy. people who work here are very nice and friendly.
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-07-21,4.0,"Since today is the national ice cream day and very hot SUNday, many people visit this ice cream shop. Therefore, it's a little bit crazy and hot in the store. 

I tasted a two scoop cup with honeycomb and Brooklyn brown sugar. Honeycomb is wonderful for me. Sweet and smooth with a little piece of chewy honeycomb. For BBS, I think it taste like a vanilla brownie ice cream. Anyway, it's delicious as well.

Happy National Ice Cream Day=)"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-06-20,4.0,"Their earl grey ice cream is so good! The texture is nice and creamy, it's not overly sweet and with 1 scoop you feel satisfied. Everyone I see who's gotten ice cream from here has been happy.

The one downside can be the price - one scoop is just $5.50 but if you share it with another person (which can be the perfect amount after a meal) it's worth it!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-07-31,4.0,"Had a scoop of chocolate fudge brownie and it was soooo good. Rich, not too sweet, dark chocolate flavored, super smooth and felt like we were eating a brownie!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-12-19,4.0,"This is a nice place, but the ice cream is very expensive. We tried the famous honeycomb ice cream, which was good, and the peppermint stick. Maybe not the best flavor combination, but they were both good (if a little sweet). Be aware that there is no restroom in this establishment."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-07-04,5.0,"Honestly don't know how a human makes all these old and new flavors of ice cream. They are all so complex and DELICIOUS like a multi-layered dish is. This ice cream is art. It makes you want to cry. There's rich flavors like the classic vanilla, brownie/chocolate. There's savory and herbal ones like pistachio and earl grey. There's fun fruity ones like blueberry pie and cookie crumbs strawberry jam (summer specials and my fav). If you're debating whether it's worth it for the price, it is. It'll be the easiest $8 you'll spend on anything. 

P.S. The service is incredible as well!!!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-01-27,5.0,"This company has a Variety of desserts that you can just indulge in and get lost. The ice cream, chocolate chip cookies, and brownies  are good enough for that last minute trip when you need a picker-upper. They also have vegan options."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-01-14,5.0,"Before this one, my No.1  ice cream place is McConell. After I tried the earl gray tea and brown sugar flavors, I consider Van Leeuwen is comparable and even slightly better. The earl gray tea flavor has a really fresh scent, the brown sugar one has something chewy inside. Loved both flavor and definitely recommend this place!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-06-02,4.0,"Known for their vegan ice cream flavors, you can't go wrong with Van Leeuwen. With a couple of locations around the city, you're never far from a good ice cream. I always try their vegan flavors (made from cashew base). Even though they are delicious I always end up ordering their regular flavors, which seem a bit more flavorful to me. 

My only gripe is the high price for a scoop - over $6. But hey, it's NY and that seems to be the running price for high-end ice cream these days. Prepare yourself for the higher price or share with friends and you won't be disappointed!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-11-24,3.0,"I always want to try this place because it was always suggested by all the foodies as a top NY ice cream shop. Since I am around the LES more, I definitely decided to give it a try.

My opinion on the shop is based just on the flavor I got, which is earl grey, it doesn't reflect every flavor in the shop! 

I thought the earl grey was a bit too creamy, the tea taste was too strong but it didn't blend well with the ice cream. I would probably have to come back and try more flavors in order to change my review. However, they do let you sample flavors before hand!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-11-10,5.0,"Oh my, the ice cream here are on the sweeter side for sure but the vegan chocolate ice cream made of coconut milk is my favorite in town."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-08-23,3.0,"The ice cream itself is pretty great - you can taste the freshness. However, while they have interesting flavors, they just happen to taste good, rather than having unique, complementary flavors. The chocolatey flavors are intense and are almost bitter like dark chocolate. The peanut butter flavor was like ordinary PB ice cream, with some add-ins for an interesting bite. I did like the honeycomb ice cream, which was more reminiscent of caramel than honey. 
Overall, given the a price of over $8, not including tip, for 2 scoops, when you factor in tax, it's a steep price to pay. The wait is also pretty long. I'd say this place is only really worth it if you're vegan."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-09-30,5.0,"If you're vegan , you NEEED to try this place! DO NOT PASS IT UP. By far my most favorite vegan ice cream shop."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-04-12,5.0,"TO. DIE. FOR. Van Leeuwen has the creamiest and richest ice cream. I can't get enough of it and I can see others feel the same whenever I walk by as they are very busy. I'm a chocoholic and opted for the chocolate brownie, which fulfilled my chocolate cravings for the night. My sister tried one of the vegan flavors. I can't believe I'm saying this but it was absolutely AMAZING! It is equally as good as the other flavors. Prices are pretty average for the city ranging from $5-$8 depending on size. Worth every penny! They even have pints to go if you wish to take some home."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-10-15,5.0,Unique and really good flavors. Their strawberry ice cream is to die for! I love their little store on the upper east side. The employees are kind and patient. I don't even like ice cream but I love theirs!
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-12-07,4.0,"Delicious. I had a scoop of the earl grey which is a special flavor. It is vegan and delicious. Made of oat milk-- my personal go-to plant-based milk.
Friendly staff. Went on a cold day-- have a seat inside where it is warm and enjoy delicious ice cream.

They have classic dairy ice cream as well. Though, go with the flavor you like. Based on the vegan earl grey, pick the flavor you like, if you aren't vegan."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-09-15,5.0,This is my new favorite ice cream shop. I was very impressed by the number and variety of vegan flavors they had. I ordered cookie crumble strawberry jam and absolutely loved it!
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-07-31,5.0,"This location has more foot traffic than any other Van Leeuwen location that I've ever been to. My friends and I stopped by here for a quick dessert after dinner on a Saturday evening at about 9 P.M. and we were greeted with about a 10 minute long wait. Nevertheless, Van Leeuwen still continued to provide the same quality ice cream throughout all their locations. 

I settled for 2 regular flavors that I normally order whenever I am at Van Leeuwen during my last visit. The earl gray tea and the honeycomb. Both are popular flavors and are usually sold out during the more busier days. The earl gray tea ice cream tastes as if real tea leaves were used in the production process. The slightly citrusy after taste provided a nice little touch. The honeycomb is a little on the sweeter side, but I am surely a big fan of the small bits of honeycomb toffee in the ice cream itself. It provided a nice change in texture and taste as it made the ice cream crunchy and sweeter. 

Overall, I enjoyed my first experience at this Van Leeuwen location. The staff were courteous and catered to our needs. Feel free to ask for samples if you're ever curious as to what a particular flavor tastes like. Keep in mind that you're only limited to a maximum of 3 samples though! They keep rolling out new seasonal flavors, so be on the lookout for those. I look forward to trying their Sicilian pistachio and mint chip the next time I return."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-11-05,4.0,"It was my first time going to Van Leeuwen but I've tried their honeycomb flavor in the pints they sell at the supermarket before. This location was so cute and not many people on a Tuesday at 5:30pm. I decided to get an affogato with a scoop of honeycomb and it was delicious . The perfect bitterness of the espresso and the sweetness of the ""dulce de leche"" flavor was amazing. The girl on staff wasn't very friendly though and seemed annoyed upon asking to try flavors. She didn't smile and was not welcoming. If it wasn't for this customer service experience, definitely 5 stars!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-07-12,3.0,"Don't get me wrong the ice cream is good. I got the vegan brownie flavor that they're doing for the summer and I've had a few of their regular dairy ice creams in pints.

That being said, there were a few issues about this experience. I got a single scoop in a cone. The scoop was literally rested on top of the cone- no squishing it down to help it stay. The scoop fell off in my first lick attempt, luckily my hands moved fast enough to save it. The kid working behind the counter should probably be retrained on ice cream scooping technique... never thought I'd have a complaint for that! 

For the amount of ice cream you get in a single scoop, over $6 is absolutely too pricey. 

The cone had zero flavor so that was a bust.

No restroom in the location.

Tons of space, very little seating.

Not impressive."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-02-15,5.0,"One of the best earl grey ice cream I have ever had. Some flavours do tend to be too sweet for my palate but overall I would say this is a legit ice cream chain that has not been ruined by popularity. Try out some of their vegan offerings as well, none of the flavours are to be passed."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-08-13,5.0,"Van Leeuwen always has a quick moving line, friendly service and too many good looking ice cream options. 

This location has a to go freezer near the front door, if you want to be alone with your pint! No judgements here. 

Anyway, there are both regular dairy and vegan options here for my lactose intolerant pals. This is the largest location of the three, so there are a few usable table inside, as well as two benches outside."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-07-08,4.0,"My friend told me so much about how great the ice cream is here! There was a line out the door when I visited around 9pm on a Friday summer night. I love that they have the basic flavors such as chocolate and vanilla as well as specials such as vegan pink lemonade and vegan passionfruit. I think the best flavor and the only flavor I'd come here for again would be the earl grey tea, which is a flavor that isn't sold in a lot of ice cream shops/places.

I tasted several flavors. I tried two of the specials which were the royal wedding cake and hot Brooklyn summer. I didn't love either of them, but if it was between the royal wedding cake and hot Brooklyn summer, I'd definitely pick the royal wedding cake. The hot Brooklyn summer wasn't terrible, it was just weird and tasted strange. The classic flavors I tasted were earl grey tea, honeycomb and coffee. I really wanted to try the cookies and cream as well, but they were sold out. On a scale of sweetness, coffee would've been the least, then earl grey would be in the middle and honeycomb would be the sweetest. 

I ended up getting a scoop of earl grey tea, it was delicious. I think earl grey tea may be their best selling flavor. I saw many other guests as well as my friend having earl grey tea. I also think it's great that they offer vegan flavors for people who are vegan; very inclusive to all guest. All in all, I would visit again, but only to get some earl grey tea ice cream and possibly try the vegan flavors. 

tl;dr - nice staff, card only, earl grey tea is my favorite, the sweetness is perfect and the ice cream is smooth and tastes great."

My GAWD this is by far the best vegan ice cream I've EVERY had, it's so creamy and authentic it's difficult to believe you are eating vegan!

We were so excited by our options and couldn't decide between a sundae, cookie sandwich or just ice cream.  I went with the Mother Earth + Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough since it's my first time and couldn't make up my mind.  Oddly enough I really liked the Mother Earth: spirulina, matcha cookie & almond flavors (normally almond extracts can bee too aggressive for my pallet).  The CCC dough was good, but I was diggin the Momma Earth flavor.  The hubs got a scoop of Mint Chip between 2 chocolate chip cookies.  It was a lot of cookie but he loved the ice cream too.

I wish I had seen the speciality flavors like Sticky Toffee Pudding or Vegan Cherry Heartbeet because I would have tried those since I like creative combos' instead of the classics. 

Ya'll would KILL IT in Atlanta... just saying big healthy vegan community here.  Call me."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-01-02,4.0,"Trendy ice cream shop with both regular and vegan ice cream options. Have both traditional and unique flavors. Some of the unique flavors go on rotation. Lots of topping options. Pricey for ice cream. The vegan ice cream was a little more icy than I usually like my ice cream, but was not too bad overall. I got the ""planet earth"" and it had a unique but delicious taste. Often run out of certain flavors. No bathrooms. I went on Mew Years day after dinner and it was packed and no seats were free

I came in and tried the Sicilian almond pear tart and loved it- unfortunately they didn't have enough for a full scoop so I couldn't order it... guess I'll have to come back soon! Instead I ordered the honeycomb, a flavor I've sampled many times but never ordered bc I wasn't sure if it was too sweet for a whole scoop. It wasn't, the creaminess helped balance it out. It was perfect and now I'm mad I waited so long. I loved the bits of chewy honey in the ice cream. Now we know ‍"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-12-03,5.0,"Best vegan ice cream I have ever had! Van Leeuwen is the place I almost always stop at when I'm in the city. The flavour combinations, both unique and the classics, are delicious and I'm always shocked at how they can make vegan ice cream taste so good!! Would highly recommend coming here for desert vegan or not since their ice cream is incredible!!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-11-14,5.0,"This location is definitely bigger than the one in Greenwich.

I think there's some flavors certain stores have and other don't? I didn't see lavender on their menu the last time I went here. Either way it's still a delicious time at Van Leeuwen!! I love the creaminess of their ice cream - never too sticky/stretchy or too light. 

Also, the employees are pretty nice about letting you try flavors too. My favorites include Honeycomb, Pistachio, Earl Grey, and Salted Caramel. Yeah, there are quite a few because they are all SO good! It's always fun to check out their monthly specials too! 

& In the winter, their hot chocolate is super rich and delicious!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-06-27,4.0,"Can't go wrong with vegan ice cream! I got the mini sundae: vegan cookie chocolate chip cookie dough with candied walnuts, hot fudge and whipped cream. They do have vegan options for chocolate sauce and whipped cream, but they were out of the latter. 
I took off one star because as I finished my sundae, I noticed that there was blue ice cream (I think blueberry?) in the bottom of my cup. Not sure how this happened but hoping they don't mix vegan/non vegan flavors often..."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-12-27,5.0,"Well this place definitely lived upto my expectations, but one visit is just not enough, got to go back and try all the other vegan flavors :)
Loved the planet earth flavor, very unique and satisfying."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-06-24,5.0,"Amazing creaminess, freshness and variety. One of THE BEST things I ever tasted. We enjoyed a peanut butter option and salted caramel but tasted all others. You will ALWAYS WIN here!"
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-10-26,5.0,I love the ice cream from here and if Van Leeuwen's was closer to where I live I would probably be there everyday. My go to is usually the earl grey because it's just that heavenly. The tea flavor isn't over powering and the ice cream isn't too heavy. I sampled harvest moon as well as honeycomb and the person working was patient with us as we decided which flavor to go with. I decided to go with the honeycomb and it was the perfect balance. Super creamy and not overly sweet. Would definitely recommend either earl grey or honeycomb to anyone who's not sure of what to get.
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-11-07,4.0,HUGE VARIETY OF VEGAN FLAVORS SCREAMS A WIN FOR ME. At 5.50-6.50 a scoop it doesn't come cheap but it's van Leeuwen so I guess it's a regular price... I like there icecream and the fact that they carry a bunch of vegan/non-vegan options also is great. THEY CLOSE AT 12AM M-W not sure about THUR-SUN. Yelp has the hours wrong FYI we walked in at 11:57 with no fucks given thinking they close at 1AM=false. Strawberry jam vegan flavor was alright... nothing special. I would go for vegan chocolate next time!
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-11-30,5.0,"One word: HONEYCOMB

To be honest, I can't even comment on any other flavors offered here since honeycomb is my go-to flavor whenever I visit. Absolutely love love love the rich and creamy milk flavor with actual bits of honey inside! I highly recommend that everyone try this flavor at least once, whether it's an actual scoop or sample spoon full. Lines can get long here, but don't let that deter you. Service is speedy and the table turnaround time is usually quick as well. Perfect spot to bring anyone with a sweet tooth."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-03-17,5.0,"There are only three places I consider top for ice cream and Van Leeuwen scores top for flavor, accommodation, and price. Flavor because where else can you combine honey comb ice cream with Earl Grey Tea ice cream? A perfect combination for anyone seeking a unique experience or alternative sipping tea with honey. Accommodation because the menu includes an extensive ice cream list and toppings to choose from including flavors of the day AND VEGAN ice cream and VEGAN toppings. Oh, it's that f+#%ing good and I'm not vegan. A perfect vegan combination would be mint and chocolate. Fuggedaboudid! Prepares yourself because, like the mailman, ""Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these ice cream lovers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds for Van Leeuwen's.

Real New Yorkers will remember VL was once only available by the VL food truck. This brick and mortar location is classic, vibrant with hipster music, and welcomes visitors from nearly every neighborhood (and some in sure) through its doors each and every day and night. While other ice cream places depend on  building the costliest or the most wildest ice creations, bedazzled with a plethora of sugar treats stacked to the sky costing you a second salary, Van Leeuwen depends on its flavor and supporting their customers' dietary choices 

So, take a walk on the wild side. Visit Leeuwen's. You will return over and over again. Amazing."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2020-01-13,5.0,I go here far too often! All of their flavors are rich and creamy and the perfect treat on any day. My go-to flavor is the honey comb but I also can't resist a good cookies and cream. The season flavors are fun and usually pretty good too. Love this place and will be a customer for as long as they are open!
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-06-10,3.0,"I've been here a few times and I'm surprised that I haven't reviewed this place yet. 

Anyway, things have changed a lot over the years since I've first visited this place. 

1.  In the past, you can get two flavors even if you just get a single scoop. They've changed, single scoop means single flavor.

2.  They took away my beloved gianduja (chocolate hazelnut) ice cream. 

3.  They no longer have a bathroom for customers (I know they took that away a long time ago, but I'm just reviewing this place now )

Aside from the aforementioned gianduja, I've also tried the pistachio (very sugary and lacking in pistachio flavor, not too memorable. Davey's nearby has a better pistachio ice cream) and salted caramel (salty, sweet, buttery caramel, so complex!). A pretty good spot in EV, but there are a lot of other strong competitors nearby too."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-06-01,4.0,Pricey but delicious. Mini sundae comes with 3 toppings but whipped cream counts. Honeycomb best flavor; candied almonds go great with caramel
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-10-25,2.0,"Yuck yuck yuck. Overrated and overhyped for bad ice cream. I've gotten both the vegan and non-vegan and both always seem to give me the worst tummy aches let alone I've never been able to finish my small cup of ice cream. I've given VL a number of chances and have tried it at various locations and never enjoyed my ice cream (except for maybe the first time which happened to be the 5th or 7th date with my now boyfriend). The cones are always stale, too. Gross."
36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2018-04-03,5.0,"I don't think I would ever say this but since discovering the vegan flavor icecreams at Van Leeuwen, all other types of ice cream is mediocre. I love the hint of coconut butter in their vegan flavors. Also if you're ordering a scoop be sure to get the vegan whipped cream which tastes like crack, I could just eat the whipped cream on its own. Van Leeuwen is my favorite ice cream spot in NYC. I highly recommend the Vegan peanut butter chocolate chip.

36,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-23,2019-03-31,4.0,"So we finally had nice weather yesterday and everywhere I looked, everyone and their mother were holding either an ice cream cone or cup of ice cream. I had to get in on the action and thankfully, Van Leeuwen's was close to where I parked. This was my first time at this particular location, which is a lot bigger than other ones I've been to. The line was long, but it moved quick! I came in with the intention of getting a scoop of planet earth however, upon glancing over the vegan flavors, I saw that it was no longer available. I asked the girl behind the counter if I could try the pb&j bon bon and she gave me a generous sample. My friend asked to try the green earth and said it was good as well, so I bit the bullet and asked for a scoop of EACH! This location is definitely not stingy with portions (check my photos). I really enjoyed the pb&j bon bon, it was a really good balance of peanut butter and tart jelly. The green earth was good too but it didn't really taste like matcha to me. There was a giant communal table, window seating, and a few tables for those who like to sit and enjoy their treat. When I was leaving, the line was again long and out the door, and it was almost midnight! It's just that good!"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2020-04-07,5.0,"They have great options right now for ordering online during COVID- you can buy 6 oz bags of beans to try several blends for the same per unit price as the larger bags. They also grind the coffee specifically for a variety of brew methods including pour over which is appreciated! To top it off, there is free shipping for orders over $20-- something not many coffee shops are doing! For what it's worth, I'm very selective about coffee and Roasting Plant is in my top two!"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2020-01-04,5.0,"Tasty, dark, and rich coffee for a good price.  I have had difficulty staying away from this fun little nook and they probably have collected enough of my cash to pay my rent for a few months.  

Friendly atmosphere too, which makes a big difference to me in the mornings :)"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2019-06-07,5.0,Absolutely one of my favorite spots in the city for a coffee.  Knowledgeable staff and cool roasting technique- Order your bean / roast it on the spot / enjoy  coffee
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2020-03-15,5.0,Excellent coffee and exceptional hot choc. Coffee roasted for you when your coffee is ordered. Dark coffee was smooth and rich..  Hot chocolate probably best we've had anywhere.
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2019-07-14,5.0,"I'm usually wary of buying iced coffee. But the iced coffee here is flash chilled (I have never heard of this before), so there's no bitter oil to interfere with the deep roast of the beans. Fucking delicious. 
Not sure how pneumatic or otherwise fictional the tube system is, but it looks cool?"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2019-10-26,5.0,"The best coffee in the LES, much better then Starbucks.  It's a machine where they roast the beans and dropped to the cup.  My son always love watching it work.  I had the ice coffee.  You can really smell and taste the freshness of the coffee beans."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2019-06-30,5.0,"This is the best coffee in the lower east side.

They make coffee, tea, roast the beans, all dat.
They won't put an egg in your coffee or any funny Japanese cool guy stuff, but you will get your coffee quickly.  They have a crazy system that will have the coffee brewed and in your hand quicker than any other coffee spot you've ever been to.

This is the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory equivalent of Coffee.    I like that their service is on point, and the coffee is consistent, they never burn the beans know what I mean.     Get the blue mountain or the Brazilian and drink this delicious coffee until your head explodes.    

P.S - Pro Tip, the large coffee is actually gigantic, one of those will last your 3 hours if you sip slow.

Shout out to their incredible staff, and to the geniuses who invented their crazy machinery."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-12-02,5.0,"The coffee here always tastes great! I first went to Roasting Plant in Detroit, and I was so happy to hear they have a location in LES (of course, not as big)

I love getting their iced coffee. All the beans are suctioned up into this vacuum machine that brings it to the front where it gets freshly ground and filtered. For the iced coffee, it gets put into another machine that CHILLS it as the liquid goes round and round through the chiller. Out comes cold coffee! 

Everyone here is also so nice and helpful. There aren't very many chairs, so it's more of a grab and go place, but it definitely works for this area because there are a lot of shops and restaurants to wander into."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-11-03,4.0,"Our place was just around the corner. So many options to choose from,  I feel you won't have trouble finding your flavor. I got a regular iced coffee and my husband got a supercharged Brazilian brew.  Both excellent.  Service was fast and super friendly.  Definitely recommend for any coffee enthusiast! Cheers!"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2019-07-28,4.0,"I've been coming to roasting plant since I was in high school, I absolutely love this place. I've realized that the staffs who work here now are not as friendly as previous staffs. 

For an example, I came in on 7/13 8:45AM to get 4 lattes, 3 with whole milk and 1 with oat. The male employee didn't know which one was oat because he didn't mark the cup, and has an ""I don't care"" attitude which is annoying. I asked him which one is the oat milk, he told me ""I THINK it's this one."" And of course, the one he said was oat milk was just regular milk.. Enough said. 

I still love their coffee because it's so good, but staffs can really work on their people skills."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-12-11,5.0,"Roasting Plant is a little hidden box of coffee heaven.  Although it's a tiny place, keep in mind that this is New York, and that's all you need.  They have really high quality beans from which just enough beans are vacuumed through tubes to grind right before your cup is brewed.

This is the type of coffee that is best served without any additives.  Otherwise the complex flavor will get muted.  They still have cream, milk, and sugar for all the people who need it anyway.

I've been to their main location on the West Side so many times, too.  I have also been to their Detroit location and was pleasantly surprised to bump into it there."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2020-03-10,5.0,Great coffee and a big variety of coffee beans to choose from if you'd like. Service is awesome and Greg is the man!
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-10-23,5.0,"Craving a nice cup of strong coffee? Get their micro-brewed supercharged. I usually drink my coffee black, but I couldn't with this because of how strong it was. It was so strong that it had me lightheaded, but wide-awake 8 hours after drinking it. 

Roasting Plant not only has an innovative way of storing and serving their coffees (with the use of suction tubes) but they also offer coffee from all over the world. The first time I visited this place, I tried a coffee from Kenya (wasn't sure of the official name) but I found it to be not as strong as the Supercharged.  

Not only do they offer coffee, they also sell cookies (I heard they're good) and other bakery pastries. 

Overall, I've had a great first two experiences here. The staff were courteous and efficient and I'll definitely be back here the next time I'm looking for a cup of strong coffee whenever I'm in the area."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-09-10,5.0,"Super friendly staff, great chocolate chip cookies and the drink I had - the iced chai latte was full of flavor.  I would go back for this drink!

If you are a big coffee lover and need coffee beans, they are very knowledgeable and this would be a great place to go to get something for yourself or a gift (albeit a bit pricier at $20-25/lb)

There are a few seats (maybe 4-5)."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-06-01,4.0,"I was in LES and in need of power joe, and I knew I wouldn't have to walk far.

""Where did you get that?"" I asked the nearest spied coffee drinker.
""Roasted plant down the street."" He replied with a nonchalant subtle pretension like he taught college.  You know - lower east side persona.  

Roasted plant was stylized from top to bottom in a small space that felt like a cellar but looked futuristic.

""I want a dark roast drip."" I somehow managed to say out of my mouth without begging on my knees.

I spied an electronic screen menu board with a complicated lay out that projected overly braininess. 

""We actually don't have dark roast."" 
The hipster girl beamed with a high chirp like a robot.  I was in outer space.  This was all preplanned.  (The darkest roast they had was a Sumatra which they would define as medium bodied.)

I'm screaming in my head -
""You're a speciality coffee shop and you don't have dark roast ??   Is this some kind of snobby coffee aficionado BS ??""

""Ok. Let me just reevaluate the options.""
I responded sounding a bit stiff and psychotic like Patrick Bateman.

The formality was a bit over the top.  But that's ok, someone's taking stuff seriously.
I ordered a triple americano $3.25 that was absolutely delicious - creamy, with depth, wonderful flavor, nutty, not bitter.  

Worn wood floors hold up some staged machinery, one in the store front window looked like a robot that was percolating coffee.  The other set up was a wall of different beans available for wholesale, with some industrial tubing connected, for what purpose I have no clue. 

I sat on one of the three cushioned seats that lined the wall each separated by a white plastic flat top.  I drank my wonderful brew as I watched beautiful cool people dash in for iced coffees in this 15 x 10 foot space.   

At two different times the room was drowned in different loud whirring mechanical noises.   Even if it was a gimmick, or even necessary, it was really uncomfortable.  

There's benches outside but it's more of a come and go place, mainly due to the insane noise antic.

37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-12-12,5.0,"Ingenious idea for fresh coffee. It's a site to see. Visit this place just to see their process with the hoses that shoot the beans to their proper place. 

Each cup is ground fresh and you're guaranteed a recent roast on your beans. 

It's a nice little store but only like four seats. 

Service was great and very friendly."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-03-04,5.0,"Wow. I'm quite impressed by this coffee shop! The coffee beans go through these pipes and its made fresh. It's probably one of the best coffees I've had, the only downside is the price, of course. 

Hazelnut with almond milk (~$6)- This was the smallest cup with an additional charge of $0.75 for almond milk substitute. It tasted perfect-creamy and not too strong with the perfect balance of hazelnut and coffee taste."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2016-11-28,4.0,"If you like coffee, this is a great no frills spot.
Not much in the way of seating and snacks but they've got tons of beans that they'll grind fresh for your morning cup. I always just get a black cup of whatever strikes
me that day and it's on the better end of decent-not the best I've ever had but pretty darn good. 
It can be a little expensive depending on what you order but I think the prices are
 more or less standard for what you're getting and the service is friendly and prompt.
Great spot if you're a real coffee lover-no super sweet ""coffee drinks"" here."

Atmosphere is great even though the spot is pretty small. Also they have yummy cookies"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-09-08,5.0,"Roasting Plant delivers a quality cup of coffee for a decent price. 

The setup inside is honestly very cool. All of the coffee beans are stored in tubes to the right when you walk in. When you order a coffee, the beans fly through tubes (in a blink of an eye!) and is sent to the barista, who brews it fresh. I never experienced coffee with crema on top until visiting roasting plant! 

There is minimal seating inside so it's not a place to hang out, but the delicious coffee makes up for that. 

The baristas here are incredibly friendly, which is so hard to find sometimes. 

My favorite thing to get is a regular hot black coffee- it is just so good and I love trying the different beans and looking for different notes of flavor. 

They also have oat milk which is a huge plus!"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2019-07-19,5.0,Quite possibly the best cuppa coffee I've ever had. Hope to visit again very soon. With so many other coffee places within such close proximity this one shines above them all
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-08-11,4.0,$2.70 for a very good chocolate chip cookie. Super friendly employees and though small inside there is seating with cute little chargers. No credit card minimum. Plenty of coffee and pastry options round this out to make this a worthwhile spot to stop by.

The baristas were super nice and very helpful when I had questions about the menu. I highly recommend Roasting Plant based on the wonderful service alone! 

The coffee was good and tasted really good. They have this very interesting way of making iced coffee - definitely go give it a try."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-11-26,4.0,"Great coffee and cafe but needs more space inside. The best thing about cafes besides drinks is the space and setting, expand this place so we can work inside and we'll be happier. Pastries here are great!!"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-05-15,3.0,The coffee tubes on the wall that shoot beans to the grinder to brew you a fresh cup FREAKED ME OUT since I was pre-caffeinated and half awake. I don't know if I like the gimmick but I guess it's kind of cool? My iced coffee was slightly acidic so next time I'll try some sort of hot brew. Otherwise this is a reliable coffee shop with strong coffee and a variety of options for drinks. There's no room to do work or sit for a chat inside but they open earlier than the other coffee shops in the near vicinity so yay.
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2019-08-22,4.0,"This place might have the best latte I've had. Been here several times and I usually get small or medium iced latte, the espresso is just so strong and delicious with some sweetener. Even better with the vanilla syrup they use. Their flash chilled iced coffee is also really good, strong and smooth. It's also pretty unique with the ""javabot"" they use and all those tubes and the customizable beans options. One star off for the pricing--it's really expensive, 4.90 for the smallest size of an iced latte (12 oz I think) and that's without an alternative milk or flavored syrup. Charging well over 50 cents for syrup is ridiculous. Plus their drinks usually come out really short which I don't appreciate. Also they offered a seasonal rose pistachio latte this summer and when I ordered it they were out of pistachio, but the young man working still charged me the same amount. Should've at least given me a slight discount if you're out of half of what makes the drink what it is."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-05-07,5.0,"This place is super cute! It's a grab and go place but they do have several seats for you to sit. When you order your coffee, you can see the beans get sucked up by the pipes and to the counter. It makes a really loud noise but it's super fun to watch.

I got the tiramisu latte! It actually tasted like tiramisu and was really delicious."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-11-15,5.0,"Ive been here twice to grab a drink. Ive only had their chai latte so i cannot comment on their coffee. The chai latte is very fragrant and i can do w or w/o sweeteners. However, their coffee do smell reallyyyy good! I also think the whole set up where u see the beans run thru the pipes is pretty cool! Never seen that elsewhere.

The staff are also very nice and friendly. There are charging stations and 3 seats alongside the left wall (upon entering) and they have a full section stocked w creamers, milk, sugars etc. to add to ur drink.

It is a small coffee shop and w only 3 seats and armrest space. Could be a nice place to get some work done or kill time. They do have a bench outdoor as well.

No bathrooms, atleast none that i saw."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-03-22,5.0,"Been here a few times before but for their regular coffee. Had a large quad latte with oat milk (tried for the first time), which, unsurprisingly, had a nice nuttiness to it that complimented the espresso. Always enjoyed coming in because of the aroma (from their on site roasting) and consistency. Roasting plant does a great job at not burning their grinds, allowing the natural flavors of the beans to come through."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-12-06,3.0,"With the serious roasting tubes on display I expected the Americano to be above average, but it was a bland wash and a disappointment.

He got to work preparing two bags, a Brasil and a Sumatra, and the total came to about $20.  Well, imagine my surprise when I got home and the coffee was already ground...not a happy surprise.  The grind is nicely coarse so I don't really mind, but there's something about grinding my own that gives me a weird satisfaction.

Next time I'll make sure the beans are whole..."

37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-12-08,3.0,"Went to the Roasting Plant in the west village for years and never had a negative experience. When it closed it broke my heart, and I haven't found a better cup of coffee anywhere else. Finally made it to the LES location and the staff was so rude, and not just to us, to all patrons. Why do people think that being a snotty barista is cool? The coffee is amazing but with so many competing locations nearby, it's risky to be rude to your customers."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2012-07-22,3.0,"$3.50 for a 24oz iced Americano? 
Yes please! 

Their coffee ""grinding machine"" is quite the sight. It's like who ever created this is a mad scientist coffee fanatic. It made me chuckle and it's pretty rad. 

Their coffee, a-ok. 

The dudes working on the Sunday I strolled in were cool. Great soulful tunes were playing that had me singing along with one of the guys. Ohh ohhhh sweet thang. Don't you know know you're my everythang.... 

The little box seats were comfy and bonus for their being outlets at each."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2016-08-15,4.0,"This is such a cool coffee place. Seating is very very minimal though, but the drinks are good. I tried my friends house coffee, it was strong but really good. Make sure to check out the beans in the tubes coming down to the front when you order coffee."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-02-21,5.0,Stopped by to kill time before an interview to get some caffeine. Awesome iced coffee
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2015-04-10,4.0,"I'll keep this short and sweet.

I was going to go to another place when I read a quick review and saw that they had the 'best chai ever'- sold. So, got the chai, a medium for $4.75, and it really was pretty good. Think a souped up Green Mountain Coffee flavor with a little bit more foam. Definitely give it a try because I think this is what chai is supposed to taste like.

Also, if you get coffee, you get to watch the B&H-like process of the beans getting sucked up and sent places by these tubes everywhere. It's pretty cool.

Also, also, there are only 3 seats in there so it's kinda cramped, but they have outlets on them which came in very handy as my phone had just died."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2015-05-04,4.0,"It's a cute small cafe like others have already said. I caught up with a friend over lattes when the wait wasn't too terrible. It wasn't crowded when we were there (around 6pm) so that was a plus. 

Their Matcha Latte is amazing. It's dark the way matcha is suppose to be. The only issue I had was that the latte would be more smooth if it was filtered more finely. There were some grainy bits that I didn't not enjoy tasting. But other than that, this place is great to catch a cup of coffee and do some mild Internet surfing on a lazy afternoon."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2012-02-09,3.0,"*Chocolate Chip Cookie Review Only*

Serious Eats voted their Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2.72) as the best in NYC. 

We were in the area and decided to give it a try. Maybe we got one from a bad batch? The cookie was tasty but not as flavorful as some of the other cookies I've had in the past. It didn't taste fresh. The cookie was way too crisp and not chewy. The chocolate chips weren't nice and gooey. The cashier was super friendly."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2014-06-06,5.0,"I loved how neat it was to see the coffee beans of your flavored choice be sucked up through those clear, very modern,futuristic like tubes to get freshly grinded for your cup of coffee. Along the wall you will see various clear containers displaying coffee beans of all sorts of flavors and from all over the world. I know as a coffee addict, I had a hard time deciding on what to order. Once you place your order at the register, you see the beans get sucked up to the grinder. So cool! It felt like I was on a field trip learning how coffee is made haha. There isn't too many seats available, there was just a few seats by the opposite side of the wall with outlets and enough space for a laptop. The staff is friendly and the coffee is great! Smooth, rich and at least my coffee was strong like I like it. Gotta check it out at least once. Loved it!"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-12-24,5.0,"Unbelievably good coffee. If you have a sensitive stomach and caffeine tends to bother you, order the Guatemala Capetillo Blend. You won't regret it"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-10-28,5.0,"Amazing service and best espresso/ matcha around. Super strong coffee which is always a plus, and it consistently smells of delicious baked goods and fresh roasted beans."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2011-07-08,5.0,"This coffee shop takes freshness to a whole new level!

A former Starbucks executive/engineer came up with the idea of: why not, roast, grind and brew our coffee beans all in the same spot? this bean-to-cup method madness he created guarantees the customer the absolute FRESHEST coffee experience. I mean, these coffee beans are roasted in several small batches throughout the day, but they aren't even ground/brewed until the MOMENT you order it. 

You choose your beans, then a small handful is sent flying through your head in these clear overhead pipes which are directly connected to the automated espresso machine. Your beans are ground and brewed within a couple of minutes of you ordering them. Everything is controlled: water temperature, coarseness/fineness of the grind,etc. You can really taste the difference in Roasting Plant's coffee: no bitterness and you can detect the actual flavors listed on the coffee bean's profile (i.e. smoky, citrusy, etc) I'm not a serious coffee drinker, but this one I especially appreciated because guess what? I didn't feel the need to put so much milk or sugar in my cup. 

Another bonus for getting your cuppa joe here? BEST chewy chocolate chip cookie this side of NYC!"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-07-04,5.0,Friendly barista gave biking recommendations for the area. I love that they will pull a single shot when you need a small boost. The ethiopian coffee is perfect.
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-06-02,4.0,"Tried their matcha latte and white mocha while waiting in line for seats at Dudleys. Their matcha latte was standard, but their coffee is tasty. It is on the pricier side though."

this cute little place had the coffee being ground and roasted as I stepped in the door
in fact the machinery is in the front window
only a couple of odd cube seats but not snuggle warm but this place is teeny tiny so I can understand
I had a lovely gingerbread latte beautiful taste and two very cute and very awesomely spicy ginger bread man cookies  prices are what you expect at upscale good coffee and this is good coffee 
felt that nice buzz of real good  caffeine"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2011-11-22,4.0,"With a bright storefront and clean signage, its not easy to pass Roasting Plant without a curious peek in. And what you'll see will probably amaze you on a gastronomical or engineering standpoint! The narrow shop space is dominated on one side by THE JAVABOT, which roasts and grids coffee as you order it. It is a ton  of fun to watch your little serving of coffee fly through the tubes! 

As for the actual beverages, I was really happy with the mocha cappucino. With low acidity and a medium bitter tang, it was smooth and strong with just enough creaminess. Perry L.'s chai latte milk was a little disspointing though, because the barista added all the steamed milk before the chai had steeped properly. 

With only 5 seats and plenty of outlets, its very tempting to want to stay - but the narrowness of the space doesn't make it very comfortable for getting anything productive done."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-04-05,5.0,"Just as good as the best coffee i had in portland oregan (my fav at the time) now i dont have to wait to be on the westcoast to get good coffee, made the way it was meant to be.  Worth the price, had a triple americano and tasted like angiant espresso! In a good way!  Will be back when visiting mom and pop again. This place is the real mccoy, wish they would have setup near planet donut for their business to be better but its close enough. If the owners read this i highly suggest you take the place of that pizza school near that famous donut sspace"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2016-10-10,4.0,"These coffee tubs are pretty cool - very Willie Wonka. The coffee is delicious (of course) and you can customize it with plenty of free stuff if you want to (many options to sweeten it, some spices...) Also appreciated during the super hot summer: the A/C is strong in that one!"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2013-02-13,4.0,"Cool that you get to choose your type of coffee bean. The beans sucked up via vacumm tubes and grinded in front of you.

Place is small with only 2 or 3 tables to sit on the side.

The condiment table is small and tucked in the front corner of the store, but they keep it clean.  I don't spend too much time there, just dump some agave and milk and I'm out.

Not really a place to hangout, it's more of a grab and go spot for some good quality coffee."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-05-17,5.0,"Good coffee and a great staff. A happy barista staff can be a bit of a rarity in New York City. Always kind, polite, and helpful, not to mention the best and freshest coffee that I've ever found in New York City. Cheers to them!"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2013-05-23,5.0,"I just found my favorite chocolate chip cookie in NYC. Wide and thin, it's every so slightly crispy on the outside, with melting chocolate chips and a slightly chewy texture on the inside. THIS is what a chocolate chip cookie should taste like.

This is a small shop, though they have a pretty cute set up indoors - especially if you're on your own and want to charge a laptop or phone. Lots of little seats, each with their own outlet. The baristas were super nice and even gave hubby and me a couple samples of their other baked goods (though the chocolate chip cookies still reigns supreme!)

It was late in the day, and I was craving an iced coffee but knew I couldn't handle too much caffeine. Decaf coffees are kind of dangerous, but Roasting Plant had a WONDERFUL decaf iced coffee. $5 for an iced coffee and a cookie - $5 VERY well spent."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-01-15,5.0,"Best Americano ever. (Of course, I chose Jamaican Blue Mountain roast!) I've been personally roasting small batches of coffee for the past 10 years. This place is the most unique coffee business I've seen. Not only can you purchase green / raw beans home to roast, you can also choose your own bean when you buy a cup of coffee, drink, or espresso! If you haven't been here or have no idea what I'm talking about, you need to check it out.  Great customer service and awesome coffee!"
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2015-03-18,5.0,"This place has the best, THE BEST, chai tea latte we've ever had.  It's so rich and flavorful.  The tea has a nice spiciness to it, the two of us almost fought for the drink and had to order a second.  The place is so nice and clean with an interesting JavaBot machine.  Next time we come, we'll definitely order a coffee to watch the machine work.  Nice location, nice people, overall wonderful place."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2016-08-11,5.0,"I love this coffee place soo much. It turns coffee into a science. Plus the beans are always fresh. I usually buy beans and use them in my french press cause I like to make my own cold brew. I can totally taste a difference when I get beans from a different place. Roasting Plant is just the best. Prob one of my favorite coffee places in NYC. And when I buy their ice coffee, it just tastes soo rich and flavorful. Good stuff all around."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2018-02-25,5.0,Stopped in on a rainy morning for an almond milk latte.  Servers friendly and the latte was done to perfection.

Even without tweaking it, the espresso is straight forward and flavorful. I ended up preferring the pure Brazil over their default espresso blend."
37,roasting-plant-new-york-4,2017-01-21,1.0,"Manager was pretty rude here. Asked me to sit in the corner cause all I wanted was some coffee. I ended up ordering some food and drinks, but still made me feel as I Was being a burden to her even being here."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2020-03-05,5.0,"Cute shop full of riceball themed apparel. They have a whole list of riceball on the menu. Some typical, some unique, and for a decent price.

Each riceball comes in two sizes, small and large. I went with the large, definitely worth it!

We had the takoyaki riceball, and it was great. Basically imagine someone making takoyaki, cutting it in half, and sticking it inside a riceball. Very satisfied with this snack."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2020-02-22,4.0,"The rice balls here are pretty good. We got the spam riceball and it was made fresh. I like how they teach you on how to eat it. There are five steps in total, which is displayed behind the counter in the screen. 

We also ordered the Japanese, which is made up of seaweed, crab and egg. There are two sizes, small and large. Small ranges between $2.50 to $3.25 before taxes. Large ranges between $4.00 to $5.50 before taxes. 

This is not just a riceball place, they sell bubble tea as well, which I haven't tried. It is also a supermarket of snacks from all over Asia. They sell Hi Chew, Lays, Rice Cake, horn, macadamia, matcha almonds, etc. There are so many snacks! 

The most popular riceballs accordingly to the lady behind the counter is the Japanese, shrimp and chicken.

Plan to return to try the others!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2020-01-28,5.0,"A place I always have to go to when I visit NYC. Nice location with seating areas to chill with friends and just hangout. The staffs are super friendly as well. 

I always order the Japanese rice ball for myself and or the Yaya with shrimp for my friend. It is a good price as well. I believe the Japanese rice ball is $2.75 and the yaya with shrimp is $3.25. For the drinks, I always enjoyed ""First Love"" and ""Boyfriend"". I like ""first love"" and ""boyfriend"" because it has my favorite flavor in them. Those two have great combinations of flavors. I ordered the jasmine milk tea this time with 50% sugar. 

Will come back again the next time i visit the city and try something different."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2020-04-29,5.0,Love this place their fruity teas are delicious and the food as well. I'll be going back there's still a lot of things on the menu that I have to try out.
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2020-04-10,4.0,"The drinks here have such fun and unique names like ""boyfriend"", ""better life"", or ""second chance"". I go here for fruity tea drinks and all the locations are very cute on the inside. They also have snack shelves with all of your favorite Asian snacks. It's a good spot for meeting up with friends and I also like to grab an onigiri as a snack. I usually go for the salmon one, but I know there are a lot of options to choose from. Be sure to go and get yourself a hot ""boyfriend"" ;) (or a cold one too, whatever floats your boat)"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2020-03-21,2.0,"Had dinner in Chinatown after 'Super Saturday' festivities. We walked around looking for an inexpensive spot to have dessert/ drink. The area was pretty quiet (9p), & nothing seemed open (possibly due to coronavirus). We stumbled upon this place, & went in; mainly b/c there was seating. Jasmine tea was good. Bubble tea was below average. Tasted very light, & the boba was semi tough. Turns out they were almost closing. Our group only got to spend 20 mins. here, before having to leave."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-12-31,4.0,"Yaya is a solid boba and onigiri spot. Although there's a steady line, most people do take out so there are seats available. 

Yaya is cute, though it might not be the most aesthetic café in the area. The prices are reasonable though. 

They have cute messages on the cups and they also sell Japanese and other Asian snacks. 

I'd recommend Yaya!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-12-03,4.0,"[Summer post] I rarely go to Chinatown anymore and when I do I need my besties help with choosing the right place to eat! She suggested Yaya Tea and I'm happy she did! 

I ordered the most liked drink called..
I Love Yaya
Strawberry, Mango, and Passion Fruit Oolong Tea
The tea is good and love the combination!

I also ordered a Takoyaki rice ball to eat. They have a very unique way of wrapping the rice ball so be careful and please follow the instructions given!

The only complaint was they didn't have any AC in the 80 degree weather. #sweating while #eating and #drinking lol

A super cute and cozy cafe, maybe too cozy that I was sweating haha"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-09-29,4.0,"I came to Yaya Tea after JapanFes. The decorations were nice and modern, and there was no seating when we first entered, but it eventually cleared up a bit. We got onigiris, salmon and spam. They offer the onigiris in small or large size, but we chose to get small. We also wanted to get a drink at first because the pictures looked really appealing and cute. However, when we realized that the bottles are an extra cost, we decided not to. The price of the drinks is not bad and the plastic bottles are also cute, but not as cute as the glass ones. 

As for the food itself, we waited less than 5 minutes for the food to be ready. The rice balls were warm and the rice was nice and chewy. It was confusing how to open and unwrap the onigiri, but still enjoyable. The salmon was cooked and there were black sesame seeds too. Not too salty and an excellent choice for my taste buds! The spam was ok, but it was not anything that special. I would have tried something else instead of spam. 

The tea names are pretty interesting, like ""Blue Blood."" After I finished my food, I wanted to order tea, but the line was about to go out the door so I opted to go somewhere else since there are so many other places to explore in Chinatown! Definitely recommend coming here at least once!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-06-25,3.0,"I was really craving onigiri, and saw that Yaya Tea Garden offered BOTH rice balla and boba!!!! So I had to haul myself halfway across town to try Yaya before it closed.

Overall, the riceballs were a bit disappointing. There aren't that many options, particularly fish-oriented options, which is what I was looking for. After reading through reviews and looking at pictures, I ended up choosing the Yaya Chicken and the Japanese (egg and crab). I really enjoyed the seaweed salad in both, but the Yaya chicken was a little dry, and I just expected more than imitation crab and half hard-boiled egg in the Japanese. The boba was also just ok - the tea was decent and not sweet, which I enjoyed, but overall it was nothing special. 

I might stop by again to pick up snacks or try something new, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2020-01-09,4.0,"This place is a hidden hole in the wall! We were waiting to eat at Hometown Hot Pot & KBBQ down the block and we decided to wait at Yaya. Because we were starving, we decided to get some onigiris as snacks. I'm so glad we did because they hit the spot! 

Food - I ordered the Spicy Crawfish Riceball and the Salmon Onigiri. The salmon was good but it tasted like normal cooked salmon and rice. The spicy crawfish was the one that stood out to me. It tasted like cajun sushi. I would highly recommend you get this!

Decor - The inside of the shop and even the sign is so cute and decorated with onigiri and boba with faces. 

Drink - My SO got the Hulk boba drink and he said it tasted pretty good. 

All in all, I highly recommend this shop for snacks. (It turned out better than hometown.) The only thing I didn't like was how the onigiri didn't stay together, so it was messy to eat and hard to split."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-11-17,4.0,"Good place to rest and get a snack if already in Chinatown. They have bubble tea and rice balls. 

Bubble tea selection: cool mixes of different Chinese flavors with fruit flavors. I like the drinks, but the tapioca bubbles didn't taste as good,  texture a bit off 

The rice balls: had the shrimp tempura. The shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly. Rice ball had plenty of rice, and it came out warm. I wish the rice would have been seasoned, or had vinegar, it was just white rice."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-05-20,5.0,"Super duper cute spot! Great for getting work done but unfortunately no WiFi. I'm a boba lover, and this place is near the top of my list in terms of favorite tea places. So much variety and so many fun names! It's kind of overwhelming so I like to pick from the favorites/suggestions section on the menu. 
I got two onigiri: spam and Japanese (seaweed, egg, and crab), and they were really yummy! For snack lovers, they have a nice variety of Asian snacks to enjoy along with your tea. There's a lot of room for customization for both flavors and chewy add ons. Large windows bringing in lots of light and a few plants make this place just Uber kawaii to me. 
I'm definitely coming back!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-12-28,5.0,"Great vibes, great boba and snacks. I've been coming to yaya for years and whenever I am back in New York I make sure to stop by. I am allergic to milk which makes this place fantastic because a majority of their teas are fruit teas. The onijiri or rice balls are great and a great snack. I love Yaya!"

Extremely nice and helpful. Never been to a Tea Shop like this. Back home we tend to have the traditional Taiwanese Tea shops that I absolutely love! This was a change, but a GOOD change.

Drinks:
My hubster ordered The Hulk Tea (Green Apple & Kiwi Green Tea) 
I went with  Aries Honey Tea (Chrysanthemum and Jasmine) with Aloe Vera Jellies 

OMG!! They were refreshing and loved them both!!

Got the octopus rice ball which was really interesting , chewy dough inside.

The Japanese rice ball was decent too, a lot of rice. Would probably prefer the shrimp tempura or yayas chicken, more flavor and protein, and texture.

The pork belly chips were interesting tasted like onion.

Service: caddie was very kind

Interior; pretty spacious and the lights were rly dim though on 12.26.18 thought the shop was closed from far away


5.13 my friend got the 3 rice balls, fav was crab and shrimp tempura!!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-09-25,5.0,Found this on Yelp. Decide to come here for a small lunch. The salmon onigiri was good. Is like a small snack to grab or take it around. The White Peach iced tea was sweet and smooth. Fill with jelly. Was a nice drink to try out
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-05-04,4.0,"A little bubble tea place downtown with a number of specialty bubble teas. The place was pretty packed at 2pm, it was a pretty popular looking spot right on the corner.

I had the ""I love Yaya"" which was a passion fruit drink, and I asked for 50% on the sugar. It definitely wasn't too sweet at all, it almost tasted like regular tea in a way but it was still good! And refreshing. You're also able to make anything sweeter if it's not as sweet as you'd like. 

The prices are also very reasonable with the small bubble teas at $3, medium $4, and large at $5. The small is a perfect size if you just need a little bubble tea pick me up. That I liked a lot, especially since it was my first time there and I didn't know what I'd love."

My only complaint would be that it's not stuffed much, I guess you can't expect more for the prices but it would've been nice to have less rice and more filling, even if it was just seaweed. Overall really good snack or lunch if you get 2 or 3!"

The packaging was cute and the matcha latte tasted great! Not too sweet and not a grainy texture which I appreciated. Would be back to try more of the drink selection!
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-07-15,4.0,"The yogurt popping boba is so unique! It tastes like yakult packed in cute juicy pearls, and pairs very well with the fruit tea. I ordered white peach tea with 25% sweetness. The packaging is adorable; I love the roundness of the cups! Do drink it quickly before the ice melts though. The tea tasted more watered down after I walked around with it in hot weather. 

Will be back to try their onigiri!"

I do know they have several locations. They do serve light snacks and food as well. Their main drink is focused on tea instead of bubble tea. I enjoyed the drink that I order, great refreshing taste for a hot day in NYC. Not to mention the rice ball that they made were quite tasty as well. DON'T forget to check in, they will offer you a free spicy mayo sauce. If you are going to get some rice ball to eat. Great spot to go if you are in the mood for some ice cold refreshing drink and light food. Service is great, food and drink are affordable. Now that is what I like! :D"

It's a new and clean restaurant with good service, I might drop in again to try other offerings but I would not get the iced matcha again."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-06-30,3.0,I usually go to the Brooklyn location but since it was closed I came here because I was really craving. Food was good as always. The reason I give this 3 stars is because the whole place smelled disgustingly of BODY ODOR. They had the AC blasting but it was really hot and stuffy if u weren't at the cashier area. The place smelled overwhelmingly of body odor and the customers definitely noticed. I don't think I can blame this on one person because many people came & left during the time and the stench was EVERYWHERE AND I SMELT IT in every breath i took. I intended to sit and eat but the stench ruined my appetite and I ended up eating outside. Please please fix your ventilation I will give it a try next time but the AC situation needs to be fixed
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-04-06,3.0,"Nicely done bubble tea as the default black milk, not too sweet. The bubbles have no sweetness in the center though, which was odd as they didn't give the same taste throughout."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-09-25,4.0,"Great spot to take a break! My friends and I took a bubble tea and snack break here on a Sunday afternoon. It was not busy at all! 

There is almost an overwhelming variety of choices for drinks! They also have funny names like ""First Love"" or ""Green Hulk"". My hubby and I shared a large cup of ""I Love Yaya"" which is Strawberry, Mango, and Passion Fruit Oolong with coconut jelly. We both thought it was okay. It is not the highest quality of tea or bubble tea but it was okay. 
Onigiri's come in two sizes and various of flavors. They are made fresh and hot!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-06-09,5.0,"Grab and go quick rice balls  and bubble tea place. $2.50-5.50 range. If you are on the go, this is a great place."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-12-04,4.0,"Good spot to stop by to grab small bites and tea.
Friendly staff, fast service.
Would love to come back and try their food."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2020-01-05,5.0,Love coming to this place. It's a very bright and lively spot. My friend and I were in for a long wait with a dinner place nearby so decided to come in here to try out their teas and get a small snack. We ordered the salmon and pork belly special onigiri along with a custom passionfruit green tea with boba. We also got a small tub of spicy mayo for the onigiri. Hands down the spiciest mayo I've ever tried...it was fantastic. The pork belly special onigiri was also delicious...would highly recommend if you can get them!
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-09-01,5.0,Got the Japanese seaweed riceball with imitation crab and egg and a shrimp tempura riceball. Perfect snack or light lunch to eat on the go. I've been going to their original branch on Chrystie Street for over 5+ years now and this is the first time getting the riceballs at this location. Same great taste! And the seating is not spacious.
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-10-25,3.0,"It's a stiff competition when it comes to boba tea in NYC. I'm rating this place in comparison to all the boba teas I've had thus far (and I've had thousands). I ordered the peach/mango tea, which is their most popular item on the menu. Here is my overall opinion..It's alright... The tea tasted like they used artificial mango/peach syrup (Not real fruit). I'm glad I added aloe as a topping to the tea which saved the day."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-04-23,5.0,"What a perfect find! We were walking around hoping for a quick snack which wasn't a baked good. We stumbled in here and it was perfect. Ample seating and cheap delicious eats. 
We got rice balls and teas for 3 and spent no more than $14. Everything was freshly prepared delicious."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-07-09,4.0,"What started out as a single shop in Manhattan has become a New York City staple for fruity teas and delicious rice balls (onigiri). In the span of a decade, Yaya Tea Garden has expanded to beyond the first Manhattan location to popular hangout spots in Brooklyn as well. 

The teas are always refreshing and the rice balls are always hot and hits the spot. Look no further than Yaya's next time you are in the mood for teas!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-09-30,4.0,"It's not as hype as before but still a familiar place to go back to from time to time. They changed their cups and probably jacked up the price. After trying a myriad of rice balls, the rice balls from yayas comfort me in a strange way. It's a really nice hangout spot when it's not crowded but during the school year around 3-6 it's always busy with kids getting out of school or after school. There are hiccups with the taste and quality of the food sometimes but I come back because I've been a customer for over four years."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2020-02-25,4.0,"Their drinks are on the sweet side and taste very syrupy. While I'd never go back here for their drinks, their rice balls are amazing. The rice-to-filling ratio is perfect and they're so fresh. Yum!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-08-20,5.0,"A friend and I were in need of a quick snack and onigiri sounded like a solid plan. What i thought would be pre-made rice balls we'd choose from a display case, were made-to-order, warm and delicious. I got the small version of shrimp tempura, and a small spicy seafood - and they were so satisfying! My friend ordered the large vegetarian onigiri and a bubble tea - and she loved hers, too. What make this place even better is the seating by the window - it's such a great place sit, chat and watch people go by in a busy part of the city. Will definitely be making repeat visits to this place."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2020-02-08,2.0,"I really hate that I have to write this review because this is my literal favorite spot to hang out and eat at in all of NYC; nevertheless, I will.

last week I went into this Yaya's Tea Garden for my usual, and the food was amazing as usual...but the music was not. I don't know about you guys, but when I'm enjoying my food at Yaya's, I don't like to hear music that's provocatively descriptive in oral sex, f***ing, and dropping the word N**ga more than the whole entire black community itself. The songs that were played were highly inappropriate and not even played in the most hardcore tattoo shops I've been in over the years. I'm black and I don't even listen to that kind of music nor do I like, use, or condone the term N**gga; especially not in a Japanese tea and onigiri joint!

It got to the point where one guy that was sitting behind me was turned off by the music as well; he gave me a look and I gave him a look and we both started gathering our things and preparing to leave. The song that was playing in that moment was at a part where some guy was talking about f***ing a girl and her sucking off his d*** and...well, it was wild. I love you Yaya's Grand street, but that playlist was out of control! I won't be back most likely!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-08-20,4.0,"Always a reliable spot to get my onigiri. Warm and freshly made in the back and to order for cheap. It's also super fun to unwrap and refold. 2 onigiris are usually enough to fill me up. My favorite is the japanese rice ball which contains egg and my favorite kinda mayo - kewpie! This location is nicer compared to the original, but seats can get filled pretty quickly."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-11-29,5.0,"If you've never had a rice ball aka onigiri...this is the place to try your first one. Your life will never be the same again.

I was nearby after getting some ice cream so decided to get some rice balls to go. It's so nice that it's made fresh and still warm when they give it to you.

I decided on the Japanese and shrimp tempura. I wish they had a stamp card for the rice balls! That'd be soo cool. 

The Japanese onigiri was the bomb dot com. Seriously I was wondering why I didn't come here sooner. What kind of rice balls have I been eating?! (cheap ones that had a teaspoon of filling). This was a game changer that's for sure. The mix of seaweed salad, imitation crab and boiled egg was perfect. 10/10 would get this again...I think I'll definitely have to try the other popular flavors too. The rice to filling ratio is on point too. You get a bite of filling in every bite! 

The shrimp tempura was okay. A whole piece inside packed white rice. The rice was pretty tasty too. But I liked the Japanese onigiri more. 

If you have two of these, it can honestly fill you up enough as meal...or you can just have one as a snack. My tip is to blast these in the microwave for 20 seconds before eating because they are sooo much tastier when eaten warm!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-12-24,2.0,"Omg. So watered down, I cannot believe I paid $3.82 for this!!! I'm so annoyed already bc many customers were complaining with me that the guy making the drink was SLOW and then the drink ending up like this? Ugh. Might as well purchased the Poland spring water they sell for cheaper. 

My husband tells me that everyone says this place is good but for a 16 min wait for my drink like this? Not worth it. Please walk the extra couple of minutes to another tea place. Anywhere! 

Added another star bc the girl in the front taking orders was cute and super sweet. Thank goodness someone there knows what they're doing."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-10-24,3.0,"This place is trendy looking with a small seating area that has 1 long hipster-type bench and a couple of other seats along the walls/windows.  There are a variety of bubble teas and fruity flavored teas, a small snack menu (such as rice balls stuffed with various ingredients) and a wall full of Japanese pre-packaged snacks.  
The teas are ok but there are so many bubble tea shops these days- I don't see how the teas here stand out.  We ordered the chicken which ended being a rice ball stuffed with chicken. My husband thought it was ok; i wasn't crazy about it.   i'd like to try some of the other rice balls next time."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-04-12,4.0,"This place isn't serious and I love it for that.

It's literally bubble tea and onigiri. I've had better onigiri (handmade with special ingredients and care) BUT they have a lot of fun flavor combos and when you're hungry it hits the spot. It's also handmade in the back kitchen and comes sealed with a cute sticker.

I love the jelly options here. The bubble tea options aren't THAT extensive but enough for you to get something you'd like. Lots of wide open space for eating and it's pretty bright with the natural light from the windows. The snack wall is impressive but probably not worth the money unless you're craving a Japanese snack. 

Overall a cute concept. And the happy onigiri plushes help keep the mood bright."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-07-15,3.0,"Just okay... the drink selection is not as expansive as other bubble tea spots which was disappointing. 

When we went they had just run out of boba. Not sure how you can be a bubble tea spot and run out of boba. They do have a wide variety of Asian snacks and candies as well as food items. 

It was good enough for an emergency bubble tea stop and satisfied our thirst."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-06-14,5.0,"We came here by chance looking for a place to chill and get refreshed and a snack from sighting and walking for hours. The place we're suppose to have for dinner is a hotpot BBQ restaurant nearby this place. Inside is very nicely decorated with things on the wall and Japanese snacks to buy. The lighting gives the place a warm and modern look. I got the I Love Yaya drink which is Strawberry/Mango/Passionfruit Oolong Tea with Mango Star Jelly and the Yaya Chicken Rice ball. They both are very delicious!!  The tea is not too sweet but sweet enough with the mango star jellies. Also, the Yaya Chicken Rice ball has sweet-flavored grilled chicken with seaweed salad. I loved it! My friend got the Hulk drink which is Green Apple/Kiwi Green Tea and the Shrimp Tempura Rice Ball.  Both of those were really good as well!! The employees are super friendly and informative as well on any items if you have any questions. They even gave suggestions on popular rice ball flavors!! I would highly recommend this place to anyone in Chinatown NYC. You won't be disappointed!!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-11-26,4.0,"YAAAAAS HONAAAY YAAAS. Boba? Bomb. Rice Balls? Super bomb. They should just rebrand themselves as Yaya Onigiri Bomb Diggity. I came in the first time and tried the salmon rice ball and 'second chance' (I'm not making this up, look at what they name their drinks). Sooooo guuuud. Filling is well portioned with the rice, the fish was nicely seasoned and tender. Seaweed had a satisfying crunch to it. My friend and I came back here the next day and I ordered the tuna, crab, shrimp tempura, and fried squid ball onigiri (no shame).

Is it authentic with true origins tracing back to Japan? I have no clue. All I know is that it tastes good."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-06-12,3.0,"The place looks good from the outside and inside is really nice and cozy.
But the bubble tea is another story.  From the menu all is looking up and up.

The bubble tea kind of taste watery, no taste to it.
It was my first time there, so I give them the benefit of the doubt.
Maybe it was just a bad one, next time it might be better.

You should go try it out because each individual have their own taste.
Just because I said it tastes watery does not mean it is."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-09-25,5.0,Love the rice balls! I tried almost all their rice balls and I liked all of them! The place is nice and clean just gets a bit crowded during lunch time. I usually go for the Hulk with green tea jelly and a rice ball makes a great small lunch but if im really hungry then one more! Hahaha They also have little cute snacks on the side shelf. The glass bottles are super cute i got the blue one with ears!
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-05-28,5.0,"Very tasty! The bubble tea is made to perfection and the rice balls are delicious.  I try to go there every other week. Staff is very polite. The service is very fast and efficient. 

The boba is very refreshing and comes in various flavors. I love the ""Boyfriend"" with mango popping boba. Yaya Tea lets costumers make their own drink! Lets talk about the rice balls. The ""Spring Roll"" rice ball is my favorite. It very easy and fun to eat! Appetizers are beautifully made. 

Very responsible prices. I would come here everyday if I could."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-03-12,5.0,"I like this place a lot. There aren't that many places in the city that you can get a Japanese rice ball. Its ~$2.5 for a small one and $4 for a large (give or take depending on the flavor).

I've tried many of their flavors before. The yaya chicken is very yummy but their fish one could use a little more fish in it. 

It's a really chill place for people to hang out. You see a lot of high school kids here after school and on the weekends. Couples coming here to grab a bubble tea and snack. Non-asians come here too! The food is good and the place is very inviting to people of all cultures, ethnicities and races!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-08-18,2.0,"I used to like this place. I love their rice ball there. It's freshly made and warm. On my visit this time, I experienced an unfriendly, not engaging  cashier. The rice ball didn't taste as fresh as it used to be.

Besides the visit, 
- Japanese Ball is a must to try. Very delicious and most popular. 
- Shrimp tempura and seaweed rice balls are the classical, worth trying for. 

I hope maybe in the future, there may be more options to choose from and be creative with it. 
Rating of the foods and drinks, I would give it a 3 out of 5."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2017-12-14,3.0,"Unlike most bubble tea spots which use powders to make their bubble teas, Yaya Tea Garden actually use real tea leaves to make their beverages which is a huge perk for those who are into real foods and drinks. I ordered the Tealuxe Honey Latte, which is a mix of osmathus/rose with honey and milk. I found the flavor to be a bit bland as there isn't much of the rose or honey flavor. They also have matcha/green tea jelly substitute for those who don't care for tapioca pearls....unfortunately they have been out for the past two weeks that I was there. This place also has onigiri and I really liked their shrimp tempura onigiri. 

$10 minimum if you want to use a credit card."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-07-27,4.0,"Pretty solid spot for Onigiri on the corner of Grand St. Always stop by whenever I'm there and in need of a snack. Haven't had anything else from them though. 

I do recommend getting the spicy mayo if you like spicy mayo. I get it with the shrimp tempura Onigiri every time."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-05-30,4.0,My favorite rice ball from here is the shrimp tempura then the Japanese rice ball. The rice balls always the same quality when you receive them no matter what day or time you place the order. However the drinks always seems to a bit water down every single time I've gotten them.
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-08-25,4.0,Cool atmosphere and delicious teas! Not too sweet and the flavor combos were amazing. The shop was packed so it was a good place to stop in for a refreshing tea and drink it while you walk through the streets of SoHo.
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2018-02-14,5.0,"COME HERE FOR RICE BALLS. Their bubble teas are just ok. BUT THEIR RICE BALLS THOUGH. 

Their extensive menu made me dizzy. But I went with the special crawfish onigiri (rice ball) and it was AMAZING. Also, shrimp tempura! I want all their rice balls!!"
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-04-22,4.0,"My friends and I stumbled in here after finding ourselves suddenly very hungry whilst walking around on a beautiful day. I'm so glad we did because it was a great find and I definitely will visit again. 

I got one of the limited edition riceballs--the spicy crawfish one--and it was delicious! It was only 3$ for a small, and the small was actually pretty big. It had lots of crawfish and yummy seaweed salad inside. I don't even like seaweed salad normally, but this was the perfect salty, fresh crunchiness to balance out the spicy crawfish. The rice was sticky and it held together very well. They also wrap the onigiri cleverly so that the nori is separated from the rice until you eat it, which means it doesn't get soggy. 

I also got the taro bubble tea. It wasn't the best bubble tea I've ever had--the flavor came from a powdered mix and tasted slightly artificial. The tapioca bubbles were pretty good though. However, it was only 3$ which is substantially cheaper than most bubble tea places in the city, so I think the quality is proportionate with the price. 

The service was very quick too! This is a great place to grab a snack if you're in the neighborhood."
38,yaya-tea-garden-new-york-6,2019-05-10,5.0,"This branch of Yaya is decorated really nicely and a good place to sit and people watch. The drinks are weirdly named, but almost all of them a pretty good. The new Yuzu drinks are sweet but refreshing. My friends like the onigiris or riceballs. They usually get the shrimp tempura or chicken one. Service is fast even when the shop gets packed. It's a nice spot to hang out with your friends to catch up and good for snacks."

very cozy.
little students studying, reminded me of college!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-07-27,2.0,"Not your typical Chinese bakery, good start. Cute spot. Nice barista. Loud owner disturbing the tranquility at way too early hours... 9:30am...  just cuz you're in Chinatown, don't mean you shout like Chinatown. 

I ordered a simple Ice-Americano with a tad bit of milk.  It was awful. The shot of espresso was weak AF.   It felt like I was drinking regular ice coffee.  

Should've just stuck with going to Sweet Moment for cold brew... ugh."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-03-19,5.0,"Great service! Coffee is a great price and the girl making our order was very nice. We got an autumn spice latte and a regular latte. Place is clean and has an assortment of baked goods (didn't get to try those). 

This place is much better than SBucks."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2020-02-16,1.0,"Gave a star because of the cute shop with a big window view. However, the smoothies we ordered looking nice but tasteless even for a hot day...So no thanks won't be back"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-02-19,4.0,This is a small tea shop in China Town. There were very limited number of seats. But the shop was neat. I went with a hot mocha latte. It was good.
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-10-20,5.0,"Amazing coffee shop ! Small location, right in the entry of Little Italy. The worker was helpful & kind."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-01-10,5.0,Really cozy little coffee shop near Chinatown. The drinks were great and reasonably priced (though the chai latte was a bit too sweet for my taste). There isn't much seating but that's what makes it cozy. The barista was quick and knowledgeable and made all 4 of our drinks within a few minutes. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area looking for coffee.
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-11-20,4.0,"Great place to do a couple of hours of work...plenty of outlets..free wifi (A bit slow, needed to opt for my own wifi hotspot)..music can be a bit noisy..but overall, good coffee/tea and ambiance."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-02-05,2.0,"Nearly 5.50 for a regular oat milk latte. Tastes the same as other coffee shops, but other places don't charge a FULL dollar more for the oat milk substitute. Wow, you can get the same for less at Jack's, especially where regardless of almond or soy or oat, it's the same additional cost. As for brand of oat meal, most coffee shops probably use Oatly so I don't see any reason in justifying the cost as if some superior brand is used? Small coffee shop, not much seating room. Good and quick service otherwise."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-07-17,4.0,"Nice little coffee shop between Chinatown and Little Italy. I stopped here to take an iced coffee cooldown break on a 95 degree day in July. But in that crowded mess in the Little Italy and Chinatown intersection, it's hard to find 'actual' coffee.

The iced coffee here is solid, and the barista was super friendly. Inside it's a little cramped though.

Overall, a good pit stop when you're in the area."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-06-27,5.0,"This is absolutely my most favorite coffee spot here in Chinatown! It's really rare to find cafes like this, small and one person handled. My experiences with this cafe are pleasant enough that I would make continuous returns back here for my daily cup of Joe. The barista is very nice and even remembers what I usually order when I do make a trip there. I haven't really tried much of the sweet drinks because of my palette so I can't really speak much on the lattes or other drinks. Although I can vouch for the coffee and the Americanos! It's delicious and at the same time pack a pretty strong punch! Make a visit here if you want a petite cafe and kind barista that always greet you with a huge smile. 

PS: she's really fast! No need to worry about waiting forever!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-11-14,5.0,Unpretentious find! It's a small but warm place. You can pop in for a coffee or enjoy the lively people watching by the window.
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2016-12-12,4.0,"There was one morning when I said to my boyfriend that I wished there was a real coffee shop in Chinatown that made cold brew (total coffee fanatic over here) and NOT Starbucks (although I do love Starbucks). He said there's not a lot of people in Chinatown that would appreciate cold brew so the chance of me finding it would be slim. On a random Friday morning I was passing by Mott Street when I saw there was a chalkboard outside of 12 Corners that said they had cold brew! 

12 Corners is definitely small with limited seats compared to other coffee shops and cafes around Chinatown. The barista/cashier lady was super nice, friendly, and helpful. The cold brew was top notch! Very good quality and I expressed to her how happy I was that they had cold brew because it is not a common item you would find in Chinatown. 

I am super happy to have found 12 corners and know that they serve cold brew. Now I don't have to look very far in Chinatown if I am itching for a cold brew."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-01-14,3.0,"The location on East Broadway is top 5 coffee shop in NYC quality. The Mott Street Location does not nearly measure up. The top of my latte was too watery. The microfoam and latte art was average. Nevertheless, the drink was much better after the top. It was much more smoother. Overall, it was acceptable but nothing special."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-02-24,5.0,In the heart of Chinatown and great place to grab a drink and people watch. Loved it here and would drop by again the next time I visit!
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-04-14,5.0,Such a great little shop. And the guy behind the counter could not have been more helpful and polite. Not a lot of seating but relaxing and convenient. Highly tecommended.
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-11-12,5.0,"I really like this place to study. Right in the heart of chinatown, this place is cozy with a very friendly ambience. The staff there is friendly and the beverages there are good. This place is very popular amongst the locals as I see people walking in and out constantly when I'm there.  

It is a small coffee shop but there are about 3-4 tables crammed in. I've been here a couple of times to study and its a nice place to get work done. There are other like minded people like you if you're looking for a quiet place to study."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-05-04,5.0,"Legit coffee place in Chinatown, used to love coming here for my morning/afternoon coffees before my company moved from the area!!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2016-05-22,5.0,"I've probably walked past 12 Corners about four times during my visit to New York, but I finally got to stop in before I headed back to Vegas. 

Located in the neighborhood, from what I'm told is called, ""Chibeca"", this place makes the all things a coffee addict like myself needs. Cold Brew, Espresso, Red Eyes, Americano and the list goes on. They also exclusively use Kobrick Coffee which is a New York based coffee roaster that started almost one-hundred years ago. 

I went with the ""Red Eye"", hot brewed coffee with an add shot. This was great, no burnt coffee taste with just a slight bite from the espresso. Need to get somewhere fast or make pace marks in the floor of your apartment? Then this place has you covered."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-03-28,4.0,"Good service and great coffee. The ambiance is calming and has a great vibe. Small and quaint. Not many flavor options, and some of them are out of season (pumpkin in march) but all in all a nice little coffee shop"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-04-23,4.0,"12 Corner serves Kobrick coffee, and has been constantly rated as No.1 coffee shop in NYC, by Business Insider. Probably the ranking was biased towards flavor or coffee bean quality, as I was a bit underwhelmed by the decoration inside the tiny shop, one thing I was always looking for when doing my coffee exploration. 

Signature drinks - pumpkin latte, matcha latte, chai latte. Would probably give a try on matcha latte next time stopping by this neighborhood."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-09-29,4.0,"I found this corner place to be good for coffee and sitting and doing work. However, I did go for amazing latte art, as it was advertised, and I was somewhat disappointed. But the latte that I did get was really good!
While it has great WiFi, you can not go here for very long stays because there is no place to plug in laptops. The music is a little loud and it does get crowded, but if you do get a good seat, it is a great place to relax for a little while in the heart of Chinatown."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2019-04-26,1.0,"I ordered a cappuccino and she asked me what size, and that should've been a red flag. Their small was already about 12oz (more than the usual 6oz), so I can't imagine how much is in a large. The drink itself was pretty bad. It was bland, no texture and was scalding hot (temperature is a pretty important factor in brewing). I burnt my tongue. Lacking the basics here."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-02-24,4.0,"A small cozy coffee shop in the busy Mott Street. While Starbucks is in Canal street and the Caffè Bene down the block has closed down, there isn't much American coffee shops in the community. 

While not everyone knows how to enjoy good coffee, their coffee is freshly brewed and quickly served. My favorite is the hot mocha and the green tea latte. Also when you get latte they also do latte art onto it. They also have a few different croissants (chocolate, almond, ham and cheese and plain) and muffins occasional. 

The staffs here are very friendly and the environment is very clean.
The only problem for me is when I want to get breakfast along with my coffee, there isn't a lot of options."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2016-08-09,4.0,"This place is such a cute coffee shop in Little Italy (Chinatown)!

I came in on a Friday afternoon around 2-3pm with my friend. I got the Matcha latte-Small and my friend got the Mocha latte-Large. 
Service was friendly as well which is a big plus. Prices are reasonable as well. 
They are partnered up with Cups App.

The matcha latte tastes really good with Honey. They have a condiment section where they have simple syrup, honey, straws, and mixing straws as well for your coffee / tea. 

The interior is very cute, they do have seating available. They use to have wifi in there but I guess they don't have wifi there anymore since I checked. 

Would come here again to try their other coffee's out when I get the chance :)!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-04-02,4.0,"This is a solid coffee shop in Chinatown. We stopped by while waiting for the restaurants we wanted to visit to open up. The menu is simple, but covers items for both coffee drinkers and their counterparts. 

They serve both 12 and 16 oz lattes. The 12 oz lattes have 2 shots of espresso, while the 16 oz lattes have 4 shots. Since the price difference is only $0.50, I'd definitely recommend going with the large latte if you need the extra oomph in your day. Lattes to be enjoyed in house are only served in 12 ounce cups though, so keep that in mind. Our lattes were delicious and thoughtfully poured. 

Since we were the first patrons of the day, we pretty much had our pick of seating in the cafe. However, by 10:30AM on a Sunday, the small shop was already at its capacity. I would recommend 12 Corners both as a good grab-n-go coffee spot, or a place to meet up with friends and chat, although it can get pretty crowded on weekends."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-06-28,5.0,"I make it my regular stop in the morning. there's nothing better than a good cup of coffee and a nice smile to start your day. at 12corners, you're guaranteed both."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-11-05,4.0,"This is my go-to study/work spot. It's pretty small but usually not crowded, usually 1-2 people staying there and people coming in and out. Great wifi and the coffee is not particularly strong but good enough for me :) It's on a corner in Chinatown and the windows with lots of foot traffic make for great people-watching. The one barista I see there is always really nice and the drinks are made super quick. Recommend for a place to get a few hours of work done or catch up with a friend!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-12-30,5.0,"Great coffee and customer service, small and centrally located. Two large coffees were $10ish with tip. Pretty small, but cozy :)"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-03-21,4.0,"This location is a nice haven from the madness that is Mott Street. It's surprising how chill I felt while sipping my matcha tea latte and nibbling on a croissant mid-day, mid-week on this super commercial stretch in the heart of Manhattan Chinatown, Part (insert iteration number here). Granted, this is no cheap cup of coffee/tea, so despite how small it is, you might as well sit your butt down and savor the hell out of your $8 coffee/snack splurge. I was hoping that their prices wouldn't be quite so on par with the fancy fancy shops, but I guess the answer to that question is always: ""the rent is too damn high!""

I enjoy the book library. Availability of plugs. Ease of paying with credit card. AND, the croissant was surprisingly better than many I've had during my previous chocolate croissant hunts throughout the city. The pastries here are by Ceci-Cela, which was not on my radar before, but CLEARLY needs to get on there now. (And according to my quick research, the rest of the world was already well informed that their croissants rank nearly best in the city, so allow me to crawl back under my rock.)

My best memory of this spot was overhearing two middle-aged men on a lunch break discussing Trump, the election, and the current administration. I really enjoyed eavesdropping on others discussing the layman's perspective politics and civics. 'Twas the silver lining in day that needed some positivity!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2016-02-28,5.0,"Ordered a soy matcha latte.  The barista warned me that they make it unsweetened, which was fine.  I actually prefer my drinks unsweetened. The matcha wasn't bitter. I would order it again.

The cafe was very cozy.  There are 3 small tables and a barstool table by the window."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-01-17,5.0,"I literally cannot get through life ( or my day) without you guys. I tried to go cold turkey and took a break for a few days but I come running back. 
They have the nicest and friendliest guys working here. Every time they hand me my cup of caffeine i feel my day is instantly better!! Thank You!!

it would be awesome if they have a reward card here for their loyal customers."

Four Stars


This small coffee shop on the corner of Mott and Hester boasts about being the best rated on Yelp but I think they are referring to their other location. There is a banquet with 2 two-seater tables as well as a three person counter with stools. The music was r&b played at a low volume. The place had one other person and she just left. It's a good place to get some work done or have a conversation. 

The small cappuccino ($3.75) to stay came in a gigantic cup. The art was good and the drink was well crafted. The espresso was mellow but had a nice taste. It had way too much milk for me but at least there was good layer of sweet foam to balance it. 

They also have books which was serendipitous for me since I was able to read a few short chapters from their copy of Moby Dick as a work break."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2016-12-21,4.0,"Tiny, tiny place but allowed us to stick around and work for a while without complaining. The coffee was good, the wifi was free, and they let you use the bathroom without making you beg for it. Of all the local coffee joints, this is one of the places that doesn't try too hard or make too much of a scene with how trendy they can make a $5 latte (that being said, I LOVE those places, too). I think that's what was most appealing about this place: the vibe was chill, and for a Tuesday evening (granted, not a super popular cafe time), it was perfect to zone out and get some school work done. 

I didn't try too many different things, but their coffee was solid. The servers were friendly and seemed to all get along great, which added to the atmosphere of chill. The location is also great because it's close to a subway stop, and it's out of the way of the main drag so there's not as much foot traffic to push through."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-10-14,5.0,"Love this coffee shop! Hope they stay in the neighborhood forever. The only complaint I have is the inconsistent open/closing hours. There have been a few times I went there, and the shop is closed. While Yelp hours stated they open until 6pm."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-03-16,5.0,They now serve Cheese Tea!! It sounds strange but tastes amazing! I love that 12 corners is always trying new things and perfecting it! Never would I thought cheese and tea would MIX together but it tastes amazing.  Def do try when you're around the area!
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-06-12,5.0,"Stopped for a coffee break after walking Chinatown and before starting Little Italy. Coffee was good, hot, and barista was quick. Took a seat to write this review (and let my feet and legs rest). She was a one person shop everyone was greeted with a big smile as her hands moved like lightning. Definitely a good pit stop."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2016-06-24,5.0,"I walk pass this coffee store every time I go to work, but I never really went in until one day I was craving for coffee and I didn't want to walk down to Starbucks. Their iced coffee tastes amazing. 
The place itself is small and cozy like and when I made my visit, no other customers were there so I got my drink within a minute or two. 
I like how the worker informed me that the syrup for the coffee was on the table by the side so that I can adjust the sweetness of the coffee. If I'm correct, there were room to add the syrup so I don't have to pour the coffee out. The guy who served me was pretty friendly and I didn't feel uncomfortable when I was ordering. 
Definitely recommend this place to any coffee lovers out there!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-06-14,5.0,"This is probably one of the best coffee shops in Chinatown. Granted, it can only hold 12 seats but I love the way the cafe is organized. They have wifi and you can easily sit and do work for a few hours. There are also outlets here.
They serve Kobrick and the drinks are really good. I have tried the macchiatos, lattes and mochas and they were all worth coming again. They also do latte art (for the gram) 
The baristas are very friendly and accommodating. This is definitely one of those places I would keep returning to."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-07-23,4.0,"My (amazing) acupuncturist is around here, so I keep trying new coffee places after my acupuncturist appointment.  Today, I came here.  The place was clean and modern, and the barista was pleasant and gave me a nice smile.  

I got an oat latte and the coffee was smooth and tasty.  I wish the coffee had been stronger but maybe I should have ordered a short latte (less milk, stronger coffee flavor).

The place is small so there are not many seats to sit (I think there are 3 stools at the window and 2 seats at a table).  They carry Stevia which many places don't, so I appreciate that.  I would come here again."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-07-17,5.0,"Really excellent cold brew. African beans, subtle taste, no bitterness, delectable."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2016-04-26,4.0,"Been to both locations and have loved both! Decided to write a review for the Mott street location since I'm in this area most often. 

This location is smaller, but definitely very quaint. I ordered a green tea/matcha latte and was told that it's not sweet (like some other places). Perfectly A-ok by me, ordered it anyway, and sat for 1.5 hours enjoying my matcha latte. It definitely had a very strong matcha flavor, which was what I was looking for. The baristas at both locations are very nice and this location has a great playlist (needed to shazam 4 songs ;) ). 

Some points:
-Does not have a restroom 
-Has about 12-14 seats
-Free wifi
-cute latte art!

Will definitely be back again!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-09-07,5.0,"Good coffee and good service:)

recommended!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2015-08-02,4.0,"I needed to kill time a little bit of time waiting for my mommy in Chinatown. I ordered a double shot espresso.

Seating is very limited. There's only 2 table and a lang bench along window, This is not a place to kill a few hours and study the GRE or write 10-20 yelp reviews."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2015-10-11,5.0,"Bumped up to a 4.5 due to a variety of better experiences to go off of, rather than the one not too long after opening. 

Atmosphere now is a good bit calmer, although occasionally friends of staff do come in and chat with the baristas, but it's not too bad. Music depends on the barista behind the counter, but it's usually decent, and low enough that headphones can easily block it out. Drinks are consistently good, although the iced coffee/ cold brew is rather sour at times. 

They now have Cups, which is awesome! 

I just wish they had a bathroom that wasn't employees-only; I usually have to limit myself to one drink to ensure that my bladder doesn't burst before I get home."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-03-18,5.0,"Their matcha tea and regular iced green teas are delicious. Sitting is limited here, however their drinks are amazing and you should definitely check them out. The store is family owned."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-04-07,5.0,The latte art never fails to amaze me and the workers are all super friendly. The coffee cup sizes are honestly WAY bigger than your average coffee cup and it's actually really cheap for something that size. Really cute place for a date or just to catch up with an old friend. Would definitely come back again
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-04-07,5.0,"CHEAP is the first thing I gotta say. Although, I did go two years ago, it left an amazing impression on me. The prices for a big ass cup was around $3.50 and when I say BIG, its bigger than your average coffee cup. The quality was BOMB and they added latte art, which I'm a sucker for, so 12 Corners, you killed it. Def would come back again. I mean. Duh."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-02-04,4.0,"Nice little place. Very clean. Limited seating. 
The coffee is really good. A nice alternative to the overcrowded chains. The pastry selection is small but sufficient. The service was very good, the young man at the counter was a gentleman, served with a smile and even made friendly small talk - it goes a long way. Since I work in the neighborhood I'll be back for a fresh hot cup."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2016-03-15,4.0,"Nice cute cafe, very small. The ice coffee was decent and green tea I had was great. If you like it sweet, don't forget to add the liquid sugar! ! :)"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-08-24,4.0,It's a small but rather lovely place. Great vibe and good coffee. I had a matcha latte. It was not the best but definitely much better than the average you can get in New York. Friendly barista.
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-05-06,4.0,"I love this coffee shop. Wifi, outlets, and great coffee. What more could you want? The staff here is so friendly and the quality of their drinks is very high. Although there is little seating in this tiny shop, people usually grab their coffee to go so there is usually always free space. It's on a pretty busy street so people watching is enjoyable here. Cards are also accepted, which is great.

I usually always get a skim milk latte, but I've also tried their green tea here as well, which was very good. I ordered a small green tea but the girl at the counter said it was the same price for a large, so I opted for the large tea instead. I also tried their seasonal pumpkin latte which was fabulous as well. It wasn't overly sweet like Starbucks and the pumpkin and espresso flavor balanced each other perfectly. I would definitely get that drink again in the fall! Stop by here if you need a pick-me-up in the morning, a breather from wandering around Chinatown, or if you need a nice place to study. Keep doing you, 12 corners!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-03-06,4.0,"Great place to pit stop for a quick coffee. Good quality and quick service. They have a few tables and chairs, small and cozy.

I opted for a small Americano as I needed the coffee hit. Didn't try the Match latte but something tells me it's gonna be good...

Better to support small local places like this than the big chains trying to overtake the world."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2015-03-25,4.0,"This is a cute café in the heart of Chinatown. It is a bit cramped. It felt very full with 4 people standing and two sitting. There are more seats but it's still not a lot. The workers are very nice (especially when it's not busy). My friends and I had an entire conversation with a bunch of them. 
My friends and I all ordered the green tea latte. We got two in cups for the yelp photo even though there was 15 minutes to close. It was the fastest drank tea I have had. I was slightly disappointed in the taste because it tasted very much like matcha powder and milk. There was nothing to make it taste sweeter or anything to make it exceptional."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2015-03-02,5.0,"Dropped by and got the red eye. I didn't have time to try the latte art which is something I've always wanted to try. And their doughnuts are from DOUGH? Haven't tried that as well, but I'd be coming back very soon for the doughnuts and latte art coffee. 

There are no restrooms though. Employees are attentive and cool!"
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2015-01-14,5.0,"12 Corner's latest outpost extends into Chinatown, replacing the outgoing beleaguered Orange Teahouse.  Time will tell how they fare against the glut of Chinese coffee shops and bakeries in Chinatown but one thing is clear, service and premium coffee drinks you've come to expect from the sister shop on East Broadway are here as well.

As you may well know, the younger demographic (20 & 30-somethings) will be right at home here as they do at the E. Broadway location for which I've grown fond of since their opening.

They have free WiFi and a few seats to enjoy a cup of coffee with a friend, though much like the E. Broadway location... It too is quite a tight space. I ordered a cappuccino and did some work on the counter space and sure enough, customers are already coming through. That's coffee for ya!

If you enjoy premium brews besides Starbucks and you happen to be in Chinatown, make this yours."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2017-03-05,3.0,Very small and tight place. I got the matcha latte which was good. It's hard to find a place that gives a good ratio. I've had it too milky and with too matcha. Expect to pay $5 for a small drink
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2015-04-01,5.0,"12 Corners was amazing... I'll never be able to drink Starbucks again! Went into Chinatown as part of a tour, and was pleasantly surprised to find a hip little coffee shop amongst some older chinese shops. 

The barista was kinda absent minded, and a little unenthusiastic, but was nice enough to remake my latte since I forgot to ask for a decaf. He also made me a cream leaf on my mocha, which was beautiful. I appreciated how he filled the cup LITERALLY to the brim, so I could get the most out of the money. 

The interior was quite small, with only two or three tables. Kinda claustrophobic if it's crowded but nicely furnished with books foodie books. 

I ordered a decaf white chocolate mocha with some latte art on it. It was AMAZING! It was sweet, but not overwhelmingly so, with a quality coffee flavor. The latte art leaf was beautiful, and definitely not something that you'd be able to find at Starbucks. 

The location is great, centered on Mott Street in the center of the Chinese tourist souvenir vendors. 

Overall very happy with my experience, and glad that I found this place on yelp. A hidden gem in a crystal of a city."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2018-04-10,5.0,"I've been here before and I return often in the morning. The staff is very friendly, the food is simple and classic, and the atmosphere is calm. It is a great place to set-up your studies or just hang out. I appreciate 12 corners as my personal morning hideaway before I tackle the bustle of the city."
39,12-corners-new-york-4,2015-04-04,4.0,"I prefer the LES one better - but only because they have more seating room! 

I love 12 Corners! I usually go to Nolita Mart for a cup of Stumptown but sometimes they close early - 12 Corners to the rescue! 

I can now get a good cup of coffee that isn't your standard Chinatown bakery coffee without having to walk all the way to Soho. It's also a nice place to sit with a cup of coffee if you have some downtime in Chinatown. 

The service is nice and I always get my drink in a timely manner."
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-04-25,5.0,I love this place!! I went here for brunch with my friends and this was one of the cutest little places.  Food was SO GOOD and this place brought me so much joy with all the natural light streaming in.  I ordered the banana pancake and my friends ordered the french toast and mushroom rice bowl. Heads up the banana pancake was THICC and took the longest to come out. Everything tasted great and it was all very filling.  I would def come back again and the price was pretty good for the city in my opinion.

40,mud-new-york-3,2020-02-23,3.0,"My friend and I were looking for a restaurant serving brunch in the area and settled on MUD since it was so close. 

We arrived around 11 AM on a Sunday morning and it was fairly crowded already. There was a line at the front and I started lining up as well but my friend told me not to and instead just to walk towards the restaurant portion in the back to tell them that we were ready to be seated at a table. As soon as we let our intentions known we were seated within 5 minutes. 

Our hostess brought us to our small table in a corner with the menus. I decided to order the huevos rancheros with the brunch order (drinks: hot chocolate + mimosa). 

The drinks were a little bit too much for me, I would have appreciated a lower price and just ordered one drink since I didn't end up finishing all of it. The mimosa was also pretty strong so that is a good choice for the price. 

As for the huevos rancheros, the flavor was ok. A bit plain but was surprisingly filling even though it looked small at first glance. 

Service was ok, but the whole restaurant just felt very cramped especially the bathroom area. If you come to this restaurant try not to use the bathroom because it is not a very pleasant experience haha. It's a cramped room in between the indoor and outdoor dining area. There was a window to the side of the bathroom with stained glasses so you're able to see the people sitting right outside. Additionally, the window was slightly cracked open meaning that you can not only see the people but also hear their whole conversation.  This just made the whole experience slightly stressful. 

All in all, an average brunch experience."
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-02-07,4.0,"This is a really cute spot in the LES. My friends and I decided to sit in the back, which is an ""outdoor seating"" area. It was a really cute looking restaurant although seating is a bit tight. I had to squeeze my way into my table just because of how tight the space was. We all decided to do the brunch special with the mimosas. 
The alcohol was okaaaay. But we did get a complimentary coffee with the brunch special. 
I ordered the huevos bowl which was pretty good. The sauce had a weird after taste and the rice and beans were a bit bland. I had to add a bunch of salt before eating. My friends enjoyed the omelette as well as the French breakfast as well. 
The server was relatively nice, but we all felt a slight attitude from her since she kept snatching things out of our hands (the menus, our debit cards, etc.) 
Overall, I would come back here and I will also recommend this spot for brunch."
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-02-18,4.0,"This was such a cozy place to sit down and sip coffee. The entrance area is really narrow, but if you go toward the back of the cafe there is a small seating area. I thought you could order up front (since I saw the Square card processing machine), but if you sit down, it'll be table service. 
I thought the coffee was fine. I'd really come back for the venue."
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-01-30,4.0,"I love the mud coffee, and like that they accept credit cards. Back when I first went--they didn't. So that's a nice change. Overall, coffee is good and so are their pastry selection. I ordered a latte, and it came in a nice biggie with a heart in the milk. Exactly how I wanted it. The only thing that I don't like, is that if you just want coffee with someone, you're kind of pressured into getting table service... and then I feel bad because I only want a drink and I'm holding a table. Otherwise you can sit at the counter like all the single people of New York City. Ambiance is nice, and it's an ok size shop. I wish they would have more locations."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-09-15,4.0,"Came here for brunch on Sunday and got a table for three quickly. The inside is cozy (albeit a little tight), with buzzing servers and patrons whizzing by. Our server was kind and diligent! For food, I had the Mudman Sandwich with home fries, OJ, and an Iced Coffee. I'm not sure what kind of OJ this was, but I thought it was much better than your standard Tropicana. I like that they pair the OJ with the coffee (hot or iced) with your brunch meal ($21 for entree and drinks). All in all a solid deal for $21. 

Mudman Sandwich: A very tasty and flavorful sandwich with everything done right. I would definitely get this sandwich again. Everything from the bread to the grilled veggies was awesome; plenty of chicken on there as well. 

Home Fries: Meh. These were like diced boiled potatoes with light oil -- nothing to go crazy over. This side seems like something to fill the extra room in your stomach after you've finished your main course. I wish they had more seasoning on them or were crispy. I wouldn't really call these ""fries.""

40,mud-new-york-3,2019-08-01,3.0,"My fiancé and I were excited to start off our day by coming to MUD for brunch! We came around 10 AM on a Saturday morning, and luckily for us, it wasn't too crowded. MUD is a small-ish cafe that luckily expands in the back. We ended up ordering the banana pancake as well as the salmon and bagel sandwich. Luckily for us, it didn't take terribly long for our food to come out! 

The banana pancake was heavily thick! I am happy they loaded the pancake with large banana slices! They were inside the pancake as opposed to just garnishing the pancake itself. The pancake was topped with various fruit such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries. Unfortunately, the blackberries and raspberries were too sour for me, but my fiancé and I enjoyed the strawberries and blueberries. The pancake was so large, I ended up finishing it over the course of 3 meals. Definitely get your money's worth with this pancake if it's going to be a part of a $21/person brunch (featuring one drink)! 

The salmon and bagel tasted better than the banana pancake in my opinion. The salmon was quite fresh, and I liked how MUD displayed everything on the side so we can assemble how much we want of x food such as tomatoes, salmon, etc. The tomatoes weren't wet thankfully and even the green garnish added a nice touch to the bagel! 

Our bill came out to about $50 but we noticed MUD charged us with something titled ""MUD"" which cost $3. Thankfully my fiancé mustered up the courage to ask us what this was, and the waitress said: ""Oh our bad, we'll see if we can get that off for you"". Luckily she was able to! Still strange how that error came up on our bill. 

Overall the service is pretty nice, and I am glad we came to MUD! I must say the brunch prices are expensive though. Maybe my pancake stretched over a couple of days made the $21/pp brunch worth it, but I don't think I would pay $21/pp for a bagel with salmon and some coffee."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-12-13,4.0,Very good for breakfast! And they have breakfast items on their menu all day which is nice. Coffee is excellent. One major downside of this restaurant is that they serve paper straws with their drinks. Don't love the taste the of disintegrated paper with my coffee. Paper straws aside would highly recommend coming here!!
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-05-29,4.0,"I've been spoiled with having brunch 15 minutes away in the heart of Brooklyn, but on this Saturday morning, I decided to go ROGUE and take a stab at brunch in the city. Mud cafe is a cute brunch spot which is only a short walk from the St Marks hotspots (Kenka, Boka, Yoga to the People). My party of 3 arrived at 9:30am and was seated immediately. 

The weekend brunch spice is $21.50 (eh a bit steep), but it comes with two drinks: one alcoholic (draft beer/mimosa) and one non-alcoholic (OJ/coffee). I decided to try out the mimosa/coffee. The mimosa was good, not spectacular but the coffee was the drink worth talking about. Not watered down, with a strong coffee punch;maybe I was just in desperate need of coffee but it really hit the spot!

We ordered the French toast, Huevos Rancheros and the Avocado Sandwich. With the sandwich, you also given the option of a side salad or home fries, which was a nice touch. I would have to say I loved the avocado sandwich the most;crunchy bread with a hearty filling. The Huevos rancheros was good, but the rice was a little hard, in my opinion. As for the French toast, oh that was yummy. I'm just not a big fan of having a sweet meal for breakfast, but if you like that, I highly recommend it!

The atmosphere here is really nice. My party stayed here for almost 2 hours and we didn't feel rushed to leave at all! The only real unpleasant experience we had here was the bathroom. It is SO small and not very clean. I am 5'6 and ~125 lbs and when I used the restroom, my head almost touched the sink. Just imagine what some other customers have to go through. (´･_･`)"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-11-11,5.0,"I truly believe that MUD's coffee is the best in the city. Their coffee is nice, thick, and full of flavor! I'm not super into sweet coffees but their chai latte is delicious and a perfect treat. Today, I tried their pre-fixed brunch and really loved it. For roughly $22 - I got a drip coffee, grapefruit mimosa, and an omelette + side of potatoes. One of the best brunch deals in the East Village. Perfect for catching up with friends!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-06-29,4.0,"Food: We came here for their brunch which did not disappoint! Loved each and every entree. Most of the entrees are traditional brunch items, and all were loaded! We ordered the breakfast burrito, huevos rancheros, and the chicken salad. They were all so good! I definitely loved the breakfast burrito which is enough to feed two people! The salad was also flavorful with the goat cheese and grapefruit which added so much freshness!

Drinks: All entrees come with coffee/tea/OJ and mimosa/beer, your choice! We all got the coffee and mimosa combo. The coffee are huge and so good--def need to try even if it's just for the coffee. The mimosas were standard but made from freshly squeezed OJ with tons of pulp (if you like that!). 

Vibe: Small and cozy with dim lights, though the back had more natural light. It is very cute spot, definitely recommended for smaller groups as it can be quite crowded. The restrooms are even tinier, yet super cute. Definitely gives off a hipster vibe, but yet cute and cozy at the same time.

Service: Service was good for the most part. They were fast and attentive even for a busy Saturday morning brunch. Only issue I had is that one of the bussers or waiters dropped water from clean dishes (i hope) on my back while eating, but I mainly shrugged it off since I assumed it was an accident."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-04-07,4.0,"We came here on a rainy Friday night (around 730) and were seated very quickly. We started with iced tea and had ordered the grilled cheese with bacon and jalapeño, and an avocado sandwich with a fried egg. The grilled cheese was delicious and my boyfriend had made a comment that it was probably the best grilled cheese he had ever had. The tomato soup was good and sort of tasted like marinara sauce. 

I enjoyed the avocado sandwich but there was sooo much arugula and not enough of everything else, it overpowered the sandwich and that was all I could taste. It was good, but nothing in comparison to the grilled cheese! 

I feel like if I were to go back I would love to order one of their brunch specials or order the grilled cheese again, because that was pretty bomb."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-08-31,4.0,"I met my friend here for a late lunch one day during the week. It was around 3PM on a Monday but there were a decent amount of people there. It's a smaller place but there are plenty of tables inside as well as a patio area outside that is covered. We opted for inside because it wa sinsanely hot on the day we came. She got there before me and started on an ice coffee. When I arrived, she ordered heuvos rancheros and I got the breakfast quesadilla. Food came out fast, which we were greatful for because we were starving. We both devoured our food. The portions were the perfect size and everything was delicious. We really enjoyed our meals.

Whne we got the check, we were sitting around and talking while we paid and sat for a bit afterwards. They were really trying to push us out though. They didn't blatently ask us to leave, it was more with body language and asking us if we needed anything else several times. They weren't closing, there were plently of tables open and no one waiting. It was sort fo weird. Otherwise a good experience until the end."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-10-06,4.0,"I tried chicken sandwich and it was great for the price. It comes with a side of either hash-browns or mixed greens which with good dressing. 
For a breakfast place, they had good wine which was surprisingly but good."
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-03-07,5.0,Coffee and Chai latte were amazing. Their regular coffee tastes like it was a cappuccino. Service was really good and everyone was really nice. The staff made us very comfortable. Food was reasonably priced and came out quickly.
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-07-21,3.0,"We rolled in for a lazy Sunday brunch. Well, maybe not -so- lazy. After all, we arrived well before the regular brunch-time patrons arrived -- perhaps around 1030. By the time we left, there was a crush at the door and people waiting out on the sidewalk. Fair warning.

Honestly, I hadn't read up on the Sunday brunch fixed price menu. Had I known about it, I probably would have steered our party elsewhere. Ultimately, I simply couldn't justify the price tag ($21.50 per person before tax and tip) for what you get. The mimosa seemed to be primarily composed of juice. Similarly, my breakfast burrito was satisfying; that's about the strongest praise I can muster.

I'm glad to have tried out MUD. It seems like quite a scene. However, there are too many other exceptional brunch destinations to go at a lower price point to justify a repeat visit here."
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-01-02,1.0,"All attitude. Tattoos and attitude. Who wears a beanie with a sleeveless tshirt anyway ?
Liberal arts kids who are way too cool for any school, who think making coffee in an east village hole in the wall makes them indie rock stars.  And besides, this isn't even good coffee. I would skip this place and try to find someplace with good coffee that's maybe less pretentious and more authentic."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-01-01,4.0,"A very sweet hole in the wall brunch spot. The back seating is in a sun room. It's very cozy. 

When we went the menu was prefix which was $21 for a mimosa, coffee and meal. The menu you is creative and interesting. I got an omelet with caramelized onions and goat cheese, home fries and sour dough toast. It was all delicious and fresh. Their coffee was impeccable. There is not a ton of seating so I am sure it gets crowded on weekends."
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-02-17,4.0,Being in new york for 3 days and not having a single good cup of coffee was so disappointing. I came in and didn't know what to expect but it's definitely the top of my coffee favorites in the time i've been here. I found myself tracking back down multiple times within my stay and that's saying something. Definitely worth it. Super nice staff and very helpful.
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-02-17,3.0,"The ambience was very dark which was not bad , a great place for a first date. I think that the mulled wine could've been a bit spicier. There's a back room where you can see the buildings above you through the skylight which is a nice view. Very rustic feel to the building. I didn't have any food here but I hope to go back soon to try it. The service was great I didn't have any problems with getting an order in Nor did I have any issues with the time it took for me to receive my order. I didn't have to wait to be seated it was very moderately packed but there was enough seating for everyone to be accommodated."
40,mud-new-york-3,2018-11-03,4.0,"This coffee kiosk in Astor place has a cool logo and very good coffee.  A large coffee for $3.25 seemed to be a very good deal.

There are tables and chairs in the public area nearby if you want to sit down.

Pastries were around $3.25 each so I passed on that.  

The kiosk looks like a dark brown wooden house and I believe it faces cooper square."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-10-17,1.0,"F U MUD ! F U! 

I walk in, looked at all 4 staffs behind the coffee bar, they look at me, 4 of them, no one said anything, not even a hi

I thought they were busy! So I wait.... 15 mins---RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM! ! Nothing!

3 white people walk in, they said hi right away and got a table right away!  

Wow! F U MUD!

I waited 15 mins in front of the coffee bar and ya all know I was there and did not do sh*t! But when white people walk in and ya all have time and willing to take care them? Wow!!!

F**K you!!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-11-10,5.0,"Waited maybe 20 minutes to sit on a Sunday morning at 11-had the bacon (amazing and crispy) and the salmon and bagel. Tasty and plenty of food. My friend has an omelet with mushrooms and cheese. Moist and cooked properly! Not flat, brown, or dry. Home fries were tasty too. Memosa and coffee are a nice touch for 21.50 included with food! Or you can get a beer or juice. Only thing is the bathroom is the smallest I've ever been in and the window (stained glass) looks onto where people eat in the other room. Little awkward if someone really wants to look in. Also the food took awhile but still worth coming back!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-02-21,3.0,"Let me start off by saying I realize this is New York and people aren't going to be super warm, but FOH staff here were pretty pretentious except for one guy who seemed to possibly have BOH and FOH duties. Food was ok, a little bland, but the side of hot sauce was good. Waitress was a little heavy handed when placing the water carafe and check on the table, but maybe that's just her. They also need to work on letting people know what to do if eating in versus just getting counter. I'd come back in a pinch, but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-06-14,5.0,So good! All day breakfast. Shared the breakfast burrito and the French toast. Highly recommend both of those! Good prices and great service. Everything is super quaint and cute too!
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-08-12,5.0,"Probably my favorite cafe in the city. The maple coffee is out-of-this-world excellent. It's a subtle sweet flavor, not too sweet but definitely hints of maple syrup! I don't usually like sugar in my coffee, but this was just amazing.

The vibe of this place is rustic and fun, a great place to read or tell long stories. Fast and friendly service too! I can't recommend this place enough."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-03-31,5.0,"Mud is a beautiful brunch spot with flavorful, tasty food and large portions. We were seated outside and it was a beautiful space with a breeze. The food was perfectly flavored and exactly what we needed. Hearty, but not too heavy, and delicious! Can't rate them highly enough."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-09-27,5.0,"I came here on a random weekday with my little cousin for brunch. It's in a great location near a bunch of trendy restaurants but I picked it because it has a good breakfast menu and seemed well priced. 

When we got to the cafe, there was no line (although it was a weekday and I have definitely seen this place packed on the weekend). We were told we could sit anywhere. There are some chairs along the bar but also a few tables in the back (indoors) as well as many tables in the back that are outdoors. We chose to sit inside because it was cooler. 

I ordered an omelette and my cousin got the pancakes. The omelette was good and came with home fries, the portion size was good and I was definitely full after cleaning off my plate. My cousin got the pancakes which were huge! They came with fresh fruit and it was pretty tasty. Given the size, he wasn't able to finish all of it. 

The service was pretty good although the pancakes took a very long time to come out. They comped my cousins coffee because of the delay. Overall I really enjoyed Mud and will likely be back. Good food and good price!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-03-20,5.0,"Interior - 4/5 there's a colorful and fun indoor garden/seating area in the back and I enjoyed the natural lighting while I ate. Such a contrast from the rest of the restaurant which is dark & very very dimly lit. 
huevos rancheros - 5/5 it was sooo good. The eggs were cooked nicely and the dish itself was very flavorful.
I also got the mint lemonade - 3/5 was very sour and couldn't taste any mint."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-01-27,4.0,"MUD has been on my Yelp bookmarks for about a year now after I passed it on a Saturday and the line was out the door. I decided to check it out with a friend on a Saturday morning around 12:00. We waited about 25 minutes for a table. 

The little lobby never cleared out from the time we entered to the time we left. This clearly is a good sign. The front counter at MUD offers coffee to go, so the door is practically revolving. Those waiting for a table must get the attention of the hostess who moves back and forth through the crowd to write down your name when she recognizes a new face. 

We were seated in a table for two in the back part of the restaurant. In the back you feel like you're both inside and outside because of the windows and light ceiling. It feels homey and comfortable in here. The tight knit tables and string-light decor really give you that ""I'm in New York for brunch on a Saturday"" feel. Something Instagram worthy.

Now, the food. Yes, $21.50 gets you an entree, alcoholic drink (boozy brunch anyone?), and a cup of coffee. It really is a good deal. 

I had a big cup of coffee. I love that they froth the milk. The food was 4-star worthy. I had the almond-crusted sourdough french toast with berries and maple syrup. I was expecting it to be a bit sweet or have a slight tang of cinnamon, but it was more egg-based. I finished most of it, so I can't complain. But I will try the banana pancakes instead next time.

My friend had the avocado breakfast sandwich with a side of homefries. The sandwich is filled with fresh bites of avocado, egg, tomato, and dressed with a garlic mayo. I don't even eat egg and I had to take a bite. It was delicious. 

I hope to come back to MUD the next time I'm in the East Village. I imagine this is an adorable date spot, and is particularly cute for girlfriends to meet up at on a Sunday morning. Thanks for the mems, MUD."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-02-01,4.0,"Waited a while for a table during brunch times, but not too long. The inside seating is quite dim, but the back area is well lit from natural sunlight. We opted for any table that was free first, because the outside seating tends to be more popular. They have a brunch special for $21.50 where you can get a mud coffee and another drink of your choice (orange juice, mimosa, or draft beer) with your meal.

Ordered:

- Almond Crusted Sour Dough French Toast - pretty good, comes with berries and banana and maple syrup. Not the best french toast I've had, but it was different in a good way. The almonds were a great touch to it. (4/5 rating)

- Mud Drip Coffee - love that they serve the coffee in mugs, made it feel really cozy. Coffee was good, I ordered it with oat milk, but they also have other dairy free options to choose from (3.5/5 rating)

- Mimosa - not too strong, was good (4/5 rating)

- Omelette with mushroom, tomato, jalapeño with rice and beans - really filling! the omelette is pretty big, you get to choose 2 mix ins, but can add a max of 4 things. (4.5/5 rating)"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-04-13,2.0,"So this was my first time going to the actual restaurant. Normally I get my latte from the truck when it's by the flatiron building, but I was in the area and said why not. It's a spacious spot with huge benches at the bar; which is great for the aesthetic, but not so much when you need to pull out the entire bench (seating 2-3) to sit down. 
Let me say the latte was disgusting and short. Paired with the waitress' attitude, I knew that was my last time going there. The 2 stars belong to the slim host that was seating ppl in the restaurant area. She was genuinely courteous."
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-02-17,5.0,"Great place, loved the atmosphere and the food was delicious! Service was quick and the kitchen was on point. Will definitely be back!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-01-01,4.0,"Pretty solid brunch with reasonable prices. My friend and I came around 11 on New Years Eve and we were seated immediately. The line can be a bit confusing since some people take coffee to go, so make sure you make your presence known if you're waiting for a table. 

The space is really cute and well decorated--the back of the restaurant has the feel of an outdoor patio but it's actually enclosed, so it's not too cold even in the winter. Our waitress was very attentive and came over right away to take our drink orders. The brunch is 21.50 and includes food, a mimosa, and coffee, which is pretty cheap compared to other places, especially since it includes the mimosa. 

I ordered the huevos rancheros, and was overall pretty satisfied with them. The eggs were perfectly cooked and served topped with a flavorful, spicy sauce and plenty of cilantro. The only thing I didn't love about my dish was that the rice and beans that it came with were totally plain and unseasoned--it didn't ruin the dish or anything, but I think that seasoning them would make the dish quite a bit better. My friend had an omelette and said it was good too. 

I plan on coming back, but I'll probably try something different next time--someone at the table next to mine had the smoked salmon bagel and it looked delicious."
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-02-21,5.0,"Yumm!  Stopped to get breakfast and good coffee.  This place has a nice energy, good music and the food was fresh.  We ordered the sweet potato bowl,
breakfast burrito and the scrambled egg and pickled jalapeño breakfast sandwich.   The place looks smaller than it is. There is another room out back, but still pretty cozy.  This would be a great place for weekend brunch too."
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-02-29,3.0,"Good food and great coffee, always consistent and a really cool spot.

However, they do not offer gluten free options.

Minus 2 ""stars"" for this."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-01-13,4.0,"Standard brunch place and super popular because of their entree + coffee + beer/mimosa/orange juice. It's a cute place and very cozy vibe. I think it is a good value for money but the wait is pretty aggressive and I think the food is good but not anything too special. Go for the value, especially if you have time. If it's not obvious already, you can't make a reservation"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-07-09,5.0,"A hidden gem and diamond in the rough. Some of the best coffee I've ever had, served by kind, delightful people. Although they're child-friendly (grilled cheese!), little children can be devastating to their fragile ecosystem, to put it politely. Very walkable location tucked away in a quiet suburb. It's a great place to meet up with old friends or kindle romances. That said, beware the frosted window in the bathroom - the people on the other side of it can see you with discomforting clarity, right at eye-to-thong-level."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-03-17,5.0,"Found this place on a Saturday looking for brunch in the East Village. For brunch, it was moderately crowded but didn't have to wait for a table around 11AM. We were sat towards the back of the restaurant where they have this precious sky light that will make you and your guest glow. 

I ordered the avocado sandwich with an egg on multigrain toast. Very tasty! The arugula made the sandwich feel extra fresh. My friend ordered the burrito which looked awesome! 


The one recommendation I will give is that coffee is included with brunch so no need to make an extra stop before hand to get your caffeine fix. Just hold out til you get there!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-02-19,5.0,"Visited NYC with my SO and stopped impromptu for breakfast. Great vibe, even better food. Great little (almost literal) hole in the wall."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-09-08,5.0,"I absolutely love this restaurant to get brunch or breakfast at. I would 100% recommend. The food is delicious and fresh, the service is quick and friendly, and the interior is cute and intimate. Also, it is not too expensive for what you are receiving which is a great bonus! 
I have been there twice since moving to New York 2 weeks ago and I am definitely planning on going again. 
I recently had the delicious mud burrito and it might have been the best burrito I have had so far. It was so fresh and each ingredient was separate from one another but all worked together.  It came with a side of sour cream and a sort of spicy seasoned sauce. 
As a beverage I had an iced chai with almond milk and I can hands down say that it was the best chai I have ever had. It was so delicious and I practically drank it in a couple of seconds! 
Can't wait to go here again and I for sure recommend for anyone looking to eat a satisfying yet healthy and fresh meal."
40,mud-new-york-3,2018-07-28,5.0,"I give rare, 5 Star ratings when I'm blown away by the service and food of an establishment. This place well deserves their 5 stars! 

Service is impeccable! I'll elaborate on this later. 

Food, INCREDIBLE! 

I ordered the brunch meal- banana pancake with fresh OJ and iced black tea in lieu of coffee for $19.50. 

Banana pancake: holy moly omg I would put positive, profane words in here for how mind blowing it is!! The banana is oooey gooey greatness and the actual pancake is an incredible texture! It's crisp and the edges are divine! The fruits on top make it even more dynamite, as does the real maple syrup. I'm drooling thinking about this. 

Fresh OJ is good as well. 

Service? I can't believe how good they are. We waited very long for our food (pancake and huevos rancheros) that we thought they forgot our order. People who ordered 30 minutes after us got their food. When we inquired, they apologized, explained that my banana pancake takes a while, and then offered us complimentary mimosas. Incredible customer service! 

I asked for the rest of my food to go, which they did promptly. As the restaurant was mostly empty and I was burning from the sun at my table, I shifted to the empty table. I didn't expect them to, but the instantly came to me and started moving my drinks and such to the new table. How kind of them! 

I asked for a bag for my takeaway and the guy walked away to do so and even had it waiting for me at the front of the restaurant. 

Thank you guys for an honestly superb experience. Between the scrumptious food and the top notch customer service, I'm genuinely impressed and left on banana cloud nine."
40,mud-new-york-3,2018-05-11,4.0,"Brick walls, wood floors, tin ceiling. Narrow, dark and really cozy. Ceiling fans. Chill music. Big mug o' drip and they put the milk in for you. Your own bottle of NYC water, best in the land. No place mats, no pretense.

Table service is pretty prompt and the staff were friendly. Just head past the tiny front counter (unless you want to sit there) and make eye contact and they'll find you a table.

Coffee was fresh and frothy, not a trace of bitter.

Not really for groups bigger than a foursome and not a place to bring your children, ok? I had scoped out the menu photos ahead of time so I knew I wanted the Avocado toast with eggs. It arrived in about 10 minutes and was excellent. Yolks were runny and the smashed avocado was fresh and plentiful. Those chili pepper flakes really made it sing. 

Quality breakfast and large coffee under $20 including tip.

Loved the little single use bathroom, so punk and so small. Also clean and well stocked. There's a bench outside to wait your turn.  

Fuhgeddibout Starbucks. Dive in here for breakfast or a cuppa & you'll be glad you did."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-07-28,1.0,"The reviews looked really good and the menu was promising, but I was really disappointed. We got the Huevos Rancheros and the Kale Pesto Quinoa Bowl. The Huevos Rancheros were alright, but there was a crunchy taco shell, which wasn't good and there was nothing besides egg, avocado, and sauce. The kale pesto quinoa bowl was a scam. It was $13 for a single overcooked egg and quinoa. The egg was overeasy and overdone, so it was a dry yolk. The quinoa was literally just quinoa with a couple nuts on top. It was super dry and barely tasted like pesto. I wouldn't come here again for sure"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-01-05,5.0,"This is our (me and my college best friends) go-to brunch spot. Great value and space for the money - $21.50 for an entree and an alcohol drink (mimosa or draft beer) and either coffee or OJ. 

As usual, there was a wait when we got there around noon even in the rain. The wait can be a lot sometimes, but today was only 30 min. We got the love salad, huevos rancheros and the mudd burrito and coffee and mimosas across the board. The food was great and the coffee is great. The coffee being good is expected since they sell their own coffee beans. 

The place feels like a hole in the wall how small it is. The bathroom is tiny - like a closet. Overall, you start to love how cozy it is. We'll be back."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-01-24,4.0,"I came here for Saturday brunch with a friend.  They don't take reservations but we didn't wait too long.  They only have their brunch special which was $21.50 for any entree, a tap bear, mimosa, or fresh OJ AND mud drip coffee.

The mud drip coffee can come with steamed milk - I had the steamed oat milk and it was delicious.

For my entree I had the Bud Burrito which wasn't bad.  I would come back to try another dish."

40,mud-new-york-3,2018-12-06,4.0,"My friend loves these kinda places in Brooklyn but I also kinda hate the service in BK. This place is definitely hipster central but it has pretty good customer service! It's a cute place with its own unique style, relaxing, cozy and can't say i recall any music being played which isn't an issue at all for me! i had the buttermilk banana pancakes which was delicious! The bacon and home fries were also great! Good coffee and decent mimosas although they are on the small side for $8. 

I removed a star because the bathroom is tiny and has a see through window! You may not be able to see it in the image but you can see ppl sitting directly outside the window from within the restaurant which was uncomfortable on top of it already being a tight fit. If the owners read this please consider frosting the glass more.

Overall, I'd recommend this place!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-12-02,5.0,"Favorite brunch spot! The coffee is incredible and yes they do carry Oat milk . Also the chilaquiles is amazing and so is the inlets with chorizo and goat cheese!!! I love this place, a bit of a wait if you are a walk in on the weekends but it's worth the wait. Service is great and everyone is friendly!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2020-01-03,5.0,"Awesome coffee, awesome brunch, awesome menu, awesome staff - need I say more. Only change I would make is the long wait.  You gotta try it!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2018-07-03,5.0,"A delicious place to stop by for breakfast/brunch!

At 9am on a weekday, there was no wait to get a table inside MUD. The front of this store is a functioning coffee shop, while hidden in the back are a handful of tables for you to enjoy their full food service. I ordered a Maple MUD and a two egg scramble with goat cheese and sausage.

The Maple MUD coffee consisted of maple syrup added to the store's signature drip coffee. Tasty twist on an otherwise classic coffee. Onto the main dish, these eggs were FANTASTIC! Never has a simple plate of eggs tasted so good. The eggs were scrambled to perfection, maintaining a creamy texture alongside the goat cheese and sausage toppings. The multigrain toast was simply the tastiest bread I have had the pleasure of eating. This is the first bread I've eaten that was packed with such dimensional flavor. Mixed greens topped off the plate, adding a nice balance to the meal.

If you find yourself in East Village, I would highly recommend stopping in for a meal."
40,mud-new-york-3,2018-06-27,3.0,"Went for brunch on a Saturday. I didn't know there was a fixed price brunch menu but went along with it. They offer you coffee, a choice of beverage, then your meal for $19.50. My boyfriend and I both got fresh squeezed orange juice. For meals he got the almond crust French toast, and I got the make your own omelette. Everything was good except he noted the dish was too sweet (syrup is added to the dish already when it comes out) while my omelette was like any other omelette. 
Probably won't be back but service was friendly and atmosphere was nice albeit tight."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-06-23,5.0,"Wonderful small spot in East Village. It's small and unassuming and serves breakfast all night. I mean does it really ever get better than that? I came by for dinner and got their Breakfast Quesadilla. It was absolutely delicious and honestly, I loved the small and communal vibe! MUD is such a special place and I know I'll be back often!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-06-23,4.0,"Solid hole in the wall kind of joint. I didn't love my cup of coffee (more earthy than my preferred roast) but it was exceptionally smooth. Despite having a small kitchen, the breakfast options are tasty & the portions are generous. I wouldn't wait for long for a table, but if you're passing by and it's not too busy, it's a solid option! I'd say stick with their coffee, that's their specialty."
40,mud-new-york-3,2018-11-22,4.0,"Good cafe in East Village. Pretty crowded on the weekends for brunch (and cash only, which is a bit irritating), but the food is solid and it's a nice area. The brunch menu is a fixed price and comes with coffee and a drink"
40,mud-new-york-3,2018-05-28,4.0,"I came here with my brother and cousin on Saturday and the wait was sort of crazy. It was already 1:30 in the afternoon and we still had to wait for 30 minutes to get a table. The waiting area in the front was really small so it got cramped really fast. When we finally got seated we were led to a small area in the back where there were more seating. Let's just say it was cramped and hot. 

All that being said the food was really good. I had the huevos rancheros and it was the perfect bite of rich egg and avocado, crispy tortilla, chewy rice and beans and fresh pico de Gallo in every bite. My brother ordered scrambled eggs with onions and bacon. He raves about the onions. It was cooked perfectly so it was tender and sweet. It was the perfect match with his eggs. Food from the brunch menu comes with drip coffee and a choice between an alcoholic beverage or oj- we just ordered the oj but it was still worth it. You have the option of getting your coffee iced or hot. Please tell them you want milk and sugar while you are placing your order.

I highly recommend this place for a small party of 3-4. Just keep in mind that it may be a little tight."
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-06-27,5.0,"What an amazing little hole in the wall! Popped in here this morning and was not disappointed! The staff was super friendly, recommending the huevos rancheros with queso fresco which made up in flavor that which it lacked in presentation - thumbs up!! I read another user or a variation of a chai latte, so I ordered a dirty chai with oat milk... wow! Mud has a cute and comfortable back patio to eat on and the decor is lively. Recommend!"
40,mud-new-york-3,2019-08-07,5.0,"This might be my favorite coffee shop/brunch place in NYC. It's perfectly hidden in the East Village. Inside there is a great atmosphere, and they have an adorable little outdoor area you can sit in too! My boyfriend is still in shock and says it's the best vanilla latte he's ever had. PLUS the prices were extremely reasonable and the food was literally so tasty I will be dreaming about it for days to come. I live in the upper west side but might make the trek to MUD again because it was just so dang worth it. I HIGHLY recommend."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-05-25,5.0,"Firstly, food is fire. I've loved this place since they opened. Food holds really well as take-out/delivery. Some issues with their delivery notification system directly on the website, but they have A+ customer service and made sure I got my order hot. Kimchi scrambled eggs are amazing and espresso drinks are bomb. Order takeout and support Good Thanks so they're around at the end of this all!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-02-02,5.0,"Going out for scrambled eggs.  Crazy, right?
Not if you are going here.  They whip them light and airy, and then we paired them with Kim chi (really), and Avocado.  It's either over or along side of some thick toast with the best crust.  Combining these elements took me somewhere I had never been, somewhere I look forward to returning to.
Our other dish was the açaí bowl.  Assorted fruit, granola, and chilled açaí that was creamy, rich, and not too tart.  As good as it gets.  The lattes also measured up.  
Whoever thought scrambled eggs could become a destination?"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-02-20,2.0,"Food and drinks were ok but the service sucked. We were seated quickly, then water and menus were given. Within less than 2 minutes, the waitress came back and asked us if we were ready. Mind you, it's 30° winter so we're still getting settled and undressed. We asked for a few more minutes to look at the menu, but the entire time the waitress kept looking over at us and it's uncomfortable. The food came and we were only there for about 15-20 minutes when the waitress came over and asked if we wanted the check. Mind you I still had half the toast left and was working on it but I ended up taking it to go because she asked us to get the check already. With a visible plate full of food, instead of asking a table if they want the check, how about ask the customers if they're still working on their food or need a box? Much more like polite and doesn't seem like you're just trying to rush us out. The waitress was cold and had no personality. No thank yous or you welcomes when we thanked her. 

It's a Thursday afternoon and it's empty inside besides another table. There was no rush for the table nor were we there for long and idling. She spent most of her time at the bar chatting with the barista instead of taking care of customers and asking if they need anything or if the food is good. I never felt so rushed or unwanted at a business before. I would prefer not to have even tipped her but still ended up tipping 20%, although I still don't think she deserved it. If you're working a job in the hospitality field, maybe try to be nicer to your patrons instead of trying to get shit over with. 

We ordered the americano and matcha; coffee was good but matcha was a bit watery. No matcha flavor at all which was disappointing. Smoked whitefish toast was great, and came pretty fast. However, there were quite a few bones in the fish. Found a big piece while eating there and found 2 more when I took it back."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-02-16,4.0,"Very Instagramable spot. The food is obviously the reason to go here, but I think the atmosphere adds another level to the kind of food-photography most of your Instagram followers will appreciate. 

The food is great, but I think the price is a tad high."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-01-19,5.0,"I popped in real quick to grab us lattes. Next thing I know, I see their avocado toast and it had to be ordered too. Great coffee. Delicious food. A wonderful staff. I can't wait to return next time I'm
In NY."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-01-08,5.0,"Loved this place! Super cozy and hands down best eggs and avocado I've ever had. The eggs are so soft and literally just melts in your mouth! The pinch of salt and pepper at the very end is also perfect seasoning.

I don't know how they do it - possibly quite a bit of butter and slow cooking - but it's just amazing. A new favorite spot."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-01-04,4.0,"Here's the secret to Good Thanks... YOU WANT THOSE SCRAMBLED EGGS. Don't get me wrong - there are other egg options and dishes for that matter, but, make sure whatever it is you get, incorporate the scramble some how, some way. The trick here is, you order the 2 eggs, scrambled... then you add the sides to make your meal complete. I ordered lox and avocado, my mom ordered cherry tomatoes and avocado... and your eggs will come on toasted sourdough. The place is tiny, so if you're showing up prime time, (11am on a Saturday), you might have a little bit of a wait on your hands.  

Coffee: On point. It's an Australian cafe - the coffee is solid.

Food: The pictures look as good as the food tastes. Simple & awesome. 

Music: So good - I had to interrupt brunch with Shazam a few times.

Service: Friendly, cute & good personalities.

Vibe: Chill & cozy spot on Orchard. It's one of my favorite parts of town. This area of town is slowly turning into the Mecca for all the brunches that be.

Side note: their acai bowl looks insanely good, if you're into a sweeter dish for brunch."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-03-11,4.0,"Stopped in this morning to grab a little breakfast. Since it was a Wednesday, it really wasn't too crowded and was easy to get a table, although there were quite a few people in the tiny place. I expect it's much different on the weekend. The waitress immediately brought over a menu. She was nice and attentive. I ordered a flat white with almond milk and the banana bread (again on my banana bread hunt). The flat white was good and was quick to come out. The banana bread was pretty good although nothing too spectacular. It did come with burnt honey butter which was a really excellent compliment! It's a really cute place and they seem to have a lot of great other options! I also liked it because I could use my computer and relax in the cozy place. Overall a good experience!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-12-12,5.0,"If you want heaven on a plate look no further. We were told the wait for our brunch (party of 7, 12p) would be ~2 hours. We were seated in about an hour. It's SO worth the wait! There's a Starbucks around the corner you can grab some coffee at in the meantime. 

I got the avocado toast with scrambled eggs and cherry tomatoes. I don't care what you get here, just make SURE to add on the scrambled eggs! They're so fluffy and beautiful and delicious. My mouth is watering brb....

We tried the blue bowl, kimchi scrambled eggs, two eggs on toast, among others. I do recommend getting the eggs on toast with avocado versus the avocado toast with eggs since it's cheaper and you really don't need as much avo as they give. But just my opinion (I chose the avo toast bc I enjoy the aesthetics lol).

Service was friendly and fast. I can't wait to go again!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-08-12,3.0,"So I think this is a testament to hit-or-miss locations. I originally had a 5-star review drafted and was going to post it after a second try as I do like to give most places more than one chance before writing the review to avoid one-off experiences. 

Here's my take: The food is phenomenal. I've had the blue bowl, the green bowl, and their eggs over toast. First, the bowls are amazing. I'm a big meat eater, and I'm a savory breakfast lover. I eat eggs very often and prefer a meaty breakfast to go with it. However, their bowls are fresh, flavorful, and the most delicious and healthy breakfast I've eaten in a while. It's a great pick me up after a night of drinking or when you've had too much take out. Their eggs are also super delicious. How they make them is a mystery to me. Honestly, I've tried to recreate them at home but it's very hard to do. They're light, fluffy, designed well, and not burned in the slightest.

Their coffee is also fairly good. $3 for a drip coffee is a great deal, just keep in mind that they go against the grain here and charge you $1 per refill which isn't typically the case in NYC. Again, though, this doesn't warrant any star decreases.

What does warrant the decrease is the service. There's a big dude in there who just seems like he hates being there. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. We arrived an hour after they first opened on this most recent visit after walking summer streets. One girl was in there, half done with her meal, and it seemed like he just wanted her out. Food was still on her plate, the place was empty, and he was trying to take it. 

Okay, I thought - maybe it's just early or maybe something happened. She looked upset. He came to our table, slammed the water bottle down. Again, maybe it was an accident. He barely says anything to my girlfriend or me, takes our orders and walks away. The entire time we're there he says nothing to us. We finished that water bottle and he slams another down. We're being extra polite, saying our thank you's and smiling and he doesn't respond at all. Again, I thought maybe it was me looking too into it. Maybe he's just not a friendly dude. I can get that. Then a family walked in, which, coincidentally was here last time we came as well. This guy is talking and laughing with them. On our previous experience, he was not our waiter, and I remembered him interacting the same way with them but ignoring others (we were sat closer to the kitchen).

I ask him for a refill, please, and thank you. Slams it down. By this point, my girlfriend is noticing how aggressive he is. We finish our meal and ask him for the check. She insists on paying since I bought dinner last night, and tries to get the check as he's coming over but he slams it down in front of me while her hand was out for it. Even while handing us the check, not a word was being spoken to us. What gives?

Look, being a good server is tough. I've done it, my friends have done it. Some still do it. We make excuses for people having bad days and often overlook it. However, when it's clear my dude just didn't like us (or that girl who was there in the beginning, or a smaller group who came in) it becomes something we can't overlook. 

Good thanks: Your food is good, but the service we received left such a bad taste in our mouth we doubt we'll return. There are many other cafes with similar eggs and menus and styles. It is because of this service that if I'm asked if I'll return, I'll probably say ""Nah, I'm good... thanks"". Let us know if you make any changes to the service because we really did like your food."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-08-07,4.0,"3pm boozie brunches are hard. I usually eat pretty early so I wanted a pre-brunch snack. My friend hit me up and we decided to come to Good Thanks for a light meal. 

This review is solely based on the one thing I ordered, which is their banana bread. It's gluten free and comes with their burnt honey buttercream. The buttercream was amazing. The banana bread was extremely moist too.

The space is really cute inside but it get's loud. The tables are closely positioned next to each other so don't expect much privacy here. The dishes were are moderately priced but I thought my bread was pricey at $8 for 2 slices.

Overall, I really enjoyed my banana bread. I'll be back to try their scrambled eggs which look so freaking fluffy and cooked perfectly."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-12-26,4.0,"Stopped by here around 11AM on a Tuesday and there was no wait. The Australian cafe was small and cozy, which probably can hold 20-25 people. It may have been a little too tight since we were literally on top of the group  next to us (we were used to this NYC atmosphere). 

We ordered the famous scrambled eggs with add ons and lattes. The fluffy eggs were perfectly cooked. The sourdough bread that it came with was too annoying to eat (could barely cut through it). There was a little too much salt on both the eggs and the avocado. 

The servers were friendly and gave us time to look over the menu. We felt a little rushed when no one was waiting since they asked us if we were still working on our dishes and gave us the check when we didn't ask for it. 

Overall, average brunch price and a good place to catch up with small group of friends."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-02-15,5.0,"Cute little jam !!! We came here for a late breakfast and really enjoyed it. My friend and I shared Breakfast roll and Kimchi scramble Toast. Absolutely delicious  
We are coming back for sure!!!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-11-28,4.0,"The açai bowl was delicious! The scrambled eggs with avocado and greens was incredible! The toasted bread was extremely burnt and hard, but the rest of the dish was lovely. I'd highly suggest it! The service was okay and the interior of the restaurant was lovely. It's a small cafe and it gets crowded very quickly."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-05-31,5.0,"Location : LES - Lower East Side 

Service : 5 Stars - Everybody was extremely nice, pleasant, and multiple people checked up on me throughout my meal

What I Got:

Blue Bowl - $12 - IT WAS FREAKING DELICIOUS!! It was beautifully plated with fresh kiwi, berries, and granola, perfect for my post - run meal. 

Iced Coconut Matcha - $6 - I'm a sucker for anything matcha, so I couldn't resist trying one of their drink options. It could've used a little more coconut milk, but nonetheless, very refreshing. 

** I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area, you won't be disappointed ! **"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-06-23,4.0,"I really liked the food here, SO tasty. We got a kimchi scrambled egg plate and the avocado toast with a scrambled egg. Also got iced matcha lattes, one of which was the coconut match with coconut flakes. 
Prices were comparable to other similar places, the food was definitely worth it IMO although I found the drinks just okay. The food is also really pretty, but unlike most places that are very Instagrammy, the food DOES taste as good (if not better) than it looks. Service was quick and the waiters were nice."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-12-20,5.0,"Yummy brunch! 

Was able to get the much lusted-after window seats for the Instagram pics. Great food and service."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-03-08,5.0,Always have a great experience at Good Thanks NYC! The food and service is excellent. If I lived in LES I'd be in here all the time!
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-04-05,5.0,"I usually never get avocado toast because I don't think it's worth the price. However, the beautiful rose-shaped scrambled eggs, along with the perfectly seasoned avocado, made me cave.

I ordered the two eggs on toast with a side of avocado. It was amazing, and super aesthetic. Definitely coming back to try the blue bowl next time!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-03-09,4.0,"Similar to Ruby's and Hole in the Wall, this cafe is the staple LES Australian brunch spot with all of your typical instagrammable, slightly overpriced, good ""healthy"" brunch options.

The menu is organized basically by how hungry you are, with everything from light bites to full breakfasts. I ordered drip coffee to start ($3, $1 refills) and the good mornin bowl with kale, quinoa, pickled onions, tomatoes, a soft egg, and avocado ($15). While overpriced for the portion size, it was delicious - the dressing on it was fresh and light. The egg was cooked perfectly and the avocado was at prime ripeness. The eggs on toast ($8) that my friend ordered with avocado ($4 extra) was a solid size with really thick sourdough toast. 

I hate paying for coffee refills and again, it's overpriced for what it is, but pretty solid option. They have a number of other coffee drinks and brunch cocktails to choose from as well. Service was fine but unexceptional. 

Will return largely due to proximity to my apt. Probably wouldn't go out of my way."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-10-28,5.0,"Awesome brunch. My friend and I arrived at 1pm on a Saturday and were told the wait would be 30-40 minutes. But after 5 minutes we were seated! 
I ordered the avocado toast w/scrambled eggs. She got the açaí bowl. Both were really good! Best avo egg toast I've ever had! The eggs were fantastic."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-03-15,4.0,"Aussie cafes are slowly taking over NYC, so I had to check their one while in town. Omg is the place cute and SMALL, we were lucky enough to get the window view (less squishy and not table to table) 

Love the breakfast roll, the egg and mayo and accoutrements worked together beautifully (one of the best egg sandwich I've had) 

The smoothie bowl was as usual pretty to look it, Not amazing in taste. I liked the granola they used, it tasted less processed and higher quality 

Coffee, I ordered a latte and it wasn't bad, but I would've rather gotten their iced teas

Price was what you expect for a popular brunch spot but will I visit again? Maybe in a couple of months"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-02-11,4.0,"Yet another friendly Aussie cafe that's become a ubiquitous sight around Lower East Side. And despite the many alternative cafes for coffee, wine, and light fare, Good Thanks seems to be well positioned to be a neighborhood fixture for a while to come. 

I got the kimchi eggs, and I have to imagine it's one of their best dishes on the menu. I'd absolutely come back for this dish again and again. 

It closes pretty early (4pm), so you'll have to pop in for breakfast or lunch. No word on whether they'll stay open later, but that'd be a welcome development if it were to happen."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-09-02,5.0,"I had scene this place on Instagram but ended up stumbling upon it when I couldn't get into another brunch place down the street. I'm happy we were able to eat here. The food is not only beautiful but delicious. I have never had softer and tastier scrambled eggs. The sourdough toast is thick and crunchy on the outside, yet soft on the inside. Great little spot to try some delicious eggs."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-02-15,4.0,Came here for brunch with my friend and it was really good! I ordered the kimchi scrambled eggs and he got fruits and yogurt. Service was quick and friendly. Would come back!
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-09-01,5.0,"I loved it! 
Basic brunch food but they somehow make their eggs super fluffy and juicy. Wonderful service."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-01-18,3.0,"Excellent coffee. Food looks better than it tastes. I was looking forward to eating soft warm gooey scrambled eggs on avocado toast BUT the smashed avocados on the sourdough slice was COLD - like someone just took it out of the refrigerator and plopped it on toast. The eggs got cold as well and had no flavor (which sounds weird, but it's true). I was disappointed that the food was not warm or even room temperature. It was cold. 

I also tried the mushroom toast with labneh and picked egg - pretty good.

May return to try their blue bowl"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-08-02,4.0,"Popped in for a quick bite and got the kimchi eggs plate. It's a tiny cafe so be prepared to feel smushed, but that's not uncommon for cafes in this area. The dish was pretty yummy - the eggs in particular had a great texture and flavor. It also comes with a salad, avocado and huge slab of sourdough bread so ended up being a very filling plate. Came on a Monday morning and didn't have to wait for a table too!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-03-14,4.0,"My favorite place near my neighborhood for breakfast!! I love their bowls and the avocado toasts are really good. 

The blue bowl is algae based, it has fruits and nuts on top. It tastes really good, comes in a cute bowl, and the price is about $12, which isn't too bad. I also recommend getting the charcoal bowl because that tastes nothing like charcoal and very berry like!

The avocado toast is great as well. I don't even like avocado but I enjoy Good Thanks' avocado toast a lot. It's great with a squeeze of lemon and adding salmon makes it taste great.

On weekends there is an average of 40-60 min wait but definitely come on weekdays!!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-01-13,4.0,"The perfect looking egg but maybe reduce 10 second of cooking time it would taste softer as it looks like!
Few mushroom costs $4 .. #nyscene"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-03-01,5.0,My fiancé and I have lived across the street from Good Thanks for almost 2 years and we go all the time. WE LOVE IT!!! We have tried a lot of different things on the menu and all are amazing. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. I love the toast with jam. The jam is unreal!!!! The eggs are good too and so is the smoked salmon. My fiancé loves the Vegemite on the toast too. Also love the banana smoothie - YUM!
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-02-26,4.0,"There are a million Australian cafes in New York, but Good Thanks may be the best of them all. It's a pretty small place, but I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes to eat here, even at peak weekend brunch times. I also feel that their menu is more unique than the standard Australian cafe -- the green fritters especially are a standout. I've also had the blue bowl, the mushroom toast, and their scrambled eggs. The scrambled eggs here are PERFECT, really fluffy and smooth, and they come out in this beautiful rose shape, which yes, looks very good on your Instagram. 

I've been hunting for the New York equivalent of the perfect blue majik acai bowl I had at Great White in Venice last year, and the blue bowl here is sadly... not that, although it's still good! Just nothing to write home about. Mushroom toast here was good, but doesn't compete with the one at Two Hands in Tribeca. Coffee is great, as expected. The service is pretty relaxed and I always have to wave someone down to get the check, but your food comes out pretty quickly!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-01-19,2.0,"Two stars for the food. It was pretty good but nothing amazing. I got the Blue Bowl, Avocado Toast with Scrambled Eggs and the Banana Bread. I had high hopes for the eggs but honestly it wasn't that great. I appreciate the amount of avocado they put in though.

The service was pretty bad. The host/server told us it would be a 20 minute wait and that he'd text us when the table was ready so we ended up walking around the area to explore. After a little over 20 minutes, we still didn't get a text so we came back and there were a couple of tables open. I'd like to think he didn't forget about us so that was fine. My main issue was the horrid service. The servers had a lot of attitude when we asked when our food was coming (which took a longer time than usual based on other tables), when we asked for hot sauce and extra napkins. Nobody checked on us while we dined either.

It's ironic that this place is called Good Thanks. Nobody thanked us even when we thanked them lol. I won't be back. No thanks."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-07-13,5.0,"Simple good food. Clean and fresh, with beautiful presentation even though it's just an avocado, scrambled eggs and thick crusty toast. More restaurants should be like GOOD THANKS. So much respect for the food and the service is just what we needed. Good and honest without being plastic or insincere. Highly recommend this place. 

Only flaw, the place is tiny. Just pray hard you don't sit next to any loudmouth."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2018-12-08,5.0,"w o w ! This place is incredible. My friend and I stopped in here for a casual light, healthy lunch as we saw a lot of good reviews here. I have noticed an uprising scene of Australian cafes and I'm completely submerged in it - these type of cafes are SO good! We both ordered the blue bowl which has bananas, pineapple, coconut, e3 magic algae, collagen, and its topped with kiwi, blueberries, pomegranate and granola. The consistency in these bowls is a very nice thick, and they served it in these cute coconut bowls! I found there was a good topping to smoothie volume ratio, which is very hard to achieve when going out for smoothie bowls. 
The taste was very fresh and light, I loved my bowl and my friend felt the same way about hers. The place itself is quaint, and the staff is very friendly. I would definitely suggest coming here it's so worth it!!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-01-17,5.0,"Nolita and Lower East side are fast becoming a hub for Australian cafes. Good thanks is one of the newest to join the community, having opened not too long ago, but has quickly become very popular. 
We visited recently and could see why. 
The food here is great, just like a good Australian cafe back home, and in my opinion, much better than most of the Australian cafes in New York. 
Our server was pleasant and efficient, and everything was brought out to us in a timely manner. 
I had the get well bowl, which is one of the best healthy breakfasts I've had out recently in New York. My husband had the bacon and egg roll, which he enjoyed a lot. The bacon on his roll was perfectly crispy. 
The space is small, like most other cafes in the area. However, with quick turnaround, waiting shouldn't be an issue."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-03-08,5.0,"their scrambled eggs are delicious & the kimchi combination is so unique and goooood! the hot chocolate foam just completely melted my heart the place is a bit crowded but it's clean, service is good & temperature is controlled (so it's not 'warm' coming in from outside). Overall, very positive experience!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2018-12-31,3.0,"I had a chai latte and the kimchi fried eggs with avocado ($18).

I think there was some kind of white cream on the side of the dish which tasted delicious. I would say overall it was pretty good... for some reason though I didn't really taste the ""kimchi"" or it didn't come through or pair that well for me. I recommend going for the regular scrambled eggs and toast ($8) and then just adding the avocado rather than getting this meal.

The dish was filling but not in a heavy or overly done way. The service was wonderful."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-03-15,5.0,Beautiful and healthy! I love this place and want to come back soon and try everything. So many unique acai bowls and an affordable and healthy breakfast / brunch place!
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2018-10-23,4.0,"So I have to admit the only reason I came in here was to get a cup of coffee while Jamie W., Carlos, and I were waiting 45 minutes for our table at the overly popular Russ & Daughters Cafe two doors down on Orchard. While there were audible clumps of myopic, badly dressed tourists huddled around the entrance of the cafe, there was a much cooler hipster vibe in this place. Apparently it's run by a couple of Aussie expats which meant they served tropical bowls, zucchini fritters, and kimchi eggs rather than knishes, latkes, and nova salmon. On a different morning, and if I was a local, I would have been tempted by their menu, but I just ordered the $3 Drip Coffee which they poured with assurance into a to-go cup since they could probably tell I had baklava on the brain (photo: http://bit.ly/2z0v4XZ).

COFFEE - 4 stars...smooth joe while I daydreamed about my latke
AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...rustic-cool touches to match the rustic-cool clientele
SERVICE - 4 stars...quite nice since I was going to dine at the competition
TOTAL - 4 stars...I should come back when I'm in the LES, who knows when

41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-11-29,5.0,"I love this cafe! Each time the food is amazing and the staff are super friendly. The space may be small and mean a wait, but it is totally worth it. Also, their smoothie bowls are the best I've had in NYC; so creamy and with great toppings. When friends are in town I always bring them there. A must if you're in the area!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2018-12-16,4.0,"We heard about this new Australian place serving brunch so we decided to go and check it out at noon on a Saturday. There was quite a buzz and a small crowd around the door, but we put our name down and were called back in about 30 minutes. It's a tiny place but has a distinctly cheery atmosphere. The waitstaff were especially friendly; we definitely felt welcomed from beginning to end. 

I like the menu because it has a healthy feel while giving plenty of options for every size appetite. We tried the avocado toast with scrambled egg and the good mornin' bowl (quinoa/poached eggs/avocado). Both were yummy but the avocado toast was the highlight. I loved how generous they were with the avocado in both dishes!

Overall, I think this is a really nice place for brunch. If you can get there on a weekday when there isn't a wait that's even better!"

I love getting the blue bowl and the scrambled egg on toast with avocado (like the basic bz that I am). The eggs are so fluffy and yummy and the bowl is like a breakfast ice cream sundae (not that it's super sweet or anything). I've also had the kimchi scramble and the white fish toast, both of which are delicious and spot on. Service is friendly and quick, wait times are never too long either."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2018-10-14,5.0,"Wish I could give them more than 5 stars. 

I got here on a Saturday afternoon when they were about to close. The minute I reached the cafe a guy standing at the door said they were not accepting any customers due to high volume of people that morning and running out of most food in the kitchen. I told him I was coming from Queens, spent almost 40 minutes on my commute and really badly wanted to try their blue bowl. I assume he felt bad and let me sit and order. It was the happiest moment of the day since I was super hungry and in a serious need of caffeine. 

Anyway, I ordered my blue bowl and latte and franticly was waiting on my food and drink to come. In mid-time the same guy who turned out to be the owner came up to me and thanked for coming all the way from Queens. He checked on me and other tables multiple times while I was having my breakfast there. The humbleness and care that he showed for his customers was excellent and something worth to appreciate. 

Once I ordered I started to look around and realized the decor.  Bright open space with a modern feel, making for a slightly upscale version of breakfast. Various shades of white. You ll feel like you are eating inside of some kind of catalogue. And a beautiful wall decorated with interesting paintings.   

If you know me, you know how much I love Australian brekki over your greasy, tasteless, average diner fare. Everything on the menu spoke to me. Im a diehard savory/eggs brunch person but I wanted to try something sweet and cold this time thats why I went for the blue bowl. So it arrived. OH MY! It tasted as good as it looked and was the perfect mix of ingredients. The portion was good as well. Usually such bowls come in a small portion leaving you half full, but this bowl was enough and satisfied my hunger and taste buds. 

Im dying to try everything on the menu. Cant wait to go back and recommend it to everyone. 

One more important note: Vibes matter so much to me. Any place I step in, I want to feel the good vibes. And Good thanks had it all. It delivered the good food, good coffee and good vibes. Thank you for everything."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-01-06,5.0,"This place is amazing! The interior, atmosphere, staff and the food, of course. Everything is on point. Definitely gonna come back when visiting New York City."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-12-22,5.0,Avocado toast and Acai bowl were deliciously fresh and filling for a healthy breakfast. Wish I lived in the area so I could have them more often!
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-12-20,3.0,"Try better Australian Brunch elsewhere! 

The portion size of everything is so small! Was still very HUNGRY and needing another meal right after spending more than $50 on brunch here..

The food and drinks were OK but not amazing enough for the price. The suggested tip on the receipt was at least 18% even if you came here by yourself.

The blue spirulina smoothie bowl was beautiful to look at but taste just like a normal banana smoothie bowl. It was icy cold so not great for winter - I think it would be great for summer though, so if you do want to try it, don't make the same mistake that I did and order it on a cold day! 

The burger tasted great but it was so small that I would call it a mini burger rather than a burger, and it didn't come with fries on the side either.. 

The tables here are tightly packed and very small, so not too great for group visits or dates as you will be sitting just centimetres away from the next table and will need to squeeze yourself and move your table just to get in and get out.. It gets crowded quickly and you won't have enough space to fit your coats and belongings near you. 

I wouldn't recommend this place unless you are ok with sitting in small uncomfortable chairs, dining on a tiny table and being hungry after paying normal brunch prices for tiny portions (at least you'll be full at other places)."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-04-03,5.0,"Love this Australian cafe!! Overall, had a really great experience when I came here one morning for breakfast. I had a difficult time choosing between the many toasts or bowls, but in the end opted for the blue bowl. I was tempted to order it based on its beautiful blue coloring and was very pleased. It was very filling and the toppings paired well with the base. The bowl is $12, which I thought was very reasonable compared to other places. The place was fairly busy for a mid Monday morning, but the service was still very fast and excellent."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2018-09-30,5.0,"Stopped here after a red eye into the city. We were greeted by a friendly staff member and quickly order some liquid fuel in the form of the most delicious coffee I've had in New York. Our server was so personable, funny, and sweet. I ordered the fritters breakfast with a side of bacon (after watching them bring up trays of freshly cooked bacon from downstairs). 

I was so impressed with the sauce, the salad, and the quality of the food. I will absolutely come back when I return to town!"
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2018-10-28,5.0,"Great spot for breakfast or a nice cappuccino in the LES. My boyfriend and I were stuck in the rain and didn't want to wait an hour+ for bagels next door. This was the perfect backup plan! 

We got the blue majik bowl and kimchi scrambled eggs on sourdough toast. The bowl was filled with delicious fruit and granola. The eggs were great but the only downside was that I didn't have enough of that labne spread that was on the side of the plate - it was so good! The girls next to us had a slice of banana bread to share & were raving about the butter. We'll definitely stop by there again next time we're around the area.

Service was great and all staff members were able to assist us when we needed anything. While the place is small we didn't have to wait long at all for our food or the check."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2018-10-14,4.0,"A cute Australian owned cafe that seats about 15-20. Had the kimchi scrambled eggs with an added side of bacon. I'd never think to add kimchi to eggs and that was a welcome innovation. Also had the peach spritz.

I'd say they need a better way of accounting for a waitlist. The host this particular afternoon either forgot to put our name down or wrote the incorrect name so we watched several groups of people who arrived after us get seated before us. Their system also happened to go 'down' when we were about to pay and even though it seemed like they could still process credit cards, we were encouraged to go around the corner to get cash from the bodega. 

So overall, food was a 5 while service was 2-3."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-01-22,5.0,"Top 5 scrambled eggs ever. I got mine on sourdough then ate the bread separately with butter and an amazingly smooth strawberry jelly. They have a nice assortment of  caffeinated beverages. Light and perfectly warmed pain au chocolate. Feels like a neighborhood place, awesome service. It was good, thanks."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-09-02,5.0,"You might have to wait a bit, but there's a waitlist system that texts you so you can shop/go elsewhere and return when you're close to the top of the waitlist.

the restaurant is excellent. Service is friendly and vibe is cozy on a rainy day. 

Coffee is really good, and the portions aren't huge but reasonable for the prices which are below 15. Would highly recommend the banana bread with honey butter and the açaí bowl doesn't have yogurt which is different than most places (only small critique is that the açaí seems like it was frozen and then blended so it's a bit icy but still good). 

Avocado toast serving is large compared to the usual brunch 

Probably around $22-25 with tip and tax if you get a coffee and entree."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-11-27,5.0,"Fantastic breakfast spot especially if eggs are your jam! Not sure how they make the scrambles but they are the fluffiest we've had anywhere, and they're also a feast for the eyes. We had the breakfast roll and a scramble with toast and avocado. The tomato jam in the breakfast roll gave it an extra punch. We also liked the house made hot sauce on both dishes. We were too full to order anything else but we're eyeing the blue bowl for next time."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-11-05,5.0,"The food is absolutely fabulous. It is presented beautifully. We were going to go to the place next door, but due to the wait there, we ended up at Good Thanks. Such a delightful mistake. So much so that we came down again all the way from East Harlem to come back once more before the end of our trip. This is a must visit."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-05-17,4.0,"Came here in the afternoon for Brunch since my boyfriend wanted to try two eggs and toast.

It was a nice and cool vibe place. We walked in and got a table really quick, it wasn't that busy. The service was fine, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't out of my expectation. 

We order drinks which was the ice matcha latte and the drip coffee.Then order the two eggs and toast(added salmon) and blue bowl. Food came together at the same time.

The blue bowl was delicious and very cooling for a hot day. On the other hand, the two eggs weren't what he was hoping to taste from the look, he thought it would be more silk and smooth as the texture.
It was a bit over price for the amount of food we got. I wouldn't go out my way to come here, but I'll come back for brunch sometimes."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-08-16,2.0,"Dishes are overpriced and the food is mediocre. But what really bothered me was when I ordered, the server sat down in an empty chair next to me to take down the order. He did that to every table and it was very unprofessional."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-10-20,5.0,"Besides this little cafe being tiny....it's amazing. When I lived in the Les, I would come here all the time and just sit by my self In the morning and people watch. Get the blue bowl!!!! And their cold brew is pretty damn great too."
41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2019-10-19,5.0,"We had brunch at Good Thanks Cafe today. The food was natural and fresh. We ordered blue bowl and kimchi scrambled eggs, and both are so good!

41,good-thanks-nyc-new-york,2020-01-03,5.0,"GREAT avocado toast with scrambled egg - hearty enough for the hungry.  Coffee on point as well.  If you're still hungry, get the Blue Bowl for a refreshing finisher."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-04-17,5.0,"The first time I had their kakigori was at the Prospect Park Smorgasburg. They had a stand there and it was a pretty hot day so I decided to get some shaved ice. It was amazing to say the least. Part of me thought maybe it was also because it was really hot that day or I was just in dire need of sugar. Nonetheless, I decided to visit their actual store to try it again.

My friend and I came in on a night in January. It was pretty empty but was understandable since it was a weekday and pretty cold outside. They had some seasonal flavors, but we went for the strawberry and cream since I love strawberries. They also had 2 sizes so we went with the large since there was 2 of us and why not? Let me tell you the large is huge!! Maybe it was because we had already eaten before but it can easily be split between 3 or 4 people. The ice is really shaved thin and melts immediately in your mouth. There is strawberry syrup in every bite. It's essentially two big snowballs and in the middle there is some cream and strawberry purée or jam (not sure what it was, but it was delicious!). They also top it off with more of the cream. It was not too sweet and had the right amount of tartness from the strawberry. Can't go wrong with the classics.

I'll definitely have to come back and try more of their flavors!"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-03-27,4.0,"i have been a huge fan of kakigori, bingsoo, shaved ice... you name it.

the staff barely acknowledges you as you walk in. they always look stressed out. there was an occasion where i just walked out because no one paid attention to me.

i've ordered drinks- they were good. it took 15mins to prepare. i've ordered a simple Matcha Kakigori. it was delicious. it's worth it."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-03-12,5.0,"Shaved ice, shaved snow, bingsu... honestly what is the difference. 

Bonsai Kakigori is so good! We strolled over after a dinner in West Village. The 25 minute walk worked up another appetite and four of us shared the Japanese Egg Salad Sandwich, Matcha Mountain, and Strawberries & Cream. We got both of the kakigori in a small size and whipped cream on the side for our lactose-intolerant friend. Total was about $32!

The kakigori are very very good. The flavors were strong and complemented each other very well. The whipped cream was super addictive and I think because we requested them on the side, they were a little generous with the portion. Egg salad sandwich was interesting... I think they were good, just not the flavors I was expecting. Mmm Japanese milk bread though. It would be cool to see a more expanded menu based on just the bread but that's just me and my love for carbs.

Highly recommend! Super chill space."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-02-25,2.0,"I liked the lavender latte and it had a strong lavender flavor.  However, I was disappointed in the food. The wait for the food took quite a while because the staff was not paying attention to us.  In fact, the trainee was put in charge of preparing our food.  Therefore, my avocado miso toast was burnt and very salty.  See photos for the black toast, which he tried to hide by turning over.  There wasn't a lot of attention placed on cooking the food.  Also, pure miso paste smeared on toast is extremely salty and unappetizing.  I encourage the restaurant to change this recipe.  

This is not an authentic Japanese experience despite the decor, which is clean and Japanese-like.

Disappointed.  

Photos attached."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-02-01,4.0,"This was my first time trying Kakigori, a Japanese dessert made of shaved ice and flavoring. The closest thing I can compare it to is a Korean bing-soo, but not really. 

I had the Matcha Mountain (small) for under $6. Good decision, because it was a large serving anyway. My kakigori had a deliciously rich matcha flavor. It was topped with whipped cream and puffed rice along with more whipped cream in the middle of the kakigori.

My friends both ordered the Strawberries & Cream kakigori. Those were basically the same as mine, but different flavor and fillings.. one with a savory pumpkin brittle and the other with a
black sesame brittle. These savory brittles balanced out the sweet flavors well.

I was looking forward to trying their more exotic kakigori flavors, but for some reason, they're not offered anymore or at least for now."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-01-12,3.0,"I tried the matcha tiramisu, strawberry shaved ice, and the matcha shaved ice

They ran out half of their menu hah when I was there around 8pm on a Sat night. 

The strawberry shaved ice tasted pretty artificial - just imagine shaved ice, strawberry flavored sauce, and whipped cream. Didn't care for it

The matcha shaved ice is more worth it - less of that artificial sweet flavor

I'd skip the tiramisu too. You can see them making it and just looks like they throw in some bread into a cup and fill it with whipped cream and milk"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-01-01,4.0,"Decided to come here after dinner on a Tuesday night! It was pretty empty and we were the only ones there.

There was a single guy working at the counter and he was super friendly.

I've been to their location in canal street market and was not impressed with the blueberry cheesecake flavor I had. I decided to try the matcha mountain flavor this time. We got the large size and it was huuuge.

The shaved ice is drenched with matcha sauce and pairs well with the rice krispies and cream that comes on top. 

We were not able to finish the entire thing and had about a third left at the end. The large size could probably be shared with up to 3 people!!"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-12-05,4.0,"I was craving shaved ice last night and opted to come here after grabbing dinner in the neighborhood. I was honestly blown away by the strawberry and cream shaved snow. Everything from the crushed pieces of toffee to the cream was so good. Did I mention the entire dessert is VEGAN? Amazing!!

Unfortunately, the lychee panna cotta fell flat. The black sesame powder and lychee chunks were good but the passionfruit jam was really tart and overpowering which took away from the lightness of the dessert.The girl at the counter was also really helpful and gave us wonderful recommendations. I can't wait to come back to try the other dessert options."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-12-04,5.0,"This place is so good and unique, my boyfriend and I went twice in the span of three days. The first time, we were watching this reallY strange live-action Japanese show on Netflix called Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman which features Kakigori in the second episode. It looked amazing so we found this place in the area we were already in.

Kakigori is a Japanese style of shaved ice, and Bonsai uses as many House-made and natural ingredients as possible. The larges are $15 and are enough for 2-3 people. Smalls are only $5! My friends shared a seasonal caramel apple. They loved it. One friend especially liked the candies walnuts and kept digging through the ice for it. I had a small strawberries and cream. It had such a nice variety of flavors and textures from the sweet strawberry syrup, to the whipped topping, to the sesame brittle. I tried a bite of both and couldn't decide on a favorite. The person working there was also incredibly hospitable and we all had a great conversation with him.

A couple days later we were with a new group of friends after watching the same show. One of my friends was especially excited because they have gluten free options (ask which ones are when you order). We shared a special pomegranate cream cheese Kakigori. Again, delicious. Even though it's mostly ice, it tasted like cream cheese. The same worker was there this time, remembered us, and gave my boyfriend rewards for this and our previous visit.

Our friends live right down the street from this place and plan on trying more of their dessert options"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-10-04,5.0,"I came here after falling in love with their Japanese shaved ice I had at the Canal Street Market. I brought my friends to try their Matcha Mountain flavor, which is my favorite. It's hard to bring out the dense matcha flavor out of shaved ice, but Bonsai Kakigori does an excellent job of making the shaved ice so flavorful. We also tried their Japanese egg salad sandwich ($9) and it was pretty good as well. I want to come back here again to try their summer flavors, such as Blueberry Cheesecake, Caramel Corn Sundae, and Lychee Basil Watermelon, which all sound delicious and unique. 

Also, I must say this is one of the cutest cafe spots in LES as I immediately fell in love with the neat, cute, and minimal interior design. The cafe is pretty small and probably has about 4 -5 tables, but it feels very cozy. If you're looking for some good dessert that's not too heavy yet delicious and satisfying, I highly recommend visiting this place!"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-08-15,5.0,"This shave ice cuts a hot summer night like butter! Got the Matcha Mountain, which is basically a towering nest of refreshing layers of shave ice and this crisp yet creamy matcha syrup that tastes natural and divine. 

Their homemade whipped cream is so delicious, as is the rice addition of the rice puffs. The whole texture is fluffy, creamy, crisp, and refreshing. Can't find that anywhere! 

My one quip is where's the chocolate?? There's not a single flavor with any chocolate or chocolate syrup, but a whole ton of banana miso and caramel and maple nonsense.

Nonetheless, five stars!!!!"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-08-12,5.0,"I'm not a huge fan of shaved ice.  
I only eat patbingsoo(Korean shaved ice dessert) for the toppings and do not mix it with the ice so I had my doubts about this place as there's minimum topping, but was genuinely surprised on how good it was. 

Bonsai Kakigori is located inside the Canal Street Market.  Line does go little slow as the staff are literally manually shaving the ice in front of you, which you can be a spectator of. 

We had ordered a small seasonal rose shaved ice to share.  Thought the size would be pretty small but was more than enough to share between the 3 of us. Best way to describe the shaved dessert here is like a really good snow cone but with a twist.  Shaved ice is topped with flavored syrup, and topped with house made whipped cream and toppings.  

Overall, while it looks like sugar overload, everything was actually pretty well balanced.  The ice was coaxed with the syrup so it had lot of flavors but not at all sweet to the degree that you would think.  House made whipped cream was creamy but not overly sweet and had a pleasant thick paste consistency.  Whipped cream had a pistachio flavor and  combined with this, you have some topping, depending on your order, to give you some texture to chomp on. Best of all, the ice was actually fluffy and not at all sharp and cold like your typical shaved ice ice that this can be enjoyed all year long.

They definitely do not skimp you on the elbow grease for this dessert and also add 2 layers of whipped cream and topping for you to enjoy.  Pretty simple dessert with a great flavor palate that I would definitely recommend you in trying."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-02-05,5.0,"This place is small and their flavors are big , delicious and so freaking yummy.  I love there menu and the vibe is relaxing."

The staff here is great and quickly churns out these beautiful and delicious shaved ice cups. I got the lychee with sesame brittle and it was so good. The homemade whipped cream was the perfect topping. My boyfriend got the blueberry cheesecake and it was equally delicious. This is definitely a place we'll stop by again the next time we're in the LES. 
They also have a rewards card - buy 10 and get the 11th free. Can't wait to go back!"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-07-18,5.0,"Lavender matcha. 

Just get it. You won't regret your decision.

The kakigori is like a one night stand. Brief, fleeting, moment of pleasure than collapses into a delicious mess that somewhat feels wrong to be eating after a while.

Mango ginger is a good flavor though. Love the candied ginger pieces. Not fully aware of the ginger whipped cream there.

This space probably seats 15 at most. Cozy but not busy on a Thursday afternoon.

And again, lavender latte, amazing."

Quantity: Fair
Cleanliness: Good
Dessert: Banana Miso Maple $5 / Matcha Mountain $5

My first time trying Japanese slush ice with so many interesting flavors that I want to try. This is a small dessert place with very limited seating, cozy and simple decorations.

Matcha Mountain: Love it! This is for someone who likes strong matcha flavor. You can taste a strong match with a little bitterness. I absolutely love the flavor with puffed rice on top and matcha whipped cream.

Banana Miso Maple: Banana milk with the banana walnut crunch in the center of the ice. A hint of miso saltiness and sweet taste of banana. Walnut crunch was my favorite when you get to the center of it. 
A cute dessert place to try, I will most likely return to try their winter flavors."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-07-16,4.0,"I desperately needed a palate cleansing after eating at a nearby ramen place. Shaved ice always seems to do the trick. Ordered a large matcha mountain that we didn't receive until we mentioned we ordered it. At least fifteen people received their order and we were like, uh, where's ours? Our order was overlooked unfortunately. Tasted great when we finally did receive it though. This is just shaved ice where the syrup/juice whatever they use, is added later. There's additional whipped cream inside and they sprinkle puffed rice over the whipped cream. There's a way to eat it without everything toppling over, you just have to figure out a way that works for you. ;)

I have to deduct a star as they have the ac blasting and their windows and doors were wide open, which is illegal as you're taxing our electrical grid! That's how transformers get blown and how blackouts happen!"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-08-12,4.0,"A light, different version of shaved ice that's satisfying on a warm day. It's basically fluffy, shaved ice with syrups, flavored whipped cream, and toppings. 

What I like most about this place is that they have toppings in the center of the shaved ice so you're not just eating flavored ice midway through. Only $5 for a small which can be shared between two people. 

Matcha Madness: I'm biased because I love matcha. The matcha flavor is strong and there's a bitterness to the ice which I enjoyed. 
Raspberry Rose: So nicely tart. The raspberry and rose balanced each other out and the rose wasn't too floral so it didn't feel like you were eating soap or flowers.
Lychee Basil Watermelon: Super strong lychee taste - I couldn't taste the watermelon and only tasted the basil in the cream. 
Strawberries & Cream: I've heard great things about this flavor. It is light and not too sweet. Not my favorite because of personal preference - I'm not a huge strawberry fan. 

The dessert is very airy and melts quickly so it is not as filling as you expect. Creative and delicious combinations and the shareable sizes make it easy to try many flavors. I still prefer milky shaved ice but this is a great alternative for a lighter, refreshing dessert."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-07-12,4.0,"Nice for a first time on a hot summer day. LOOKS big but the ice shavings has a lot of air pockets and also melts fast so it was actually eaten fairly quickly. We got the banana miso.

 The first bite all I tasted was miso and slightly regretted. But keep eating! The next bite had a banana with a hint of miso! It's weird but works well together. The star is the banana crunch walnut nuts sprinkled on top. This made my ice shavings another level. They actually do two syrup fillings so be careful when you bring ur shaving along. I saw someones topple over LoL. But it was refreshing and pretty good to share
 $5 small $7 medium and the black bowl was $11?  IG eatsumbap. Good to try as a first timer!"

Also the customer service was next level! 
The gentleman who took our orders was so informative and friendly, and brought our food over to us.

It's a right time have Kakigōri, Japanese-inspired desserts, in the hot Summer, Bonsai offers many options of Kakigōri , going with classic flovours is always a good choice, but we tried special summer flavors which are Alnold Palmer (Lemonade + Peach Black Tea with poached peach slices and peach ginger jam), It's fruity and fresh, good choice for the summer while the other one is Caramel Corn (burnt caramel + corn cream source with salted citrus cream and corn crunch) its creamy and flavorful."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-12-26,4.0,I got this one at World Trade Center food fest. The shaved ice reminds me of one from Hawaii. I ordered matcha flavor and it is so good. Definitely will go back again.

There will definitely be a big line for that, so I went yesterday to try a good sampling of their new sweet and savory offerings that they didn't previously offer at their Canal Street Market location.

The best new flavor is probably the addictive Banana Miso Maple ($11 for a really large Large). The Black Cherry & Cocoa Nib is close behind, followed by the LES Black & White Cookie, which are both great too.

As for savory, definitely try the Chicken Katsu Sandwich. I also loved the Japanese Avocado Toast which is an excellent take on a staple with a slight spin on it, as well as the Mango Crunch Toast, which is very unique and unlike anything you can find at most cafes.

This will be my new go-to dessert spot in this neighborhood for sure."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-05-24,4.0,"Cute little place!

Was on our way home from Koneko Cat Cafe and saw this along the way. 

My friends and I decided to try this place out.

We shared a Key Lime Pie and Banana Miso.

Key Lime Pie is no joke! Packed with flavor,  sour, tarty,  taste like Key Lime Pie alright.

Banana Miso is always delicious! It was an unique flavor combination. 

Can't wait to come back again to try the other flavors out."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-11-15,4.0,This small Japanese shop has an ever changing menu. I've been here three separate times in a six month span and each time I went they've changed the flavors or their Kakigōri. Some of their flavors are classic like matcha and some of them are more original like grape with yogurt. Whichever flavors you decide to try you will not be disappointed. The person sitting next to me was there by himself and he order three Kakigōri for himself. And he ate all of them. They also have drinks and sandwiches. I haven't tried their savory items but they're drinks were also delicious. I've only ever seen one person working there at a time so the tables didn't get wiped down after every customer but that's my only negative feedback.
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-05-02,5.0,"The new Bonsai Kakigori at Stanton Street is fantastic. The team over there is really about top notch hospitality. You really need to run over and experience it. They began at a booth at the Canal Street Market but this shop makes their first brick & mortar location.

The large is very large, I recommend sharing it with a friend. The small and medium come in to-go cups. At this location, the kakigori is created with an electric Swan shaver vs. the Hand Crank Hatsuyuki.

They serve small bites like Avocado Toast which is Japanifyed with Togarashi, Pickled Daikon, and Miso Butter, it tastes great, seriously! Or more filling sandwiches like the Chicken Katsu Sandwich.

This location seats about 12, and whats so cool, during nice weather the windows open up to the street.

The Japanese Style Pour Over Coffee is yummy!  Its from Joe's Coffee, and as a tea fan....the teas are amazing.  Its all single origin tea which comes from ""In Pursuit of Tea"" I have had both the super earthy Hojicha, and the wonderfully floral Chrysanthemum.

So far, I've enjoyed two of the Kakigori new flavors.  I've had the Banana Miso which I really enjoyed, and the incredibly thoughtful LES Black and White Cookie (which pays tribute to the area that they're in, the Lower East Side.)

Speaking of thoughtfulness, an amazing thing about Bonsai Kakigori is their mindful business practices. They have a rewards card which, after enough hole punches they will donate money to an environmental charity! I also found out, in the upcoming weekend they are practicing a community day which will donate their proceeds to the Lower East Side Girls Club. I would give them 6 stars if I could. I appreciate this business model.

And they still have some of their classic favorite flavors on the menu, like Matcha Mountain or Strawberries & Cream. I'm going to definitely visit this place regularly."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-06-19,4.0,"Found this cute spot while walking about on Saturday so I decided to come back Sunday to check it out. I ordered the small espresso peanut kakigori and it was HUGE! 

ESPRESSO PEANUT:
Never thought coffee and peanut would be a combination but it was so so good. The espresso mousse on top was TO DIE FOR! They also used peanut milk (I'm not entirely sure what it was used in - either the syrup on top or the ice that was shaved down) which I didn't know existed but now I'm wondering why it does exist because it was delicious. 

Only downside was that it was super messy and a bit hard to eat. Also remember to eat it fast because it melts in a second."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-09-29,5.0,"My friend and I came here after dinner for a refreshing dessert and needless to say we were not left disappointed. Bonsai Kakigori has a simple menu, with $5 for the small, $7 for the medium, and $11 for the large. We shared the large and it was more than enough for the two of us (though I think the medium would've been too small). As for the flavor, we got the seasonal key lime pie which was really, really good on a hot summer day. The only ""qualm"" was that it melts VERY quickly but I'm pretty sure that's the vast majority of ice cream let alone an ice. All in all, I would definitely go back again to check out more of their fun seasonal flavors."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-11-23,4.0,Came here after dinner and got a matcha tiramisu and a hot hojicha tea. I loved both. The matcha tiramisu wasn't too sweet. The inside of Bonsai Kakigōri is simple--- scandi vibes. Would love to be back in the summer to try their Matcha Mountain kakigōri.
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-06-18,3.0,"You know what they say, size doesn't mean everything. 

And these mountains here are a prime example of that. Three of my friends and I stumbled upon this place for dessert, and to be honest it was kind of a let down. I know it's shaved ice but when you taste the ice and water more than anything, the flavors seem irrelevant and pointless at that point. Flavorless and bland. They were pretty pricey for what they were too (well..ice), the bigger one being double digit dollars. I've had way better shaved ice before."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-01-15,5.0,"The sky blue sign first caught my attention. Then, the warm, cozy atmosphere when I walked in. There are benches and chairs and it feels so communal where you can talk to anyone or just find solidarity in solitude. Loved the openness.

Spenser is 1 of the 2 egoless chefs I've ever met- there's no ""we can't do that."" I can never decide what to order because I want to make sure it's the perfect dish for my tastebuds. I get so overwhelmed at the sight of a menu I internally over-stress. It's expressed as annoyingly indecisive. Spenser happily made me half of 2 separate dishes so I can try it all. They were both fucking delicious!

""Matcha Milk Jam"" (try this first- it's not as strong/citrusy a taste and is such a good prequal to:)
""Ricotta and Jam""

They were so so good. I went back the next day for Taco Tuesday and the owner, Gaston added to the energy of the place. He has a lightness to his presence and it was so nice to feel like we all knew each other, super relaxed place. Gaston btw gives awesome high fives and took a pic of the group next to me and it was just so lax (relaxed, not laxative :P).

Oh, also please don't judge my taco picture. I devoured it before its aesthetic stood a chance to be captured."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-10-12,5.0,"There's no shortage of ice desserts in New York, from patbingsoo to halohalo to falooda to Italian ice. Kakigori, like other East Asian iterations, has a soft, powdery texture that makes it an amazingly light and refreshing choice of dessert. Bonsai Kakigori, in particular, has some fantastic and creative flavors for their ice. They have a solid classics menu (highly recommend the strawberries and cream-- that black sesame brittle is bomb) but their seasonal menu and monthly chef collaboration specials are no joke either. As summer is over, I will mourn their caramel corn and Arnold Palmer kakigoris but remain excited to try out new flavors.  

They've also branched out to other desserts including panna cotta, tiramisu, and toast. I also heard they offer tasting experiences at this location as well."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-10-23,5.0,"I can't believe this place has been opened for months and I only recently discovered this little gem. I was lucky enough to try the summer special before they changed the menu... &. I wish I went for the large on the caramel corn. It was perfect, perfectly sweet and salty!

Regardless of what flavor you get, they don't skimp out on how to prepare their kakigori. I've tried other places and it ends up being watered down at the end, but not bonsai kakigori! 

However, I did come here yesterday and tried the fall special - grape yogurt and it didn't meet my expectation. I just don't know if the Concord grape juice + green grapes + the very light yogurt + almonds worked well together. Maybe just a preference. BUT, I have to say I will definitely try more of their plated desserts. Even though I hate black sesame, I highly recommend the lychee panna cotta! I love this place! The staff has always been super friendly as well."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-12-29,5.0,"Bonsai kakigōri,
I've been a bit hesitant to give this place a review because I'm not quite sure what I want to say about it. 
Let's start with what I love about the place 
- Best matcha 
- Matcha Tiramisu 
- Matcha Toast
- Avocado Toast
- Chicken Katsu 
- Piña colada matcha 
- Lavender Matcha latte 

Torn between the Matcha Mountain and Coconut Lime Kakigōri, the puffed rice makes me happy but the coconut like is a refreshing flavor. The toasted coconut can be a bit overpowering though if not used sparingly. 

They have this Hojicha Hot Chocolate now which is INSANE. Taco night they had a mango Kakigōri which I could not get enough of and had to be my all time favorite. The Yakisoba was satisfying (though I opted out of the tofu). It's a good place to pop in and stay awhile, meet a friend, do some work. 

The staff is friendly, though I miss Ceilena. The overall atmosphere is tranquil though. Though it's a little out of my way, I try to make the time to pop in for an oat lavender matcha latte and either the matcha jam toast or the avocado. The matcha Tiramisu here is something I would strongly recommend from the non Kakigōri desserts section of the menu.

My wish for the future is that the business stays consistent in the experience they provide, as no other visit compares to the first time I went."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-02-11,5.0,"Kakigori is one of my favorite types of desserts - and Bonsai Kakigori delivered.  I love the fluffy, delicate shaved iced and their creative flavors/toppings.  We split the coconut lime and the strawberries and cream Kakigoris.  They were little doses of heaven.  The coconut lime had crunchy roasted coconut, coconut cream, and lime zest giving it this sweet, but semi-savory flavor that we loved.  The strawberries and cream not only had strawberry and cream, but also black sesame and black sesame brittle.  The brittle added an incredible crunch and flavor that made the dish for me.  I can't wait to go back and try more flavors!"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-05-17,5.0,"This new kakigori spot is perfect for the summer! I don't always love shaved ice, but Bonsai Kakigōri really just took it to a whole new level. The shaved ice has layers of flavor, and my favorite was definitely the banana miso. It was definitely a very unique flavor, and I was initially hesitant to try it, but I'm so glad I did! They also serve a few small snacks such as avocado toast, which was also very fresh and authentic.

42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-10-12,4.0,Had the vegan key lime coconut crunch and it was so good! I liked that the coconut flavor was subtle and the layer of key lime foam was so good with the crunch. We ordered a large for 2 people but I think it was a little too big for us -- two smalls would have been a good choice. The large is good for 3+ people.
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-08-28,5.0,"What a lovely addition to the neighborhood! They create unique desserts that are fun and fresh.

 I was able to try a strawberry and cream. Layers of freshly shaved ice drenched in flavored syrup and topped with the cream and toppings. So good!

It satisfies a sweet tooth but is still light- it doesn't weigh you down. 

I happened to go on a day that they were supporting a local LES girls group, which really makes me want to return. I love when businesses support the community they are in. Way to go Bonsai Kakigori!

5/5"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-11-05,4.0,"I'm not even sure that I like key lime pie, but their key lime crunch shaved ice is dope. I've also tried their matcha shaved ice (veganized with coconut whip) and a matcha latte. 

I imagined I'd prefer the matcha shaved ice, but I actually found it a bit too sweet. They poured a ton of matcha syrup on which might have been overkill. The key lime on the other hand is really well balanced, with a nice mix of sweet, tangy, crunchy, and sour. Their latte is also great - creamy and not sweet at all. It's honestly pretty standard, but somewhat notable since plenty of spots do a terrible matcha latte.  

Overall I'm definitely a fan, and whenever I'm in the area I find myself wanting to go back."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-10-11,4.0,"I love kakigori so I knew I had to come here. Per staff, their most popular flavor was the bonsai caramel corn - so I gave that a try. It was sweet & salty. I have to agree that it oddly did taste like Milkbar's cereal milk soft serve. 

Will try their other flavors in the future!"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-10-15,3.0,"Came here for dessert after dinner in the neighborhood. This place is cute and pet friendly. It's priced fairly but the shaved ice was just okay. We tried the matcha mountain and lychee cream. Portion is huge, even the small is good to share between 2-3 people."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-08-06,5.0,"Bonsai Kakigori is amazing, from experience, to taste, selection, and worthiness at it's price point.

The experience at the new location on 100 Stanton is wonderful. A very light and airy feel, with very welcoming and caring staff. Co owners Theo and Gaston are so friendly and very in touch with their customer base. At this point, it's a family environment LOL. 

The taste of the Kakigori is complex and refreshing, there are multiple layers which allows for so much flavor leveling and it honestly makes the experience that much better. 

The selection is just enough and with constant introductions of new flavors on a monthly and seasonal basis, it keeps the experience fresh and exciting every time.

Each Kakigori is actually filling to me, you would think ""Oh, it's ice, it's a cute snack"" but a whole kakigori for me is holding me for at least 2 hours until I eat again lol. So I would definitely say it is worth it at it's price point. They also have other selections that are aesthetically pleasing. I'm thankful they introduced me to Kakigori because sometimes you don't want dairy (or all the time) and they have options for you. 

Plus watching them make it is almost as good as tasting it!"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-12-26,5.0,"Bonsai Kakigori is one of the only places along the east coast that serves traditional Japanese shaved ice.

This location is their own storefront; they also have a kiosk at Canal Street Market. It's small inside, but there are a few tables, bar seats, and a bathroom.

I've had Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese shaved ice desserts, which are all 100 (double underscore), so I was excited to try the Japanese take.

The ice used is some kind of pure, extra clear water. The machine, specially made for Kakigori, shaves the ice to be extra fluffy, so it melts on your tongue pleasantly. Bonsai Kakigori has a few classic flavors, including a vegan coconut flavor, and ~3 seasonal flavors. You can get the classic flavors in small (for 1-2 people) or large (for sharing), but the seasonal flavors only come in large. I wish they had more vegan flavors besides coconut, which is kind of the boring old go-to vegan option at any dessert spot, but I still really liked it. The ice is lightly flavored with coconut and it's topped with a delicious blob of coconut cream.

Because of the fluffy texture and light taste, it's probably the most refreshing of any Asian ice dessert. It's perfect for a hot day when you want something slightly sweet and relatively guilt-free. But if you're craving for something very sweet and loaded with red bean, mochi, jellies, and all the goodies, walk 10 min west to Chinatown or north to East Village. :)"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2020-01-15,5.0,"The only place in New York City to get authentic Japanese Kakigori (Japanese Shaved Ice).  As a person of Taiwanese descent I am quite the Shaved Ice connoisseur and Bonsai is on top for options in New York.  Creative flavor combinations and creations that are beautifully crafted with detail and preciseness.  Their service for a small cafe space was friendly, welcoming and truly a unique experience.  We had the seasonal flavor of Caramel Apple and it was such a delight.  They make the shaved ice right on the counter for all to see. It seems to defy gravity as one giant snowball the size of your head and they kindly bring it to where you are seated.  Digging in there are layers of discovery with tasty bits even on the inside.  What is this ??? a Scotch egg snow ball dessert?  We sad by the window and passerbys were so intrigued.  
The kakigori is also ultra instagrammable, important things who those who blog their food.  We were a bit hungry and they also have coffee/tea and regular savory items.  I absolutely love egg salad sandwiches (especially Japanese style) and we ordered it.  They thoughtfully crafted the sandwich as it required some time as they advised, but the results were well worth it.  It was light yet rich.  Perfect to have right before the delicious sweet dessert."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-06-21,5.0,"I first had kakigori at Tonchin after ramen, and it was amazing. My friend who was with me, however, said that Bonsai Kakigori was cheaper, bigger, and better. How could I not check it out? Since my first Bonsai kakigori at Canal Street Market, I've been a huge fan. 

When this location opened, I was really excited to see that they also had savory bites; I ordered a katsu sandwich and a mango ginger kakigori. After having just come back from a month trip in Japan, I was pretty disappointed by the katsu sandwich; the meat was lukewarm, almost cold. It tasted like it had come out of a fridge and it was not crispy at all. The accompanying sauces and bread were good, however, and I think there's a lot of potential. I've had cold katsu sandwiches from the 7/11s in Japan so I know it's a thing, but I'm just not really into it. 

The mango ginger kakigori, on the other hand, was phenomenal - the reason for 5 stars because this is a kakigori place, after all. The mango flavor permeated the ice and the candied ginger throughout was absolutely amazing. I love that they layer the whipped cream throughout the kakigori so that there's always a balanced bite. I was also a huge fan of the ginger cream.

I've also had a coffee special kakigori (don't remember what it is at the moment but it's no longer on the menu), the strawberry kakigori, and a cold lavender matcha latte. I remember liking the coffee kakigori but I do generally prefer fruit-based ones. I had just had a strawberry kakigori the previous day at Tonchin, but this one was equally amazing in a totally different way; Tonchin's features fresh fruit, whereas this one had an unbelievably tasty black sesame brittle generously scattered throughout. Digging through for it felt like a fun (albeit super easy) treasure hunt. The lavender matcha latte was perfection - not too sweet and very well balanced between the lavender and matcha. I can't express how hard it is to do that, and they're two of my favorite flavors.

Bonsai, I'm so thrilled you're in New York. Can't wait to try your new flavors :)"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-06-20,4.0,"Pretty good shaved ice and inventive flavors (I got the mango and ginger) but it's a little overpriced for ice. The small is $5, medium $7, and large $11. There is some seating, but it's limited."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-06-21,5.0,"Bonsai Kakigori has turned me into a shaved ice convert. As an ice cream guy, a year ago you would never spot me eating shaved ice. Sure, most suck, but Bonsai Kakigori is on a completely different level. First of all, their ice has a fluffy texture to it, so it doesn't taste like crushed ice. They saturate it fully with the flavored syrups so nothing tastes watered down as you might expect. They also assemble the kakigori mountains with mutliple layers of whipped cream and mix-ins. This is key, and the make or break factor of good kakigori. You need crunch and cream in every bite. I want as much whipped cream as I can get, so I would ask for extra :). 

My favorite flavor here is by far the Banana Miso Maple. It basically tastes like banana walnut bread in kakigori form. The banana milk flavor is really strong (but not artificial tasting). 

They also offer coffee and tea options like matcha lattes and your usual espresso based beverages. I will be back to try their savory offerings like the Katsu sandwich."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-06-02,5.0,"Amazing, Amazing and Amazing. Light and airy, well distributed flavor and just a delightful treat. 3 sizes, we each got a small for 5 bucks and it was more than enough. Coconut lime vegan and strawberry today, but next time the mango ginger is on my radar. Love how there are 2 layers so that you have a hidden treat inside the already marvelous creation. My new favorite, can't wait to return"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-06-27,5.0,"All i can say is WOW! Bonsai Kakigōri is honestly one of my favorite places to be for shaved ice now! I even got a punch card for the next time the summer heat gets me craving something light and flavorful! 

The service was great and the workers were very nice. They also have free wifi but when i tried to log in, it wouldn't work so y'all have to check up on that. 

My friend and I ordered a medium Matcha Mountain and the Iced Pina Colada Matcha. The Matcha Mountain ($7) had a strong taste of matcha and was not drowned in sweetness. The cream helped balance the bitterness of the matcha and was a match(a) made in heaven- well at Bonsai Kakigōri! 

The Iced Pina Colada Matcha ($5.50) was alright, my friend and I did not care for it too much since the shaved ice took the spotlight for being super delicious. 

After, we decided that we were still craving something else sweet and decided to order the medium Strawberries & Cream ($7) and boy did it satisfy our cravings! The strawberry flavor mixed with the black sesame brittle and whipped cream was simply delicious!"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-06-02,5.0,"This is my first experience at the new location in Manhattan. Easy to find and the store overall gives good chill vibes. The workers there were super friendly which is a plus plus!! 

Me and my friend ordered a medium strawberries and cream Kakigōri to share (I'm curious how big a large would be cause the medium was good enough between us two for an after meal dessert). 

I didn't have much high hopes with this one because of the name, though I've had a decently good experience with trying out the matcha one from the other store; which is why I was pretty impressed after the first bite. The strawberry syrup has a strong impression in each bite of the ice but it's deliciously overpowering. Mixing the strawberry ice with the light cream and bits of sesame brittle that is hidden underneath the cream for texture creates a lovely refreshing taste.

We both enjoyed the sweet treat in the very warm weather on that day. I definitely look forward to going again for a Kakigōri or if not, some other thing on the menu. I would love to try out the monthly specials they have which I think is a cool concept (A shame I noticed the May one too late and they didn't have an essential topping for the Kakigōri on that day too)."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-05-25,5.0,"Food: Unreal, everything on the menu is good and unique as it gets. Try it all. All the kakigoris, the sandwiches, especially the fried chicken, the mango toast, and get the sourdough avo toast. Come back for more.

Service: the nicest staff in LES and most down to earth. WiFi is 100+ mpbs, blazing fast for a cafe.

Drinks: Haven't tried the drinks tbh

Location: perfect window seating for the summer to get a tan and work, kick back

Atmosphere: nice natural lighting inside, outlets, small space but about 3 tables and a window bar 

Prices: amazing prices, cheaper than anything in LES for the quality. 

Recommended? Yeah go here pronto"
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-06-08,5.0,"I first fell in love with Bonsai Kakigōri at Canal Street Market. I was so excited when I saw that they finally opened up their own store. In this new location, they serve savory items, drinks, as well as their iconic shaved ices. I opted for a large Matcha Mountain today for $11. It comes in a cute tray with a wooden spoon rested on a rock and a cup of tea. I was stupid enough to try to even attempt to eat this by myself, and the shaved ice melted quicker than I could eat. Unfortunately, that means it slowly overflowed the bowl as it melted. On the plus side for dog owners, this place is dog friendly. Enjoy this snack while spending time with your pups."

There are a few small tables and barstool seats by the window. We came at around 2PM on a saturday and it was pretty packed but we were still able to get a table for 6 people. 

Can't wait to come back and try their lattes! This place is the perfect stop for refreshing dessert and drinks."

42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-06-11,4.0,"Came here on a weeknight around 7ish. The place is small, with bar seating at the window and only a few tables. My friend and I ordered a small banana miso to share ($5). 
The manager talked to us as we were there. The servings are large, and two people can easily share one small. It was my first time having a shaved ice, and the banana miso did not disappoint. It was topped with a delicious and flavorsome banana cream, and flavored with banana miso syrup. It was a unique flavor combination, and felt light and refreshing. There was also sprinklings of nuts throughout. Unfortunately the mountain of ice did not hold up, as my friend and I were eating, and fell on to the table. There was another layer of cream inside, but not enough to go with the masses of ice, and we had to ask for additional syrup. 
This however, was still not enough, and I found that I was eating unflavored ice most of the time. 
I would recommend this place as service was exceptional, but think they need to work on distributing the syrup more evenly throughout the layers of ice."
42,bonsai-kakigōri-new-york-3,2019-07-02,5.0,"I don't even no where to start! This has to be one of the best desserts I have ever tasted. We had the strawberry and cream shaved ice, banana walnut and my favorite the key lime pie. This isn't your ordinary shaved ice. They don't use syrup, it some type of homemade juice that brings out the true flavor. It is seriously to die for. And the customer service was on point."

I got here at 8:30am to grab breakfast before class. There weren't too crowded. But just 30 minutes later, I looked up and there were so many people waiting in line to order already. This is usually the situation at La Lacombe whenever I walk past it - it's a busy coffee shop!!
 I had the raisin cinnamon roll and hot almond latte for a decent price, $9.25! The pastry was delicious and huge! It kept me full for hours. It was buttery, flaky, the creme filing was not too sweet and I loved the green raisins inside. The latte was weirdly sweet. It was one of the sweetest unsweetened coffee I've ever had but actually I enjoyed it. Perhaps it was due to the coffee bean they used? Idk! Next time I'll be back this early to try their draft iced latte - i didn't know that was their signature drink before I came!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-07-14,3.0,"It's almost impossible to get seats here because of those damn NYU students (just kidding, I'm one of them). But seriously, this location is always filled to the brim and you may have to wait around for a while if you're grabbing a table. What bugged me is that absolutely everyone here grabs a two-person table for just one, which wastes a lot of space and efficiency. The MBA in me was screaming on the inside.

This small-scale roaster has two types of coffee: cornerstone, which is the darker one, and workshop, which is the lighter one. I got the cornerstone because it was late in the afternoon, it has a chocolate feel, and I wanted less caffeine. They have almond and oat milk for those who want it. It's your standard coffee, I believe a level above Starbucks. 

I also tried the peppermint tea and the honeysuckle tea. The first is super strong in taste and smell. The second is on the polar opposite: very subtle. Neither was mind-blowing, two very standard teas. 

La Colombe is above average price for both coffee and tea, as in $3.50 for a tea satchel, $4.50 for loose leaf tea, $2.50 for cornerstone drip coffee, and $3 for for workshop drip coffee. 

Also, there's one bathroom and I didn't see any outlets. Last, the baristas have unnecessary attitude. Wouldn't hurt to not look down your nose at all your customers, y'all!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-21,4.0,"Depending on your preference of coffee beans, you could give this place a 4 or 5 star rating. I come here often as they are very quick and near my work. Their iced soy latte  is great and I CHALLENGE you to try to not drink it under 10 seconds! 

I have had the following: 
Drip coffee 3/5 stars 
Iced soy latte 5/5 stars
Hot latte 5/5 stars 
Cold brew 3/5 stars (I personally don't like cold brew so this is VERY bias) 


I would highly recommend if you are in the area!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-11-10,5.0,"La Colombe hands down has the best iced coffee. No need to add milk since it taste that great on its own, but if you want to add it definitely go for the oat milk. The employees at la Colombe are always so welcoming and friendly. This is one of the larger La Colombe's in NYC. There is usually a bit of a long line but it does go very quick so don't let that scare you away. It has a great ambiance and it's in a prefect location to grab a cup of coffee and head outside to stroll through the Noho neighborhood and shop."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-21,1.0,"There is a gaping void of professionalism and courtesy from staff members in this location.  I am baffled management has failed to address and mitigate the ongoing issue of appaling customer service reviews.  Other commenters have said they too were not acknowledged, spoken with, or even looked at.  When I smiled today and said thank you to the barista at the register following my purchase, I might as well have had a conversation with a brick wall.   Is this the new normal for coffee house culture?  

Here's a thought.  If someone resents their position or lot in life that much, especially when you're working directly with the public, why not locate an opportunity where little to no communication is required?  Why not work in the morgue, the back of an office or freelance from home?  

Perhaps it is just Manhattan where some feel they have license to be innately rude to others.  Perhaps getting up early isn't for everyone.  Overall, the climate at La Colombe is especially cold, which I find off-putting given how beautiful, warm and open the space is.  Such a shame.  
 
Sadly, I won't be returning here as a patron."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-05-03,5.0,"The coffee heres delicious, and they have this. Drunks that is so creamy it's called ""oat milk draft latte"" soooooo good!! Must try!!!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-03,5.0,"Delicious coffee spot right across from my favorite soulcycle location! My brother and I got to soul way earlier than expected and decided to grab a coffee beforehand. I always see this place but have never actually gotten coffee here. 

We both got cappuccinos and they came out at the perfect temperature for us both. It was SO delicious and the coffee cups are super cute!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-01-18,2.0,"One of two La Colombe locations I've been to regularly (the other is 270 Lafayette St). This location is much busier, so I prefer to go to the other one.

My problem with both of them is that they don't seem to know how to pour a draft latte?? Lately they keep giving me all-foam pours, which, when settled, comes out to half of the cup. Not worth $4.25. When I asked for less foam, they said it's just how it comes out of the tap. If it works like draft beer, just hold the cup at an angle??? What is being done differently with the tap or by the barista when they give a good pour? Surely it's not random? If you look at pics on the company website, a draft latte is supposed to be at most half foam and half liquid. No one would accept an all-foam beer, would they? It's sad because I really love their draft lattes (even the unsweetened canned ones taste too sweet), which no one else has, but I can't really justify $4.25 for half a cup."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-06-05,5.0,"I truly don't know where to begin. Let me start by telling you this is the best tasting coffee/espresso ever.  Like EVER!  

I pride myself in being a coffee snob.  With that, I try coffee/espresso type drinks everywhere I go. In my opinion, La Colombe has the best, non bitter tasting drinks.  

My go to drink is almost always an iced latte.  La Colombe offers multiple alternative milk options so I always order half reg milk and half oat milk.  Try it, I promise you, you will love it! They have awesome tasting simple syrup too.  I think it's made from raw sugar??? Whatever it's made with, it is SO good!

They have great pastry options as well as some Chobani yogurt (one of the owners happens to be an owner of Chobani). All the baked goods are the same at each location.  How cool is that?  Consistency is key!!  Each La Colombe we visit tastes the same!!  Like the drinks always taste the same! Novel idea, I know! 

This location pumps the drinks out.  Don't let the daunting line scare you. Even if it wraps around the bar, they clear it fast.  They have an amazing team working there. Always friendly.

They have a pretty cool seating area too!

My only complaint would be the fact that they have no WiFi.  

Oh my! I almost forgot!!!  They have fresh flowers on the counter everyday!!!!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-24,5.0,"I live for oat milk lattes therefore La Colombe gives me life!!!

Was running out of natural energy so needed an afternoon pick me up. La Colombe was across the street so we walked in and were pleasantly surprised by the high quality espresso + OATLY!! This place is HUGE, there's so much space especially for being in Manhattan. If I were a local, I would definitely get some work done here."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-26,5.0,"A great coffee experience. 

While walking around New York City, and in a search for a coffee stop, we visited La Colombe.  It is a great experience since the moment you walk in.  At first you will experience an atmosphere that makes you feel comfortable, good enough for a coffee chat, or to get some work done.  

But the hero of the experience is the coffee; great flavor at a price similar to those of other ""premium"" coffee shops.  Additionally, the baristas know their stuff, are friendly making each visit perfect.

Overall, if you are looking to change your coffee game, La Colombe is a great option. 


My Criteria
5 stars: The best food I have ever had, or an excellent option given the price.
4 stars: Good food, a restaurant I look forward to trying again. 
3 stars: Good food, a restaurant that I am indifferent to. 
2 stars: Below average experience, will not go again.
1 stars: This restaurant should be closed."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-04-24,3.0,"This cafe has a modern ambiance with good coffee. I was here a couple of weeks ago as I was on my way to the cutting room studio around the corner. Because I smelled the coffee from outside, I decided to walk in! Customer service was okay because staff did not acknowledged me even when I was ordering. Communication was short and felt like I was not welcomed. 

I ordered a medium roast coffee and a berry sweet bread which were incredible. The coffee was hot and very good. As for the berry bread; Heavenly! It was very well baked (not chewy)and had the right amount of sweetness to it."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2020-01-19,1.0,"I love La Colombe but this location is always bad. Coffee tastes stale, never fresh, and espresso comes out cold.   Quality suffers quite profoundly because of volume."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-10-11,5.0,"I like La Colombe a lot better since they renovated the inside. Its prime location in the heart of NYU means it can get suuuper busy, but the new layout makes the store better equipped to handle the crowd. 

La Colombe is definitely on the pricy side for coffee, but I think you get what you pay for in this case. The coffee tastes fresh and high-quality--my iced coffee was a nice medium roast and not too acidic. They also give you your coffee on a cute little saucer with a fancy spoon. Bonus points for the details! 

Even though it was busy when I went in, I got my coffee pretty much instantly. If you're looking for a solid cup of coffee in the NYU area, skip that Starbucks nonsense and head over to La Colombe instead."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-08-21,4.0,"Chill place with some quality coffee. Their draft latte is a must have. Loved it! Really smooth and came with a strong coffee taste which is exactly what I love.

Their dripping coffee is mediocre. Would not recommend though. 

Overall a great visit and would sure to come back."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-22,5.0,Crowded but it's a big enough place and busy enough that people are constantly coming and going so I don't see an issue with finding a seat. With the amount of customers that go through there I'm very impressed with the quality of drinks and the chillness of service. Lovely experience
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-05-19,5.0,Stopped by to grab a cup of iced green tea and it was pretty amazing. I'll come back and try their coffee next time!
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-02-21,5.0,"Walked into the store for a nice cup of iced coffee. 
Out of all the la colombe coffee shops, this has to be one of the biggest location. It's spacious, there is seating, but it was always full with people. The inside is very modern and seems very hip/trendy. Very cool ambience. 

In terms of the coffee itself, la columbe is popular for a reason. I personally got to try the black & tan. Very smooth and you honestly don't need too much sugar added. It taste good on it's own. I really enjoyed it."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-14,5.0,"Friday at 9AM and the line was wrapped outside- not sure why I was shocked considering it's NYC. I went in anyways....because just like the 15 people before me, I too, need caffeine to function. The line went surprisingly quick, I only waited a total of 8 minutes (Yes I timed it). I ordered an Oat Milk draft latte on tap and bought a vanilla draft latte in a can for later. The latte was so frothy and delicious. Didn't need any other sweeter added, and did the job of waking me up. Super cool to see you can get cold brews, lattes, Black and Tans all on tap here. Def a new way to enjoy coffee, will be returning!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-25,5.0,"A single shot of espresso made me a convert to La Colombe.

Their Cornerstone Nizza blend is truly, as described, nutty, caramel, and renowned. It was incredibly smooth and had only a trace of bitterness. I could have drank this straight, but instead I used a touch of the syrup on the counter and a healthy dash of oat milk (first time having it but love it!).

My boyfriend also had a black and tan, which I thought was pretty good. I'm interested in trying the draft latte.

This location is on a dramatic corner in Noho, and is bustling with pre-SoulCyclers (or maybe post?) and well-dressed New Yorkers. Service was masterfully handling the rush, though my espresso was forgotten about for a couple minutes. After a reminder, it came swiftly.

At $3, I thought my espresso was fairly priced for the area. It is pricy, but their quality lives up to it. Also nice that they have a fair trade / earth conscious business without beating you over the head with it. Recommended!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-07-23,5.0,"The oat milk draft latte is amazing here. 10/10 would recommend. 

This coffee is also well known for being sold to-go. You can get it at Trader Joe's or at various bagel places or order online!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-10,4.0,"La Colombe's coffee is one of my favorites! Strong, bold, and non-acidic. 

This location was very packed and dirty on the inside. The line wrapped all the way around the counter, and the staff weren't very good at cleaning leftovers on tables."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-06-28,4.0,"I had the opportunity to visit this La Colombe location while grabbing coffee with a friend on a Tuesday afternoon. Although this isn't the first time I've been to this location it's definitely good enough to warrant a few kind words about my experiences all together. 

On this particular occasion, we arrived around 5:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. The spot itself is located conveniently near the 6 train subway stop at Astor Place. Its a great corner cafe that boasts a lot of table seating (if you're able to snag one) and large open windows letting in a lot of natural light. 

The staff is knowledgeable and efficient. Knowing how busy it can get during the rush hour, they made sure to have a barista taking orders, ringing up customers, and making beverages all at the same time. I didn't wait more then a few minutes after walking in and getting in line behind about 8 people. Definitely appreciated!

Overall this spot is great to grab coffee and catch up with a friend or to even get some work done on your computer. The only thing I wish they'd do is stay open later than 6:30! But until then this is definitely as close to perfect as a cafe can get in the city."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-18,5.0,"The best chocolate chip cookies in the world and even better coffee. I've frequented this place weekly since my freshman year at NYU and the quality / service is always outstanding.

Standouts include the draft latte (light and frothy), the regular iced coffee, and the chocolate chip cookies and almond croissants! There's no real menu so you have to know what you want beforehand; baristas will ask you what you want well before you get to the front of the line so your order will be ready almost immediately. 

It can be hard to grab a seat since there are always people lingering, but if you're able to it's a wonderful place for some people watching / catching up on work."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-08-02,5.0,"I had a very pleasant experience here! I came in wanting to get the oat milk latte on draft because I'd heard about it. I went toward the end of the day, so they were almost out of it. The barista filled it up as much as she could but I said she could just fill the little rest with the regular draft latte. She only charged me for the regular latte which was so kind. The coffee itself was amazing as well. I had a great experience and suggest the latte!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-10-09,5.0,"All time favorite coffee shop, any city. The cold brew is unmatched. The draft latte and draft oat milk latte are also like drinking a cloud. My favorite is a Black and Tan, the best of both -- half draft latte, half cold brew. Sometimes I'll go for ""more black than tan"" or ""just a tanline"". The flavor and consistency are amazing no matter how you splice it. Also love their classic hot Corsica brew. Excellent product and thrilled to see them cropping up all over. I started out at the original single shop in Philly!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-09-15,4.0,"Alright, so...the ambiance was great but the coffee was not the best I've had. We ordered an iced and hot mocha, an americano, cappuccino and latte. The mochas were made with dark chocolate and no sweetness whatsoever. I love dark chocolate but then we had to add our own sugar or simple sugar syrup and it took away from what most mochas taste like. The other drinks were good but not hot enough. Overall it was okay, but it depends on how you like your coffee and mochas."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-10-29,4.0,"Love love love La Colombe Coffee. It's high quality and less acidic than other coffees. They're a great franchise because they have convenient locations all over NYC. 

Even though they usually have long lines their system moves very quickly. 

You just can't go wrong with their lattes!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-03,5.0,"Long line, but moved very quickly. Latte and sesame croissant were soooo good. 

Nitpicky thing: They defaulted me as a ""to-go"" order giving me my food in a bag and latte in a disposable cup. There were many others in the store eating and drinking with real dishes, I wanted the same, but was not given that choice (also, less waste)."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2017-03-20,4.0,"Love the vibe, interior, and friendly baristas here. Always crowded but the service is swift. 
Their coffee is definitely one of the best but not their hot chocolate/mochaccino."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2016-10-16,4.0,"Don't let the long lines on weekends fool you, it moves pretty fast! I brought my mom by for a latte and decided to stay for a while since there were (surprisingly) plenty of seats that opened up as I was waiting in line. Lattes are poured beautifully, and it doesn't hurt that the drinks to stay are served in equally exquisite cup and saucer sets!

We stayed for a while, but eventually left because the clamor in the cafe was quite distracting. That being said, while this could be a great place to get lost in conversation, it is probably not the best place to study. However, for those who go to NYU stern, the stern wifi does (somehow) connect as far as this cafe, which I guess is pretty cool!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-13,4.0,"Beautiful interior, and they are very efficient! La Colombe takes your order, and has your drink ready for you at the back of the bar. My drink was ready before I paid, and there was a pretty long line! I had the Oat Black and Tan, and it was really tasty"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2017-12-16,4.0,"This. place has an amazing cold coffee ""on draft"" in two different varieties: black, or latte. You can order it as a ""black and tan"" which is half and half. It is smooth, milky, and delicious. 

They pour the coffee from a tap just like a draft beer. You can't really get a cold/iced coffee like this anywhere else. They also sell their coffee lattes in cans which are also great. 

This particular location is crowded and the staff is not super nice. Still, if you are in the mood for a cold cup of coffee, it is the best place to get one."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-02-12,4.0,Great espresso. Not my favorite in NYC as I like my espresso a bit more complex but certainly consistent and great. The place itself is always busy and hectic but it's worth the quality of caffeine fix. Averagely priced compared to the other cafes nearby.
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-03-14,1.0,"Service is terrible right now.
Young man looked at me like he hated me and no smile when I smiled about pulling the ""push door""
And he tried to charge me more than I've ever paid for a hot chocolate (which I get every time I work for $3.75)
Hmmm...  does he hate his job? Won't be going back cause he made me feel embarrassed and seemed annoyed w me.
That is all."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-03,5.0,"Always a choice for my morning fix before I begin my day. My favorite drinks are the iced cascara tea, oat milk draft latte, and iced oat cortado. Can't go wrong with those three."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-06-02,5.0,Best coffee I've had in the neighborhood and maybe I've just been living in New York too long but I was pleasantly surprised by the price of my iced coffee. Storefront has a nice energy too
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2016-08-14,5.0,"I can finally see what the hype is about! Agh. 

Draft lattes are my new favorite thing. Chilled, creamy, frothy, textured latte goodness. The almond croissants here are near perfect. Not too sweet or overly sugar-crusted like other coffee shops or bakeries I've been. 

The staff are also really friendly. 

The vibe in here is super relaxing. Bright, open, clean design. Bring a book, grab a cup and a pastry and unwind. (But only if you can find a seat and the lady across from you hasn't setup camp and turned the bench into her couch.)"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-07-20,1.0,"This place is not that great, also for what they offer it's just ridiculously overpriced. Based on these reviews and what I had heard from other people, I was excited to check it out, but I was extremely disappointed.

The service is just okay, but even if the service sucked I would still go if the coffee was worth it, but it's not! First, I will start by saying that I was SHOCKED when I asked for a chai latte, and they told me that they didn't have chai. What?!? That just can't be true. So I asked one more time to make sure I had heard correctly, and unfortunately I had. This place DOES NOT have chai, folks. So is that what earned this place a one star review? No, it isn't. I'm not that mean.

So I think what the heck, I'm here now, so I'm gonna get something, right? Well I decided on a latte and not only was it the worst latte that I have had the misfortune of trying, but it also made me sick to my stomach!! I am not lactose intolerant, in fact, I love all milk (skim, whole, soy, etc.) but all I could think was that one of the ingredients was bad or something.

Anyway, skip two weeks into the future and I really wanted to give this place one more shot. Well I went back, this time for an iced latte and I'm sitting here, writing this review, feeling sick to my stomach! Also, for the record, this is the only latte that I have EVER drank that has made me sick (twice).

TL;DR I won't be back here, and I suggest you go elsewhere as well. Fool me once, shame on you, La Colombe. Fool me twice, shame on everyone...involved."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-04-25,3.0,"La Colombe has the best cold brew in my opinion but this location can't seem to keep it in stock.  It is very frustrating to wait 10 minutes in line to find out they are once again out of their cold brew, and it's not even summer yet.  Sadly I will have to change my rout to work and settle for a competitors cold brew since I need coffee in the morning and I'm tired of rewarding this place with my business when they obviously have little clue on how to properly order."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-11-21,4.0,"Consistently good coffee. Usually a long line, but it moves pretty quickly. I don't love that I have to give my order twice-once to a barista and once to pay- and then have to keep an eye out for my drink also. But worth it!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-05-20,5.0,"Just walking into the place would be enough to give you your caffeine fix for the day (how the staff isn't bouncing off the walls is a complete mystery to me), but if that was all you did, you would be missing out on the magnificent coffee and tasty pastries (sorry about the poetry, it was inadvertent).  Only drawback is that they close by 7 most days."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2016-06-22,5.0,"This is probably what I picture the perfect coffee shop in New York to be - La Colombe.

There was quite a line in the late afternoon for coffee, which I didn't mind since I was mesmerized by the moving parts around me. It was the epitome of the New York coffee scene, surrounded by tourists and locals alike. The shop was bustling with people drinking coffee alone while reading the Times, or in groups having heated discussions. 

Once I got to the front of the line, I ordered a latte, just to keep things simple. The latte art was simple but elegant - or maybe it took no effort at all, but by pure luck it turned out to be a beautiful pattern of steamed milk amid the strains of espresso. 

Closes unfortunately at 6:30pm, but I shouldn't be drinking coffee that late at night anyway. 

This was one of my favorite lattes in New York, by far. It was strong and smooth, just the way I like it."

43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-06-27,3.0,"I enjoyed my iced latte, but my boyfriend's hot latte was uniquely terrible. It tasted like oysters. Yes. You read that correctly. He tried to enjoy it but ultimately threw it away after five or so sips. 

I'm not sure if it was the roast, the particular bean, rancid dairy, or something else altogether. What I am certain of is I'm unlikely to go back, despite enjoying my own drink."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2016-02-29,5.0,"La Colombe inhabits an excellent corner space off Lafayette with an abundance of windows, natural lighting, and sky-high ceilings.  The shop is laid out with the main barista counter in the middle and seating all around.  The line regularly wraps around the center counter, but isn't more than a 10 minute wait (starting from halfway).

La Colombe is their own coffee roaster and offers both regular brews (house) and ""workshop"" brews, which feature coffees with special notes - in my case, I got the workshop drip coffee with notes of honeysuckle and rose.  I love my coffee, but I have trouble picking out these notes... either way, La Colombe never fails to please me, even when I have their coffee at shops that feature their beans.

From regular ol' drip coffee to lattes to cappucinos, La Colombe serves up satisfying drinks.  This would be a great place for a coffee date or a catch up with some girl friends, especially on a nice sunny day.  Of course, I highly recommend having them everyday as your daily fix - too bad this location is nowhere near home or work for me."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2016-08-22,5.0,"Like all good coffee, theirs made my day. I had a bad experience with la Colombe coffee at this one restaurant who served it so I was nervous coming here. I got a hot almond milk Cappuccino and loved it! 
The smooth texture and delicate sweetness wow im so happy. Nothing can make one happier than good coffee and nice service!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-07-05,5.0,"Hands down the best coffee in town. That's all I need to say. Oh, maybe also - they charge extra for stuff like almond milk, so an iced latte comes out at around $5.50, but I've gotten used to the fact that coffee is a luxury product in New York. It's usually pretty crowded at this location, which isn't surprising though, it's a really nice spot."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-09-21,5.0,Top top top of the line. Double espresso w Kenyan beans over ice and shot of sparkling water. As good or better than I've had in Europe. Caroline knows her craft. Bravo!
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2017-07-05,3.0,"2 stars for the interior. Love the interior of this place. I was able to grab a table, but it seems it's still not enough for how much traffic this cafe gets. 

1 star for the drink. Got a draft latte and right when I picked it up it just felt...super light. I understand a latte has foam in it. However, this cup was half foam. Look up the definition of a latte. It's espresso, with a bunch of milk, and a LIGHT layer of foam. Will not be ordering the latte again if I decide to come back."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2017-10-18,5.0,"La Colombe is my savior when my morning cold brew wears off and I'm struggling to fight my afternoon caffeine crash. I usually get the black and tan, which is a mix between the draft and a cold brew and is the perfect amount of creaminess.

I don't know why so many people choose to work here -  maybe discomfort fuels productivity? They have a standing desk if you're into that. Otherwise, choose between miniscule tables or sharing your space with someone else. Also, like most other places in the area, no Wi-Fi.

I'll stop complaining because these draft lattes are life and the chocolate chip cookie is incredible. I was seriously debating parting with my $4, but it was well spent, although also spent with a few quick bites."

Five Stars

This mini chain of Coffee Shops are by far my favorite in the city. They do everything well. This shop is slightly less crowded than the original which is just a couple blocks away and always with a line out of the door. This location had a large center island where you could order, wait for, and receive your coffee. There was not much seating but they were a couple places inside and outside. (I saw Malcom Gladwell outside on a bench). I had an ice coffee on this unseasonably warm November day. 

The best part of this location is the self service water station with still and sparkling. 

As always, a great experience."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2017-07-31,5.0,"If I could give this shop ten stars instead of five I would. After my so so experience at Blue Bottle, and okay experience at Brooklyn Coffee Roasters, well, this was beyond my expectations. I own a coffee shop in Hollywood, Florida known for our friendly service and great coffee, but the La Colombe coffee house is Hall of Fame customer friendly, great coffee beyond what I have had so far. All the staff was AMAZINGLY FRIENDLY. Did I say attentive, while providing a great coffee experience to everyone in line? Yes, that too. But my favorite, the star of this show was the draft Latte. OMG! I drank two just to make sure it wasn't my thirst or my mind playing tricks. 
 There is a fine line between greatness and hyperbole. The staff and the product tread this line like tight rope walkers above the highest peaks. How is that for hyperbole?"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2017-02-19,5.0,"I keep it real!! This place is legit. I came here today after reading all the great reviews. Since it's like 60 degrees out I was feeling an ice coffee so I got the tan and black! This coffee is so delicious, I was hoping to get it with almond milk but since it's pre mixed (the milk) I have to settle for regular. Nonetheless this coffee is one of the best I've ever had. 

I also ordered an almond croissant! Omg this was AMAZING! The flavor, the crunchy flakey outside and, the soft inside was just perfect. I would come back to just get a croissant.. 

This place is very good if you are looking for a good coffee alongside a good pastry... I understand now why there are so many good reviews! Def a place worth trying if you are in the area!"
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2018-03-23,5.0,"[OVERALL]

Great atmosphere, great coffee. What more do you need? The staff is always nice, and I'm never disappointed by what I get! Though, they only have oat milk as a dairy substitute (too bad because I prefer almond milk).

[FOOD]

Latte - If you're not sure what to get, get the latte; it's smooth and creamy but still has the distinct taste of coffee.

Americano - My go-to drink. It's strong and doesn't make you feel full.

Almond Croissant - Super good. The filling is very subtle and provides a slight sweetness to the croissant. Quite filling as well.

Hemp Seed Scone - This is vegan and tastes pretty good. It's quite nutty and dense, and there are hints of spice in there."
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-08-12,5.0,Great draft oat latte! Yep! Draft! Try it! Super nice staff and a big space so you don't feel jammed in. The scone was perfect as well. Met my daughter there Sunday before exploring. Love living in this city!!
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2019-08-18,1.0,Worst experience I've had at a coffee shop. They have no dairy-free options to eat and when I ordered a coffee with oat milk they gave me a cup with half creamer and half coffee. After taking a drink I got sick and threw the rest away. Waste of my time and $5
43,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-4,2017-04-08,5.0,"Somehow I haven't reviewed this location yet. One of the best coffee places in town for sure, and everyone is so friendly here. Line moves pretty quickly. I had an iced coffee on my last visit."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2020-02-21,5.0,"I came here the day after Valentine's Day and ordered the pistachio gelato and two cannolis. The cannolis were delicious, I wished they were a bit larger, and they had the amazing filling topped with candied orange. I would definitely come back here."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2020-05-31,4.0,"I came here while exploring little Italy with my friend who's family is from Sicily. Although there weren't as many flavors that appealed to me I opted for pistachio (a solid back up and go to as it's a standard gelato flavor). The owner was very friendly  and began speaking Sicilian to my friend! Let's be real I couldn't understand any of it (sadly not talented to know more than one language) but I appreciated the authenticity of this place! Cost about $5 for a small --portion size not as generous as some gelato places (which is somewhat expected in the city but I still find expensive and disappointing). As I don't live in the city I think I would want to try another place before returning. Nothing that has me dying to come back for more.

*note this visit was prior to quarantine"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-11-10,4.0,"Went here to grab some ice cream on a Saturday night--it was around 7 or so and there was not a line so I was able to be helped right away.

After trying a few flavors, I decided to go with the dark chocolate and coconut, both of which were pretty good--and the scoops were definitely generous as well.

Definitely not a bad spot to check out if you are craving something sweet in the area."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-09-16,5.0,"About a year ago, I ran into these guys at the 2018 Gelato Festival America in Jersey City by accident. Like I was literally running in the park when I stumbled upon this festival... the worst thing that could possibly happen to a run in the park. 

Needless to say, there was no more running for me that day. 

What there was, however, was the discovery of the ""Dark Chocolate Surprise"" flavor from Polosud which immediately became my favorite out of the dozens of super-creative and tasty contenders. It's super silky, smooth, and chocolatey without being too sweet. And unsurprisingly, it won that competition!

I've been to their physical location in Little Italy a few times since. It's been tough to steer away from that magical dark chocolate flavor to try other ones, but I did manage to try Hazelnut once, and that was excellent! This is definitely a great place for gelato in NYC!

P.S. One minor gripe: I wish they would announce ahead of time when their hand-crafted avocado gelato will be in stock. I've always found out about this a few days after the fact... every. single. time!

9/25 - Update: just found out they make the avocado gelato daily. This is super exciting news!! Guess who's gonna be waiting outside their entrance at 11am when they open?"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-08-07,5.0,"Extremely friendly gelato shop located near Nolita and NYC Chinatown, Polosud offers high-quality and unique gelato in a cute little shop. When I stopped by here on a quiet Sunday evening, I had the opportunity to try their avocado gelato (made literally in a hollowed out avocado skin), and it was definitely something worth a try, even if it's not entirely down your alley like it was for me.

The gelato is quite airy, while also being extremely flavorful, and if you opt for the avocado skin, the hazelnut gelato serves as a perfect complement to the avocado. My only gripe would be that, since Polosud only makes 80 of these skins each morning and sells them throughout the day, the part of the gelato exposed to the air gets harder and forms a bit of an odd-tasting skin on the top.

Regardless, there is a wide selection of flavors for any budding gelato-lover to try, and I will definitely stop by again when I'm in the area. Finding a great gelato place is tough, and the friendly service and unique experience makes this a must-try when you're nearby."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-05-24,5.0,"Stopped here today on my way to the delicious Banh Mi Saigon on Mott St. Had never heard of it before! Well, now I'm a fan. Definitely the best gelato in the city. 

Got the special flavor they had - Loaker Chocolate - made with the chocolate from the Loaker company, a popular Italian wafer brand you've seen in more gourmet supermarkets. It was divine! Creamy, fudgy, with chunks of chocolate shavings, topped with a wafer. I'm a chocolate fiend and this did the trick. 

Also got the Cafe flavor, their coffee. This was great for a hot day after walking miles, but it wasn't as good as the Loaker. Also wasn't that much a fan of their Italian Biscotti flavor - way too sweet, which didn't taste natural. Would give the Cafe four stars and the Loaker Chocolate gelato five stars. 

Will come back for the special flavor as long as they have it and try some others next.

5 stars!!!!"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-03-09,5.0,"Where do I start! After checking out the reviews we headed straight to this gelato store. 
We walked in and were warmly greeted and offered samples. The proudly hang their ""Gelato Festival 2018 winner"" for their dark chocolate surprise flavor.  
Not sure how to explain the dark chocolate flavor other and amazing! We were told the process of making the perfect gelato winner flavor. Cute shop with excellent customer service.
We each tried different flavors, Fragola (strawberry) and Amarena (dark cherry). They were perfect! Not to sweet, just perfect flavor. No water needed after consuming the gelato which is a plus. 
Absolutely loved this hidden gem! Definitely a sweet tooth destination."

It's yummy in my tummy!

You get a scoop of gelato of your choice. I picked the coffee (cafe) flavor. Then they press it between brioche buns and topped with powdered sugar. 

I was told this item does get sold out. It was my friends 3 time trying to snag this item and we got it!"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-09-02,5.0,"Another gelato place? I'm in. OMG!! What a great find at 10:30pm when Polosud was one of the few places that were still opened in the neighborhood.

Obviously it's late at night so the store was empty. But don't let it fool you as I'm sure it'll soon be one of the hottest places in town for some of the best gelato. I sampled the mixed berry which was the flavor of the day. It was good. I decided on the Amarena (dark cherry) which was out of the world. You could literally taste some fresh berries in there. The cone was crunchy too. Extra star for a very reasonable price as other places charge double for the same item easily. 

The lady was super nice. Can't wait to go back and try other flavors. Those cookies and desserts looked amazing too. Oh boy, my waistline is going to thank me. Lol"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-02-02,5.0,"Everything looked amazing--especially the pastries. I went with the chocolate hazelnut and was not disappointed. The actual hazelnuts gave such a satisfying crunch. The flavor was so rich and true. WOW. 

Only thing that threw me off was that country music was playing"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-07-30,5.0,"This is superior gelato.  Tried the nocciola and bacio, both sublime.  My son said his mango tasted like a lassi.  Can only imagine what the dark chocolate tasted like, apparently an award winner.  Worth seeking out this little gem."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-11-22,5.0,"Amazing gelato and the owner is from Sicily with the authentic accent!!! We had some of their award winning dairy free dark chocolate gelato (it was reaaally rich and good, if you are into dark chocolate take that!). My favorite was phistachio (made with Sicilian pistachios) and straciatella!

Great place, please go there instead of some Ferrara, even though they are relatively new they are so good!"

It's a must if you have any interest in an ice cream sandwich. It's warm brioche with cold gelato; nothing better in the summer or maybe ever
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-07-06,4.0,"Came here on a hot July 4th because I remembered there was a check-in offer for a free small cone. Only realized that offer was gone when we got there but I had wanted to try the gelato filled brioche bun anyhow.

So the brioche bun is heated up, and the flavor of your choosing is the filling. I asked for dark chocolate. It was actually pretty good, maybe a bit pricey for $7.50 but high quality gelato is usually expensive. Dark chocolate gelato tasted great, not overly sweat and went well with the brioche bun. I would come back to try other flavors."

I usually get the pistachio to judge a gelato place and this place did not disappoint! The pistachio is not too sweet, is thick, and creamy. Service was very friendly and will let you sample flavors first.

Overall, I will come back for more and highly recommend this chain for quality gelato."

We walked closer to Polusud Gelato and found a delightful place with plenty of outside seating in a breezy benches. I had the flavor of the day ( mixed berries) gelato and found it crisp and fresh as a ripe fruit. It was delicious and refreshing for this hot NY afternoon. Had a taste of Mango gelato and it tasted like a bite of fresh mangos ripened by the sun - soft, creamy and yum. The limón was tart and icy- perfectly balanced. The biscotti was creamy and delicious. You can't go wrong with these gelatos. You can have a cone for the same price as a cup- so why not?! Come to Polusud and don't get cranky standing outside an ice cream parlor waiting to get inside! Who wants that!!!!"

I crave this stuff so much when I'm home that I make a point to go out of my way to visit here every time I travel into NYC. Let the ice cream speak for itself! Make sure to try the vanilla, but literally every flavor is delicious. Top-quality ingredients with an award winning chef owner/creator makes for some pretty incredible gelato.

Today I went to Polosud and I loved it!!

And it was 
So creamy and thick. I got the dark chocolate and it was outstanding. After I got my gelato we wound up talking to the owner for about 45 minutes and she could not be nicer.  This is the first location and her and her twin sister got the business started.

Dang, if we didn't get lucky as heck! I thought I knew what gelato was, but I didn't until I had it at Polosud. Every flavor was so distinct, yet easy on the tongue and an utter delight. We went for the mint chocolate chip, the hazelnut and the creme brulee. Lets just say there was a mad scramble after MY hazelnut choice haha! the owner is delightful and friendly and kind, with a wonderful environment at the store. highly recommend!"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-02-08,5.0,"An Authentic Gem - After a family lunch we decided to treat our daughters to a gelato. Our online search led us to Polosud, where we indulged in the most wonderful gelato, rich in flavor, smooth and inspired. The owner, a native of Sicily, shared his passion with us as he guided us through tastes. His dark chocolate gelato was fantastic, as was the pistachio. As if the gelato wasn't enough of a reason to recommend, we purchased a tiramisu and a few cannolis to go. Upon tasting the crisp shell and delicate filling, I was transported to my childhood, eating my grandmother's homemade Italian pastries during holiday celebrations."

ENG:
This place was so, so, so awesome. Definitely the best gelato I've had in the US, and it was up there with some really good Italian gelato shops. Francesca, the person working there, was super nice and friendly, and I was glad that she let me use my Italian with her. The dark chocolate and strawberry flavors were so good, and were both vegan (dairy free,) which is great, since I'm vegan hahaha.
Update- I returned, and the gelato was great, just like the last time. This time, I ordered mango and dark chocolate gelato. Giacomo was working, and I got to use my Italian with him also. He's a great and charismatic person, and I hope to be able to return again room to have another conversation.
IT:
Questa gelateria è veramente fantastica. Ha assolutamente il migliore gelato che abbia mai mangiato negli Stati Uniti, ed è al livello di alcune gelaterie italiane che sono molto buone. Francesca, la persona che lavorava stasera, era molto gentile e amichevole, e sono stato lieto che mi avesse lasciato usare il mio italiano con lei. Il gelato al cioccolato fondente e quello alla fragola erano così buoni, e entrambi erano vegani (senza latticini,) che è fantastico, siccome sono vegano ahaha.

Aggiornamento- Sono tornato, ed il gelato era buonissimo quanto l'ultima volta. Questa volta, ho ordinato il gelato al mango e quello di cioccolato fondente anche. Giacomo lavorava, e ho usato il mio italiano anche con lui. Lui è una persona meravigliosa e carismatica, e spero di poter tornare di nuovo per avere un'altra conversazione."

Great setting for a stroll in the neighborhood and great for pets as well. I tried several items and I hate to say it I ate all of it in one night . I tried 2 cannoli's that were amazing and garnished with a preserved piece of citrus, a white mouse, tiramisu and creme brûlée. All of it were extremely well made and very flavorful. Texture,color and presentation were all perfect. They are open until midnight so it's extremely convenient especially for dates. I met 2 lovely ladies whom I asked their names twice and still forgot their names . They were a great help and very nice. I will be back!"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-08-22,5.0,Heck yes. The gelato here is legit (you can always tell if the lemon gelato is white vs yellow - white is the real deal). The brioche con gelato is out of this world - warm dense bun with delicious gelato filling and sealed edges. The owner was there when I stopped by and was genuinely kind and excited about his gelato. Will definitely be back.

The gelatto was amazing. I tried the strawberry and the pistachio - both were excellent. The prices were high in general but average for NYC. The price of one scoop could get you a pint in the grocery store, which is a bummer. The lady who helped me was a co-owner and AMAZING. She let my try all of the flavors I asked for and was just so friendly. I really hope this place does well and I recommend stopping by!"

The owner talked with us and told about his training Italy as a pastry chef and then his pivot to specialize in gelato, he has some innovative stuff going on. Our family of 7 had 5 flavors. Our favorites were the mango and the biscotto. Kids absolutely loved it as well. Owner also gave us an awesome recommendation for an Italian restaurant nearby (which was great too). Overall +++++"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-09-02,4.0,"Fortuitous find in the heart of Little Italy/Chinatown!  We were temporarily parked for run errands in maybe May or early Summer 2018 when my toddler daughter needed to go to the bathroom.  I walked into the recently opened Polosud, and Francesca was nice enough to allow her to use their restroom.  The best part of going back there was to see how they made the ""magic,"" of the lovely desserts for us at the time - ingredients, mixers, etc.   

I was incredibly indebted to Polosud for not only saving me from an unlikely accident but more so for introducing me to their lovely treats on such a predominantly Chinese street.  It was too early to try their gelato and I am not a coffee/espresso drinker so we ended up taking home several of their individual desserts - cheesecake, a chocolate mousse-type cake, something raspberry, and a slice of its version of a buttery Italian pound cake (but don't remember its name maybe quattro quarti?).  The desserts were really good and the $4.95 slice of pound cake was slightly overmixed and therefore just a bit dry.  Otherwise, flavors on the individual desserts were memorable and very good, and the pound cake was quite good, not too sweet.

I was finally tidying the car and noticed my daughter still had a copy of Polosud's business card intact.  What a great reminder of my experience!  Wanted to write this review a while ago to say how incredibly appreciative we were of Polosud's hospitality and our sampling of some of their food.  Just saw their Aug 2018 award for gelato - bravissimo!  Hope they continue to thrive in that neighborhood!"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-12-13,4.0,"Actually,  I put the wrong review here.  The price wasn't all that bad for what you get.  It's probably one of the best spots in little Italy.  However,  that's the thing,  it's in little Italy.  So,  it lost one star for not being an accessible Franchise."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-09-22,5.0,Best gelato in town! Must try the chocolato fondante and the fragola. Also very good pistacchio. If you are around Little Italy don't miss this amazing experience.
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-04-16,5.0,Small and delicious selection. Ditch all the touristy ice cream places in the area for this one. Reminds me of gelato I had in Rome and Milan
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-06-05,5.0,Very pleased with this cute little place. My fiancé and I had bacio and cioccolato fondente. It was excellent! We will definitely come back for another date in little Italy.
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-09-24,5.0,Qualita in tutto. Giacomo is a master of his trade. You will be happy and fulfilled!
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-08-27,5.0,"Relatively new gelateria that opened up on Mott St. I walked by one night on the way to Oddfellows and decided to pop in to see what it's about. To our surprise the gelato ended up being some of the best I've had outside of Italy! Top flavors for me are the mango and hazelnut, although their pistachio is great as well and their vanilla has garnered acclaim in some articles."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-08-04,5.0,"Had the gelato which ranks up with the best I've had. Clean, inviting storefront. Friendly owners. A very authentic experience in a slightly touristy area. Highly recommend!!"
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-06-15,5.0,"Friendly staff and amazing coconut gelato! Not everyone can do coconut ice cream right, but this one is absolutely delicious. Tried the pistachio too, which was also good. They have a rum & mint flavor that sounds tasty in theory, like a mojito, but it has a bit of a bitter/odd aftertaste."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-08-14,5.0,"My friend Jackie, an elite yelper who I'm sure will also write a review, and I recently went to Italy and had gelato once or sometimes twice a day in each city. We came to Little Italy in New York hoping to find authentic gelato. Polosud not only met but exceeded our expectations. The gelato is honestly better than many of the gelato we had in Italy. The worker was extremely nice and helpful. I had the mixed berry (flavor of the day), their award winning dark chocolate, and the fragola (strawberry). All were creamy, rich, and true to flavor. I HIGHLY recommend coming here if you get the opportunity."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-06-16,5.0,"This is the freaking best gelato I've had!!!! The flavors are delicious, I just love coming to this place is amazing if you want dessert    not only they serve gelato but they also have pastries, so far I tried the cannoli and the créeme brûlée and it was DELICIOUS  and not to mention the girls working are the nicest too, they have great stuff and great customer service and to me that's a winner."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-07-05,5.0,"This is hands down the best gelato in NYC.  You are really missing something special if you don't try this.  The owners are fantastic people and so the service is top notch.  It really is a product of a labor of love rather than another corporate money making grab.   Run don't walk, I love this place and their gelato."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2019-01-19,5.0,My girlfriend and I decided to stop in during a cold gloomy day after eating nearby and had a wonderful experience! We sampled a couple flavors (extremely fresh) and decided to get brioche with gelato (chocolate hazelnut). The brioche was warm and the gelato was a perfect mix between a solid and liquid. Looking forward to coming back to try new flavors when it's actually sunny!
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-07-14,5.0,"This is delicious. Drove by last night and they have this cute little area with benches outside to enjoy your gelato. You arrive and they ask if you'd like to try any of their flavors and they are all spectacular. The guy helping us was straight from Italy with a beautiful accent, and believe me when I say this - it was the best gelato I've had in NYC. Had the nocciola flavor (hazelnut) in a cup and it was super creamy. Will definitely be coming back."
44,polosud-gelato-coffee-pastries-new-york,2018-07-29,5.0,"Absolutely the best gelato!! Whole family came back night after night for an evening gelato.  Thanks, Franco and friends."

45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2020-05-06,5.0,I was missing my favorite coffee! Since the lockdown it's all I could do to keep from going there. So much sadness in the world right now and I don't want to cause any harm to anyone over coffee so I have been drinking other brands from my weekly trip to the market. Finally broke down and called and was told that I could order it online! It arrived today and brought tears to my eyes. Hello old friend! Looking forward now to morning. Thank you everyone at Porto Rico for working to get us the best coffee in NYC!
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2020-05-08,5.0,"I see a lot of grumbling about service in reviews, but I can't imagine being in their shoes and having to deal with some of the ""eccentric"" folks I've seen in here. I think they do a good job with customer service.

So really, bottom line, the coffee is great and and priced very competitively.

I am in NJ and locking down, so I ordered some coffee. They were totally up front about how it would take a while to ship. When I did get it in the time that was promised, it was almost TOO fresh. Total satisfaction."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2020-01-02,4.0,"Good place for a very large selection of coffee.  Just walking in the place makes you want to have a cup (you can buy coffee to drink in the back of the shop) and try a few things to bring home.

I bought my sister some tea and they had a nice selection of loose tease, which is how she likes to use it.

Prices are reasonable.  A good, classic, New York City shop and well worth a visit."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-12-26,4.0,"Another old sleeper shop that has caught the eye of the masses now turning it into a frenzy.  Ridiculous.  Where were all these people over the years when Porto Rico was empty?  What exactly caught their eye now?  An article or a shout out in Sex in the City or something?

The coffee bar in the back used to be one of the few places to grab coffee years ago before all the coffee shops sprang up around the neighborhood.

I enjoy the old school vibe here and grab beans when in the neighborhood.  So glad they have remained all these years.  I love old school New York places along with the new places.  That's what makes a neighborhood."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2020-06-05,5.0,"Breathe in the best coffee aromas anywhere and get your coffee on! You want a bean, they've got it. You want a grind, they've got it. You want it fast and at a good price, where else is there? This place has been in business forever because they know what they're doing and they do it better than anyone."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-12-02,5.0,"A great coffee establishment for coffee lovers of all stripes. 

This is one of my go to coffee places near Bleecker Street, and I think you would be hard pressed to find a better place to buy your coffee. 

Prior to this review, I have had the pleasure of both tasting Porto Rico's coffee from its in-house cafe and purchasing coffee beans from the store; both methods of experiencing coffee here are great. 

Besides selling very flavorful cold brews and other coffees, Porto Rico coffee sells a variety of beans both decaf and caffeinated. This makes Porto Rico stand out in a city powered by coffee; I have yet to find a store with the same variety of decaf coffee as this store. 

Additionally, from what I have seen, Porto Rico also sells a variety of tea. I definitely need to check this out next time."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-09-08,3.0,"I sometime see what I don't read case in point the ""Porto Rico Importing Company "" I saw Puerto Rican so I expect some Bustelo, even if it's pails against the better PR brands like Yaucono, Cafe Rico or El Cogui.  But sad none was to be found I'm sure they have some good beans and fresh roast here and that they ship there coffees to Alaska and Pitcairn Island but I just wanted some PR Beans to roast and grind like Grandma did.  

I been up 8 hours without having my normal coffee too busy walking around and taking photos I could upload to Yelp and I needed a fix so I ask for a cup of regular here and it was worst than the free coffee at the office and I tossed it half why through, my disappointment continued."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-11-08,3.0,"They have some really cheap tea options here, I got the Sencha which was super cheap, especially compared to any of the other tea options in the area.

That being said, I thought the quality of the sencha was a little low. I wasn't expecting too much though since the price was so low but still a bit unfortunate."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-08-13,5.0,"This place is coffee heaven! I've been coming to Porto Rico since I was a teen, hooked by my mom who remembers it fondly from her NYU days in the 80s. It smells amazing, the staff is very knowledgeable but unpretentious (so rare), and the selection is fantastic. 

Most beans are $9-12/lb and every bit as delicious as the $18/lb stuff at your local hipster coffee shop. Plus you can buy the amount you actually want; there's no discount for buying a full pound so why not try a couple, date around before finding The One, ya know? And while you're here, get a mocha or a pour over from the little coffee bar in the bar. Stick it to the chain coffeeshop man while enjoying the aromas a little longer. 

Heads up for you organic-only snobs, you'll appreciate that they have a dedicated grinder only for organic beans."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-06-28,5.0,"I just found my favourite coffee shop in the city!!! They offer varieties of coffee beans around the world! Before you choose the beans, they let you smell them first. They grind beans for you as well.

Definitely get their fresh coffee when you are in the area! Their coffee is cheap (and so good) compare to regular coffee shops! The barista made coffee very fast as well. Killed the long line very efficiently. A large iced latte is $4 and coffee is refillable with another $1.5. Love this place!"
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-12-01,5.0,"Exceptional and affordably brewed coffee! Walk in and you're instantly engulfed with the wonderful aroma of fresh coffee beans. The shelves on the left are lined with coffee products for sale such as mugs, French presses, and logo printed merch. The right side of the store is filled with assorted coffee beans from around the world. All the way to the back of the store is a tiny barista bar. Bring your own cup for a discounted price! Each coffee cup purchase (not with your own cup) gets a loyalty stamp. Buy 5, get the 6th cup free! Amazing historical, no frills  establishment! My favorite is their chicory iced coffee!"
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-06-16,5.0,"Awesome place to get you morning brew or your late afternoon pick me up. You can also find amazing coffee beans that you can take home. I highly recommend the place their beans are just splendid. 

One thing I would say is to make sure you order the right sizes. These guys aren't aren't your dainty Starbucks grande."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-11-21,5.0,"Exceptional brew on the coconut coffee I got from them. Nicely balanced with a sense of the Caribbean with the extremely pure taste and smell of the coconut. After many years and dozens and dozens of brewers, this is by far the best coconut blend I've ever had."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-12-06,4.0,"I've passed by this shop so many times within the last few years, and it's been on my yelp list! 

Well I finally decided to go in and get a coffee. There's a bit of a line, but the coffee is good quality.
They also have baked goods! 

Other then the coffee, they also sell coffee beans, teas, and snacks. 

Cute little shop to stop by and grab a coffee and snack!"
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-11-08,5.0,"Attention all coffee lovers! This place is a MUST GO. As soon as you step in, you are welcomed with soothing aroma of coffee. Extensive selection of coffee beans lined up in large sacks throughout the store. The staff will freshly grind the beans of your choice according to the coffeemaker you use - in my case, a French press. I love coming here to of course, get my favorites such as hazelnut and French vanilla but also try new flavors by getting a half pound. Highly recommend."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-10-26,5.0,Best coffee on the planet!  Great customer service.   Free shipping with orders $75 and over in lower 48 states ALL YEAR 'ROUND!  Stock up on whole bean or ground coffee.  French Peruvian Organic Fair Trade is a favorite of ours. We also like the French Mocha.   The newsletter published to announce sales in October and April includes owner Peter Longo's personal letter.  His latest newsletter took a humorous approach to his recent loss of his barber.  It was as if Peter were talking directly to us!  Mom and I love Porto Rico Importing Company!
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-12-20,5.0,"I came all the way from California to bring back stuffed bags of coffee beans from Porto's. Located not too far off from the famous village Joe's pizza, Porto's is what I expect of an NYC coffee roaster. There are tons of options to choose from, and the guys hanging around gives you some great recommendations based on your coffee preferences. Coming from the West coast, I thought prices were dirt cheap. I bought French roast, house roast, and vanilla bean. Since arriving back home, I look forward to grinding my beans up and making the most delicious, smooth cup of java with Porto beans. 

Highly recommend grabbing some espresso from the coffee bar. They give you samples which help you pick and buy even more beans. I sampled the house, and after a quick taste I added 1/2 pound of these to my stash. Also told them I was travelling, and they did a great job of wrapping everything up nicely. 

Overall, cannot say greater things about Porto's other than if you're a coffee snob like me, fly to NYC and buy yourself some decent Porto beans."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-06-19,5.0,"Always buy coffee beans from here when vising New York. There are so many varieties and I love the tiramisu coffee beans. When I make drip coffee out of it, I love the smell of tiramisu with coffee."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-02-16,5.0,These guys still have it going on. I've been coming here for years for fresh roasted coffee beans. Light roast Colombian is where it's at!

a small cafe in the back 
lovely staff :)"
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2020-02-21,5.0,I LOVE this place!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitely my favorite cup of coffee in NYC. Always feel at home when I get a cuppa Americano or herbal tea there.
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2020-02-17,5.0,"Amazing and huge selection of coffee beans (and loose leaf teas). They sell by the 1/2 lb whole bean or ground-on-site. If you just want a cup, head to the back for a brew. They also have some nibbles. Need a reusable to-go mug, or a whole new brewing system? The West Side location has a wall with various coffee machines and some ""old fashioned"" candy. I love just smelling this place - it's heavenly. My go to coffee is the Thai Burbon."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-08-22,5.0,Great customer service and coffee/tea selections. The French Guatemalan coffee is amazing! I highly recommend it. And so affordable! The service clerk gave me storage tips for coffee and made some recommendations too. I can't wait to go back and try out their coffees from other countries.
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-09-15,5.0,"This place is seriously legit! The selection is exotic and huge, coming from all over the world! Prices are very much commensurate with high end coffee (not over priced). The staff is friendly and helpful.
We purchased a pound of Costa Rican French Roast for 10.99/lb.
The beans are perfectly roasted, and our resulting brew of coffee is delicious. Perfectly robust and smooth. If you are a coffee lover and happened to be in New York, this lovely purveyor is a must stop!"
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-07-09,5.0,"I LOVE coffee - and now i am hooked on Porto Rico's coffee, here's why: 

AFFORDABLE! i think most are around $10 - $12 a pound. (I share with someone else, and we go through about a pound every two weeks - that's making coffee every morning)

CONVENIENT! you can get however much you want, of whichever kinds, and whichever grind you want! 

DELICIOUS VARIETY! i love flavored coffees, and they have tons - irish creme, blueberry creme, french cinnamon, cherry, streusel - the list goes on. And of course they have the standards / blends from different countries (french Brazilian and french Costa Rican are great!). 

Highly recommend, I go here every other week because honestly nothing beats their coffee."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-06-30,5.0,Delicious mocha with almond milk. Pretty cheap for Manhattan and nice workers. Recommend.
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-04-20,5.0,"I've yet to taste a dirty chai latte as smooth, complex yet clean, as the one I had here! I have never really been agreeable to foam before until now either. They have such a huge selection of coffee with some varieties of tea I recognized and loved. Their whole store smelled aromatic! My fellow classmates and I had just finished attending a presentation at NYU and wanted to enjoy a simple cup of coffee before heading back into NJ. I'm very glad I stuck around or I'd never discover this deceptively ordinary store. I will definitely come by again for that drink!"
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2017-08-18,5.0,"Coffee coffee everywhere! 

This place has some of the best coffee and coffee beans in the neighborhood... all reasonably priced. Definitely a worth visit for all coffee lovers. They have different types of coffee beans from many countries, all labeled. They also carry many unique items such as different types of coffee presses, filters, mugs, post cards, jars, drip kettles, vintage coffee grinders, chocolates, etc. 

The customer service is also very professional...I especially like the lady who serve in the morning during the weekdays because she is very efficient at what she does. Remember to pick up a punch card when you purchase a drink...free drink after every 5 drink purchases and each drink comes with a piece of chocolate. If they don't give you the chocolate, just ask.

Also, this is a walk in and go spot, so no seatings available inside. However, there are two benches outside for some good vibe people watching if desired."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-03-20,4.0,"Cute coffee store in the street of trendy West Village! I liked how they offer daily specials for certain kind of coffee, which is sold for a discount. Staff seemed to knowledgeable and was willing to talk to me to find out what kind of coffee I would like the most. I was impressed that before putting the coffee beans in the grinder, the staff asked me in what way I will make coffee. And the coffee came out perfectly when I made a cup using Aeropress. The coffee tasted great, and I am excited to go back and buy more!"
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-03-11,5.0,"The store smells amazing and the staff is very friendly. Bought French mocha and Vienna Costa Rica for drip coffee. $5.5 per pound, complimentary grounding, also makes great gifts"
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-02-20,5.0,"I must admit I didn't actually get to try the coffee here, and yet, I feel compelled to share my awe of this place. We stopped here on a food tour; not for any samples but for an added cool factor, I suppose. I can't recall how many coffees they roast and import, but I want to say somewhere between 80-100. Upon entering, the magical aroma of coffee fills the air and sacks full of open beans are spread throughout. It's a tight squeeze through the people and the sacks, but there's so much to look at; each bean seemingly so similar yet distinct in color, original, flavor and roast. I regret we weren't able to stay and sample but judging by the line of folks, I'd say this is a great stop for an incredibly fresh cup of warmth!"
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-06-27,5.0,"I don't think I've ever set foot in a better smelling place than Porto Rico! Walking in there is an experience in and of itself so, if you're in the area, I highly recommend checking them out!

The store is filled with different varieties of coffee from all over the world. Plus all of the paraphernalia for coffee lovers, like me! And -even if you're not that into coffee - Porto Rico is an excellent place to get a gift from someone who is.

And, while you're there, why not enjoy a cup of joe while you shop? That way, you can try the coffee and take some home if you love it."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-06-19,4.0,"Seems like the popular coffee shop to go to if you want to buy coffee beans. They have so many different varieties. It was pretty crowded on a Monday afternoon. 

Tried their iced coffee. It was good. May come back for some coffee beans."

Thanks to Cynthia writing a review I would have completely forgotten! I would walk over to Bleecker Street and hang out on my lunch breaks. This store meets every coffee addicts needs. 
I really loved to buy gifts here when I was employed! Especially since my Supervisor was a big fan! 
I can't match my Friend Cynthia 'a ROTD. I'm not going to try. Thanks C! I can't wait to head back to that neighborhood on a Spring Day and enjoy all the shopping! I'll try to remember to stop in to pick up some coffee. Or take photos anyway!!"
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2017-03-27,5.0,"An absolute must for coffee lovers in the city. Straight forward purveyor of all things coffee: beans, grounds, presses, machines. All at reasonable to solid prices.

The coffee beans are set up in open sacks along the middle of the store. Each labeled with name, country of origin, and type. Wasn't quite sure about the strength of each, but was able to get the info from one of the people working the area. Got a half a pound each of two different coffee beans (ground for my french press); total $12 - amazing price. 

People who work here are informative and grind the beans correctly (not a given elsewhere). Haven't tried the actual coffee they brew here, which is probably very good."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-02-23,5.0,"This local chain manages for each location to look like a funky original with a red faded sign and old world cellar feel. 

Open barrels of coffee beans fill the room, and the smell is delightful .

Go to the back counter to order coffee.
This Location has a wonderful looking selection of pastries too, unlike bushwick.

There are a couple of benches outside that have a decent street view of Bleeker, or you can mosey down to a set of benches on 6th avenue if you want more action.

I was a little surprised that my iced coffee was a mere $3.  I also bought a good quality chocolate for .50 cents.

There is also a large selection of coffee drinking  related brewing and storage equipment including - French presses, 
Mason jars, creamer pitchers, Stanley thermoses and more. 

Deets 

This place mainly sells beans by the pound.
They sell cups of coffee to go, but there is no seating area except for two benches outside."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-06-08,4.0,"I would have give this coffee shop 5 stars. They put 4 express shot in my $4 ice latte. It was the best ice latte I ever had. However, the customers service is surprisingly awful. I would give them 0 star for customer service. Their so called baristas is the worst I have ever seen. The barista is even worse than the ones who work in Starbucks. I am not sure they are even qualified as a barista. I was taking photo of my coffee. The barista got freak out and said don't take pictures of him and told me to delete from my phone. I don't know who he think he is because I was taking photo of the ""coffee"". Just like the other reviewers on yelp, this coffee shop has 0 customers service even they have great coffee. They're very unlike other coffee shop. First, They don't offer a comfortable environment for you to stay. No seats inside of course. Apparently they want the customers to pay the money and go away. Second, this place is not credit card friendly unlike other coffee shops in the city. They have old fashioned machines. They prefer cash. Third, the environment is dirty. You can actually see the dusts around the cashier area. The only good thing about this coffee shop is the good coffee with cheap price. I would still come to here next time but I would just close my eyes and ignore everything and get my coffee out of here."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2019-07-08,5.0,Cool spot with great coffee. Pretty busy when I went but staff very quick. Good spot to get some work done.

I only came for a cup of coffee. It was the cheapest priced cup of coffee I had all week. And, it was very fresh.  

The barista was very courteous and told me all about the place. 

If I lived in the area, I would be a regular there to buy beans and coffee."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-03-13,5.0,"I'm not sure how I haven't ever written a review for Porto Rico. I come by a lot - sometimes to buy beans, but more often to get coffee from their little café stand in the back. The coffee here is great - it tastes great and it's cheap. It's definitely cheaper than specialty cafes in the area. 

Service is always nice. The wait can get a bit long if there are a few people in line, but it is well worth it. 

They have a bunch of different coffee beans for purchase and the prices are always fair. The workers also really know their stuff, so if you're looking for a recommendation, they have a lot to offer."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-11-06,5.0,This is my favorite of their locations though i assume the beans are the same everywhere. It just transports you - smell environment and people are incredible. I always get the beans they recommend for espresso and they make amazing joe in my machine
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-10-01,5.0,"Porto Rico is a must go. I might just stand in the store to smell like the delicious coffee aroma that fills the store. Not only are the employees super friendly and animated but they are always excited to see you and so loyal to their customers. After only 4 visits they know my regular order. 

Also, the coffee is some of the best I've ever had. It isn't acidic or too strong but the perfect blend. Also they have a great rewards program where 5 drinks gets you one free. 

In short this place looks like it would be cash only but IS NOT- which is great they take credit cards."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2017-11-27,4.0,"I was introduced to Porto Rico about twenty years or so ago when I worked at NYU.  If you ever want to see what a piece of old New York City retail looked like, this shop is the place to go.  While the neighborhood around it changes with more dessert and vegan places than you can shake a stick at, this shop remains as it was.  The store front has an old school charm to it and the interior is even better.

When you enter there is an old wood floor and the walls probably have not changed in years (both in terms of color and decor).  Distributed throughout the store are huge sacks of coffee sold by the pound.  The *smell* is amazing.  If you are a coffee lover, you will want to take some deep breaths!  I wish I could tell you a favorite flavor, but I have loved all the flavors so I would say try those that match your tastes.  You can order a little bit (try a quarter pound) if you are unsure.

Porto Rico also has some chocolate covered roasted coffee beans which are amazing, but be warned at the caffeine rush you will get as a result!

Tip: It is not immediately obvious, but to order you stand in one line at the cashier and you pay at the other.  If you just stand around the sacks of coffee it is likely you will be overlooked unless you are the only one in the shop.

I love Porto Rico and try to get its coffee every chance I get."

I walked in and no less than three people were standing by the counter having a conversation. Not one of them could be bothered to say hello, do you need something, etc. despite the fact that I was the only customer actually looking to buy coffee beans. Clearly my money is not needed here."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-09-18,5.0,"The coffee was amazing here! I loved the fact they had actual burlap bags filled with coffee beans out on display. There were so many options of coffee beans to choose from. From dark, to medium, to light roast. A lot of different imported coffee beans that you can purchase by the pound. There was also a tiny coffee bar tucked in the back corner of the shop. They had a small selection of drinks to choose from. I couldn't resist the robust aromatics that was filled in the air that consumed me! So, I decided to purchase a small cappuccino that tasted great amazingly! You can really taste the aromatics in the coffee! I enjoyed my nice cup of coffee on the benches outside the store front. I would definitely come back to this place for some great coffee and perhaps take home with me next time!"

45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-09-01,4.0,"I usually go to the Porto Rico Importing at Saint Mark's. However, the selection here is slightly larger. 

Just like it's Astor brethren this store just seeps out wonderful coffee smells. The selection of quality coffee is excellent. I haven't found a bad bag of coffee here yet. However, this store is a tad busier than Saint Mark's. Possibly, as a result of this, the staff is less likely to spend a lot of time making recommendations. However, I do think the people working here don't know their coffee as well as their co-workers at Saint Mark's."
45,porto-rico-importing-company-new-york-2,2018-03-31,5.0,"I long for the days I get to step into the magical land of Porto Rico. 

It's one of the best ways to start your day and I highly recommend you swing by if you haven't done so already. 

I often purchase beans for family and friends. The options are vast -- the friendly staff will help you navigate if you're as clueless as I am.  

Definitely grab a coffee here the next time you are near. I'm confident you'll be a repeat customer."

But all the employee were ""Americans"" who simply ignored us, did not attend us. They were too busy to respond to our questions or to sell us coffee.

My favorites so far are French Brazilian,French Guatemalan, Italian Espresso, Vienna Sumatra and French Mocha... but there are just so many to try. If you are a starter, I would highly recommend their cafe blend. It's not as dark as individual roasts I listed above, but nice easy blend to start your day. I just love this space filled with loose beans and instant fun escape from busy NYC life thanks to the strong smell of coffee beans. There is a few other locations in NYC. I also love their East Village location!"

Look no further than Caffe Vita - I stepped into this small establishment on a serendipitous search of coffee after placing my name at russ and daughters, and was happily surprised. The music was banging, and everyone who stopped in game by to chat with the employees at the counter. I got a Sevilla mocha, which had orange peel in it (Seville is known for its orange tree-lined streets) and was absolutely smooth and delicious - chocolate-y and dark, and the  perfect amount of citrus that came through. I also got a cappuccino for my boyfriend which he also liked. 

A cup will probably set you back anywhere from $4-6, but given that this is New York, I was happy to fork it up for a good cup of coffee and excellent people watching."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2019-11-24,4.0,"The only thing I had here was the coffee, so that is what I'll be reviewing. As soon as you walk in you're faced with a very busy and warm front of house. This place oozes coffee shop appeal. 

The baristas were very welcoming and extremely quick. I can see why my AirBnb host recommended them! The coffee had some good robust flavor, maybe a little too dark for my liking, but my father would definitely enjoy a cup. 

Be warned, the location is a tad on the small side, so large groups may find it difficult to come in and all sit down to talk over a cup of joe. 

I definitely have to try the food next time I'm in town! Can't wait!!"
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2020-02-16,5.0,"This is a great coffee option on the Lower East Side. Their space is minimal, but the barista was very friendly, and the coffee was even better! Their Americano had a great espresso, and they offer simple syrup, milk, and cream for free! Their Iced Oatmilk Latte was also excellent. Their Oat Milk was exceptionally creamy and had a unique oat flavor that stood out from the espresso flavor!"

You would think working at a coffee shop that they'd be more ""awake"" but instead I received good coffee w dry customer service.

46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2019-07-02,5.0,"Quick stop for coffee. This place is tiny so it's not somewhere you hang out all day sipping coffee, staring at your laptop, reading about beard oil, and looking indifferent. This is a place to walk in and order a fine cup of coffee, or an espresso, Americano, or something similar. And it's good coffee. I was across the street at the Hotel Indigo and didn't want to buy their coffee. This was less than hotel prices and mush better than hotel coffee. 
If you are in the LES, particularly near Houston and Ludlow, maybe after eating at Katz, I would definitely recommend stopping in for a cup. 
And if you need to stare at your laptop and read about beard oil go to the Hotel Indigo and up to their lobby on the 14th floor."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2018-02-18,4.0,"I was in the area and needed a morning pick-me-up. This was one of the first coffee shops that popped up on my Yelp search, and as it was one that I had not yet visited, I decided to give it a shot. As others have mentioned, the cafe is teeny tiny. There is quite a bit of standing room (if you aren't claustrophobic and don't mind standing next to the roaster), but the only seating inside is at the window and consists of two stools. 

There drink menu is no-nonsense, but it does cover all of the basic espresso drinks. I ordered a medium Americano, which set me back a little less than $4. Overall, I thought the prices were very reasonable for a cafe in NYC. The coffee wasn't particularly memorable, but I drank it black and enjoyed it."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2019-02-27,3.0,"Really good cold-brew and reasonably priced. Small, more of a grab and go place. I'm not sure if they have wifi as I'm usually there for less than 10 minutes. 

With that said, I've walked to Tiny's Giant and Starbucks sometimes just because the vibe is hit or miss with the staff here. One woman in particular tends to make you really feel like you're interrupting her day. It's hit or miss, so hopefully she's just not there when you are-orrr hope she's having a great morning. I think coffee shops being reviewed need to be weighed heavily on hospitality."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2018-08-14,4.0,Cold brew was decent but it's VERY tight in here so don't expect to hang out. Best to get it to go.
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2018-07-05,4.0,"I came here one afternoon after my friends and I were lacking energy and needed our caffeine fix. Being that we were in the Lower East Side, finding a coffee shop wasn't really difficult and just coincidentally, we were just standing outside this place and one of the employees saw that we were trying to find a place to grab coffee, so he invited us in.

As a majority of the reviews on here states, the quarters are indeed extremely cramped, so this isn't a dine-in place. I ordered the chai tea latte because I wanted something flavorful and aromatic. My friends who ordered regular cold brews all agreed that the coffee was definitely on the strong side. My chai tea latte was creamy, had a slight aftertaste of  spices and was very refreshing and kept me well caffeinated.

Overall, I enjoyed my first visit to Caffe Vita. The employee was very nice and fun to chat to and he served us some incredible drinks here. Definitely give this place a shot if you're ever in the neighborhood."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2019-08-24,5.0,"Long time customer, have loved their products since they opened in Seattle ~'95.

Coffee is amazing.

46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2016-07-25,5.0,"Downtown wakes up late, especially in the lower East side.  You're lucky that Vita coffee is open at 7:00am, because no one else is in these parts.  

You're also lucky that VITA's coffee is really good.   My doppio had such a marvelous crema, drawn to perfection in its coffee bean meatiness, with an almost hot chocolate thick deliciousness and fresh nutty bean flavour.  

You're also lucky that the women womanning this small lovely little caffeine creamery sanctuary are shiney goddesses who are happy to hold conversation and pretty much attend to your specific needs.

Good coffee is the star here, with only a few croissants as a back seat offering.  They don't even have cinnamon.  I'm assuming they think the coffee speaks for itself, and they are right.

To bad you can't sit down anywhere, although it's completely forgiveable because of the coffee caliber, but the romantic narrow little brick space might call for you to linger.  It's a stand and sip joint. 

Outside the basement stairs are flanked by an oddly placed narrow stand up coffee counter like you might find in Europe.  One side of the counter has a small planter where I tried to sit but the picket fence composition makes it a little impractical and uncomfortable.  

Maybe the best cup of coffee I've had in New York.
Swing by if you're in the neighbourhood for a special cup of Joe."

46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2015-10-12,5.0,"They seriously served me one of the best latte's I've ever had. The place looks a bit sketch from the outside but it's pretty warm and cozy once you step in. No tables here, they have six stools and a counter that you can stand up against. There are two small counters outside if you want to smoke while you sip.

Pricing was excellent and the service was good."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2018-12-28,5.0,Best coffee in LES. Staff are great and make an amazing coffee. Loyalty scheme takes a bit long to accumulate rewards. Maybe a good old stamp card would be better for loyal customers?

I went to Caffe Vita this morning since, even though I love NY, there's always a little piece if my heart that will always belong to Seattle. Caffe Vita is definitely one of the best coffee spots. They roast their own beans. And their LES location is no different. I walk in and this rocker, all black clothes with patches was roasting up a batch of coffee beans. The aromas of the beans being roasted was making me salivate. It was early in the morning. I ordered an americano and found a little spot by the window to work on my little ipad with the attached keyboard. They let me know how to set up the wifi and I had a beautiful writing moment before I had to head to work. I would love if there was more space to sit at a larger table but it being LES and knowing how much rent is, I see this is the NY version of a Seattle favorite. 

I heart Seattle! And I love wearing my Caffe Vita baseball tee!! And I use my pour over funnel all the time. Keep up the good work!"
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2018-10-16,5.0,"I happened upon Caffe Vita while avoiding some unexpected rain, but I'll be back rain or shine.

The second I stepped in, I felt a familiar feeling, kind of like returning home. Everything was set up in a real casual way. My eyes were first caught up by the huge grinding machine, which took about a quarter of the room. Impressive ambience!

Opted for cappuccino with skim milk. My friend told me it's gonna be much bitter than stumptown, the other Seattle local brand; however I felt the smooth level just about right! So lucky to come here and enjoy a great cup. Definitely a gem in the city!"

I can't help but mention the service. The two people ""working"" were kind of rude. Chatting with as customer as we're trying to place our order. Not sure if they were talking to her or us. They missed one of our drink orders as a result. 

My coffee was fine... the same as any other overpriced coffee in NY. Not making any plans to go back."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2017-02-10,4.0,"I love coffee! I even went out during the freak blizzard (Feb 2017) to get coffee and I ended here (partly because it opens early - I don't know why all the other coffee shops in the area open late but Caffe Vita came to my rescue). 

First, like most of the other reviews say, this place is small. They have 2 seats near the window but that's about it. 

But, for those of you wanting a good cup of joe and don't need the seat, this place hits the spot. I had a french press coffee and it was rich and not bitter. 

I also had an almond croissant - partly because I had burned so many calories walking in the snow (or so I tell myself) and the thing was delish! It was big too so it really added on a few extra warmth points to my layer of lard. 

Overall - yum and I would come back again."

And give them a nice tip if you know what's good for yah...especially if you are an annoying tourist just out of the tenement museum trying to figure out just what a pacnor is. Cheers.
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2015-09-17,5.0,"I ordered a regular latte, and it was DELICIOUS. The quality of the coffee here seriously puts Starbucks or even worse Dunkin Donuts to shame. The coffee beans were so fragrant, and the consistency was so perfectly rich and creamy without being overpowering. I ordered a small, and it was definitely enough to energize me for another 7 hours, and I am quite the caffeine lover. 

I like how the shop is a bit of a hole-in-the-wall but not small enough that it is claustrophobic. Unfortunately, this means you really can't linger around and do work, but the LES is a pretty fun area to walk around, so grabbing your coffee to go really isn't that bad."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2017-02-26,5.0,It never fails me! Awesome mocka in this cold weather! Nice and warm staff told me that their syrup is made by theirselves from dark cocoa powder.

46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2018-01-28,5.0,"A Seattle based roasting company, Cafe Vita procures top-shelf espresso in a cozy, modern almost Italian cafe environment. With only 4 other locations nationwide, Vita is a specialized brand exclusively available in Manhattan in this east side location, although they recently opened a branch in Bushwick. The espresso is robust and silky smooth, and the service professional and prompt. Some may complain about price, but that's to be expected at shops like Vita. If you're craving a strong, no nonsense house brew, stop in and you're sure to be impressed. One last tip: don't plan on staying around, not a sit down cafe."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2016-05-06,5.0,"Yummy coffee! I live right by here and am obsessed with their iced lattes. They are so well made and taste amazing! 

The cafe is rather small and you might miss it from the outside. The building is painted black and has a red neon sign with 'VITA' printed on it. 

When you walk inside, you will see a few tables and the coffee bar where they make your drinks. It's rather claustrophobic and I wouldn't recommend this place for a place to sit and chat with friends. It's more of a 'to-go' type of coffee place in my opinion. 

However, their coffee is great which keeps me coming back. They have a typical menu like any cafe with iced drinks and regular hot drinks. Obviously my favorite is the iced latte. I will keep coming back for some great coffee on Ludlow street! Great and friendly service too. Thank you cafe vita!"
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2014-07-11,4.0,"Iced latte for almost $5. I feel like the barista was very particular about how to make it (in a good way). She kind of folded the drink onto itself, instead of vigorously mixing it.

Very tiny inside so I wouldn't recommend hanging out there. There's barely room to wait for your drink."

I normally get their regular coffee with soy milk, and they're nice enough to even steam it. Their coffee is thick and creamy/silky. Friendly baristas too!"
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2014-06-30,3.0,"I know I'm in the minority here - everyone else is raving about how great the Seattle coffee is. I thought it was just okay. I'm not an expert on coffee but I've had my fair share of nice, gourmet coffees. I'm pretty sensitive towards coffee flavors - I can't drink Dunkin or Starbucks but I'd love a good cup of Chinese bakery coffee any day. 

I had an iced latte here - the mediums are actually smalls and the larges are actually mediums. When you first drink it, it tastes REALLY bad. But once you swallow it, the aftertaste is pretty good. It was a VERY weird experience. I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. 

The Boyfriend had a cup of their cold drip Japanese coffee which was nice - there was a hint of mint that was very interesting. 

I don't know, for the price I'm paying, I think I'd rather have a nice iced coffee at Stumptown instead."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2015-05-19,4.0,"Stumbled upon Cafe Vita one day when my usual place Irving Farm was closed. This place has great staff that are super friendly and their cold brew is top notch.  

It is a very small space with one small table but I usually grab and go.  The best part of the place maybe the fresh beans being roasted all of the time giving off an amazing aroma.  

The price of drinks is pretty standard for other similar establishments.  It's not an every day place (unless you can afford it) but if you need a pick me up and want something tasty check out Cafe Vita."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2014-05-29,3.0,"Had the iced coffee and was not really that bad. Just the size of the cups are a little askew. I mean the medium size cup is small, to me thats a ripoff. Come on and they charge a premium price.

I can get a bigger iced coffee for a cheaper price elsewhere so the size and price point really will not have me returning here. Cause if you dont think size matters think again!"
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2016-07-15,5.0,"There are many cafes with excellent coffee and espresso based drinks these days and Vita is on par with the best.  Capp/latte cannot be improved upon.
The standout for me is their iced coffee which I have to say is the best I've ever had. Uncommon depth of flavor, strong but not acidic at all. Similar to Kyoto style; hard to believe they get this kind of flavor from just extended steeping. Delicious and worth going out of the way for."

46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2013-05-28,4.0,"Call me a snob, but finding great coffee in NYC isn't the easiest task. Sure you can sip your comforts at Dunkin Donuts, but it's more of a nostalgic caffeinated taste than a quality cup of Joe. But this here Caffé Vita does it up right. They fresh roast their beans right in the store (which happens to be like, 120 square feet total), so you know what you're drinking is darn near as fresh as you can possibly get. Their espresso drinks are top notch, and the staff is super friendly as well.

If you're in LES, be sure to bookmark this ish."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2013-05-20,5.0,"And my Caffe Vita high continues as I payed a visit to this LES location today. 

Just as good as in LA.

My favorite cold brew in all of NYC by far. 

I am smitten. 

On my way there, out of nowhere, they followed me on twitter then favorited and responded to tweets. 

I am now in love. 

Marry me??"
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2014-03-27,3.0,"Super tiny cafe with barely enough room to line up, but the staff is nice. I came here on the recommendation of a friend who says that CV is her favorite cafe in Seattle. I stopped by to buy some beans (Queen City roasted in Seattle just 4 days prior) and for some coffee. The beans were $16, but they threw in the French press coffee for free. The FP coffee itself wasn't that good. I got the butt-end of one of the thermoses, but hey, it was free. The beans are delicious though."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2017-02-12,1.0,Bad experience here. The barista was not very nice. She seemed annoyed at any question you had. As for the coffee. I asked for a cappuccino and asked if they had different sizes or was it just one. She told me I could get a large and proceeded to make me a small cappuccino in a large cup just filling it with extra milk. It was not good. Go to Coffee Project NY if you want great service and coffee.
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2015-07-15,4.0,"This espresso was indeed amazing, Abrocos is my favorite place, but now this place comes second.
This espresso had one of the thickest foam i've probably ever had.
The taste was extremely deep and rich. After taste acidic but amazing.
Also, this shot is pretty strong, but seriously one of my favorite.
My girlfriend had a latte and loved how dark it was.
I'm definitely coming back to this place..."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2015-05-10,5.0,"Good lawd. Rarely in all my excursions do I encounter truly fine, smoother than silk espressos/lattes. Vita easily landed in my top three with just one visit (the others being in Seattle, so of course this Seattle based caffe would be fantastic). 

This is the type of coffee that I crave - not meant to be hurried, it is for sipping and savoring. Truly a delight from the moment the first sip that hits your lips to the last. The flavor tantalizes the tastebuds. 

Service is casual, friendly, sincere. An all around outstanding experience, and I'm thrilled to have a new favorite/go-to in the city!"
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2018-06-03,1.0,"Go here if you want rude service. The coffee was unremarkable. The shop is very small, with no sitting room. The only plus is the clean restroom. And don't ask the hip barista for ""flavors"" in your coffee, it will elicit and eye roll and a sneering response of ""we don't have flavors"". Id rather spend my money on corporate coffee."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2017-07-13,5.0,"Went to this charming hole in the wall on the LES after dinner. Ordered the latte and it was perfectly made. Milk was steamed at the proper temp and texture, and the espresso cut though just enough.  Definitely will return soon. They serve espresso with a glass of sparkling water, as it should be!"
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2016-04-30,5.0,"Cute little place. Very calm and relaxed. Baristas are very nice and helpful. You don't get that rushed, busy feeling like you do in other coffee shops (i.e. Starbucks). 

Only downside is that there isn't a lot of sitting room. No tables and only about 4 or 5 stools. So don't plan on making this your place to meet up with a large group to sit around and chat. There is some space to stand outside with some ledges for drinks/ snacks."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2012-12-15,5.0,"Seriously some of the best coffee in NYC. 

For out-of-towners tired of the absurd attitude you get at a lot of retail establishments in New York, this place not only offers a refreshingly flavorful cup of coffee, but also terrific service. 

During our recent quick trip, staying in the LES, we hit Vita up two days in a row. Both days they were clearly freshly roasting their own beans, and both days the service was honest and friendly. They play great music and the coffee is amazing. My sot of espresso this morning immediately took my back to my travels in Italy.

Highly recommend to both locals and out-of-towners!"
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2017-02-09,5.0,"Frequented their location(s) in LA, and now I shall frequent this in NY. Baristas were hella informative, and definitely know what they're talking about. I generally drink my coffee and my cold brew black, so suffice to say I ordered the latter. However, I saw a sign for their Tokyo cold brew which piqued my interest. Lawd. Let me tell you: that sh** is powerful. The taste was strong, rich, and bold, yet you can still taste it's origins and its characters. Coffee connoisseur would be too prestigious of a title, however I am a fellow barista (hi new friends!), and I def know when coffee is doodoo. But this, this sh** (no pun intended) is the opposite of that. Can't wait to have another cup o joe from this dope spot."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2014-11-10,4.0,"Discovered this place by accident, but I'm glad I did. The place itself is really charming.

We were there in the early evening of a Sunday. When we walked in, we were the only ones in there. Not a bad thing as the place is small and not meant to accommodate  crowds. But we decided to have our drinks to stay and sat at the few stools there are in the front by the window. It's cozy and not really a drinking-in place, but it worked out for the two of us. 

As we drank our beverages, tons of people came in and out. I was surprised, but glad that people were patroning this place even at odd times (Sunday evening coffee?).

We got one cappuccino and one pacnor (which is there version of a cortado). They make their pacnor with whole milk and add a splash of cream to make it richer. I always take my cortados with all cream, so I didn't try it there way. The cortado was delicious. Cortados are so hit or miss at places because you can really taste the quality of the beans from the espresso. Sometimes it's burnt and bitter and there isn't much milk to hide the flaws as with a latte or a cappuccino. This one was great, not bitter at all, and served in a really charming glass.

The cappuccino was shorter than most are, so it tasted stronger than normal. But everything is good quality and they grind their own beans. They have a roaster on site.

They have a few pastries as well if you want a little snack. But I wouldn't go here to chat or hand out with friends - no room. And no bathroom in case you're wondering, either."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2015-08-05,4.0,"Great place to start the day with an excellent coffee. This place has a buzz about it in look, sound and coffee.

Cheery service and good turnaround time in preparation. Macchiato was stunning. Lovely silky coffee with dense and generous foam. All three of us gave this place the big tick."
46,caffe-vita-lower-east-side-new-york,2017-04-01,5.0,Best coffee spot in the LES. Check the O.R. You like it so far?
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-03-20,5.0,"Make room, coffee. It's tea's time to shine!

We've had bubble tea for ages, but Whistle & Fizz takes tea to a whole new level. The employees are so friendly, and you can tell they're really passionate about what they do. On my first visit, they let me sample several flavors, and explained the differences between carbonated and nitrogen teas. The first is the larger bubble variety, kind of like soda, while the latter produces smaller bubbles that foam, a bit like beer, to create a smooth, slightly milky texture minus the actual dairy component. Essentially, nitrogen teas have more of a low hum in your mouth, while carbonated teas create that snap, crackle, and pop feeling that most people are used to. So cool and interesting, and I've learned I'm definitely a bigger nitrogen tea fan.

Their cold teas are so refreshing. I've tried them all, and my favorite one's the nitro mango tea. I have to admit, though... the cold brew lemonade is a pleasant surprise of a drink considering I don't like coffee. The combination is a perfect blend of bitter and sweet. A similar thing can be said for most of their drinks. They add just enough sweetness to balance things out, which really enhances the actual tea flavor itself.

Their hot milk teas are equally amazing and perfect for winter. The hazelnut orange milk tea feels like a warm hug, and I'm a huge fan of the black gold milk tea. I always get it with oat milk and occasionally tapioca. It's wonderful.

The prices feel a little steep at $5-7 for a drink, but I've been saying that about everything in New York City lately. Either way, so glad to see this place doing fun and inventive things with tea."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-03-02,4.0,"I have been to this location a few times and I stop by often. I ordered the salted caramel latte and loved it. I usually get the bubble teas but, decided to mix it up today. I do like my drinks very sweet and the barista was very accommodating. I love how friendly the staff was. Every customer was treated with respect and kindness.

On my recent visit, I noticed they start charging for tastings. I think on my very first visit when the store first opened, they offered everyone to taste anything off the menu and anything they were working on. I remember one time, they were working on something really delicious but, unfortunately, because it was a prototype I wasn't able to buy it. However, they offer a flight with a full-size drink included for $14 (I believe). Be sure to check the hours before coming because they have summer and winter hours."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-02-29,5.0,"This is one of my favorite coffee places because they also bubble tea and vegan-friendly muffins! I heard about it through the Crave app because they offer a free drip coffee as a voucher. 

It's super cute and cozy inside so be sure to bring friends when you go. The prices are great, and plus, everyone who works there is super friendly! The best part is that they distinguish themselves from other bubble tea places in the city by offering nitro & fizz options. 

My only suggestion would be for them to offer a stevia sweetener option! And I'd also love to see them be a part of the FoodForAll app &/or YourLocal community to prevent food waste."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-27,4.0,"Whistle & Fizz has completely blown every other coffee & tea shop out of the water. Let me just say that I almost NEVER buy anything at coffee/cafes/boba shops unless I am compelled to by friends/co-workers. Shoutout to Yelp for sponsoring my first drink here. You've convinced me to come back here in the near future.

The service here is unbelievable. I came here with my friend on Sunday afternoon, and the barista allowed us to sample a variety of different drinks. Both of us got the jasmine nitro (hot) milk tea with boba, almond milk, and 50% sugar. The 'whistle' and 'fizz' options are all cold drinks. They also serve classic coffee beverages.

They have a few small tables; not the best place for large groups. Also no bathroom! The barista pointed me to the Chipotle afterwards lol"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-02-01,5.0,"There are few places that have both solid coffee and boba and this is one of them!

I had the nitro mango tea with boba and it was one of the best mango teas I've had. It was a tad sweet in the house format but still a solid drink. The boba was average with a harder chewy texture than soft honey boba.  

The iced coffee was surprisingly smooth for a regular iced coffee. They offer liquid sugar options which is great for iced drinks. 

The Nutella latte was indeed nothing like any other Nutella latte I've ordered but I wouldn't say it's my favorite because it lacked the hazelnut nutty taste. It reminded me of Nutella chocolate cookies as the chocolate wasn't too strong either in a good way. Overall I think it captured the essence of Nutella. 

I will definitely come back and think it's a great place to study or meet with friends. I want to try the yuzu mint tea and salted caramel latte next time!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-24,5.0,"The Quick: this place rocks! Super inventive ways to get my caffeine fix.  They use real juices and flavors in their inventive tea combinations.

The Details: Ping is the man! Super friendly staff, awesome location near Washington Square pak. Highly recommend if you're in the area. Very peaceful and great fast wifi (always important). Plenty of vegan options - oat milk! Cold brew lemonade - a must try. Nitro mango- dairy free yet super creamy goodness. The decaf dark chocolate Latte- out of control good.

The Damage: $4-$5 for the fancy Lattes. Cheaper and more original than Starbucks. Ask about their loyalty program foe free drinks!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-21,5.0,"I love this place! It's a cute little coffee shop located near NYU. I walked in on Saturday during the snow storm, and was greeted by a warm, cozy and inviting atmosphere. 

The staff was very friendly, patient and welcoming. They patiently answered all of my questions about the drinks, and even let me try a few of the fizzes. 

I ended up ordering the roasted chestnut black tea. The staff member who recommended it told me it tastes like Christmas, and she was right. I had it with sugar and half and half and it was delicious. The flavor was complex and comforting. It tasted like a good quality black tea, with an apparent note of roasted chestnuts, but it did not taste artificial. 

I particularly appreciated two more things about this place: first, that there were tea samples that you could smell before making your choice, and second, that they did not foist just paper (or plastic) straws upon you, but that you had a choice between the two. 

If you like good tea, excellent service and a warm, cozy atmosphere, this place is for you."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-16,5.0,"If you want to be happy, go to whistle and fizz for that cold OR hot drink. I had the privilege of meeting Kevin this time around and really enjoyed his passion for the drinks they make. 

My hot drink choice of the day: hazelnut orange milk tea with condensed OAT milk and tapioca

Yes, you heard me right, they gave condensed oat milk! 

They also have tinkered with their flavors to bring out more flavor profiles without overwhelming your taste buds with sugar.

Whistle and Fizz is basically what happens when passionfruit slush boba grows up and is ready to move out of their parents home and pay their own rent somewhere -- maybe even pay their own cell phone bill!

You get the some of the same kinds of drinks as you might at gongcha, Kung Fu Tea or coco, but the flavors reflect more thoughtful and complex use of the ingredients, like the ways they infuse actual grapefruit or apple into their drinks. 

In other words, the Grapefruit Fizz is not your teenager drink. It has gone to college. It has experienced the ups and downs of friendships. It has loved and lost and found the courage to try again. It has a story to tell."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-27,4.0,"Came here as a part of the Yelp Elite event to try any of their one hot beverage for free.

While I was there, I got to try the iced mango tea sample and it was really good. A little too sweet but they told me that it is possible to adjust the sweetness to match our preference.

For my hot beverage, I got the Black tea with no sweetness. It was average but the mango tea is definitely the way to go!

They serve tea flights and I definitely would like to go back to try that."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-16,5.0,"I LOVE WHISTLE & FIZZ. They have such an innovative approach to drinks and they're always striving to make their drinks better. I suggest you try their Flight Club to taste and learn more about the different drinks they have and hear what the employees have to say-- they're extremely passionate and knowledgeable about their drinks and how they make it. 

My favorites are their nitro black gold (latte), nitro mango, green apple fizz, grapefruit fizz, and yuzu mint fizz. I tend to prefer the fizz (slightly carbonated drinks). They even allow you to add toppings such as jelly and tapioca to make their drinks more delectable. Their cold brew & lemonade fizz is extremely unique and I would've never thought to pair those together but it works. 

I absolutely love the vibe this place provides. Great for studying, doing work, or just hanging out (in small parties due to limited seats and a small space). Only downside is that there's no restroom here for customers, but I can overlook that because this place has delicious drinks (I guess don't drink too much before you need to look for a bathroom). I hope they eventually offer more food options as well. As of right now, I see that they mostly only serve pastries. 

I'm a huge fan and I really hope they expand and open more shops within NYC!!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-14,5.0,"Whistle & Fizz is a hidden spot around NYU and Washington Square Park and it definitely is worth a visit. The interior decor is modern, trendy and instagrammable with industrial style wall and blue neon light. 

The staff was friendly and passionate with their drink, served and introduced us with samples. We were impressed by their nitro collection especially the lemonade cold brew which was refreshing to start a day. We also had their Nutella latte which was also delicious but it would be perfect if it had a stronger Nutella flavor. 

We would like to try their sesame latte, which is caffeine free, next time. We didn't have it today since we needed caffeine in the morning."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-20,5.0,"Very cool place for a fruity drink! I sampled the nitro mango, cold brew + lemonade fizz, grapefruit fizz, and green apple fizz. To my surprise, the nitro mango was my favorite, perhaps because of its flavor resemblance to bubble tea. I look forward to coming again and try the other flavors!

For my main drink I ordered the nutella latte and I thought it was good. They were to adjust it to make it less sweet. 

Overall a cool place with nice staff. Can't wait to come back!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-27,5.0,"One of my favorite drink spots near the NYU campus. I've come here probably too many times at this point and have tried many of their drinks and specialties, and I am finally writing my review.

Some of my favorite drinks include: Lavender Fizz, Chai Latte, Matcha Latte, Hazelnut Orange Milk Tea, and the Black Gold Milk Tea. I usually get my drinks with Almond milk/Oat milk, and I like the drinks less sweet. The flavors they have for their milk teas, especially, are super unique. The Black Gold milk tea is so smooth and flavorful, and the Hazelnut orange is really an interesting mix that works surprisingly well! I really enjoyed it more than I thought I would. The Fizz drinks are lightly sweet and so refreshing, though I usually only get those when the weather is warmer. 

The staff, as other Yelpers have mentioned, are super cool and are always so nice with helping people understand different drinks on the menu. 

Now that a new school semester has officially started, I will be back much more. I look forward to seeing what new drinks and flavors they bring out!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-20,4.0,"Whistle & Fizz is a very fitting name for the place! You can hear the whistle when they make your coffee or see the fizz when they pour your tea on tap! The staff was really welcoming and was more than happy to break down the menu for me.

I got to sample the Mango Nitro and the Cold Brew Lemonade as they've been crowd favorites. The Mango Nitro was refreshing and would be the perfect summer drink! The Cold Brew Lemonade tasted just like it's name...creamy with a slight hint of lemon. 

I ended up ordering the seasonal Black Sesame Latte with Skim Milk and Tapioca. The warm, nutty latte was just perfect on a snowy day in NYC. The latte was caffeine free and although it came sweetened, it wasn't too sweet, which I liked. It's the perfect drink when you want to indulge but without all the guilt of a bubble tea drink!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-19,4.0,"A unique concept focusing on nitro coffee, tea, and carbonation, Whistle & Fizz infuses both quality with creativity into the drinks they make. The employee at the front was very welcoming and friendly, as I stepped up to peruse the menu, and he was eager to break down their menus and answer any questions I had.

I went with the Black Gold Milk tea with tapioca as my complimentary Yelp Elite drink of choice. To be frank, while the milk tea was not quite what I expected in terms of flavor, I really appreciated the finesse and innovation behind the Black Gold brew (described as a black tea with a floral hint). While it was not overpowering, I'm afraid the flowery taste wasn't to my liking, at least not for Milk Tea. It reminded me a bit of Oolong tea, but perhaps more rose-y tasting. The tapioca pearls also fell a bit short of expectations, being a bit more chewy and less 'bouncy' and sweet than what I am used to.

As I thought I would walk away slightly disappointed, I was pleasantly delighted after sampling the Nitro Lemonade and regular Black Gold Nitro cold brew with a dash of brown sugar syrup, both from the ""Whistle"" and ""Fizz"" menus. The fizzy Nitro brews tasted crisp and clean, with a light sweetness. As the shop came near closing time, one of the employees was nice enough to give away their leftover baked goods to any customers still in the shop. Really enjoyed the cute bear-shaped chocolate-chip madeleine.

Although I wouldn't come here necessarily for a milk tea fix, I would definitely return for more of the fizzy nitro drinks, as well as the Black Sesame Latte they had described so tantalizingly. Well done, Whistle and Fizz, you have my approval :)"

Tucked away on Greene Street, this cafe is the perfect haven for studying or chilling with friends. I saw a lot of students studying for exams on a Saturday at the cafe. 

I ordered a Green Apple Fizz with lychee jelly. It was really refreshing and reminded me a lot of soda/seltzer. 

One of the baristas was sooo nice and was offering free boba drinks to people at the shop. I didn't get one but he told me I could get a free pastry on the house. Talk about awesome! 

If you're interested, they also have flight sampler!

I will definitely come back again so I can try more of their delicious drinks."

I've been here a few times now and have never had an issue grabbing a table. They have a couple of tables and also a few seats at the counter. The baristas are all very friendly as well."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-22,4.0,"Tldr: welcoming service, great location, free wifi, but slightly underwhelming black sesame latte

I made a pit stop here on my morning commute and tried their black sesame latte with regular milk (part of the Yelp Elite event). The drink itself is un caffeinated which makes it a lovely dessert-ish drink (at 10am in the morning!) The latte has a great sesame flavor which was pronounced at the get go. However, it became muddled by the milk as I drank more. It's a seasonal drink and a unique flavor, but not one I'd go back for.

The barista was very nice and offered me samples from their whistle and fizz menu. Unfortunately, I was running late and couldn't take them up on the offer. I definitely have to come back and try the mango nitro at some point though, it sounds delightful.

The shop itself is tucked away right next to Washington Square park, and it was mostly empty when I got there. I wish they had later hours, because the only thing keeping me from coming here more is the fact they close at 5pm. They also have a loyalty program and offer 10% off to NYU students (with id)! There's bar seating a some tables and the cafe also offers wifi. (See picture)"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-03-09,5.0,"I've been here many times so I'm surprised I haven't written a Yelp review for this place.  My favorite drinks are the iced yuzu mint fizz and the hot matcha latte.  What I like is that all the drinks are customizable with the sugar level and the type of milk.  Also, all the drinks are made with real tea leaves.  One time, I actually left my business card in the box to win a free tasting.  I won a free tasting for me and 10 friends which was cool.  We came here on a Monday night after work.  Jin was very nice and let us sample every drink including drinks in development like nitro Hong Kong milk tea.  I ordered one of their seasonal specialties, a black sesame latte. It had a strong nutty flavor and not too sweet.  I'll definitely be back."

I tried Lavender frizz, mango nitro frizz, red berry nitro frizz and lemonade brew and they were all amazing. They are like super tasty sparking tea full of favor. Red berry wasn't sweet but they said you can ask to sweeten it. However for people who doesn't want extra sugar, it was tasty. Mango one was so tasty like dessert. I feel like these drinks are so unique and will be so refreshing once the weather gets warmer. 

I had golden black milk tea hot and that was also amazing. Just right amount of sweet and the floral smell of the tea was great for the winter weather. I still can remember the taste and would go back again winter and summer. Everyone was so nice and they filled my reusable cup which is a plus! Check them out and try their unique selections. Many options for both coffee drinker and tea drinker. I don't drink as much coffee anymore and my tea options were always limited but it was not an issue here."

You can tell they everyone that works there cares and are extremely nice. The drinks are around $5 and there's WiFi. It's very clean and there's a small amount of seating.

I tried 8 different draft teas, and some of my favorites were: mango green (sweetened), black gold (unsweetened), Apple fizz (sweetened), and lemonade? it tasted like yuzu (sweetened). The nitrogen made it extra creamy, especially the mango green, w/o any milk added.

I also ordered a jasmine tea with oat milk (hot) and next time I'd get it less sweetened but overall pretty good.

Also love that this place is a bit hidden from the main street (Broadway)."

The two people in there were nice and welcoming. The woman offered me to sample their cold brew + lemonade fizz and their nitro mango ... both of which were on tap... how cool!! 
They were both really refreshing and I def want to come back in the summer to order one of their nitro or fizz drinks. Loved how it was all on tap. 
I got the Nutella latte with almond milk and it really hit the spot!! It wasn't too sweet, it was actually perfect. 
Also their season drinks looked super yummy... might have to go back sooner than later to try that black sesame latte ! 
This is a great spot to grab a drink then head to Washington Square Park to sit and do some people watching. They also have a few tables inside if you decide to sit inside."

The nice server even let me try a few samples. The nitro mango drink was something else! The carbonation affect was really something unique, and i would definetely come back for this on a warmer day! 

The cold brew lemonade was also an experience, perfect for a hot day, when looking for a coffee, and avoiding milk! Overall cute spot, with great friendly service which is refreshing for nyc. The workers were very educated in the process and production of these unique drinks!

Will definetely be back to try their other delicious menu options!"

Staff was knowledgable, explained how the drinks are made, and allowed my friend and I to sample most of the menu. Some of my favorites were the Cold brew lemonade (not overly sweet), Yuzu mint lemonade (very refreshing), green apple (like a green jolly rancher) and mango jasmine. Honestly, they were all delicious!

You also have the option of adding bubbles to your drink. Great if you're in the area and want to try something unique! Will be back!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-02-18,3.0,"Came here on a rainy afternoon, and it was pretty busy. The menu is pretty extensive, with things from milk tea to interesting lattes. I appreciate that they indicate which items are caffeine free/available hot or cold. 

I'm not sure if this menu item usually tastes like this, but the hot sesame latte literally tasted like moldy food/smelled like gym clothes left in a bag for too long. The aftertaste was okay, but the initial taste was definitely sour. I've had other black sesame flavored items, and this really didn't taste right... I'm not sure if the milk had gone bad?

There's a few tables, but if you're planning on coming here to catch up with someone/for a coffee chat, it can definitely get quite loud. NYU students do get a discount, but honestly would recommend Boba Guys or Kung Fu over this."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-04-22,5.0,"Whistle & Fizz captured my attention through a Yelp elite event and I was able to try the Nitro Mango drink. If you are visiting for the first time and you are a tea lover, I highly recommend trying the flight experience! You get to sample the whistle & fizz flavors ranging from their staples on the menu and any new and innovative flavors they are working on. It was a cool and informative experience. The flight experience also includes a choice of a full size cup of the drink of your choice, you can even personalize it like we did with a combination of nitro flavors! They also value your opinion and feedback and if there's any recommendations on flavors. They are all about being innovative and this is place heaven for me, since I am a big fan of tea. The staff were nice, accommodating, and passionate about the science of their drinks. They also have an array selection of loose leaf hot tea, bubble tea, espresso drinks, and pastries. Location is convenient and short walk to Washington Square Park. It's a small space so it could be easy to miss but they have a visible sign right in front of their entrance. I'm very fond of Whistle & Fizz and their innovation, there's simply not enough cafes/bars dedicated to teas in the city!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-09-30,5.0,"Came here on the recommendation of a friend. They have something called a cold brew lemonade that I've never seen before. After some coaxing from a staff member (sounded disgusting to me - it's actually cold brew coffee + lemonade), I got it and it was absolutely delicious. The coffee was what you expect it to be, but it was a little fizzy and the lemonade added this refreshing burst. 

I usually drink my coffee black, and this wasn't overly sweet to me. It was perfect. 

Shop is pretty small - maybe seats like 10. The staff is super friendly and talkative. I've tried a few other of their drinks but the cold brew lemonade is by far the most interesting / best thing on their menu. 

The nitrogen adds a nice sweetness to some of the teas, and you can't really go wrong with anything you get here! Would stop by if I'm in the area again!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-23,5.0,"This is my new favorite cafe! 

The staff here are SO nice and really knowledgeable about their product. I love, love the idea of fizzy teas and coffees! It's also an extra plus that their cold brew drinks are Stumptown coffee - my absolute favorite roaster. 

Their cold brew lemonade is made all in-house with homemade/squeezed lemonade. It is one of the best things I have ever drank before in my life. 

I also really enjoyed their Yuzu Mint Tea and I love how refreshing it is. I can't wait to come back in the summer and just drink the heck out of this. 

Honestly, COME HERE."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-09-12,5.0,"I love the concept of this place! The nitrogen infused drinks are an interesting and unique concept for me; they add a creaminess and a carbonated/bubbly consistency at the same time.

I really enjoyed the sparkling green apple with the apple purée the nitro mango tea. I have a sweet tooth so the sparkling yuzu lemonade mint wasn't a good fit for me.

My favorite was the orange hazelnut bubble tea! I just think that flavor pairing is so incredibly unique and nuanced, I've never seen or come across it before."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-08-04,5.0,"In a world full of tea and coffee spots how do Whistle & Fizz stand out and set themselves apart from the rest? ... The answer lies in right in their name.

Their ""Whistle"" drinks refer to the drinks they offer that are infused using nitrogen, that gives the drinks a smooth, thick, and creamy texture, while their ""Fizz"" drinks refer to drinks that they offer that are infused with CO² (carbon dioxide) that gives the drinks a fizzy texture like seltzer or soda. In addition, their signature teas and coffee come out of a tap just like at a bar, and overall, this place just has a swanky vibe, unlike other tea or coffee place I've ever been to; moreover, This cute, cozy little spot that sits right outside Washington Square Park, is quickly becoming popular for their unique twists on two of everybody's favorite drinks.

I was able to sample a little of everything they had to offer from the tap and although they were all pretty tasty two drinks really stood out to me. One was the ""Cold Brew Lemonade"" which is a mixture of iced black coffee and fizzy lemonade. It was a nice little twist on two classic drinks that you wouldn't think to put together. Sweet yet strong, I really dug it. The other was the Nitrogen Mango Tea with was a nice smooth take on one of my favorite tea flavors, so I ended up ordering a large size of it and added lychee jelly.  It made for a nice refreshing drink on a hot summer morning. 

It should also be noted that the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful throughout my experience. I can't wait for the next time I come here so I can get a full size of that cold brew lemonade."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-08-04,5.0,"Call me British because damn I like tea. I'm basically like prince harry but like have a soul. Shoutout to my main dudes Jin and Ken. They really know their tea and shit. Also mad funny. 

Ok here's the deal. It looks like a coffee shop bar. It's got a cool vibe. Like as cool as NYU thinks they are (but let's be honest NYU ain't shit). They got bubble tea but like bub tea is 2014 so try to keep up yelpers. The trend things to get are the nitro teas so you can tell all your friends about how it's the only way to drink tea because of the smooth texture. Or the lemonade cold brew which shouldn't work but I swear the devil made this shit because it works and is my new vice. 

Anyway that's the T (dad puns are life you're welcome)."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-08-06,5.0,"Thank you Yelp for a wonderful opportunity to try this shop.

I arrived around 5 PM on a Sunday night and let the people up front know that even though the store is famous for their caffeinated drinks I didn't really drink caffeine and they were very accommodating. 

First, one of the workers gave me a handful of samples to try. I  ended up choosing the yuzu lemonade mint tea and it was such a great choice for such a hot day. The drink was refreshing and a delicious accomplishment to escape the heat. 

Additionally, the aesthetic and the service are also great and really added to the experience. 

All in all, a great place for both caffeinated and non caffeinated drink patrons to check out!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-07-26,5.0,"My first job ever when I moved to NYC involved going around to various independently-owned cafés and coffee shops, meeting and getting to know the owners and their product lines. 

Suffice it to say, I now know a good one when I see one. Whistle & Fizz is the real deal. It's situated on a sort of unassuming block on Greene street convenient to NYU. I love that it's tea-centric (but still offers a full line of espresso options for all you addicts). The store itself is immaculate, and the decor is casual and hipster without being too hipster... if that's a thing. A note that there are no restrooms available, so plan accordingly.

I really wasn't sure what to expect, but Whistle & Fizz caters to all seasons. The fact that you can get hot tea, iced tea, sparkling tea, and anything in between -- is pretty great. They will customize according to sugar content (and lactose intolerance, I might add), and you can get lychee jelly or tapioca pearls in your drinks. The owners are passionate about experimentation and are the perfect blend of laid-back and eager to show you what they are working on. The tea tasting was fun, informative, and didn't feel rushed. I was able to pick my favorite (the mango) after a thorough tasting. I loved the yuzu mint lemonade and the grapefruit teas as well. 

For the people who want creamier options, there is oat milk available! Hurrah!

I love supporting local businesses, so this will be on my list. The staff was all super friendly and humorous, which I enjoy."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-07-16,5.0,"Yesss, NYU finally gets a local little cafe with some character. Move over, Starbucks, Stumptown, and Think Coffee. Thank the Greenwich Village gods and goddesses. 

- wide variety of teas and coffees, from shaken to iced to hot to sparkling to decaffeinated to loose leaf 
- smoothest almond milk latte I've had in a while
- passionate staff who will go above and beyond to educate you on their flavorful product and provide samples
- groundbreaking concept of nitrogen in their teas to make it feel smoother. It's a whole thing here. You want to give it a go. 
- you ever heard of cold brew lemonade? Me, neither. They've got it! And they'll let you try it. It's what they're known for, and it's weird. Good weird. 
- seats with outlets next to them. 

Unique spot! I'll be coming back over and over and over again."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-27,5.0,"I have to admit that I was a little skeptical about trying the fan-favorite ""Cold Brew Lemonade Fizz"" but I was pleasantly surprised!

First, I was impressed with the array of options on the menu. There were so many delicious sounding options! From the lavender butterfly fizz to the black gold milk tea but I decided to stick to what I came to try. 

I was greeted by a very friendly cashier/ barista who was pleased to have me try the cold brew lemonade fizz. The two flavors worked surprisingly well and I am sure it would be even more refreshing and tasty on a hot summer day.

The cafe itself is also warm and inviting and seemed like a good place to sit, work, and nurse a drink for a while. I will definitely be turning next time I am in the area!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-26,5.0,"This is NOT your usual coffee shop. 

This has a bit of everything and extra. It has the basics and items I'd never seen before at a coffee shop. 

I had a taste of the nitro mango and I could guzzle this all day. It goes down smooooothhhh and it's not too sweet. 

I also had a taste of the lavender fizz and would definitely recommend this. It's hard to have a floral taste not taste similar to soap but they did it! I don't know how! It may be magic! If you're unsure and want to try them all (like I was) you could get the flight which lets you try everything they have on tap. 

Last point...The seasonal drink, black sesame latte, was TO DIE FOR. I would try it first to see if you like it because I grew up eating something very similar to this so it was partly nostalgic and partly velvety nectar of the Buddha. w"

Because I really need to congratulate the inventor of this new addictive drink and hope that she/he never stops bringing their creativity to life! The world needs more cold brew lemonade kind of people. 

Also the girls at the counter at whistle and fizz are the best! Explained the whole process, all the available flavors and gave me all the samples possible before I made a drink decision. 

Will be back for another fix and for the yuzu mint lemonade which was awesome too! A very close second choice."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-09-08,5.0,"I came upon this location looking for a coffee shop with WiFi. It's a trendy place that injects carbonation into tea/coffee. 

I got the yuzu/mint lemonade. There was the perfect amount of pulp in there. Perfect summer drink. The WiFi is fast--I watched Netflix while I drank my tea. 

The customer service here is welcoming! Everyone had a big smile on their face! Rare in nyc I think..."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-10-25,4.0,"Whistle & Fizz has the best parts of a Starbucks Reserve and an artisan bubble tea place combined. 

I stopped in with a friend during a weekday lunch. There was no line, with just a few people in the store at the (limited) seats. There were two seasonal offerings on the day that we stopped in -- a pumpkin spice latte, and a black sesame latte. I tried the black sesame latte with almond milk, and got it iced with boba. My friend got a more traditional jasmine milk tea, but with oat milk, and also iced with boba. 

The black sesame drink was absolutely delicious, and I had never tasted anything like it. It was rich and nutty, but wasn't overly sweet. It tasted like black sesame ice cream that had effectively been made into a less-sweet drink. The black sesame latte was caffeine-free, but would have been delicious with an espresso shot poured in. The jasmine milk tea was a bit more standard, but was wonderfully floral, and had the perfect amount of sweetness. 

I am looking forward to coming back to try some of the fizz drinks and the lemonade nitro cold brew."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-07-20,5.0,"Whistle and Fizz sets itself apart from the rest of the crowd with its Nitro and Carbonated drinks, but what really pushes this place to excellence is its service. At the point of this review, Whistle and Fizz has been open for roughly 2 months. 

Coming here for the first time on a hot summer day, I really wasn't sure what to expect drink-wise. If I'm around this area, I usually pop over to Boba Guys for my thirst quencher, so I was pleasantly surprised that this place stands toe to toe with the best. 

Upon entering, you're greeted with a mixture of your typical cafe seating arrangement, as well as a bar area next to their taps. During my visit, the owner was gracious enough to walk me through each of their drinks, as well as give me a sample! To say that service was pretty good here is an extreme understatement. 

Without getting into each drink, my top 3 flavors at Whistle & Fizz are the: Lemonade Cold Brew (carbonated), Grapefruit Tea (carbonated), and Mango Tea (nitro). So far, I really have yet to come across a tea shop that serves nitro drinks. The nitrogen gives the drinks a smooth and creamy texture that complements the various tea leaves that Whistle and Fizz uses. 

I'm glad that I came across Whistle & Fizz, because now I can add another go-to spot when I'm around NYU/Astor Place. Don't leave without trying their Nitro drinks. You won't be disappointed."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-30,4.0,Came across this place on the crave app so I gave it a try.  I asked them what their best drink was on the menu & was told to try the Nitro mango tea. It was something I never had before since it was a creamy like tea infused with nitro bubbles. Glad I got to try it. The spot it self is super cute. A nice lil ambiance to chill at with your laptop  or friends. I definitely plan to stop by to try more  items from the menu!
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-08-13,5.0,"I came to check this place out last month and this place is going to my new favorite drink place every time I'm back in town now. Great selection of nitro brewed tea. Creative and bold flavor combinations. 

My friend and I got to meet the owner and he is a really friendly good dude. He let us sample couple of flavors before we got to pick the one we wanted. I would highly recommend trying to Yuzu lemonade and the Cold Brew lemonade. 

This place is going to be the spot to know about. I can already tell all the NYU kids are going to pack this place for their tasty carbonated drinks."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-27,3.0,"I ordered a Hazelnut and Orange Nitro Milk Tea, which I received courtesy of Yelp.

The flavor combination was divine! However, I was not aware of how over-sweetened it'd be. If I were given a warning, I would ordered it to be half-, or even unsweetened.

Based on how far it is from the places I frequent in the city, I don't see myself coming back here soon. It is a cute little cafe if you are in the mood to try flavorful drinks!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-08-06,5.0,"Wow I am definitelyyyyy going back soon! I was looking for a coffee place in the area and saw this pop up on yelp. Walking in the interior was clean and modern, and the staff greeted me immediately. I wasn't sure what to get so the lady at the front helped me with some suggestions in the specials section. She was so friendly and made me feel really comfortable! She suggested the nutella latte, matcha latte and black and gold latte.

I got the black and gold latte w/ tapioca - super light and creamy all at the same time!

They have so many items that sound really good so I can't wait to go back. And many of them sound pretty unique - want to try the fizz's when I go back."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-26,4.0,"This coffee spot was in a bit of a transition when I visited so several menu items were not available . That said the decor is inviting and the staff is friendly. They serve  Stumptown coffee beans and brew it well and have oat milk, yay! So if you like Stumptown, you'll be happy. I especially loved the nitro teas and the tea fizzes. My one complaint with the fizzes is that I was told they are all mildly sweetened, so if you are avoiding sugar and sweetener they wouldn't be an option for you. Would love it if Whistle & Fizz added an unsweetened fizz option."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-07-23,5.0,"Iced. Sparkling. Cold Brew. Lemonade.
CMONNNN. Yessss!!!!! Why have I never had this drink before??! Totally a fan! So unique and refreshing.

This place is located near Washington Square Park -- kind of unassuming from the outside, but once you step in, you're in quite a welcoming, chill space. My group of 3 walked up to the bar area and were immediately greeted by the staff -- they're so friendly and kind!! We were able to sample the draft drinks and my faves were the cold brew lemonade and the black gold tea (both the unsweetened and sweetened versions! Reminded me of a milk tea but without the milk).

Friendly service, refreshing drinks, and a relaxing space to hang out! Will totally be back for my faves and to try the other drinks as well!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-07-09,5.0,"W&F provides very delicious, refreshing beverages. We had the yuzu lemonade and the passion mango and they were both very delicious. 

The place is very clean and the staff members are incredibly nice and helpful. We shall return."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-07-21,5.0,"Stopping into Whistle & Fizz on a hot day is a genius idea. This little spot is tucked away on a pretty quiet street right around the corner from Washington Square Park. Walking in you'll notice there's plenty of seating to chill and relax.

If I'm being honest with you, each and every flavor was straight up delicious. They earn some brownie points solely for serving Stumptown which (in my opinion) is one of the best cold brews in town. Speaking of cold brew, the cold brew lemonade just works. It's light, refreshing, and marries two flavors that I'd never think of mixing. Absolute genius. It's worth sampling if you're weary of the combo!

You can't go wrong with any of the fruity flavors if you're looking for something on the sweeter side. The mango and grapefruit are both outstanding although the apple is equally as tasty. Kind of reminiscent of a jolly rancher if they were actually made from real fruit. Being the serial indecisive person I am, I was torn between legitimately every option. How can they all be SO good? Ultimately we choose the yuzu lemonade mint tea and the grapefruit fizz.  Both were perfect for cooling down on a hot summer day. 

Aside from the A+ drinks, a stand out for us was how genuine and friendly everyone was. It's clear everything they've done has been thoughtful and intentional which is a sure sign they're going to absolutely kill it. Can't wait to stop in the next time I'm looking to satiate my tea fix in Greenwich."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-09-29,5.0,"I was a little skeptical seeing how this place had 5 stars with 140+ reviews so I had to go try this place. This place is a hidden around the corner near the NYU Boba Guys line. Compared to all the cafes around the area, this one is truly unique and reasonably priced. From your normal brewed teas to fizzy nitro coffee on tap, there is something for everyone. For boba lovers, you can add it to anything too. If you're not sure if you'll like something before you order, you can ask for a sample! 

We got the draft mango tea with lychee and the cold brew + lemonade. Though you can't adjust the sweetness in the tap selections, the tea was soo smooth and perfectly sweetened. The cold brew + lemonade combo was surprisingly refreshing as well. 

I am definitely planning to come back here to try some of their other drinks. With all the new tea shops, this one focuses more on the quality of their drinks rather than the presentation and instagrammable-ness."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-30,4.0,"I was always really intrigued by this place, so being able to visit for a Yelp Elite event gave me the push to travel downtown and order a drink! Not really sure what to expect, the person working at the front desk was extremely friendly and gave some great recommendations (especially since I'm not a big coffee drinker). I ultimately decided on the black sesame latte and could not have been happier with my decision. The drink wasn't extremely sweet which I appreciated, and it had a strong but not overpowering flavor of black sesame.

They have an amazing selection of drinks and I definitely want to come back to try out some of their cold drinks! Even though there isn't much seating, I would love to come back, grab a drink, and take care of some work!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-06-10,5.0,"I heard about their unusually intriguing sparkling cold brew/lemonade drink and had to try it. The staff were super friendly and helpful, and offered free samples. The cold brew/lemonade tastes like an upgraded Arnold Palmer, sweeter with slightly (but pleasantly) bitter notes from the coffee. The carbonation is an extra bonus! If you are looking for a fun, effervescent pick-me-up, you can't go wrong with this drink. It's pretty strong too-- I've been up for about 30 hours and I still feel wired. I confess, I came in with doubts but I have become a whole-hearted convert. 

I also tried their sparking yuzu mint tea, which was equally incredible. The addition of yuzu purée and CO2 made it incredibly light and perfect for the summer. Between the two, I think I'd prefer the yuzu drink but the cold brew is perfect if you need something a little stronger. There are a ton of other drinks available at Whistle + Fizz too. Based on the solid performance of the two I tried today, I will definitely be back to sample the rest (maybe with some friends/prospective converts in tow). 

The cafe is located in the NYU campus area, a couple of blocks away from 8th St-NYU (N/R/W) and Astor Pl (6)."
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-07-27,5.0,"I love this place. Whistle and Fizz truly offers unique alternatives to your regular coffee shop or traditional bubble tea parlor. They offer great drinks that span a spectrum of variety and flavors for all taste buds. When I went, I was not expecting to see this super chic, stylish, lounge that offers some super unique cooling drinks for a hot day. 

I had the mango tea with lychee jelly. It was the perfect amount of sweet and refreshing and was just what I needed on a 100 degree summer day. I also had the fizzy grapefruit tea and that one was surprisingly good as well. It had a nice tart grapefruit flavor, but it was not sour and the fizzyness definitely made it a good compliment to the other flavors. 

Whistle and Fizz probably most advertised the cold brew lemonade and it is definitely not a combo that I'd ever expect but it was also really tasty and an interesting alternative to traditional coffee. 

The owner of the place is super nice and super friendly, and is always willing to answer questions and tell you about the different drinks!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2019-07-25,5.0,"Need a pick-me-up? RUN NOW and get yourself a Whistle (Nitro) & Fizz (Carbonated) drink!

Located near Washington Square Park and NYU, this is definitely a spot you have to come to check it out. The vibe is very hip, inviting, and best of all, plenty of outlets. So whether you need a recharge or just a refreshment, stop on by and grab one of their unique teas. 

COLD BREW + LEMONADE: The perfect marriage~ What do I mean by perfect marriage? They work so well with each other. You get the caffeine kick from the cold brew without that after-grogginess or crash if you are caffeine sensitive because the lemonade brings out such a freshness. Highly recommend and one of my top three favorites!

NITRO MANGO TEA: A mango bomb! They use real mangos here so you get that concentrated real mango flavor, not the artificial syrups you get in some shops. This is on the sweeter side of their drink options, but one of my top three favorites!

FIZZ GRAPEFRUIT TEA: Calpico + Grapefruit! You get that light soda with a bit of tartness from the grapefruit. Refreshing and on the less sweet side. One of my top three favorites!

FIZZ YUZU LEMONADE MINT TEA: Citrusy + Fresh! A very light lemonade with notes of yuzu (Japanese citrus that's almost a cross between grapefruit and lime) and mint. One of the least sweet but fresh drink.

WHISTLE RED BERRIES: Tart + Sweet! It may smell very tart, but the crushed fruits they used add a nice light sweetness to harmonize the tartness. 

FIZZ GREEN APPLE: A trip down memory lane for me! This brings back a lot of memories as a 90s baby of all the sour green apple candies in my childhood. What surprised me the most is that they use REAL green apples! 

Very happy be able to sample their drinks through Yelp Elite Event and meet one of the owners, Ping, who was so passionate about his craft. The ingredients they curate for their teas are the best of the best and all the flavors are naturally created by using real fruits. And they never stop experimenting and creating new flavors every day! I cannot wait to try what they come up with next!"
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-26,5.0,Checked out this coffee/tea shop through Yelp Elite and was very pleased. They were very knowledgeable and provided good recommendations. I enjoyed the Nitro black gold milk tea (I was caffeinated for the rest of the day) and sampled the nitro mango under the whistle menu which I thoroughly enjoyed. Would definitely go back!
47,whistle-and-fizz-new-york-4,2020-01-24,5.0,"Went for the Yelp Elite event and ordered the black sesame mocha which was a seasonal special, it tasted so good! My order was freshly made, there was grind sesame in it. I added a bit of brown sugar to make it sweeter, it turned a little too much sweet for me, but still an excellent drink. While I was waiting for my order I had the opportunity to a sample a couple of their cold drinks, they are most well know for their nitro drinks (the fizz). The drinks are mostly tea based, with fruit accents. I tried the butterfly pea fizz which had a dreamy purple color, made from the butterfly pea plant; the mango fizz might be my favorite one; the cold brew lemonade was lemon accents mixed into cold brew, it tasted weird to me but I suppose some people love the flavor. The barrista was very helpful, she recommended me flavors and checked on me to see if there's as anything else I wanted"

Yuzu Mint Lemonade - This is the best summer drink! Sparkling and refershing, I swear a cup of this will energize you enough to tackle that sticky 95 degree NY humidity.

Nitro Mango - also a delightful flavor, you can't go wrong with Mango.

They have some really cool flavor combos that work really well. They have nitro teas options for that little extra something something. 

I am not a coffee me drinker but I tried a sip of my friends cold brew lemonade. The lemon is comes through as nice subtle undertones. 

I went with the ice matcha with oat milk and  it was delish!

I drink quit slow, so most of the sesame paste goes to the bottom of the cup. So I fee like I'm drinking very thick sesame puree. So make sure you drink fast! And it taste better when it's hot anyway!"
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2019-09-21,5.0,"This is what we need more of in NYC. Quality-focused cafes really bringing it who show that the $5 dollar cup is really worth it. 

We were craving some nice 3rd wave coffee last week when it got a little chilly in the afternoon and stopped in to have a couple of their pour-overs. Talk about having it dialed-in. Wow. 

Beyond that, the baristas were all super knowledgeable and friendly even though there was a line building up because of our pour-over orders ha ha ha. 

I told all my coffee friends about it and apparently I was the only person in the world who didn't already know about Kaigo. Can't wait to check out their other Brooklyn location."
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2019-04-04,4.0,"I found Kaigo Room through Yelp and I'm glad that I did. This place have a few tables, free WiFi, and great choice on music (no restrooms, employees only). 

When I looked at the menu, instantly, The Black Sesame Latte and The Lavender Matcha Latte caught my eye. The barista suggested that I try the Black Sesame so that's what I went with. The Black Sesame was so good!! It was a perfect thickness blended perfectly with all necessary flavors. The taste was so unforgettable that I came back another day to try their Lavender Matcha Latte. Definitely stick with the Black Sesame as the Lavender Matcha was a bit too floral for my liking! Both were good though, but the Black Sesame came out on top!"
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2020-02-29,4.0,I loved the black sesame latte. Black sesame with espresso and milk or your choice. My friends loved the americano and cortado. Cozy little place without much seating but very well done coffee. Will be back to try more.
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2019-03-02,3.0,"Good - The turmeric latte was delish. I basically guzzled it down and wanted 3 more. 
Bad - Ambiance wise, it's kind of an awkward place to be at if you want to get work done. The music was kinda odd - the playlist kept skipping, I don't know... It was also freezing inside, so I didn't really want to be there. But the worst thing, no bathroom!! Wtf.. I've blasted coffeeshops for this before, but I feel like it's such a bummer to sell people diuretics and not give them a toilet. 
I might come back but it'll be to-go. 
Side-note:  Canal Street market (which I discovered after coming to Kaigo because they were apparently the closest bathroom) is a pretty fun spot and just around the corner."
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2019-03-06,3.0,"Nice little spot... very clean. 

I had the americano... I was made well. 

There are a few seats- looks like a nice place to do work.

Especially in the spring/summer because of the huge windows.

No bathroom"

Pourovers are $5 and there are usually 3 delicious flavors. They also have kyoto cold brew, which is basically normal cold brew but imagine you make it with a bunch of beakers that drip very slowly. They also have Asian flavored drinks, ie matcha, sesame, and even a rose latte."
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2019-04-28,5.0,"A little nugget tucked across the Glossier HQ. 

While the prices are pretty steep, the menu is very cool and the employees are super sweet. 

After contemplating if I wanted to spend $6.50 on a latte, I decided the unique order would be worth it and got a Black Sesame Latte with oat milk. Super tasty! They blend toasted black sesame paste into the espresso and create a latte with beautiful latte art on top. If you're a fan of black sesame flavor, this is worth trying. 

There are about 4-5 2 person seater tables located inside and there is wifi available if you want to work. One downfall is there is no bathroom."
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2018-12-12,3.0,"Stopped by Kaigo in search of a cafe that was workable with my laptop situation in the area. Located right near the subway with all the major trains, Kaigo definitely helped me get my work done with its small yet doable space. The interior is beautiful for its size: wooden floors, seats and tables with large coffee decorations on the walls. Although Kaigo has a very tight-knit seating, the crowd that went there were pretty focused on their own business and wary of their surroundings. The staff was super friendly and quick. 

I did not try their famous black sesame latte but did order their lavender matcha. It was good but quite pricey and not too special. I would probably just try this famous black sesame next time or espresso. There are also some pastries up front.

Overall, it's a cute spot but a little too pricey for Chinatown. I recommend coming here if you do want to get some work done or bring a friend. They have some seating if you're lucky with outlets! WiFi is free too. Unfortunately there is no bathroom and they close a little early (6PM).

Accepts card.

Drink up!"
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2018-10-06,5.0,"Yelp brought me to Kaigo and I left a fan. It's a nice looking coffee shop in Chinatown. At first glance, it looks like a sterile, cookie cutter shop, but it's not. Kaigo has its own identity from the type of wood they use for the tables to the art on the walls. There are several places to sit and enjoy your coffee and morning pastry. 

However, where I converted is ordering their black sesame latte. It's the best latte I've ever had in the entire world. Hands down AMAZING! If you like sesame, order it!"

48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2019-04-07,4.0,"Kaigo has very interesting cold brews from time to time like their Kyoto cold brew, and lavender cold brew. Their lattes are also especially yummy (I'm looking at you black sesame latte).

The environment is lovely and well decorated. I personally found it comfortable sitting there chatting with a friend and sipping on my drink. I would imagine with the tables and free Wi-Fi, it will make a nice setting to get some work done as well.

My only vex would probably be the pricing of the menu. I do find it a bit pricey for some items like their drip coffee or espresso. These drinks seem fairly ordinary in contrast to their more unique drinks. With that said however, I would probably find myself returning to this place to get the lattes and cold brews seldom to be found elsewhere."

I ordered the black sesame latte and my friend ordered an iced lavender matcha. The black sesame latte had ground up black sesame and espresso shots with steamed milk. The iced lavender matcha tasted like a normal matcha latte with a hint of the floral lavender at the end. We did work here for a few hours at the tables because there was WiFi and outlets and it wasn't too noisy. I did have my iPhone charger taken by another customer and the shop did not pick up their phone when I tried to call them to get it back.
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2019-10-08,2.0,"Honestly the coffee I had was pretty good but man the overall ambience was awful. The baristas were rude, didn't bother answering my question about the Kyoto Cold Brew with more than one word, and the entire cafe was just full of loud tourists. Even though the cafe itself is small, nothing about it felt cozy or inspiring."
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2018-06-10,5.0,"Modern coffee shop with a killer black sesame latte. Latte is smooth with a hint of black sesame. I highly recommend it! The finely grounded black sesame ended up collecting at the very bottom, so I'd recommend stirring frequently. 

Free WiFi. Power outlets. 5 small tables to work at. Perfect for working here."
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2018-06-01,5.0,"Prologue is legit. The space is rather plain, but the coffee options are worth a detour. Not only do they have La Colombe draft lattes (my personal favorite), they also have delicious house specials. The lavender matcha was great, but the black sesame latte was even better, so subtly nutty.

Drinks were around $5. They also have pour over, espresso, and all that if you're not into sugary stuff. Service was good. Recommended!"

Pros
-Free WiFi 
-I had a mocha which wasn't bad at all but surely not the best I've had :) 
-Staff was friendly and service was fast 
Cons 
-The place has about 5 tables so don't expect to find a place during peak hours especially if you're looking to get work done 
-No restrooms here so beware 
-Certainly not much in terms of ambience as it's really small"

It was super aromatic to taste at first and reminded me of straight up perfume, but it was an acquired taste. After awhile, I caught myself drinking it non stop. It was good, but I would definitely try something else when I go back. The staff here are super nice and the atmosphere is also very cozy. Highly recommend if you want to grab coffee with a coworker."

48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2020-01-21,2.0,Great coffee but staff offered crappy service. My friend and I were the only 2 people who had ordered coffees and it took the staff 10 minutes to realise they hadn't started making our coffees (we ordered Americanos.... not that difficult). There were 4 staff members working and they were too busy chatting to one another to realise we were waiting for our coffee. But I will say the coffee itself was great - good quality beans used
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2018-12-18,2.0,"Review is just for the black sesame oat milk latte. 
Verdict: Latte had a grainy thick unpleasant texture due to black sesame. I could not finish the the latte due to the texture. 
Maybe worth a try if you really like black sesame, but I was not a fan."
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2018-02-01,4.0,"Came in here with a friend on a tuesday afternoon and saw that they have new coffee and drinks. 

We both ordered the Lavender matcha latte. The service was more friendly this time and the drink itself was worth the price. 

If you like Lavender and Matcha at the same time I totally recommend it, the lavender isn't overpowering and the matcha is smooth. No one likes grainy matcha but they did the job right. 

Overall, I would come back again just to try their other coffees and drinks when I'm around the area. Also, this is a great spot to catch up with a friend."

Came here the other day after running some errands in Chinatown and ordered the Black Sesame Latte with oat milk cause the boyfriend's lactose intolerant and not a fan of almond. It was our first time trying oat milk (didn't know oats made milk), but whatever it was the Black Sesame Latte was absolutely amazing!! Reminds me of those Chinese black sesame tang yuan desserts I used to eat as a kid. 

Guys working at the register were extremely helpful and friendly. The place was pretty clean and spacious although there were only around 4 tables and they were all taken. 

This place is conveniently located next to the Broadway Lafayette station  and the Chinese-looking Starbucks. But skip the Starbucks, go here instead!"
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2020-03-08,1.0,ordered an? espresso which was expensive to start with.  but had to be the worst tasting I ever had.  I actually had to put 2 sugars to change the taste.  I guess I spend to much? time in Europe where the espresso is amazing.

I came here for the working atmosphere and I was not disappointed. When I arrived, there was one table left, which I immediately snatched. The wifi is very stable and reliable. The place is quite spacious, surprisingly enough, considering it is in the middle of Canal St, across from Glossier, in a very busy area. The only downside is that it does not have a bathroom."
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2019-02-23,1.0,"The owner is evil. S/he puts a bathroom right where you can see it but then won't allow the waitstaff to give you the key because it's 'Employees Only', in an area with an already scarce bathroom scene (Soho). Beetroot latte is mediocre. Looks like pink milk and tastes about the same (the beet flavor is so mild it's basically non-existent). 
Also, when I found out that they wouldn't let me use the restroom, I asked to cancel the transaction (because if I have to go elsewhere to hunt for a restroom, I'd rather spend on food and beverages where I can actually enjoy them without a full bladder) the barista refused and suggested that I just leave without the beverage for which I already paid.
Lastly, the coffee was acrid, acidic and burnt. Tasted like the equipment hasn't been cleaned properly since they opened."
48,kaigo-coffee-room-new-york-4,2018-09-19,4.0,"Nice cafe on the edge of Chinatown. Has nice drink selection with hot and cold drinks as well as a small selection of tea. I got the ice latte which was pretty standard. The workers here are very nice too. 

There are exactly 5 tables, each can sit 2 people. They have free wifi so it's a great spot for working. Most people had laptops with them and it was just super chill.

Most importantly, bomb acoustic playlist. They played the piano cover of 'City of Stars' from La La Land when I was here and it was a mood."

Prologue Coffee Room isn't a large space, you won't be sitting here all day using their WiFi and sipping java. However! Why sit in a room when you can enjoy NYC with some outrageous coffee?

First off, they have serious coffee machinery. It kinda looks like a Breaking Bad lab up in here, I expected to hear: Jesse, it's time to cook! haha 

Prologue Coffee Room does have some science happening with the different coffee concoctions, the end result is they make a BANGIN' cup of coffee.

Lattes, cold brews, pour overs & drip coffees, all being served at Prologue Coffee Room. If your downtown, find this place!"

Kaigo was just a few blocks away from my hotel and it had a great vibe, so I decided to setup shop here for a few hours. There's not much seating here, but it's actually a good thing because it keeps the place from being too loud while going back to the mellow vibes that their music gives off. I ordered the black sesame latte and thought it was smooth and not too sweet. The baked goods also looked delicious, but sadly I decided to save my appetite for an actual breakfast."

One of the best (maybe the best) latte I've had in the states. I will absolutely make it a point to stop by whenever I'm in NYC. 

Additionally the space is very clean, neat and I love the decor. It also has a whole wall of windows so it's nice and bright with natural light."

I was there on a very early day 7:00am exactly. Unfortunately, they are still preparing to set up everything. Well, it's fine. I am not in a rush so I just stopped by one of the Chinese bakery to get some early breakfast. When I came back, it opened. Place is modern decoration but nothing special. 
I felt like the current coffee place is following the same interior design style which made me very wanna puke...
Anything
Coffee bean is from Toby's. Yes, if you look for tasteless Americano, this maybe your place. 

I, on the other hand, dislike it very much

Price is okay. 3.27 for a small americano

Service: dudes are definitely nice. They open early and very nice and very professional. I felt bad to give bad scores but I just am not a fan of their coffee bean choices. 

Overall: if u r in the area, this place is def Better than Starbucks."

Stumbled across this place on my way to work and decided to drop in after seeing ""black sesame latte"" written on their outdoor sandwich board.  The place was quite small with six or so two-person tables opposite the bar. There was a lot of natural light from the large windows and the white walls and chalkboard menu added to the bright atmosphere. The baristas were very nice, and I decided to order the black sesame latte, which came out to about $6 after tax and tip (kind of pricey, but not unusual for NYC). The latte was beautifully decorated, had a distinctive black sesame taste, and was the perfect temperature for immediate drinking (vs. some drinks which are served too hot).

A great find at the intersection of Soho, Little Italy, and Chinatown. Will stop in again to try some of their other drinks."

They also have a small assortment of baked goods and your standard coffee house drink options. We didn't have difficulty getting a table, but it probably only seats about 15 people. I'd definitely swing by again."

It was super clean and quaint and just the right amount of vintage. 
The only thing that holds me back from 5 starts is because they didn't have flavored syrups. At all. 
While this might be a plus for the legit coffee lovers that don't need it believe in sugar or syrups, I still believe that they should have some just because of the fact that it is a coffee shop and sometimes, not the most earnest of ""coffee"" lovers come by! What if someone just really loves the flavor of milky coffee covered with tons of syrup?
But their latte art is on point and so is their service!

Also, you need a key for the bathroom and you get that at the front, just ask a worker for it.(:"

My friend and I came to do work. There are about 5 tables, it's a rather small place but we managed to grab a table. The wifi isn't their personal wifi, it's one of those optimum or cable wifis so we didn't use it. We just used my friend's wifi. 
We originally came because we wanted the rose lychee latte. That was literally the only reason we chose this place but when we arrived and asked about it, they told us it was only a summer special :( 
I opted for the ice matcha latte and my friend got one of the teas. The matcha latte was about 6 dollars for a standard size (they only have one size). It's pretty expensive IMO. It was good but for such a small cup, it's not worth it. 

To all the other reviews, there's actually no bathroom. I'm sure they have a bathroom but it's for storage/employees only."

Drop in and enjoy some time checking out this rare book store that is so much more!"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2019-12-18,5.0,"Wonderful bookstore / cafe.  There are a lot of books here on feminism and I quickly found the book I was looking for.  They also have a nice selection on witchcraft and my friend found a couple books she was interested in.  The service is friendly.

The coffee is pretty good.  Overall, a wonderful place to visit and buy from."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2019-12-15,5.0,"Gay. I like this little spot a lot. A ton of feminist books and intersectional ones with disability which I really appreciate! Little tables (like too small maybe) to sit at and drink yo tea. They also sell tea. I feel calm here and like my people are around me. Bought a few books to support the place even though Buddha knows I have a stack at home that is threatening to fall over and crush someone any day now.

Go. Visit. Be openly gay with your gay lover like I was. It's cool here. And there's a bathroom. Unrelated to previous statement, just saying it is a positive."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2019-11-18,4.0,"Man, this place is woke. I don't mean that sarcastically. Here, you'll find a ton of books written by people from historically marginalized backgrounds. And also a whole section for pagan/witchcraft books? Not my scene, but I know people who are into that.

There's a coffee/tea shop, and they seem happy to let people just sit a spell and ""sample"" some books.

Oh, and they're part ""activist center"" if that tells you anything."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2019-08-02,2.0,"Couple good books among stacks of things that rich white kids and people with alternate lifestyles and appearance must think makes them unique (the thing is, they all look similar and think similarly, based on the slim selections of books)

overheard one of them saying ""Yes, occasionally problematic people DO come here"" Ha!

Their health and medicine section is a sad space - it's called something like ""accessibility"" ??? Hello to all the serious women scientists- this is what they get? A pseudoscience spirituality section"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2018-10-15,4.0,"Bluestockings is a volunteer-powered and collectively-owned radical bookstore, fair trade cafe, and activist center in the Lower East Side. It isn't huge, but it has a really interesting selection of books. We were exploring the Lower East Side for a day, and I realized I had never gone inside Bluestockings even though I'd passed it a million times. I'm glad we went in this time! I picked out a great book on gentrification to read on the airplane on the way home (you know, just some light reading). Great shop."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-12-05,4.0,"Bluestockings is a mix of that hippie dippie political activist shop yet gets that modern witchy, feminist twist. 

A popular spot for those who still have a love for books. Especially the kinda books that might give you a second look on the subway. The book store also has another favorite, coffee. But regular coffee, no fancy drinks here. There are a couple small tables on the side where customers can drink coffee and read. In ordering coffee you will be tempted in the very cool large and small buttons. I ended up with a fully manicured nails with the saying ""hard as nails"". I love it! Can't wait to flare my jacket with it. 

The coffee is strong and the prefect beverage during the fall and winter season. I ended up having the same book that they sell ""Witches, Sluts, Feminist"" by Kristen J. Sollée And the woman next to me was also reading said book. I enjoyed that Blue Stockings knows what's up and coming but also keeps classics like Simone De Beauvoir ""the woman destroyed"".  

This is the perfect spot to find gifts for birthdays and also when the holidays are around the corner. Highly recommend stopping by and seeing what's new."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2018-02-26,1.0,"While I love the idea of a volunteer-run bookstore, it leads to service that is unprofessional. I'm an aspiring author so was hopeful about dropping my environmental novel off at Bluestockings for consignment. 

After receiving a rejection notice, the staff was careless enough to leave their own internal memos in the returned copies, all of which had to do with the cover! They never even read a word!

An employee named Janelle wrote:

""haha! These will be gray in a week :( Also why do ppl think a white cover is a good idea.""

So since then, I've been dragging my copies around the city, trying to get the word out about climate change. I would direct New Yorkers to Greenlight Bookstore in Brooklyn, whose staff could not have been more gracious and helpful, and have also decided to list my book on Amazon here: http://a.co/gqRVSFv

This is the only negative review I've ever written on Yelp."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2018-03-28,5.0,"Favorite Bookstore in all of NYC! ""Speak up, this isn't a library!"" I am very into how you can find a diverse audience in this bookstore and that they have areas labeled Feminisms, LatinX, Anarchism, and they have books spread out that I would not find elsewhere. 

Bluestockings is an extremely inclusive and safe space. People can be chatting on their phones, reading the newspaper, indulging in $1 coffee or eating vegan green tea cookies. It is an extremely comfortable area. They also have a restroom. The store also sells merchandise including clothing, shirts, Planned Parenthood trinkets and pins, mini Dali Lama Books, books on how to manage stress and anxiety, Zines, etc. 

You can purchase children's books here on gender identity, feminism, on the like."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2018-11-28,5.0,"I love Bluestockings!  A real gem in this city of big box stores and Barnes & Nobel.  

This shop is run by volunteers and has an amazing selection of free-thinking books.  Pretty big inside, so the selection is pretty large.  Knowledgeable staff.

There's also a little cafe inside."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-02-10,5.0,"I love the name of this bookstore.  According to Google, Bluestocking means an intellectual or literary woman.  I LOVE it!  But of course it welcomes everyone who is interested, not solely women. 

Bluestockings is not your typical neighborhood bookstore.  Their books address important social issues that are relevant in today's society.  They have a lot of interesting books and the used ones are on sale.  $10 for however many you wish to fill inside their paper bag.  Here's hoping I can find time to read all 5 of them in 2017!"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2019-07-25,5.0,"This is one of those places I will probably visit every time I'm in NYC. This time I ended up just buying an Ursula Le Guin novel, but they have a wide variety of nonfiction on a number of feminist and political topics as well, and I spent a while just browsing. I also really enjoyed their ceylon iced tea, which was a great refreshment on a hot summer day."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2019-06-01,4.0,Awesome Feminist and LGBTQ social justice book store. Some seats and great selection. Cheap coffee too. No pics sorry! Worth a stop if on lower east side.
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-09-17,4.0,"LES contains a radical community bookstore specifically for the feminine activist and advocate very non-corporate and volunteer powered.  There are several tables and a few food items which I came for lemonade break cool down and to be briefly drawn into the whole feminist activism.  In scanning through their book selection there are books on how-to-be a feminine activist, how to lead rallies and non-feminine activist fiction, sci-fi, magazine, and poetry books.  Bookclub meetings, discussion groups, open-mic events specifically women activism in poetry, prose and song among the various events held at Bluestockings.  There is also a small stationery selection of greeting cards but disappointedly no journals, no notebooks.  Most of the books appeared sold ""as is"" used.

This is not your traditional, old school bookstore.  Very casual setting, very relaxed and comfortable atmosphere and, yes, men are welcomed.  Bluestockings' bookmarks serve as dual bookmarks and as a business card with different variation designs.  My lemonade $2.50 was refreshing for a cool down on a mild end of summer afternoon.  Local volunteer owned and operated for the community."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2019-02-17,3.0,"While I love that this place carries a lot of conscious readings and has coffee for $1, I'm giving it three stars because of the guy behind the counter, who gave us an attitude because we didn't purchase enough to make their $8 credit card limit. I get why there is a minimum but there was no need to get upset over it and make us feel like we did something wrong. This type of service doesn't want to make people come back. Aggression towards customers is detrimental to a business, even when and esp when it's passive. It also makes people feel bad and not comfortable coming back. Businesses should get in the habit of creating truly safe and comfortable spaces esp those businesses who claim to be dedicated to conscious-raising. I will think it over several times before returning here. 

This is not a review to dissuade people from going here because it does have a good mission but feedback for staff and management."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-09-04,5.0,"I've been looking for you for MANY years. You haven't presented yourself until now, but may I just say that the wait was worthwhile,...I'm talking about this absolute JEM of a bookstore. My boyfriend & I were right next door picking up a set of keys when...WHAT'S this glowing beauty?...

It is one of the better bookstores in NY because of their unique book selections, displays, categories, staff & most importantly their ability to stay different by not selling a bunch of the top best sellers. After all, isn't that what online stores are for? This place makes you remember just why bookstores are important & what makes them stay. Cheers to your ever growing selection of goodie paperbacks. I'll be back for more!"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2019-05-21,5.0,A superb radical bookstore in the autodidactic working-class tradition!
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-04-20,5.0,"One of my favorite book stores in NYC. Collectively run (all the employees are volunteers), and well stocked with books and zines on feminism, anarchism, radical politics, queer theory, and more. Really nice staff-I always feel welcomed and comfortable in this space. 

Bluestockings frequently has great free events open to the public-I have come here many times to see readings and guest speakers. It is inspiring to see a small independent business still surviving and encouraging community/activism in the ever gentrifying Lower East Side. Check this place out for unique reading material, and grab a cup of fair trade coffee or tea ($1) and a vegan treat to go with it."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-09-30,5.0,"Absolutely 5/5 stars. The first time I walked into this bookstore, I fell in love, and have been back three times in the past two weeks. To say ""bookstore,"" seems underwhelming, because Bluestockings is so much more! It's also a cafe (with $1 coffee!) and an event space, with events like ""Ukulele for Social Change"" and ""Queer Socialist Meet-Ups."" It's a body-positive, identity-affirming space, with book sections such as ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Black Politics."" This bookstore inspires me in my own writing, and in my own social justice, advocacy, and activism journey. They even have a kids section! I bought my one-year-old goddaughter a book from here, and it's great to see support from the community in these ways.

On a related note, it's also 100% volunteer based, which just makes it even more incredible. It really is fueled by advocacy and representation of queer folks and folks of color."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-10-21,4.0,"They put on a nice reading last night, an anthology of immigrants and children of immigrants experiences. My personal favorite was Dr Danusha Goska from William Paterson University in NJ."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2019-03-16,5.0,"Adore the curation of this spot, it seems like there are often really cute events happening , and lots of trans friendly literature which is obviously a rarity anywhere"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-06-25,5.0,"Bluestockings is a wonderful place where you can grab a drink and a book, engage in some literary conversation, or go to a book event. It's a nice and cozy little place. This is definitely an ultra, uber feminist and queer-friendly bookstore. I stopped by today, after I got off from work, I decided to walk around the area. I was greeted by a friendly girl. She was very polite and very knowledgeable about the book selections available, they even have a small sections of books in Spanish. I was looking for an specific book from black author James Baldwin. After going around the aisles, I ended up with two books from author Junot Diaz instead. Very satisfied with my purchases. I'm definitely coming back. It's good to support small businesses, besides Strand bookstore, which I also love and support as well."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-02-22,4.0,"WHAT A TREASURE THIS BOOKSTORE IS. I literally googled ""political bookstores"" and it happened to be located in the coolest neighborhood in nyc. They stock the shelves with radical literature- topics like civil rights, nonviolent / violent protests, feminism, lgbt. They also have a neat collection of stationary, eclectic postcards, and politically charged posters.

A brief conversation with the man who rung me up informed me that the store is ENTIRELY VOLUNTEER DRIVEN. Holy shit. They rotate between about 60 people. They started off as a bookstore for just feminist books but expanded in space and as well as topics. There are corkboards for interesting community events and infographs. This place may not be the newest or invested in with millions of dollars, but I am SO impressed by their sense of community."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2018-02-27,3.0,"As the name suggests it is an activist center bookstore in the genre of modern liberalism and left winged advocates. I necessary would not categorize myself in those genres therefore I found the bookstore very limiting and biased. But it definitely has a very intimate, locality and quaint feel to it."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-07-14,5.0,"Go to this feminist book store! You must!

One of my favorite spots in NYC and definitely my favorite bookstore. I've gotten quite a few feminist and queer books here. And coffee and vegan snacks. And even a diva cup! 

Be sure to check out what events are happening too because they host some awesome readings and other community events."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-01-05,3.0,"If any part of your college major includes the words Gender Studies, or if your Twitter feed is ridden with the hashtag #SJW, this is most likely your place of choice

I do admire the fact that the entire establishment is volunteer-run, which I hope is a passionate trend for the new year, regardless of political ideologies.

We can all agree that peanut butter cookies are the way forward in 2017. Vegan or not, grab a handful before you go."

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. 
I love thee to the depth and breadth and... 

Ok let me stop playing around. 

I love this bookstore with all my heart. This bookstore is the reason why, even though I almost always choose to pay less for things whenever I can, I intentionally spend more to purchase my books here. Because one can't love physical bookstores but bemoan their slow disappearance from the city because one consistently chooses to purchase them from Amazon instead of buying them locally (hops off soapbox). 

The selection is phenomenal and you get to talk to real staff who have real opinions and recommendations when you tell them you like reading certain types of authors/books. Plus, what's better than coming in looking for one particular book and discovering the 10 others sitting right next to it that also look good enough to read??? Nothing, that's what. Seriously, they do a good job of curating the selection here so that the visitor experience feels like one big clickhole session come to life."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2018-01-04,5.0,Loveliest bookstore I've ever been to! Lots of books and media on queer subjects! A nice place to regain some warmth in the chillier months as well! And be sure to check out the groups they have! :)
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-08-18,3.0,"It's mostly a bookstore rather than a coffee & tea place. Very casual place. Nice to sit for a bit to wait someone or just pass some time. The cashier was very friendly but the tea was just plain. 

There was a hobo sitting there the whole time I was there. Not sure why the store allowed him inside."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2018-09-02,5.0,"Keep these last resorts alive! Love how clean and clear is the message! The categories are so helpful and make it easy to find you need to read today! Kinda walked around the corner and found this amazing little magic pocket! Thanks for doing the great job that is needed so badly in today's world! And of course, unleashed New York!"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-09-02,5.0,"I LOVE THIS BOOKSTORE!!! I was walking around the LES and randomly stumbled upon here. Browsing through the books, I realized there's a lot of social justice/activists books that I would totally read and study. Browsing through the titles, you realize this place is a wealth of knowledge. There's little tables to sit at inside. I was so excited to see all these interesting titles they have like NYC gentrification, human rights, LGBTQ+, gender, ethnicity etc. If you're into sociology, anthropology, human rights, foreign affairs, public policy, etc then this place is for you. If not, the titles are intriguing and unique enough to pique anybody's interest in learning something!

Just come check this place out!!!"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-10-26,5.0,"I help run a magazine sold at Bluestockings, so I had heard of the store and had some communication with people there for the past few years. When I was in the city a couple weeks ago, I decided to do a quick search for bookstores in the area (I live in South Florida, where the closest bookstore is a half an hour drive), and I was pleasantly surprised to find I was just five blocks from Bluestockings.

All the stress from walking the streets of NYC in a rainstorm melted away, as soon as I stepped through the doors. In regular life, it's rare to cross paths with someone who looks and thinks similar to me; when I entered Bluestockings I felt like I was surrounded by like-minded folks. It's a small store, so it didn't take too long to make my way through the crowded aisles, but in the few minutes I spent glancing I was overwhelmed by all the amazing looking books I wanted to bring home and read. Unfortunately, books are expensive these days, so I only bought two, but I regret neither.

I wish I would have gotten in more conversations--either with the other shoppers or with staff--but it didn't seem like the right time or place. I missed the store as soon as I left, but now, sitting here in South Florida, knowing i won't visit anything similar anytime soon, I would I would have found a hiding spot and never left!"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-04-27,5.0,"AHHH!! This bookstore is amazing. This is the first place I've been to where I feel completely at home, comfortable, and safe {since graduating university}. Seriously, this is a judgment free zone, and you can strike up conversations at random and make new friends.

This social justice driven book shop is a great place to continue those intellectual conversations and question norms without getting too quagmired in the academic discourse. Bring a book, and an open-mind :)"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-01-10,4.0,"This place is pretty good, and does a lot for its community. I am a fan of some of the events held here. My main gripe is the amount of work written by men, though...surely there are radical women of various backgrounds who have tackled Zizek, Foucault or Marx. I did like that the anarchism section had various books on women's unpaid labor, but I'd prefer to see that over philosophers whom, when given the mic to speak of women, can be incredibly harmful in their end result.

Other than that the selection of zines is awesome too, so are the patches and pins. My cashier was a bit rude to me, but at the same time -WHY DO WOMEN HAVE TO SMILE ALL THE TIME- we don't, it was just a reminder."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-04-04,5.0,"Such a wonderful little bookstore! The staff is so sweet and willing to help, and the bookstore has any feminist related book you could ever want. On top of that they have zines, stickers and other fun little things - all at reasonable prices. 

I highly recommend checking them out, but give yourself some time because you'll want to browse every aisle!"

49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-07-22,5.0,"Such a great place! I'm so disappointed I didn't know about this store sooner. 

It is everything that a bookstore should be. They gave an amazing selection of titles that are well organized and easy to navigate. You just want to spend hours sifting through them all. If you're in need of new book recommendations or inspiration definitely come here. 

The staff are also incredible. So nice, so helpful, so genuinely interested in the subject matter. It's a great place to spend a Sunday afternoon."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-05-31,5.0,"Amazing. Went here for the first time ever. It is such a great chill place to look around, read a book and just be around non-judgemental, laid back people. Helps that their drinks are fairly cheap too. 

Went for their trans/gay open mic night where I heard spoken word artists and artists singing and it did not disappoint. Gotta say it was truly and seriously amazing to be there in the cafe and enjoy the amazing atmosphere that everyone was giving off.

Can't wait to go back again for another one of their awesome themed nights."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-09-15,4.0,"Awesome anarchist book store dedicated to leftist and radical thought close to the East Village. I walked in and there was some talk going on in the back but it was low-key enough that you could still browse around, scan the shelves. Very helpful staff and great tea and coffee too. Most of the titles are more from contemporary writers and thinkers. Of course you have the usual giants like Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn, but I didn't see a lot of post-modern thinkers like Jacques Ellull or old-school theorists like Malatesta. Also the focus seems to be on American writers and thinkers. I didn't see a lot of European stuff.
I did see one book by Ivan Illich in the used books section but that was about it. 
I'm glad the leftist and radical tradition still continues in increasingly gentrified NYC, especially  in a neighbourhood which has multi-million dollar condos going up around the corner. Literally."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2015-04-12,4.0,"On our way to Pala Pizza, on a beautiful Saturday night, we stumbled into this place. WHY, you might be wondering?? Simple......My wife, is an avid reader and book enthusiast. Having written a novel of her own , she appreciates a good read along with the rest of us. The bookstore is independently operated , by the looks of it. They have an interesting selection with authors i have never heard off. As I perused through the sections , I noticed that the books covered various topics as Transgender, Rape, Civil War history and even Tupac Amaru. Not the same Tupac that we know and love from music, but the Tupac who was apparently a Spanish ruler of some sort. Definitely need to do my research into that. 

This is a quaint bookstore and there is even an area where you can sit, drink coffee and read the books. I was surprised to learn that all the people ""working""  there are actually volunteers. Will stop by here if I'm in the area for a nice read."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2018-02-06,5.0,"I discovered this gem of a bookstore because La Pluma Y Tinta holds quarterly readings here and in 2017 I was featured under one of the New Voices series. Since then I've returned a handful of times both for reading and just to sit and do work. The customer service is always wonderful, there is a bathroom available for use (nothing fancy but it gets the job done) and some tables to work at by the windowed front of the store. Great place to sit and do work, support book culture and/or attend a community event. Great atmosphere!"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-12-07,4.0,"This bookstore is cool if cool was a physical space, that one could enter. I attended an event here and was beyond impressed by the selection. Looking forward to the next event later this month.

Also love that they allow groups to host events here for a donation! bring cash!"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-10-02,5.0,Absolutely delightful experience yesterday at the Lit Crawl. Got to know about the history of the bookstore: how it started in 1999 with 100s of bookstores and now is run by volunteers. It started with books on feminism and moved on to include other topics. The food and coffee is pretty cheap and the ambience is amazing. Found some of the rare books in this bookstore. Will come here again.
49,bluestockings-new-york,2018-06-22,1.0,Silly little bookstore for rich socialists who don't pay payroll taxes for their nannies and cleaning ladies.
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-11-29,5.0,I find myself stopping by here about once a month. It reminds me of Oakland. I have purchased a few books from here and appreciate the volunteer setup they have going on.  I would probably come here more if they had wifi for customers.
49,bluestockings-new-york,2016-12-03,5.0,"Power to the girls.  

Loved finding this little gem on a chilly Saturday afternoon.  Stepped in to warm up with a cup of coffee and found a welcome reception, a girl-friendly environment, and a nice selection of feminist literature. 

Pop in and learn a few things, including a few things about yourself."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2015-12-22,5.0,"A great DIY feel (volunteer run) bookstore and coffee shop, where you can work on your computer to the free wifi and not feel time pressured to leave.

I attend a Women's College (it should be easy to guess which one) and I am an Africana(/Black) Studies and Comparative Literature major. Being here is like being in heaven. The selection is incredible and it attracts awesome customers and volunteers. I honestly wish I could purchase every single book in store. So far, this is  my favorite bookstore in New York."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-05-24,5.0,I totally splurged here and stocked up on some awesome feminist and political lit. Got a ton of cool. stickers and buttons for my gear too. The staff here is super friendly and passionate about social issues. They are well stocked in so many different types of political writings and I managed to find a bunch of books that I had been eyeing for the longest time. This place is a total treasure.
49,bluestockings-new-york,2015-04-09,2.0,"I hate to say it, but I was pretty disappointed by my experience here. I found that the selection was very limited (it's a small bookstore and maybe I got my hopes up because of the nature of the store) and that the staff were disorganized. 

I was looking for a book by bell hooks, and was very surprised when I couldn't find it. One of the volunteers told me that the book was in stock (the computer said it was), but when we went to look for it, it was of course not there. So I ordered the book through them. I received a call a few days later saying that the book had arrived, but when I went to pick it up, it wasn't. When the book did arrive, there was a mix-up with the price and I was told to pay a price higher than originally stated (when I ordered the book). However, when I explained the situation, the salesperson changed the price back to what I was originally told.

Everyone was very friendly through the whole thing (I was very pleased with how the salesperson handled the price mix-up), and I understand that it's tricky when volunteers are in charge (I volunteer at a bookstore as well so I get it) but I was disappointed with the level of disorganization, especially because the bookstore came so highly recommended. I doubt that I'll order another book through Bluestockings, but I hope to go back and browse and have a better experience in the future."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2014-12-27,5.0,"This is a great, collectively-run, feminist bookstore. The best thing about shopping here is that you can be sure you're supporting activism in a neighborhood that's fast becoming as homogenized as every other neighborhood in Manhattan. 

All the workers here are volunteers; in addition to edgy, feminist, political, and radical-type books, they also sell fair-trade Zapatista-roast coffee (by the pound or cup) and great baked goods such as the killer Vegan O'Brien cookies (chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and now brownies.) 

The selection of books is, as I said, stuff you might not find at Barnes & Noble. As their website states, they hold events nearly every night, and list coming events here: http://bluestockings.com/events/

As the world becomes increasingly Kindle-ized, bookstores need to set themselves apart in some way. Bluestockings does that, and does it very well; I'm lucky to have them just a short bus ride away--unless it's a nice day and I walk.

[Lastly, they have a restroom, and won't give you the stink-eye if you ask to use it.]"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-04-13,5.0,Ran into this bookstore yesterday and it seemed heaven sent. I am so happy that places like this still exist. I will be back.  It is a feminist bookstore that welcomes anyone/everyone.Such a great warm vibe.

There are tables to sit at.  Theres a bathroom.  This place is a resource for you.  For all of us.   The register is volunteer staffed, be patient.  Consder becoming a volunteer.   

I dont get enough free time to volunteer myself. But I love to support this place.  I buy gifts here at the holidays.  They have fantastic oddities and art books.  They have books for kids. They also host a bulletin board and many community events, workshops, carry lots of zines and slingshot calendars and wonderful books from publishers that I love.  In an era of social movements being expanded through the web we are also very fragmented and dispersed along the same lines as commerce.  We've lost the art of community - places like this are safe haven for the wayward isolated new yorker to drift in and find that community whenever you need it."

49,bluestockings-new-york,2015-04-17,5.0,"Bluestockings continues to be one of the best bookstores in America, punching way above its weight. You will literally find more quality books in this one tiny store than you'll ever find in all the Barnes & Nobles in the world.

The events here are also top notch. There's a book reading, book club, or other literary event literally every night of the week - and the store has a fantastic little cafe, so you can enjoy top notch (non-alcoholic!) drinks with your experience.

Great graphic novels. Queer theory. Novels. Magazines. Zines. Bluestockings. Has. Them. All! GO!"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2015-08-22,3.0,"I have been coming here since the place opened in 1997. Great selection and good politics.
I just wish that the people who worked behind the counters were ok with talking to people who come in the store, not making them wait at the coffee counter for a while and being more friendly. It seems that many of the people who volunteer there are more into having fun chilling behind the counter than anything and if you are over 24, your chances of interaction about books, etc are not good."
49,bluestockings-new-york,2017-04-09,5.0,The book selection is amazing. The staff is very helpful and kind. Love that I got to support this store!!
49,bluestockings-new-york,2014-10-17,5.0,"My #1 favorite bookstore! The book selection focuses on feminism, queer theory, race, activism, political scifi, and more. I have found tons of books here that I didn't know about before, and it has really broadened my thinking on womens' issues, Palestine, and capitalism. The pins, patches, and journal selection is also bad ass.

The customers and counter people are also super friendly and loves to discuss politics, organizing, crafts, and more. It is collectively-owned, volunteer-run and non-hierarchical - it's inspiring that a group of committed folks can operate a space like this according to their own principles!"
49,bluestockings-new-york,2018-03-14,5.0,Every city should have a bookstore like this. Supportive community bookstore. Gives voices to the rest of us.
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-03-04,5.0,"I was waiting for the bus home and was starving when I decided to check V-Nam Cafe on yelp to see if they have good reviews (true yelper right here!) and they do. Next is to check their menu and they have $7.25 classic banhmi with Pate and you can adjust the level of spicyness. I ordered medium spicy, which is perfect for me. Since they have a $10 credit card minimum, I decided to order 2 banhmi, the classic and the roasted chicken. 

Throughout the bus ride I could smell the delicious aroma and once I got home, unwrapped the banhmi. It was juicy, tasty and full of flavors.
I have died and went to banhmi heaven. Definitely going to be a regular here."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-02-07,4.0,"I love this place. Like part of me wants to give it 4.5 stars if I could. It is a little dingy but in authentic amazing NY kind of way. Like you want your restaurants to be more like this and less corporate.

Anyway I am vegetation and I have to say I am I love with how they cook their tofu. I work near here and want to eat here nearly every day. There tofu bahn mi so SOOO GOOD and today i tried the vermicelli noddle with tofu and it hit the spot. SO INCREDIBLE !!

I used to  live in seattle and miss having accessible Vietnamese places where I live so I am so happy that I found this  place. I generally spend $10 on lunch when I go and feel it is worth it.

I have gotten the vegetarian pho once and I want to give a  huge props for them doing a vegetarian broth that has flavor and not just water -- but it is t my favorite broth ever. But thank you V-Nam for having a vegetarian options.

The bathroom is in the way back of the kitchenn which makes me chuckle but then again props for letting people use the bathroom because you know some restaurants are stingy"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-01-22,5.0,"I think this might be my new favorite place to get Pho in the city! I've been to so many Pho places and have been disappointed.  I'm so blessed that I stumbled upon this place. 

I got the veggie pho and the broth was so flavorful. The soy protein was amazing with little pieces of chili peppers. I like that they served the soy on the side so it didn't get soggy."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-05-20,5.0,the beef + classic pate banh mis are delicious. great flavor and good portion. ca phe sua da on point too. authentic vietnamese taste.
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-10-17,3.0,"Was searching on Yelp for something to eat late last night after a long day with a hangover and I'm happy with finding V-Nam Cafe. They were one of the only Vietnamese restaurants open that deliver and I ended up having a nice average meal!

Ordered the vermicelli beef noodles and delivery came fast. Also got a side of beef soup that was delivered and only had chicken in it. I think I would've liked the Vermicelli Beef Noodle better if it was delivered correctly-- asked for it ""Very Spicy"" which means they add thai Chile, sriracha & jalapeños but they forgot it :( so it has no spice at all. Womp womp. 

All in all the beef was cooked well and the noodles were tender. Wish they had more mint as it only came with 1 leaf. Left me craving for more flavor!!"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-02-01,4.0,"Standard delicious classic banh mi. Small place to eat inside, good service. Can't go wrong."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-01-23,3.0,"I got the chicken pho. It's ok, but nothing too special. The chicken is dark meat, which I'm not crazy about. I prefer white meat. But I do appreciate the prices, which are very reasonable. The pho came out to be around $10 including tax (not including tip)."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-01-20,5.0,"This place hit the spot when I was craving pho! I ordered a bowl of pho and egg rolls through Grubhub and it was the fastest order I've ever gotten. It literally came 20 mins later! Everything was packed up well where the broth, noodles and meats and veggies were separated so nothing was soggy. Everything tasted great!! The egg rolls were crispy. Could not have had a more perfect experience."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-01-20,4.0,"Delivery review: 

Really yummy pho here with vegan friendly options! Flavorful vegetable broth and they have either tofu or soy protein (faux chicken) which is delicious! Always glad to have a veggie pho option. When you order delivery they package all the components separately !

I also really enjoyed the summer rolls and subbed out shrimp for soy protein. Generous portion and very tasty ! Actually really loving this fake chicken. Not dry and good texture. 

I would order from here again. Fast and timely delivery"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-09-12,3.0,"I came in here after doing a search for lunch in the area. I've been here before.

I looked at the menu through Yelp app and called to order the chicken banh mi sandwich when I was at 2nd ave and 1st Street. I said I would pick it up and was told 10 minutes.
1pm. I was asked about level of spiciness. I chose medium which would be safe but not bland.
I walked to there in less than 10 minutes. It was ready and wrapped.

When I ate it there was the cilantro pickled  shredded carrots shredded daikon.
The chicken was moist, flavorful and complex combination of herbs and spices."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-06-22,2.0,"Cheap prices and good reviews reeled me and my friend in, but I think I'll just stick to my usual Banh Mi shop in Chinatown after all.

It's a small store with a decent amount of chairs and tables, dark lighting, and no bathroom. Me and my friend shared a Banh Mi Ga (chicken) to stay. Good thing was it was a very filling size but in regards to the taste, it was way below mediocre. The chicken, which was thigh meat, tasted rather bland and since that's the main protein/what most of the sandwich is, felt very disappointing. Maybe because I did order it as non-spicy, at some point as I was eating, I was considering to squirt some sriracha on my sandwich to give it some more flavor. The other only redeeming point was the sandwich came hot so you know it's freshly made. 

Regardless, if you are to come to this place for a cheap meal to share, I wouldn't suggest getting the Banh Mi Ga at least."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-01-25,5.0,"This is a review about their banh mi, which is the best I've ever had in my entire life. Like there's something about the way they prepare it with just the right balance of ingredients like pickled radish, meat, bread, other veggies, condiments, etc. cannot be beaten. Beat me. I think it's a pretty unassuming banh mi but it's otherworldly. Also, just because it looks like a random place don't be fooled - the sandwich is great. Not all great books were written with fancy pens. 

I'll make the trip to NYC a few times a year from DC and this is one of those places that I always try to find time to go and pick up a sandwich because it's worth the time and effort if you feel like you should treat yo'self. And if you don't deserve to treat yo'self, I'd still get it. Point being, spare no rationale to eat banh mi from here.  My mouth is watering as I write my own review.

I remember visiting NYC from DC when the wife and I were dating (okay, we still go on ""dates"" but you know what I mean). I used to take all modes of travel to NYC including bus. I mention the bus because one time I took out half of my unfinished banh mi on the bus ride back to DC and suddenly everyone wanted to be my friend or my banh mi's friend. I don't blame them, it smelled delicious (and I busted it out about 3 hours into the ride down when everyone was probably hungry). 

Oh man, that story just made me really hungry for banh mi. 

dmo out."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-03-25,3.0,This is a very small cafe. Has enough seats for like 16 people. The pho broth taste pretty good and not really oily. The meat for the pho isnt really good. The meat was tough for both the beef and the chicken pho. The Bah mi is pretty good but spicy isnt really spicy at all. The price cost about 1-2$ extra from the viet restaurants in chinatown. Overall this would be a good late night snack area after drinking at the bars around the place.
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-01-18,4.0,"I love the classic banh mi (w egg!) here- also I've tried the summer rolls and beef soup (tasty but salty). Would love to try the rest of my favorite dishes! 

(Easy to bypass, since there are so many larger storefronts around this small restaurant.)"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-09-05,5.0,"I eat here probably once a month if not more. Amazing vegetarian pho and the soy protein is so flavorful and yummy. Also, they have the best banh mi in the city. And they're a quick cheap meal!"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-07-06,3.0,"Banh mi are okay. For $9 beef, I probably will opt for going to Chinatown instead, where the quality is the same and at half the price. The beef was cold, which was odd considering how long it took to make the sandwich with no other orders on the line. The bread was still a good classic Banh mi baguette, thin crusty outside and fluffy inside."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-01-14,4.0,"Got two vermicelli veggies, ordered both with tofu and requested no fish sauce. I waited 30-45 minutes requested before picking up, but when I arrived, they said it wasn't ready because they ran out of tofu and wanted to know if it was okay that one of them had soy protein, so I had to wait again. Besides that, it was very delicious and a decent portion size. They gave us an alternative soy-based sauce, and I would def recommend it with either the tofu or soy protein. I believe the soy protein was glazed in a sweet and savory sauce."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-01-23,5.0,"Everything here is delicious and fresh, big portions, lots of vegetables pickled just right on the Banh Mi. Beef soup and salad sides ($2) are one of the better deals around."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-04-27,5.0,"I had the chance to visit V-Nam cafe on a  Thursday evening around 7:30 PM. Since we were going to an event in the area and had some time to kill (along with having not had dinner yet) I decided to take the risk and try something I'd never had before. All I can say is that I'm so HAPPY I did.

When I walked in I was surprised to see that the space wasn't bigger. They had about three high table tops and two large tables. It seems like this place is more of a causal dining spot so no need to make a reservation. When we walked in the host greeted us from behind the counter and allowed us to pick where we wanted to sit.

When it came time to order I went with an apparent Vietnamese classic, the Bahn Mi Bo sandwich ($8). Its a beef sandwich with other added toppings like cilantro and such. Such great flavor and also extremely filling. In the moment I almost couldn't believe I'd never had this dish prior to this experience. They also let you pick your spiciness level for these sandwiches. I went with mild, but if you're a true spicy lover (or have an affinity for sriracha) I'd say definitely go with the medium.

The service was also great! Our waitress gave us time to look over the menu, answered any questions we had, and was also fast in getting our food out to us after we ordered. 

Overall a great experience through and through. If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food that's sure to fill you up, definitely give this hole in the wall joint a try."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-05-13,5.0,"Tried and true. This place has remained my favorite vegetarian pho in the city over the last three years I have lived in NYC.

The broth has salt, citrus, herbal elements all coming together to be so nourishing. The rice noodles have a nice al dente texture. The garnishes include more herbs, lime and jalapeño for more acidity as you wish. If you balance this meal off with a Vietnamese iced coffee it provides sweetness to the meal and you have perfection  you have what tastes like ""home.""

I've dined in and out and the consistency has remained the same. Thank you VNam Cafe for always feeding my soul"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-09-28,5.0,"This hole in the wall cafe is my go-to spot for 2 years for pho, banh mi, and vermicelli noodles. The owner has been a chef in the restaurant business for a long time, and has excellent dishes at such affordable prices. The staff is super friendly and is always willing to chat. Great place overall."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-10-13,5.0,"I was pleasantly surprised with this spot and actually think it is one of my favorite phos I've tried in the city. Just from looking at the outside storefront, I'm not sure if I would really gravitate to this place but it got good reviews, seemed relatively cheap/fast, had an A sanitation rating and looking good for carry out. I'm so glad I tried it though.

I got the beef pho and you can tell they really put a lot of care into the details of the pho. The oxtail broth was extremely flavorful and not too salty and the meat was pretty tender. They gave a pretty generous portion of onions, cilantro, bean sprouts, lime and noodles to go with it too. 

Even though I carried out, there were a lot of people sitting and eating there for dinner (seems like a pretty casual spot with no reservation needed). If I lived closer, I would definitely eat more at this place. It only took 5-10 minutes for me to get my order. They're cash only unless you have a min $10 order and the beef pho was below $9, so would bring cash."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-01-13,5.0,I tried their Pho Curry Chicken and Veggie Soups and I thought is tasted amazing. Everything is made fresh and has very good flavors. I would recommend anyone to go eat there.
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-01-05,5.0,"Perhaps my favorite establishment in the Lower East Side! Small, locally owned & very cozy spot offering wallet friendly traditional Vietnamese dishes. First time visiting, we ordered ordered beef pho, spring roll vermicelli, & classic banh mi w/ egg to share (allows variation of spice level to order). Have returned several times since & expectations have been surpassed each time. Waitressing staff is incredible as well. HIGHLY recommend if you are in the area or simply seeking delicious food for a friendly price. be sure to leave a tip as they deserve it :)"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-04-13,4.0,"Good Vietnamese fast food in a convenient location. Service is quick and friendly, but not overly so. 

I would describe both the inside and outside as no frills, but clean. Cafe is a good description of the size and vibe. The seating area is very small. 

The Spring rolls are the star here. I also had the curry chicken noodle soup, which was good, but next time I will probably opt for the pho or bahn mi (which everyone else eating here seemed to be enjoying). Will be back for sure.

Also note: only cash or Amex accepted."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-09-09,5.0,"My absolute FAVORITE VEGAN PHO place in the city and I've had nothing else! They have tofu and soy protein option and the latter is soooo good! The pho is SO flavorful and definitely on the ""junky"" side... as in not clean and healthy like some I've had. I used to go here at least once a month when I used to work in LES... now I live in LA but I still stop by when in the city! Don't know if Amy is still there, but what a sweetheart and a beauty she is! 

PLEASE GO AND SUPPORT THIS TINY LITTLE LOCAL GEM!"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-08-28,2.0,"The beef pho was a disappointment. Soup is too salty and lacks flavor. Noodles are overcooked - this could be just a personal preference, but I didn't know how much I enjoyed the noodles in the pho from other locations until I ate here. The lime that came with the pho looked old and was browning on the edge, so that wasn't so nice either. Consequently, I wouldn't order another bowl of pho from here again.

However, V-Nam Cafe seems to advertise its sandwiches than pho, so maybe I should give that another try."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-08-31,5.0,"I absolutely love V-Nam cafe's banh mi.

The beef pho was standard and you can never go wrong with a bowl of their noodles, but their banh mi was what stood out to me.

The bread was crisp and had a good crunch to it without being too tough or too soft. The mixed meats all complemented each other very well and the sauce kicked my ass every time in a good way. I used to come get a banh mi to go every week or so when I lived nearby, but I have moved away and no other banh mi I've had since then has compared. Every time I stop by the area I make sure to come back and pick up a banh mi to go."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2017-08-11,5.0,"Alert: East Village hole-in-the-wall gem 

Pretty skeptical walking in here late at night - it's not the most decorated place by any means. There's no bathroom as well. However, the Pho is delicious! The cooks definitely take their time back there cooking up the dishes, unlike a lot of other pho places around that come out right away.

It's cheap, big portioned, fresh and authentic. They gave me so much chicken in my pho I didn't even finish it! The spring rolls were also fried to a golden crispy perfection.

5 stars for sure - my tummy and wallet thank me."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-06-14,4.0,"My go-to these days for cheap Viet takeout. The spot is very hole-in-the-wall and a little dingy, but the food is excellent. My 4-star review is mainly driven by the value you get here.

Favorites:
Banh Mi Bo (beef)
Vermicelli Beef or Spring Roll
Pho Beef
Clay Pot Ginger Chicken

Spring rolls are really meaty and dense, and they even poke a hole in the containers so they don't get (as) soggy. Banh mi are all a great bread to meat ratio. Flavors in general are really strong and yet, not too salty. I unfortunately can't eat cilantro, so I'd imagine it's probably even better for cilantro eaters.

Prices are again, an outstanding value, especially given the neighborhood. $8 for a huge beef banh mi. $8.50 for serviceable pho. Can't beat that!

Really great for takeout or a cheap, low-key meal."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-08-02,3.0,"Ordered the classic ban mi, the spring rolls, and the ""Vietnamese"" iced coffee. The spring rolls were decent, the iced coffee tasted like a regular iced coffee from the street stand. I only finished half the ban mi due to a funny taste. It was very far from the real Vietnamese food. I wasn't expecting this food to have the authentic flavor but at least something close. Very disappointing."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-10-28,5.0,Excellent food and service. Will definitely return any time I'm visiting NYC. Highly recommended if you're looking for good Vietnamese in a casual low key place.
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-07-03,4.0,Their bahn mis are one of the best around. The fish one and the soy protein one are both super tasty! We always get those two with a side of broth or pho if we're feeling hungry. Always reliable and consistent. Delivery is fast too! Me is a fan
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-09-10,4.0,Solid Vietnamese food. I've had the banh mi and spring rolls - fantastic for a quick bite.
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-01-19,5.0,"My partner and I ordered the beef and regular banh mi with summer rolls for lunch from Postmates this week. Prices are very reasonable, banh mi was sizable and supremely satisfying. I did slightly prefer the original banh mi over the beef banh mi. Summer rolls and the accompanying peanut sauce were on point as well. Will definitely be ordering from here again soon!"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-01-19,2.0,"I've been here a few times and thought the food was overall good. But then I went last night had did not have a great experience. 
The calamari was great! My chicken Bahn Mi was not. It didn't taste fresh and the chicken was suppose to be shredded. It was in big pieces and the flavor was just off. Hated the music they were blasting over the speakers. The other times that I was there the music was non existent or in the background.
My friend had the fish hot pot which he enjoyed.
I spent this whole morning in the bathroom! I won't be going back."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-04-15,4.0,"A great pho place in east village. The portions are HUGE I came starving and still couldn't finish the entire bowl ! My friends and I split the calamari and it was crispy and the texture was firm. It had a tangy filling sauce that added a lot of flavor to the dish. Overall the pho was great and not too oily.

The spot was a little dirty with a fly inside even though it was still pretty cold outside."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2017-02-10,5.0,"Wow this was a good Banh Mi sandwich.  I ordered the classic banh mi.  They also have the option to add a fried egg for a dollar.  This is really a no brainer.  I mean if there is an option for a fried egg then you obviously need to add the fried egg.  Then you need to select your spice level.  Be careful here.  If you are like me then you automatically say spicy.  The problem here is that there medium is the spicy you are use to seeing with the jalapenos and sriracha.  They spicy here includes Thai chilies.  Now while a love spicy food my stomach does not always agree with my mouth, so I opted for the medium.  

The sandwich came out quickly and looked delicious.  Everything was fresh and tasted amazing.  The bread was nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The spice level was perfect.  The medium spice was still spicier then most of the other spicy banh mi's I have had in the area.  I will definitely be back for more in the future."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2020-01-06,5.0,Delicious pho that's gluten and dairy free!! The people are so nice too. One of my go-to places!
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-03-09,5.0,"*V-Nam Café*
notes of black pepper, maggi, nc mm; healthy caramelization on grilled meats without being too sweet, nc mm included; bánh mì ingredients all satisfying and flavorful, with good balance, in flavor and in portion proportion; could taste the pâté and quality of the cold cut meats, nicely sliced; bánh mì bread structure is not long and skinny, but not short and fat either, sort of in the middle, akin to italian sub style bread, which is appreciated for its ease to eat, and doesn't come off too rigid, tough; simple presentation; very reasonable prices; finally, customer service and hospitality very down to earth, authentic. Reminds me of local cafés by my pents's home in Garden Grove, Cali and I am almost certain to come to V-Nam Café when I am fancying some classic Vietnamese dishes and flavor."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2016-12-29,5.0,"My favorite go-to for banh mì! V-Nam is situated right near the F train on 2nd Avenue. It's a small hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurant. There are about 5 tables: two big tables and three smaller ones. You can also hang out and eat at the front by the window if you wish.

V-Nam may not look like much but I really enjoy their sandwiches. The price is a little pricey but what do you expect from NYC? You can definitely get cheaper in Chinatown or Queens but the reason I like coming here is for the extra spicy option! If you're into spicy food, get this version. You will be drinking so much water (maybe milk). They use Thai chili peppers, the real deal.

I also usually order their coffee- hot or cold, depending on the weather.

I prefer to order to-go mostly because it's really cramped but I'm sure it's great with a friend or two. It can get full though.

Customer service is always friendly! She's awesome.

They take card above $10 so bring cash!"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-01-07,5.0,"This gem has my heart. My favorite spot in NYC and best banh mi you'll find. Charming and unassuming. Delicious every single time. More than fair prices and it's in one of the best neighborhoods for strolling. If you're new to Vietnamese food, done well it is fresh and healthy, like here! V-nam's veggies are always so crisp. The staff are so kind and welcoming. V-Nam is great for eating in solo or with a group friends and they're fast when it comes to take out and delivery. I have eaten all items on the menu, but tend to stick to vegetarian options. Seitan everything (bahn, pho, vermicelli) if you want to skip the meat. Or, the baked curry sunfish dish hits it out of the ball park."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-08-15,4.0,"This place really looks like a dump, but do not let the appearance deter you from coming in, it's great. 
We get the spring rolls -they are so authentic, they taste similar to those I used to eat in Vietnamese restaurants back home in France. Makes my heart so happy to bite into those crunchy greesy goodness rolls, it brings me back to the old days :) 
We also get the banh mi sandwiches, which should be its own food group. Delicious. The bread is tasty, the serving of meat pate is very generous and the filling is huge. 1 sandwich is enough for 2, butwe always get 2 because it is just too good to share! 
We have also tried the summer rolls, they are fresh and big and I love the peanut dipping sauce. We ordered once the beef vermicelli, and while it was very tasty, my favorite items remain the banh mi and the spring rolls! 
YUM"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-06-14,5.0,I love this place! Best vietnamese food i've had in NYC. Prices aren't bad considering the area and the food always hits the spot. Their vegetarian (vegan) options are even better than the meat options... other vegetarian friendly restaurants should step up their game. Need more vegans in this world i'll eventually be one of them. Anyways anything you get here will be good. Can't complain about the portion size and the service is pretty friendly and I love how they never rush you.
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-06-16,5.0,"This is my Favorite Neighborhood Vietnamese spot and I eat here a couple times a month. They keep their menu with a spartan list of items which is a good thing and does not overwhelm you like other Vietnamese restaurants. I am pretty much a creature of habit with ordering the spring rolls, Chicken/spring roll Vermicelli, and of course their Pho. But their other rice dishes and Banh mi are also excellent as well. Seating can be limited at certain times but the carry out is very very quick option."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2017-10-15,4.0,"This place is a little hole in the wall, and looks super sketchy from the outside. I'm almost positive when I went there was a B rating on the window which usually deters me from places, but the person I was with is a regular here and insisted we eat her. 

It's super small and has barely any seating. So you have to stand outside and be ready to run in and grab a table once someone gets up. I went on a Friday and it was packed so we sat at a bar next door and ran back over every 10 minutes until a spot cleared. There was only one girl waiting tables, which is ok because there aren't many tables to wait. I tried a dish with curry chicken and potatoes and vegetables. It was not the kind of curry I'm used to but super tasty. It came in this little pot thing and was filled to the top. It also came with rice on the side, which was great because I have to eat rice with my curry. Overall it was good dish I had but not sure I'd come back on my own."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-02-13,5.0,"Amazing banh mi. Great flavor and while it's a little more expensive than banh mis in nearby Chinatown, it's one of the cheaper restaurants in the areas."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2017-08-03,4.0,"This is my go to spot after hitting up a few bars on 1st Ave. You order at the counter and seat yourself. There are a few tables and some high tables for two. They have decent vegan options. The only item listed vegan on the menu is the pho (because of the vegan broth), but you can get vegan summer rolls and noodles. My favorites are the summer rolls and pho. 

The staff is nice and will answer any questions about the menu. I definitely recommend if you haven't had Vietnamese food and want to try something different."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-05-10,1.0,Found a fly wrapped up in my shrimp roll  the spring rolls were pretty good but after eating one shrimp roll I found a dead nat in my second shrimp roll so definitely throwing out the rest. Huge bummer

50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-11-04,1.0,Got my bahn mi with RAW CHICKEN. This is disgusting and could've got someone pretty sick due to lack of quality control. Never again. Would give 0 stars if it was an option. Chicken shouldn't be pink
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2016-03-24,4.0,"I came here randomly with two friends after volunteering nearby. We originally went to Taste of Bhatki, but they had no food setup yet. We saw this place directly across the street and hopped right over. Best random find ever! The restaurant is a tiny hole in the wall but serves delicious Vietnamese food at really cheap prices. I really loved the food here. My Vietnamese friend from Hanoi said the banh mi was really authentic, so it must be really good.

Clay Pot Red Curry Fish Rice - Delicious!!! Served sizzingly hot in a claypot for only $8. The sauce was actually a little bit too sweet, but the flavor was good. The catfish was flaky. The rice was delicious soaked in the sauce.

Pho Beef - Good broth. My friend said they use the dried noodles instead of fresh, which is not as good and sometimes makes him sick due to the chemicals. Learning new things about Vietnamese food everyday. There was only brisket, no omosoa or tendon. 

Banh mi (pork pate) - The pate was delicious and they weren't skimpy on it. There were also lots of pickled vegetables and the baguette was crispy. The banh mi is HUGE. The owner cut it into 3 pieces for us and each piece was like half a sandwich. What a great banh mi.

I'll definitely come back every time I'm in the area for volunteer. I can't wait to eat that claypot catfish curry again!!!"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2017-07-30,5.0,"Great fast flavorful fun filling fantastic ferocious (that one was just for the alliteration) noodles!

I got a vegan bowl which definitely made me happy. Not much makes me happy anymore. Oh, I don't wanna talk about it. Just want to slurp up more noodles.

The place is tiny and doesn't have a bathroom or anything. But that's part of the charm. ALSO CHARMING: the girl taking my order was singing along to the radio and had a great voice! I hope she reads this and tries out for The Voice or whatever. Tbh I'd vote. I'd vote!"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-11-29,5.0,"I've been to V-Nam a few times and each time I leave feeling happy and satisfied. Located off 1st & 1st, it's conveniently located near subway stations and walking distance from spots like Katz and Russ & Daughters. I've dined in and have ordered take out as well. The place is small, a hole-in-the-wall almost, but the service is always friendly and quick. I've tried the Catfish Banh Mi, Beef Pho, and Summer Rolls. The pho here is unreal. I may say it's the best I've had in the city. The portion sizes are big for the price and anytime I'm craving Viet, this is my new favorite."
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2016-01-09,4.0,"After the comedy show, we were a bit hungry so I look on Yelp for cheap eats and came across V-Nam Cafe and popped my best friend's cherry as she never try Vietnamese food. I shared a Mild Banh Mi Bo with my best friend and my brother's girlfriend ordered a Mild Banh Mi with Vietnamese Iced Coffee. The decor is a little rundown but its really about the food sometimes in these mom and pop shops. I believe the owner might be the old man who took our orders and he was friendly. Good thing I was sharing my other half of the sandwich because it was too fulfilling for all by myself. The baguette was toasted and crunchy which I love. I forgot that Vietnamese sandwiches always are topped with cilantro so I pulled it off my sandwich. Mmmmm there were a lot of beef and woah baby so delicious than the other Vietnamese spots. I need to come back and try the Pho =) 

There's a bathroom but only for customers towards the back of the kitchen!"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2018-06-20,4.0,"This place is a hidden hole in the wall gem in a neighborhood of expensive eateries.  I used to always go down to Chinatown to get my fix of cheap Vietnamese food, but now I come here.  I don't think there is one item on the menu above $12 and the portions are huge!  I have tried their beef stew over rice, curry chicken noodle soup, vermicelli with grilled chicken, and the clay pot red curry fish and everything was solid.  The flavors were all delicious and I always leave their stuffed.  I highly recommend giving this place a try for those who haven't been and are in the neighborhood."

Price:  cheap
Claypot ginger chicken- had no ginger flavor..sauce was rather tasteless.  Have had much better.  
Curry fish claypot- glad this was highly recommended on here.. It was the better dish.  Very flavorful sauce.  Fish isn't exactly fresh but at this price, can't complain.
Complimentary soup served was very tasty!"
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2019-08-21,5.0,I've been to this place from when it first opened. Since then they have expanded their menu to accommodate non-meat dishes and they are just as delicious. The pho and banh mi selections are delicious. The owner is very nice and mild mannered. We have had conversations about our respective home town in Viet Nam. I'm so happy this little cafe has been so successful.
50,v-nam-cafe-new-york,2017-12-03,1.0,"This was my favorite place that I would eat almost once a week, until, I found a really big BUG in my pho. I almost ate it thinking it was a jalapeno... it was not. 
I haven't gone back but I also heard they have a ""C"" rating. 
(the ""Veggie"" Pho with Soy protein is awesome but go at your own risk.)"
51,banter-new-york,2020-04-18,5.0,"Wait wait wait, hold up. I haven't written a review for Banter yet?!

I first came here for brunch when the cafe first opened. Now it's ridiculously popular & boy, if you haven't been - you are CLEARLY missing out! The food is fantastic, the drinks are superb (augh, what I would do for a dirty chai with oat milk right now!) & the service is great.

Banter is THE perfect Australian brunch place. The decor is simple & clean cut. Every dish I've had (from the French toast to the bowls to the toasts) has been scrumptious in every damn bite. And their drinks equally are fab. I love coming here, being able to get cozy with an amazing brunch & hot latte (oh, the feels right now, especially with this stay-at-home order!). I have brought numerous friends here & not one person has been disappointed.

Banter fits perfectly in the neighborhood, a growing Little Australia. Augh, and it's definitely on my list of places to hit up once this Covid pandemic is over. Don't change a thing! Well, okay, I lied - maybe the long lines. But I will definitely be back for more!"
51,banter-new-york,2020-03-10,5.0,"The food is so delicious and they charge at a fairly responsable price.

51,banter-new-york,2020-01-27,4.0,"Came here on a Sunday for brunch. They don't do reservations so definitely time yourself on their yelp waitlist.

My review is solely on the food and service. The food was good. We ordered the Banter Big Breakfast and the Housemade Granola.

In all honesty, I originally came for one of the items that were in their old menu so I was a little disheartened to realize that they renovated their menu. Nonetheless, I gave it a chance.

I think my only concern is that because my friend scarf down his food in less than ten min, we had a semi empty table once the server took away his empty dish. I was fine with it until I noticed the host and the server kept looking over to our table. I was eating my housemade granola pretty slowly because I wanted to enjoy it. 

I'm sure they don't mean to look as if they want us to hurry but it's still pretty passive aggressive in its own way. I decided to just finish the bowl and leave after I lost count of  how many times the server and host kept coming to look at our table. 

Besides that little hiccup the food was good. The interior decor is cute. I think it would be a great spot if we come here on a very early morning next time and not during the rush hours of brunch."
51,banter-new-york,2020-01-05,5.0,"Good lord, the Australians know how to fix a  brunch. And a happy hour. We were looking for a late brunch on a Saturday at around 4pm-- just the time lots of places stop serving. Luckily, we found Banter, where we were immediately guided to a cozy little table in the corner.

Happy hour apparently happens every day from 2-5, inclusive of weekends, and the deals are pretty legit. I enjoyed a well-made Aperol Spritz, typically $13, for $8. 

I ordered the mushroom toast and added on a poached egg for an extra $3. This is an excellent alternative to avocado toast and should be found on more brunch menus. The mushrooms, light but incredibly savory, were rightly the highlight of the dish, but I also enjoyed the thick bed of creamy burrata that they laid on. There's also a nice little squeeze of a sundried tomato pesto, which added a sprightly savory punch of flavor. 

My boyfriend ordered the golden folded eggs, which were beautiful (the presentation reminded me of a rose), light, and delicious. Fresh salmon (extra $2) mushrooms, avocado, and kale rounded out the dish. He said it was one of the best brunches he's had in a long time. I'm inclined to agree."
51,banter-new-york,2020-02-24,4.0,"Came in for brunch with a group. Waited about 45 minutes on a Sunday at 11, which was what I expected. Vegan friendly and a cute space. The avocado toast was good, but a bit salty. Not a bad option, but nothing out of the ordinary."
51,banter-new-york,2019-09-25,4.0,"Good food, and an aesthetic yet cozy feel to the restaurant space. Got the golden folded eggs and the house-made granola. The eggs were some of the best I've had; so fluffy! The guac tasted really fresh and the peas and prosciutto paired surprisingly well with the eggs. 

The granola was good but not sure if I would get it again for the price. 

Service was a little slow but understandable because it was very busy when we went!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-10-05,3.0,"Banter is a small, cute and artsy place for brunch. The vibe the restaurant gives off is very nice and is probably great for some insta posts. However, regarding the food, it wasn't my favorite. The food wasn't bad, but it didn't leave me amazed or wanting to return again after my meal. The price for the food just wasn't worth it for me. 

I ordered the sweet potato fries with some spicy mayo sauce and 2 poached eggs on toast. I was honestly kind of disappointed, the eggs barely covered the toast and the sweet potato fries were just normal fries. My favorite part about my meal was probably the spicy mayo sauce, that was good! 

Overall, an okay place that I personally would not recommend, but if you're looking for a brunch place with a good atmosphere and don't mind paying a few extra bucks for an ordinary brunch then this is the place for you!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-10-05,5.0,"Came here for Saturday brunch. REALLY POPULAR!! The wait time around noon is about 40-60 min and glad that we put our names on the waitlist via Yelp! (Highly suggest that you do so to avoid waiting too long)

I got the chia smoothie bowl because i wanted a lighter brunch and also it was around 1:30pm when we got the seats. It was amazing! The yogurt, granola and fruits blended perfectly and it tastes so fresh. 

I also got the black breakfast tea to warm up.

Highly recommended!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-08-20,4.0,"I know it's a brunch place, but I checked it out for la cena, which was an impressive experience. First observations: the menu doesn't feel very Australian! The menu is quite short! And the vibe is cute, romantic, and quiet, although I went for a late dinner, so maybe that's why it was empty. 

My friend and I shared the beet cashew dip, which I gobbled right up. It comes with vegetables drizzled with oil. I've never had a dip like that before. It's a big portion, too! 

I got the spicy salmon salad, which was so delicious and filling. The salmon is shredded. The dressing of the salad was a bit too salty for me, but overall, I really enjoyed it. It comes with a huge avocado slice and a good number of cherry tomato slices. 

My friend got the brussel sprouts pasta, which I tried and agreed with him that it was so unique. They add honey to it! Definite must-have if you're going for carbs. 

The waitress was sweet and on top of it all. She told us that the menu rotates, so I'm intrigued to return for some Aussie brunch bites!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-09-05,5.0,"I returned for Saturday lunch with a party of 4. We reserved a table at around 11am and got seated at around 2pm. There are a lot of parks and cafes in the area where you can hang out while waiting.
I enjoyed my mushroom toast. It had a great flavor and texture profile. We also shared the Nutella French toast. It wasn't too sweet and the toppings to bread ratio was perfect.. most places I feel don't provide enough toppings. I felt very satisfied and healthy after the meal! The place was full but emptied out by the time we left at around 3:30pm."
51,banter-new-york,2019-09-25,4.0,"Added myself to the Yelp waitlist (Definitely do this! So much more convenient than waiting in person) on a Saturday morning for brunch. I had to wait around 30 minutes on the Yelp waitlist but was seated quickly once my name was up.

They had a full menu of brunch/ lunch items. I ordered the grilled chicken burger and my partner ordered the fried chicken burger. Both were decent but not the best we've ever had. The sweet potato fries that came on the side were quite tasty.

The service was quick, if perhaps a tad too quick- while they didn't rush us out, we did feel like they were trying to move the tables along to seat the next people waiting. Understandable during a busy weekend!

Overall, I liked Banter but wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. Stop by if you're in the area and can get on the Yelp waitlist ahead of time!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-12-20,4.0,"Pretty good spot. 

Food: 4/5: ordered the pulled pork sandwhich which was good but I wouldn't say it was amazing. Would order it agains

Ambience: 4/5: low key, nice, small diner with jazz music

51,banter-new-york,2019-11-29,5.0,"Have passed by this place on countless occasions but never gave it a shot.  After eating here, the unanimous consensus was ""Why have we never eaten here before?!""  Admittedly, the menu isn't extensive, but what is on the menu is really well done and wonderful.  The mushroom toast?  An absolute home run.  Burrata cheese over sourdough toast, with the most amazing artichoke and tomato pesto, topped with crimini mushrooms and (optional) a poached egg.  Total game changer.  The nutella french toast was a huge hit, as was the granola/yogurt bowl.  Service was fast, and friendly.  We were surprised how lucky we were to get a table right away (day after Thanksgiving), since there are not that many tables.  Glad we finally tried it and already looking forward to returning!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-08-18,3.0,"This restaurant has been on my bucket list for 2 months now. Waited for an hour to get a table at about 12:30 on a Saturday afternoon and though the food is good, it's not someplace extraordinary 

Chia smoothie bowl - the quantity is slightly less for one person but is good to share along with a second bowl. The berries are nice and fresh and not too sweet or sour

Greens bowl - well, one bowl is sufficient for one person in my opinion. The cherry tomatoes filled with olive oil taste really nice. The avocado on the side makes it a good healthy bowl 

Mediterranean bowl - the beet hummus is really good! It's creamy and you just can't get enough of it with the cucumber, tomatoes and feta. The number of falafels could have been more 

Banana bread - I would expect the bread to be sweet and as a person with a not so much of a sweet tooth, it was perfect. Baked to perfect, it wasn't too sweet and adds a change from the bowls

Almond croissant - it was a part of the house party on that particular day. It was nice but I have definitely had better!

Avocado toast - the sour bread avocado toast is tasty but just like anywhere else"
51,banter-new-york,2019-06-01,4.0,"Very solid brunch spot with a good amount of free nearby street parking! It was about a 30-35 min wait for 2 people at around 1pm. You can leave your number and they text you when your table is almost ready and then you have 10 min to claim your table. The wait wasn't that bad just because you can easily walk to soho and shop while you wait. 

This place is popular for their avocado toast and poached egg, so that was a must get for us. It had a generous amount of avocado and was very simple yet delicious. 

I also got the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. Highly recommend this!! I love the pickles and cole slaw with this sandwich. 

The Nutella toast was decent. Definitely have had better, but I did like that it came with strawberries, banana, Nutella to dip to your liking, and granola. Great presentation. 

I would have given 5 stars to this location because I did enjoy my food. However, I didn't like how the tables were so close together and there was no personal space. You literally have to pull the table out or push it next to another person's table in order to get out."
51,banter-new-york,2019-06-06,4.0,"I went to Banter for lunch and ordered the Avocado Toast (with a poached egg). The toast was pretty good. It had a generous amount of avocado on it, although the bread was quite hard, especially along the edges. The poached egg was an extra $3, which is not really worth it. The standard avocado toast is $13, which is an okay price.

The place has a nice bustling yet cozy atmosphere. The decor is fitting of a trendy café. The service speed is quick and the waiters are friendly and attentive.

Overall, Banter has decent food and very good service at affordable prices. I'd recommend it as a nice little spot for a lunch with one other person."
51,banter-new-york,2020-02-14,5.0,"I've been here a few times and it's always amazing! Their mushroom burrata toast is to die for (see attached). Everything on it is perfection. The 'pesto' added a nice texture, the eggs are always perfectly poached (no watery white part...), the burrata is a GENEROUS portion. Holy hell it's amazing.

The greens salad w/ added smoked salmon is my go-to though. It's just a great salad and the dressing is perfection. 

Also, Chai and matcha lattes are 10/10!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-06-26,5.0,"Came here for the aperol spritz happy hour! Needless to say all their aperol spritz were amazing and delicious! It was an extremely refreshing happy hour and my group of 6 were all satisfied with the drinks. We ended up ordering some fries which were just as delicious. The layout of the place is pretty small and shaped like a U. The only downside of it was that we were seated in front of the AC and the cold air was blowing straight as us. Not sure if there's only one AC unit in the entire establishment but we didn't stay there for too long. 

Overall, it was a great place to hang out and be and very bright and open! I plan on coming here again a couple more times before summer is officially over."
51,banter-new-york,2019-06-28,4.0,"Came here for brunch and I got their golden folded eggs ($15) and it was yummy! I love their sourdough toast and the eggs were cooked very deliciously.

51,banter-new-york,2019-11-17,4.0,"Its good. Not amazing, but good. Heads up, the menu currently is different from the pictures on yelp. I was planning to order the sweet potato smash, but they had substituted the falafel bowl instead on their menu, which was alright. It was a cute vibe, and the cappuccino was actually pretty good (and they have oat milk!).
Definitely put your name down in advance using the yelp waitlist on your phone from home (otherwise we would have had to wait at least an hour in the cold). There was a zillion people waiting, so we ate kind of quick and then headed out!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-11-17,3.0,"We came here at 8:30am on a Sunday for brunch and were one of the first people at the restaurant. The decor is cute and trendy, with plants outside. The menu is pretty big, with everything from savory to sweet brunch items. I got the folded golden eggs with toast on the side, but it was about average and I wasn't really wowed by it. The eggs were fluffy, but were a bit too much for me, and the bacon (ham) was a tad too salty. The avocado also wasn't completely ripe. The service was also a bit slow, given that we were one of the few people at the restaurant, but it was very early in the morning. 

Overall the food is average, ambiance is okay (I can imagine it feeling pretty cramped at peak brunch hour). I probably won't go back, and also am not sure it is worth waiting any more than 10-15 minutes for."

The food...not so much. Ordered a mushroom toast and it was extremely difficult to cut through the bread. Good thing the toppings made up for it. Overall, it is worth a try!"
51,banter-new-york,2020-03-13,4.0,Stopped into Banter on a Friday afternoon for a quick meal with a friend visiting the city. The service was friendly and my spicy chicken salad was delicious and the perfect afternoon snack. My friend's avocado toast was presented beautifully and flavorful as well.

51,banter-new-york,2019-02-03,4.0,"I had the opportunity to dine at Banter for breakfast with a friend on a Sunday morning. Since I had been there before and waited about 30 minutes last time I knew that earlier would be better this time around. 

My friend and I agreed to bite the bullet and go at 9 AM. We were both surprised to find out that we were the first customers they had for the day! They open at 8 AM, but it must've been a slow start to their morning. Regardless we got our choice of table and were given time to look over the menu after ordering some coffee.

When it came time to order I went with the slow cooked pulled pork sandwich ($15) while my friend got the avocado toast ($12). The pulled pork was extremely tasty and filling. Really flavorful and the added coleslaw was really great. It comes with pickles though, so if you're not a fan make sure to ask for it without.

The decor for this spot is definitely a winner. Minimalistic with pink hues and contemporary artwork throughout the interior; the restaurant allows for light to flow in naturally which gives is a bright feel. The staff is equally as bright too! Friendly and personable, they answered all of our questions without hesitation. 

Overall this is a great spot to grab brunch with anyone! Nice interior, friendly staff, and great selection all adds to the guaranteed good time you'll have dining at Banter."
51,banter-new-york,2019-04-01,4.0,"The pastel colors and worn wood interior makes me feel like I'm walking into a beach shack on some island paradise or in some vineyard. Since most of my days consist of pushing through people while shoveling a stale bagel into my mouth on the way to work, this cute and relaxing atmosphere was a welcomed escape for brunch! 

I saw a ton of photos of their Golden Latte ($5) on this page so obviously I had to contribute a photo of my own because if I don't, am I even a millennial foodie? The turmeric spice was not overwhelming and overall it was a unique experience. I don't like it a latte, but it's not bad. 

the fried chicken burger ($15) - I would not recommend. The bun is fluffy and the pickles are crisp and tangy, but the chicken slices are flat and dry and just ....just don't order it. 

pulled BBQ pork burger ($15) - wow this was super tasty and also very filling. The pork was tender and sweet and every bite was a mouthful of flavor. The sandwich came with sweet potato fries. The table next to us had some sort of aioli with their fries. I did not know that was an option until it was too late. 

Lastly the service. Bleh. It wasn't BAD, but it wasn't great either. I don't recall our waitress introducing herself. I didn't know what was worth trying. 

4/5 stars because the food and ambiance were trendy, but dining experience was ok."
51,banter-new-york,2019-12-28,4.0,"Get the golden folded eggs. I have never tried eggs like this and it certainly won't be my last time. Also, their banana bread is just okay, so I would pass on that. I was very happy with my plate, it was a nice upgrade compared to a typical plate like eggs ham and home fries. The service was prompt and courteous. If you come on a weekend, be prepared to wait or join the waitlist on Yelp!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-08-31,5.0,"Great location for a weekend brunch. Arrived at around 10:35 Sunday morning and already it was quite crowded; any later probably there would be a long queue outside. Ordered an Americano coffee, pulled pork sandwich and side of scrambled eggs. Coffee tasted standard. Pull pork sandwich was nicely seasoned pulled pork in a crispy sweet bun. The scrambled eggs were surprisingly good: creamy but not watery, soft and smooth. Highly recommended for brunch!"

My friend and I had a great time at Banter last night (a Tuesday)We made a res for 6, though it really filled up by 7. Happy hour runs 4-7 every week day-- we drank $8 aperol spritzes all night. Food is not part of happy hour.

But that's ok, because the prices were super reasonable for everything! We split the burrata appetizer-- really yummy, but not my fave burrata. I got the bucatini pasta with brussels, kale, and mushrooms. I really enjoyed and would order again.It doesn't come with cheese, which is great if you're dairy-free! My friend got the linguini and loved it. They have gluten free pasta available to swap on all dishes but the ravioli. 

We left satisfied but not stuffed and super happy with everything! They also have a small outdoor seating area, which I'd love to come back and use."
51,banter-new-york,2018-12-23,4.0,"Banter is quite a popular breakfast/brunch place in Greenwich Village. I met up with a friend who was in NYC on a business trip on an early Saturday morning (9am?) and we were lucky enough to grab a table before a large crowd started arriving less than 30 minutes after.

The menu itself was ok. I would say there wasn't a lot of selection, but they offer fresh/clean food to eat. Maybe because I don't and havent lived in NYC ever...I wasnt used to the price...but I rmeembered getting a minor price tag/ sticker shocked looking at a menu. A simply meal like an omelette and a glass of fresh juice was suddenly so expensive in NYC! :)

Overall, this place was clearly a popular place in the neighborhood. The food was ok, nothing bad..but also nothing to rave about. The tables though...we're laid out so tightly together in such a small space that it was kind of hard getting in/out of the table and to just have a more private conversation at your own table (I could hear what the tables to the left/right of me were talking about without even trying!). So, if you are looking for a nice, more quiet place to chat...this is probably it. You provably don't want to linger too long anyways because a crowd of people who are waiting for the table will probably be looking at you wanting you to leave as soon as you finish your meal already!

Overall, an ok place for breakfast...if you are looking for a trendy/more popular place to catch up with a few friends in the neighborhood."
51,banter-new-york,2020-01-26,5.0,"Just a consistently delicious spot. My husband and I are regulars here; and we keep going back because the food is delicious; and, the service is excellent. James, the manager, makes a point of remembering your name; and the rest of the staff ensures for timely orders and will never rush you no matter how busy it gets.  The prices are good, especially since you clearly get fresh, healthy food when you eat here.  Banter proves it's possible to have incredible food that's also good for you.  And, they make the best falafel I've had (and I make a point to try it as many places as I can!). 

This spot has perhaps the best happy hour anywhere.  Well drinks? Nah. This place has legit craft cocktails every single day from 2pm-5pm for $8, including the weekends. I'm hard pressed to find a glass of wine on a happy hour for that price, nevermind a small batch cocktail. All drinks are amazing, but I'm never disappointed starting with an espresso martini and rounding things out with an aperol spritz!  So come here. You won't be disappointed!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-02-27,5.0,"These Australian brunch places are great!! The layout of this tiny place is split into two wings - the left and right - when you first walk in. I was seated in the left wing. There are many tables, but space between tables are super compact. The atmosphere was warm and cozy under the heater. It has a natural and modern style because of the soft wood color and lack of decoration.

I ordered the Big Breakfast for a full, hearty, and nutritious meal. It came with two poached eggs, two pieces of sourdough bread, cherry tomatoes, mushroom, one slice of avocado, and 3 pieces of bacon. There are some arugula pieces underneath. ((Speaking of poached eggs, it is SO SATISFYING to break a perfect poached egg and watching the yolk spread out.)) It fulfills anyone's daily requirement of getting protein, veggies, and carbs. And! It was healthy and filling. At other brunches, this breakfast costs maybe $25-$30. Here, it was only $18! I think I know a steal when I see one. I would definitely recommend to others. 

I'd recommend coming here on a weekday since spaces don't fill up too fast, and to order their brunch menu. Feel free to ask for hot sauce!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-08-28,4.0,"This is the cutest Australian cafe! Smaller than expected so wait time can be long, but my friend and I got on the yelp waitlist 30-40min prior to arriving Saturday around noon, so we were seated within 5min upon arrival. We both got the golden folded eggs - I'm usually not a huge fan of eggs unless they're poached, but wow golden folded eggs is my new favorite thing! The eggs were soft, fluffy and creamy, and paired well with the green peas, prosciutto, guac and kale salad. All in all, I loved this meal. Not only was it surprisingly filling, but you also feel healthy and energized afterwards. Will be back to try other items on their menu!"
51,banter-new-york,2018-12-24,5.0,"Came here at 9am on a weekday and got seated right away. I loved how simple their menu was and ordered eggs with smoked salmon. While the meal was simple, it was absolutely delicious. Loved the avocados on the plate and the presentation was beautiful. Also ordered the matcha latte - not quite my favorite coffee here but was a nice addition to my meal.

I'd highly recommend you come here if you're looking for something simple. Also my first time trying Australian brunch!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-04-30,4.0,"Came here on a Sunday for a lovely brunch with my friend. It was kind of drizzly and I arrived at about 10:00-- there was a short wait of about 10 minutes for a few tables to clear up. The place is actually really small and cosy, but I have no qualms about it given the small wait. Do note that if you were to come at a busy time, you'd have to wait outside as there is simply no room inside.

My friend and I both ordered a soy latte, the avocado toast, and the sweet potato fries. I want to start off by saying that I LOVED EVERYTHING AND I HAVE NOTHING BAD TO SAY... AT ALL... EVEN IF I TRIED.

Their soy latte was perfectly made. I've had my fair share of lattes, and they're usually crappy. Banter knows how to make a good latte. I would come back just for their latte.

Their sweet potato fries are... the way that fries should be. Well seasoned and super crispy (none of that lame mushy type fries). I would come back just for their sweet potato fries. PS the sauce it comes with is spicy mayo.

Their avocado toast is by far the most well presented piece of toast I've ever had. And not only does she have looks, baby she tasted great too.

Ugh. I'm coming back."
51,banter-new-york,2019-12-15,4.0,A wonderful brush spot located in the village area that is sure to please everyone in your group. Open early all week and weekend and takes reservations/ live wait. It has the makings of the perfect brunch spot and boy does it come close! Personal favorites on the menu include the French Toast - perfectly made and not overly sweet with the added crunch of wholesome granola and nuts. Banter Bowl is a winner and the side of sweet potato fries with the spicy mayo - gotta have it!
51,banter-new-york,2019-01-10,3.0,"We came around 2 pm and were sat immediately. 

My friends and I all ordered cappuccinos. The appearance was cute with the foam art, however, 2/3 were cold. 

The best part of the brunch were the excellent poached eggs, perfectly cooked - 5/5 stars. The bacon on the other hand was so incredibly salty that it was difficult for me to eat. My friend requested salt for her poached eggs and 10 minutes later, the waitress apologized for completely forgetting. Overall, alright brunch spot that I wouldn't necessarily recommend."
51,banter-new-york,2020-01-27,1.0,"Worst experience ever!!!!!

The wait time is super long, more than 1hr and a half, and even there's no way to make reservations online, even they dont have any agreement with yelp, they allow people to be add on a wating list thru them, which they don't tell you when you get there, putting those people over the ones who stepped in and are waiting to be seat at the place. That's very disrespectful and unfair for people who decided to show up and wait there. 

Hope you guys find the way you fix this. After all, food was good."
51,banter-new-york,2020-01-08,5.0,"Really great food. We had the Nutella French toast, the sweet potato fries with spicy mayo sauce, and the bacon and egg roll. All delicious!!! Would highly recommend going here."
51,banter-new-york,2018-12-17,5.0,"My new favorite Australian  brunch spot! It's a small place so expect a wait, but worth checking out. My hungry cousin & I came here on a Sunday afternoon, there was a 45 minute wait, they take your number so you can walk around while you wait. I prefer to go through the photos of the restaurant's food on yelp while I wait. 
They have a coffee counter as soon as you walk in with tables on either side & many Australian waiters/waitresses ().
The food is highly quality, fresh, & satisfying. Great atmosphere & great coffee. What more could you want from brunch?
I recommend the golden folded eggs."
51,banter-new-york,2020-01-05,5.0,Avo toast was prob one of the best I ever had. The bacon egg sandwich was also amazing. Matcha and coffee lattes were tasty. Def worth the $
51,banter-new-york,2019-10-28,5.0,"Came here for a flat white on a weekday afternoon. I was immediately seated by the window at a charming little table. This cafe is overall very charming and homey. The service was on point. I enjoyed my flat white very much. The latte art was a leaf, and it was done well. They seem to have many great food options too, but I wasn't able to try them, so I'll refrain from commenting based upon visuals only!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-07-14,3.0,"Food here is okay but ambiance is great. Service is slow though so overall I would not come again. 

We did the set menu between the two of us ($40 pp). Started with the halloumi & honey, which was the best part of the meal. The crunchy breadcrumbs balanced out the chewier cheese, and the honey made it perfect. It was kind of downhill from there. The beef tartare was alright - the chunks of beef were a bit too large. The mussels were fresh but the spicy tomato sauce was kind of plain (definitely had a nice kick though). The roast half chicken was cooked well but the flavor was not outstanding. The sugar snaps were a fresh addition to the chicken though, while the mashed potatoes were very creamy with a bit of texture. Finally, the vanilla ice cream (not sure what flavor actually) with tangerines and honey for dessert. Again, nothing special but I liked it second best after the halloumi."
51,banter-new-york,2019-05-29,5.0,"Came to Banter after a workout class and was starving! I usually get avocado toast at brunch spots and I was happy that Banter's was a hearty serving. I got it without the cheese or egg to make it vegan but the  tomatoes plus spices they topped it with were delicious and made it feel well rounded. We also got coffee, a chai latte, and the beet toast with the cheese on the side. They have a tiny sitting area but we didn't have to wait for a spot on a Saturday at 10am. The service was great and the staff was friendly!"
51,banter-new-york,2018-09-30,5.0,"Everything at Banter was delicious and satisfying. The portions were great, and the waiters were very friendly.

I went with 4 other people; I tried all of their dishes; It was all good. We started with drinks and the golden latte with tumeric was incredible. Their coffee and matcha tea was good too.

Every dish came with sourdough bread that tasted like they made it that morning (although actually I think it's bought). My favorite was the beet toast.

We did have to wait 45 minutes to be seated - as Banter does not take reservations for breakfast/brunch. They texted us when the table was ready. 

All in all, we left feeling very happy."
51,banter-new-york,2019-06-03,5.0,"This is an amazing brunch spot! We came here on a Friday morning and had about a 15 minute wait, but it was worth it! The place itself is very small but decorated very pleasantly and nicely. The ambience is very lively and bus
The food came is very large portions and was cooked very well! My table had several alterations to the menu, and we were accommodated with no problem.
I ordered the ""Golden folded egg"" but swapped out the prosciutto for mushrooms for a vegetarian option. The food was served gorgeously and the portion size was very generous. 
Would recommend!"
51,banter-new-york,2018-10-25,5.0,"GREAT AMERICAN STYLE BREAKFAST PLACE!

A pleasant surprise for brunch while searching for a breakfast place in the SOHO area. 

My wife and I struggled the week we stayed in SOHO, trying to find a breakfast place that served American style breakfast; you know.... bacon, eggs and toast kinda food? Everywhere we found served too fancy of breakfast food like ricotta pancakes, almond milk sourdough French toast, caramelized onion scrambled eggs, etc. 

Banter was a great find for us! We ordered the ""2 eggs any style"" with toast, avocado toast, and Nutella french toast. All were great! Beautiful presentation and super delicious! Everything was so good! Even the simple scrambled eggs were very flavorful. 

As far as the restaurant itself, it's very small. Only a handful of tables. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. 

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for simple American food type breakfast"
51,banter-new-york,2019-10-19,4.0,"First off, love love love the atmosphere here. Light pink (aka millennial pink) is one of if not my favorite color and accents of this color were everywhere. Although it is a small space, it feels spacious and open (for a NYC restaurant ha) and is nice to people watch and enjoy some natural light (given it was a beautiful Saturday morning when we went). 

The staff was attentive and kind and the food was really nice (I loved the dishes that were used, beautiful ceramics). I got the Mushroom Toast which was something I had never seen before on a menu, always love when there is something unique on a brunch menu. It had burrata, pesto, mushrooms and some spices - a really nice combination. I thought there was a bit too much burrata and not enough pesto, although I did love the combo. The bread was also fabulous quality. I ended up needing to add salt to the dish though. My friends got the Avocado Toast (which looked fabulous) and the Pulled Chicken Salad (which I tried and it was DELICIOUS - definitely getting this next time I eat here).

Again, there were aspects of my particular dish that I wasn't crazy about but the overall experience was so nice and we didn't feel rushed out of our booth at all and got to enjoy our morning here."
51,banter-new-york,2019-11-16,3.0,"So I came into this place due to all the hype online. The wait was around 45 minutes and the yelp app and waitlist feature helped navigate that pretty easily. Remember, it's still a 20 mins wait after you check in at the door. Its doable though if you're mentally prepared before ha. My 3 stars are due to the annoying fruit flies we had to deal with, and the cramped atmosphere. The food looked amazing and was served up real quick. We really weren't  blown away by the food itself though. It was good but not amazing. Like that Captain Marvel movie, you want to like it and it has all the ingredients, and yet you remain underwhelmed . FYI We got the Nutella French toast , Avacado toast , falafel bowl and one of the burgers. I really wouldn't go back again. If you are being forced to go, get the Nutella French Toast. At the least you'll get a good Instagram photo hah‍."
51,banter-new-york,2019-11-30,5.0,"Service is JUST the average.
Flat latte is great with oat milk.
Mushroom toast with a poached egg is good."
51,banter-new-york,2019-08-30,5.0,"Banter is a modern cafe that serves a healthy menu that delivers on both flavor and nutritional content. 

The servers were immediately friendly and seated us right away. We ordered the mushroom toast and the banter bowl with salmon. 

The mushroom toast was delicious, the mushrooms themselves were cooked perfectly and sat atop a bed of cheese which I normally don't like but the ratio and flavor profile mixed well. The bread was good.

The banter bowl was chock full of vegetables and the salad dressing had an slight Asian influence that I loved. They provide plenty of smoked salmon and the freshness of the bowl hit the spot.

While most restaurants offer foods cooked without your health in mind, Banter provides a respite from these heavy foods by serving light, yet filling, dishes."
51,banter-new-york,2019-10-16,5.0,"Banter is a small, cute and great location for a Sunday brunch. And their food is delicious. My friend and I got the golden folded egg and mushroom toast. I especially love the mushroom toast, highly recommend if you love mushrooms."
51,banter-new-york,2018-09-17,3.0,"I was looking for a new brunch spot and this pop up in my yelp app. The spot is cute- I personally love the decor and how they have everything organized. The color scheme and details of the decor were very well thought out. 

The coffee was good, however I wasn't really too much of fan of the food. The food wasn't bad, but it also wasn't good. Their avocado toast had way too much olive oil and something else I could t out my finger on but it wasn't enjoyable. We wanted their chia parfait from what we had seen in the photos but we ended up with just a bowl of yogurt, mixed nuts, and berries- it didn't taste bad but it wasn't what we expected. Their air fries were the best thing we ordered.

The wait time was around 30 minutes. Their staff is friendly but I wasn't a fan of what we had and don't think I'll be going back."
51,banter-new-york,2019-12-12,5.0,"Had the Chia pudding and Bacon and egg roll. It was amazing! Couldn't be more pleased with the servers, they were all nice and friendly. 

The place is also nice and cute. Would defo go back again!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-11-17,5.0,They have the best sweet potato fries I have ever had in my life! Avocado toast is not bad. And all the food are good for Instagram.
51,banter-new-york,2019-03-13,4.0,"This is your standard Australian cafe, but they get props for being less busy on the weekends than some of their brethren (like Two Hands). I always get the golden folded eggs with smoked salmon, which is very solid. Have also wanted to try their big breakfast, but can't help defaulting to the folded eggs every time. Their scrambled eggs are so light and fluffy. Have also had the banana bread and matcha latte here, and enjoyed both!"
51,banter-new-york,2019-02-13,3.0,"3.5/5 

This is a nice spot to start off your day. The atmosphere is relaxing and the interior is aesthetically pleasing. The service was welcoming and friendly. I ordered the golden folded eggs and I enjoyed it."
52,kossars-new-york,2020-01-26,4.0,"I'd absolutely go back here. The lox pastrami is unique and delicious. I had a sesame bagel with chive cream cheese, lox, onion and tomatoe. It was exactly what I wanted. The bagel was hefty and the service was quick. The staff were very friendly and it seemed like everyone working really enjoyed what they did.  

The only thing I regret is that the bagel was not toasted. I think it would have been even better if it were. Oh well, I'll have to go again!"
52,kossars-new-york,2020-02-13,2.0,"Sweet customer service by the two ladies at the counter, but the bialy with cream cheese was so underwhelming! I was expecting the best I've had in a while, given that known they are for it, but it was like deli-level quality. It was also extremely small, like four bites. It hurts to write this, but I think Kossar's is all hype. 

Also got a green tea with honey, and it was standard. 

The search for a decent bialy in the city continues."
52,kossars-new-york,2020-01-27,1.0,"I have been living on the Lower East Side for over 40 years. And I have been a customer of Kossar's for the same length of time. i arrived at the shop around 6:15AM this morning and bought two everything bagels. When I arrived at my office there was nothing that I could find which was able to cut either bagel in half. These two bagels must have been sitting there for at least a week. I threw them out. 

This place is no longer special as there are so many good bagel places in Manhattan. A word of advice: You should think about getting out of the bagel business and trying something else."
52,kossars-new-york,2020-06-07,2.0,"Ordered through Goldbelly, bialys were almost $4 each, underbaked and disappointing. Not even close to what they used to be. Ripoff"
52,kossars-new-york,2019-12-04,5.0,"A New York institution, I absolutely love the fresh bagels and bialys they serve daily. I am so grateful to have grown up in Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I was able to enjoy their full range offering. From many flavor cream cheeses, egg Sandwiches or a simple toasted bialy with butter, my very favorite! 

I visited this past week during our trip to New York and  this place is solid. Never a miss and always a hit. My daughter ordered the bacon egg and cheese sandwich, on a toasted bagel, this sandwich was heaven, made fresh and super tasty and yummy breakfast for a cold day and I had a toasted bialy. 

If you every find yourself in the LES I highly recommend yo stop by, you won't be disappointed or hungry."
52,kossars-new-york,2020-06-06,1.0,"This place can't get an order right to save their lives. Used to love ordering from here but over the last year or two their order accuracy has dropped significantly. 3 of the last 4 orders I've placed in the past couple months were delivered with missing or wrong items, and these were simple orders too, just a couple poppyseed bagels with jalapeno cream cheese, a couple iced coffees and a couple OJs. They can't even handle that. I'd get plain bagels with plain cream cheese, or two drinks but only one bagel. Think for one second, why would I order drinks for two people but only one bagel? Hello??? 

And then when I call to get my order fixed they are often clueless until I explain the entire situation twice and then they are short and snippy with their attitude. Today I had to call twice to get my missing bagel delivered because it took longer for them to do that then it took to receive the original order! I don't know what is going on over at this place but they need to put a new system or training in place because whatever they're doing isn't working. Get it together Kossars!"
52,kossars-new-york,2020-03-28,4.0,"Bagels are fantastic. Tried a turkey, egg, and scallion cream cheese on a everything bagel, so fresh and crispy and delicious. On the pricier side but super close if you live in the LES."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-11-09,5.0,"I disagree with the other reviews -- this place deserves 5 stars no question. Let's dive in ...

Everything bagel (5/5): This is a damn good bagel. It's really a 4.75 in my eyes but I'm rounding up. I wish it was a pinch more airy but it's doughy in a delectable way. There is ample seasoning on both halves (take a note other bagel places!) and I can't ask for more. 

Onion Cream Cheese (4/5): Very flavorful. Nice chunks of onion. I'm looking for even more which is why I went with  ...

Vegetable Cream Cheese (5/5): Wow this is truly chock full of veggies! It's creamy, spreadable and packs a burst of flavor punches in my mouth. 

Eastern Nova (5/5): This is perhaps the best lox I've tried in the city. They don't mess around. It's hand-sliced so thin I can almost see through it. I wish I could buy it online in 1/4 instead of a 1/2 pound but that's my only complaint. 

Toasting Options (5/5): Three toasting options is just the cherry on top. The light option is the best because it preserves the bagel but gets the cream cheese just a little extra melty. 

TL;DR: There's a reason they've been around since 1936. A must-try for locals and tourists alike."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-12-28,3.0,Good but not amazing. 3 stars are mostly because they didn't get a super easy order right and the place was empty. I ordered a lox bagel with scallion cream cheese toasted and scooped out with capers. My bagel was only scooped out. No toasted and no capers-super easy order and they couldn't do it right. disappointed
52,kossars-new-york,2019-12-01,5.0,"A friend brought me back a Bialy from Kossar's in New York City.
It was so good .. the yeasty, home-style dough, the pop of the poppy seeds and the savoury yet sweet taste of the onion.

Unfortunately, Kossar's doesn't seem to ship to Toronto, where I live. 

Their babkas  and hamentaschen look brilliant, too, but I may never get to taste them unless I visit NYC.

If you live in New York, please go to Kossar's and try one of these things!"
52,kossars-new-york,2019-03-18,3.0,"What happened to this place? Gone is the intoxicating aroma wafting right outside the shop as you walk past it. I remember back in the day when my best friend and I would go into Kossar's to get one very warm bialy to go for 25 cents. There were no counters, just a guy standing around asking what you want. We would leave the store happy, ready to tear into the soft onion bialy. Each bite was oh so good. I can't tell you how many I have eaten there while growing up in this neighborhood. 

This morning we had it for breakfast. Yesterday we ordered 3 sesame and 3 onion bialys to bring home. If you blindfolded me, I would not be able to tell you if it was sesame or onion. I couldn't taste it nor smell what flavor it was. For all I know, it might as well have been a plain one. The softness is still there, and the veggie cream cheese that we got was delicious. What a let down, not the same bialy as I remembered. The original owner sold the business. You would think that they would have given the new owners their recipes as well, doesn't seem to be the case. The place is still bustling with customers but I think it's a generation that doesn't know what a true good bialy is supposed to taste like. 

What a disappointment!!"
52,kossars-new-york,2019-09-13,5.0,"The historic LES Jewish bialy/bagel spot!

Kossars bialys have been a staple in the Lower east side community for decades and has continued to deliver some of the best bialys in all of nyc. 

I have been coming here for years and they continue to deliver on bringing delicious bialys, onion, garlic, etc. They are all good especially with cream cheese.

If you plan to come here on a weekend i would expect a long line but it does go pretty quick and worth the wait.

In short:
- Great Bialys
- Historic LES Spot"

They also ended up getting my order wrong (where was the cream cheese??) but I wasn't going to wait another hour.

Used to come here quite a bit but this made me late for work and gave me a terrible start to the day."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-09-05,3.0,"summary -
came here because my mom was raving about it to me and so i decided to stop by. fast and friendly place. however, i kept emphasizing that i wanted cream cheese in my bagel and asked twice to make sure it was there because i got a turkey egg sandwich (no cheese). checked out and went outside to see, no cream cheese for a bagel that was $8.50 :/ yes. it was fresh, toasted and warm, but super sad to not have any cream cheese in it.

food & price: ~ $13.50 for two bagels 

everything bagel with garlic thyme cream cheese:
good ratio of cream cheese and bagel. for $5 you get a decent meal and it keeps you full for a while. warm, delicious New York styled bagel... can't beat it.

plain bagel w/ egg and turkey - so disappointed that they left out the cream cheese. would've made it so much better. for $8.50 i would only give it a 2/5 because it was SO dry!! it wasn't crowded and i kept emphasizing i wanted cream cheese in it and paid for it too!! :( 

overall - if you're on the go, im sure any bagel spot will hit a home run. nothing beats the freshness of a baked bagel in the city. much softer than anything ive ever had! they also wrap it in foil and paper to keep it warm which is nice."

I love to get a plain bagel with cream cheese and salmon here. It's super quick, they are very friendly, and their bagels are fresh out of the oven. It's a small place with no room to sit down but honestly their bagels are so delicious it'll be gone in a hot minute! I'm craving one right now just thinking about their bagels. I love it here!"
52,kossars-new-york,2019-08-22,5.0,"I wish I could use a multitude of fire emojis to describe how good this place is. 

The bagels are the best I've had in the city. I always go for the everything bagel toasted with the jalapeno and caper cream cheese OR the salmon salad + onion. 

The everything bagel is perfectly seasoned with everything. The jalapeno and caper cream cheese is salty with just a bit of spice and the salmon salad is simple but delicious. The food is *inserts another fire emoji*. 

The service is quick and efficient. I've never been disappointed. 

Their interior was recently upgraded not to long ago and they've added additional seating, which is great. They've managed to keep their classic old-time charm throughout the remodel. I always feel like I'm in Old New York when I come in. 

I have no complaints and will continue to enjoy this LES treasure.

52,kossars-new-york,2020-04-26,5.0,Great bagels at a great price with great service. Came for the first time this morning and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Will be coming back!
52,kossars-new-york,2019-11-22,5.0,Oh yeah! It's bagels and bialy beyond  your dreams and cream cheeses and smoked fish and lots of delectable Jewish style foods. Take a dozen bagels home take some of the chive cream cheese with it and you will not be disappointed in any of the bagels at the shop.And again if you can't make it to lower Manhattan you can always get these bagels shipped to you . They are larger than most bagels they are well done and tasty don't miss this place it's an iconic lower Eastside establishment.
52,kossars-new-york,2020-03-29,1.0,"This place absolutely sucks. I'm currently trying to get money back from an order that never showed after 2 hours. I called and person kept hanging up on me. Will never give this place my business again, especially with the thousands of other bagel places in NYC. We ordered one bagel sandwich and one plain bagel. How it took over 2 hours at 1 pm?? Not even the rush time, I'll never know??"
52,kossars-new-york,2019-07-29,4.0,"I come here once a week (usually Saturday or Sunday morning) for my usual:  a whole wheat everything bagel, toasted, with tofu scallion cream cheese and bacon.  The bagel is super fluffy and not overly seasoned.  The tofu scallion cream cheese is extremely creamy - it's got scallion and red onion in it.  And bacon to top it off = near perfection.  The only thing that sucks is the long line and disorganized waiting area. To avoid the confusion and waiting mess, I encourage you to wait outside.  But for goodness sake, please pay attention.  No one likes that person whose name has been called 5 times cause you were too busy on Instagram.  

Anyway, I highly recommend the combo above.  If you're worried about your breath afterwards, brush your teeth."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-10-17,3.0,"I have wanted to visit Kossar's ever since I read The Bialy Eaters: The Story of a Bread and a Lost World. Kossar's is one of the few bakeries left in the United States to make bialys. It's like a bagel but there's no hole and it isn't boiled before it's baked. I got there just after 9 on a Friday morning. I ordered 1 onion bialy and 1 Essex Street Sandwich (Pastrami Salmon, Avocado, Double Onion Cream Cheese) on a Salt Bagel. They told me they were out of avocado but I said go ahead and make it anyway. They offered me cucumber instead and I said no thank you. All components of the sandwich were very good I just should have known better than to order it on the salt bagel. It was too salty between the bagel and the fish. The Pastrami salmon was excellent though. The bialy I took a couple of bites of and it was good but not amazing. I'm very glad I got to try Kossar's but there's lots of examples of bagels in New York City that are just as good or better. Their other baked goods (Rugelach, babka, black & white cookies, etc.) looked delicious but I didn't even eat  1/2 of what I ordered."
52,kossars-new-york,2018-09-29,4.0,"Mmm first time to try a Bialy with an onion filling and it was good. I am always up for trying something new and I cannot believe that I have never tried one. I love his cousin 'The Bagel' and I spent some time in Poland where it originates from so why have I never had a Bialy? Anyways, a Bialy is similar to a bagel but a bit more chewier. You really need to have strong teeth to eat one but they are good. They are also made to be eaten on the spot and fresh so you know they are not day old!

I tried one from  Kossar's while on the Big Onion Walking tour and it was one of the stops. They seemed to be friendly when our Ethnic Food guide popped in and walked out with a bag of Bialys. 

Bialys may not be on everyone's yummy list. I do think it's aquired because some people may compare it to their favorite bagel with a schmear. It is different and that can sometimes be a good thing."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-09-15,2.0,"I came here midday on a Sunday. The place wasn't packed at all, but it took the staff a few minutes to acknowledge me (yes, I did say excuse me a few times). I ordered an Essex Street w/ everything bagel ($14). I saw the man tendered cash with his gloves on, then proceeded to make my bagel with the same set of gloves. Maybe I'm a little paranoid about a little bit of germs but I'm paying a little too much for that bs :). I brought the issue to his attention but he just laughed at my remark. At this point I just wanted to leave, so I took the bagel and my friend ate it. She said it was okay, just a little hard. 

It can just be me, maybe I'm the issue here. But I really don't want to get sick, you feel me? :)"
52,kossars-new-york,2020-04-29,1.0,Ordered bialys from Kossar's through goldbelly for $44/dozen and three came moldy.  Goldbelly has reviewed to handle the problem and blames Kossar's who seems unwilling to respond.  Very disappointed in Kossar's customer service and would not recommend ordering shipping or delivery.
52,kossars-new-york,2019-09-03,2.0,Way overhyped.  The biayls are tiny and the extra ridiculous amount of money you pay for the smear is not worth it as they little give you a tiny itty bitty scoop of cream cheese.   It's about a nickel size amount of cream cheese.  Not worth it.
52,kossars-new-york,2020-03-14,4.0,"Great bagel spot! This place has been a LES neighborhood favorite forever, and I don't know how I just discovered it. It's the perfect spot to get a bacon eggs and cheese, and their cream-cheeses are amazing! I would say their whole menu isn't created equal because some of the lox based bagels are a little over priced and ended up lackluster, but thumbs up overall on the bagels across the board! It's also a really friendly staff who looks like they're having a good time and they deal with a line well. I don't think you should expect to have an easy time doing eat-in on a weekend, but if you're patient enough to wait 5-10 minutes, that's definitely an option."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-12-27,5.0,"Yum! Not the cheapest bagel but made fresh and delicious. The egg and cheese bialy with cream cheese was a toasty, savory start an early winter morning trip to the airport. Staff was friendly as well. Highly recommend if you're in LES."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-09-19,3.0,"I've been here several times, I always give a place at least a couple tries. Being one of the only early morning bagel places in LES, I had higher hopes. 

The Everything bagels are over salted. The bagels sometimes have the texture of being day-olds. Apparently there's no option to buy 1/4 pound of cream cheeses or butter to go though, which basically every other bagel place offers. The staff generally tries hard but the service is slow. 

The only saving grace is that they have a decent variety of cream cheese selections. 

Give it a shot. Maybe it'll be an ""on"" day for them."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-01-20,4.0,"come here for the bialys & stay for ""dat schmear"" of cream cheese. 

Kossar's--the iconic bialy, bagel, & more eatery-- anchored on the Lowe East Side. Kossar's has bright clean interior old school interior with a small amount of seating. menu is posted on the wall. glass display has the cream cheeses available as well as lox. refrigerated unit has a variety of soft drinks. there's tea & coffee options as well. there are some breakfast/y sandwich options as well like bacon-egg-&-cheeses, egg sandwiches, & such. 

the toasted bialy with a heap of cream cheese is my go to. warm carby fatty smooth creamy gluttony. the bagels are fine but the bialy is where it's at--it reminds of any finely baked Jewish bready roll. so freaking good. 

the prices on some eats here seem a tad high but this is a some-times indulgence for me so it's no big deal. 

the staff? pleasant and fast. 

drops mic cuz i be all about the bialy
i out 
zzz"
52,kossars-new-york,2019-09-01,5.0,"Best bagels I've had in the area! The shmear is incredible. From the moment you walk in, you can tell the bagels are going to be bomb. It's an old fashioned place and you can't help but love it. You know you're going to get a delicious bagel from a spot like this"
52,kossars-new-york,2019-04-22,5.0,"Visited NY from Cali... and by far the best thing ive eaten during our trip. all those other ""must try"" joints dont even compare to these bagels and bialys... we came here about 4 times during our trip they were that good lol. the everything bagel with everything cream cheese was seriously the best bagel ive ever had. they add nice coarse sea salt to their everything mix to give a big pop of salty goodness, my mouth is watering just thinking about these things"
52,kossars-new-york,2020-05-10,2.0,"I tried the classic and it was disappointing and overpriced. The bagel was stale and had the consistency of old bread. The ingredients were minimal, a thin spread of cream cheese that could barely be tasted. I could get a better bagel with lox anywhere in the city. For $14.75 + tax it's a ripoff."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-11-10,5.0,"always forgotten and a lost art because no one knows how to make it anymore. even if you go to your corner bagel place more often than not it's just bread with diced onions. a real bialy should be light in the hands with a mix of doughy and airy innards, and when you bite into a bialy it should be crunchy because it isn't boiled then baked like a bagel. 

the best ever is located in the lower east side at kossars. you can surely take two dozens if your no longer a subway ride away, but nothing is like having a fresh bialy out of their oven right then and there."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-02-05,4.0,"That's a solid (everything) bagel. They have some creative bagel sandwiches, all named after Lower East Side streets. We went with the classic, with lox, onion, capers, cream cheese. Love lox. And it was a hefty portion.

The bialys was pretty underwhelming, to be honest. Just a big chunk of dough with some garlic. I guess that's what you get for $1.15.

A bit of a wait (~15 minutes), even at 2PM, but what can you do?"
52,kossars-new-york,2020-03-06,5.0,Amazing customer service! Found through an app. Got amazing bagels for half the price
52,kossars-new-york,2019-03-15,5.0,The only bagel shop in lower east side that opens before 7am. This shop has a great selection of bagels and spreads. They also have muffins. Decent selection of coffees and great selection of hot teas. This place is small with a total of maybe 10 seats but most people grab their food to go and I have never had a problem finding a spot and enjoy my breakfast there.
52,kossars-new-york,2018-12-07,1.0,"I wish there was a way to leave zero stars. I am not sure what has occurred, but a place that was once a culinary pilgrimage for me and my family seems to have been bought by a tourist family from Indiana. In addition to an unnecessary makeover which has robbed the space of any old New York charm, the focus of the visit , the bialys, have undergone an awful transformation. What was once a beloved treat adored by generations of New Yorkers as a flat 4 inch wide pillow of deliciousness, seems to have morphed into a heavy, dome shaped ball of dough that resembles a knish (see photo). 

I fully recognize that Jewish upward mobility and the suburban exodus from the city has robbed New York of some of its Jewish food heritage such as Ratners and the Carnegie Deli just to name a few. I would actually just rather see Kossar's disappear than die a slow agonizing death."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-02-10,5.0,"Kossar's was a delicious final meal on to our trip to NYC on 1/6/19 (yeah, I'm a little behind in my review!).  Thanks Team Kossar and an especially warm thank you to Trish for her gracious hospitality! 

As an out-of-towner (I'm from Nebraska, what do I know about Bialys and Bagels?), I thought the food was delicious, piled high with meats and cheeses.  I can't say enough good things about their flavorful coffees, generous portions, and clean everything.  We liked watching the bakers do their thing.  We enjoyed Sunday morn' bagels and coffee with Team Kossar so much we purchased two sandwiches for the flight home!  

Obviously the purists and locals have their own valid and educated opinions.  I can only say that having eaten at Kossar's made our trip to New York City utterly complete.  

Thank you Team Kossar for rising at O dark 30 to bake for us and have these amazing creations waiting!  You all rock!

Sincerely,
Patrick Shaughnessy"
52,kossars-new-york,2019-07-01,3.0,"It's been years since I went to Kossar's. After going to Moishe's nearby, I wanted a bialy. The bialy itself was inexpensive, but it was $3.25 for the cream cheese. I could understand if it was really good cream cheese, but it just wasn't that great to me. I think the negative reviews are right, that this place is not what it used to be."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-06-28,1.0,"Poor customer service on an internet order, a dozen bialy to be sent as a gift to a relative. Ordered Monday night, received an email on Wednesday with the tracking number saying orders received Mon-Wed would ship on the next day. Checked tracking number on Friday and the bialy were never shipped. I called and spoke to the manager. The manager told me ""Good thing you called I almost left for the day, I should have called you, I did not like the product that day so I did not ship it."" That was on Wednesday and when I called I barely caught her on Friday.

If you order via their website make sure they actually ship your order."
52,kossars-new-york,2020-01-16,1.0,"Quite possibly one of the worst bialys I've ever had, ever.

So bad. Stopped in at 8am after walking by every day, expecting a hopefully warm (if not hot!), light, airy bialy. 

Instead I got a doughy, cold, stale, tough, hockey puck. 

Super disappointed, and never again."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-12-30,4.0,"Ordered bagel and lox, a few bagels, and a spread (everyseed). All of it was good. The bagel and lox was good but not the best I've had (Russ & Daughters). Bagels and spread were very good. For me the price is also very good for the area."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-04-10,1.0,"Wow. First time here in a year and what a disappointment. What happened to this place?
This used to be a classic now it's a wannabe version of itself. Why?

They have a menu up now in marker with prices constantly going up. They have a sandwich up for 13.75?!?

They used to have  a classic breakfast I'd get  constantly for less than $7. Now the price and the taste and the overall feel is just lost. It might as well go away instead just getting mad that they forgot me ingredients like my avocado."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-11-01,3.0,Mediocre spreads (jalapeño was disappointing) and sandwiches have 'turkey bacon' which wasn't advertised
52,kossars-new-york,2019-05-25,4.0,"Great bialys and solid bagels and lox in the LES. If you haven't tried this NY institution, you should definitely check it out. My favorite sandwich is The Ludlow. Pastrami lox, horseradish and pickle cream cheese, cucumbers. It's delicious!"
52,kossars-new-york,2018-12-02,5.0,"Kossar's is solid! I've never been disappointed by any bagel or bialy there. They have nice sandwich options and will also create whatever for you; eg once I had a tomato, avocado, and egg sandwich that wasn't on the menu. It's good stuff! Just not too many spaces to sit inside."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-09-30,2.0,"I ordered a bagel behind another dude named kyle so I went by kyle s. after I paid, they ran out of everything bagels, which affected both me and the other kyle. I bought a water bottle that had a hole in it and it squirted all over the other kyle's leg."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-06-30,5.0,"Best Bialy in the city.

The garlic / thyme and the everything cream cheese are both amazing.  For under $4 and 1/5 of the wait of Russ and Daughters this place will not let you down.  The chocolate babka is also crazy and you should try it if you get the chance.  Head next door for a pickle after."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-10-09,2.0,"Came here a few times to give things a try.  First time I didn't get a good experience with the service. So decided to go again to give this place more of a chance because it has a good reputation.  I have to say the service from staff is sub par at best.  Waited in line to be acknowledged but it never happened.  The second time I changed my game and was more aggressive and was told to wait my turn while she stared at the register.  The bialys were good I initially thought but had a bialy from my local stop and shop and it was much softer and had a lot more onion flavor compared Kossar's.   The best thing there is the prepacked egg salad, white fish salad and the salmon salad.  Pricey but worth it!"
52,kossars-new-york,2019-08-09,1.0,"I was far too generous in my previous review. What this place has become is an absolute disgrace to their origins. It was a bialy shop, I should be able to judge it by walking in and just ordering a bialy and eating it. I get something that's stale and barely has any onions on it. Frankly given the history of the place it's absolutely appalling that this is all that's left of the only business in all of Manhattan to have ""bialy"" inits name. Go to Hot Bialys out in Queens if you want a bialy that actually tastes like one should, but it seems that the old-school fresh bakery that Kossar's used to be is just gone and there's no real substitute available."
52,kossars-new-york,2017-07-26,4.0,"I've been meaning to catch up on a recent NYC trip and all the amazing food I ate, so let's start with Kossars! I was brought here by Yelp's NYC community director, Ruggy Joesten so I knew it was going to be legit. He rarely steers me wrong when in NYC so was stoked to try it. 

Apparently this place is know for its biali, not bagel but I opted for a bagel instead. I mean, I'm pretty sure this is the birthplace of the biali but, didn't know that till after I left. Rookie mistake. Anyway, I ordered the lox and bagel breakfast sandwich that came with onions and was on an everything bagel. The result was a soft bite of heaven. The flavors played extremely well together and I appreciated the fact that the bagel was less dense than others in the NYC area. 

Oh, pro tip. I usually like my bagels toasted, but apparently it's kind of an insult to toast a legit NYC bagel. Who knew? So if you're brave enough, ask. Otherwise, do as the locals do."
52,kossars-new-york,2019-09-23,4.0,"NY bagels with a wide range of cream cheeses and quick service. Can't complain at all.

Everything, toasted with jalapeño caper CC or even better the garlic thyme CC. Highly recommend."
52,kossars-new-york,2018-09-22,4.0,This place was really built up to me and I was slightly disappointed. The bialys were very good but the bagels were average at best.  Perhaps expected too much but I believed this would be some type of a life altering experience and it was not.  Still pretty good just not the best I've ever had. In fact I've had bagels better in Florida.  The bialy's were excellent though if you were to come here I would stick with the bialy.
52,kossars-new-york,2018-09-22,5.0,"Great fast service, staff was very friendly. I love the l variety of bagels and  cream cheese spreads. I got the everything cream cheese so delicious."
52,kossars-new-york,2018-12-15,3.0,"I have to say I really miss the way Kossar's used to be. Sure, it looked less flashy on the outside but there was a certain old-world Lower East Side charm that's now missing. It's nice that there's seating inside and that there is a huge array of cream cheese and spreads to choose from. But I really miss walking in and seeing white flour on the floor and having the smell of baking bialys hit you in the face. The store doesn't smell the same anymore. They sell nice Harney & Sons tea, but I'd avoid the coffee, they aren't experienced at using the machine and burn it sometimes, but it's only about $3 so if you're not picky about how your coffee tastes, then it's a deal. The one critique I really have is that normally the music is Too Loud. I shouldn't have to yell at someone who's sitting directly across from me, they keep the music blaring and it would be so much more pleasant to have it at a low volume and something more mellow like Nat King Cole than rap or pop."
52,kossars-new-york,2017-05-15,4.0,"If you're from the New York/ New Jersey area and you are Jewish, then you grew up on bialys. Trips to the lower east side were a ritual to pick them up along with pickles and knishes. It was the routine and then maybe head up to Katz's or Rockefeller Center. My brother and I would each have a fresh, hot bialy to eat in the car and we were happy. 

Since I no longer live on the east coast, my father would bring bialys when he'd visit while I lived in Texas and being that this was my first visit since living in Oregon, I picked up a dozen to transport back. Now I haven't been to Kossar's in decades. The place is not the same as it was when I was a child. I remember chaos, I remember flour on the floors and the windows all steamed up from the baking of the bialys. Times have changed, but the bialys are still bialys and are still worth the trip downtown. I even grabbed a bag of chocolate ruggelach. Something my grandmother used to make. They were ok, but the texture wasn't right to me. They also had babka, and one can not go wrong with babka.

Nothing like a visit to ones memories past. Places like this are what make New York City great. Keep supporting the old businesses. Enjoy."
52,kossars-new-york,2018-05-14,1.0,"(review started on 10/16/16)

Bones in my whitefish salad sandwich on an onion bagel. I regret having to give a classic establishment a low review like this, but this is pretty unacceptable.

I did also try their chocolate babka, which was not bad and kept longer than I anticipated it keeping, but it was not good enough to redeem the horrible experience of finding bones in my whitefish sandwich. Yikes, seriously."
52,kossars-new-york,2018-12-24,2.0,"I'm inclined to agree with the reviewers who have proclaimed that this place is no longer what it once was after being sold to new owners. On a recent visit, the bialy was so pillowy that it was barely distinguishable from a bagel. And while pillowy might be a positive word to describe a marshmallow, I intend it here to connote the unappealing texture of excessive flour."
52,kossars-new-york,2017-10-07,5.0,"I've never heard of bialys prior to my most recent NYC visit. TBH, I didn't mean to come here...was passing it on my way to Doughnut Plant. The large crowds inside and outside piqued my curiosity to see what I was missing out on!

It just so happens that I had my very first bialy the day before at Russ and Daughters, and then I find Kossar's - famously known for their bialys! The New Yorker love of dousing cream cheese isn't really my thing, so breakfast sandwich it was! Love a great breakfast sandwich. 

As I stood there deciding what to get, the loudest New York grandparent aged couple cut me off, demanding a dozen garlic bialys, which they were out of. The demand was followed w a ""COMMEEE ONNN MANNN"" when he was informed it'd be another 20mins for more. I took a step back to give them more space, before the Grandpa turned and said to me in the most gentle way, ""oh I'm sorry sweetie, did I cut you off??"". The whole thing cracked me up. And he meant zero harm. Felt like a typical Thursday morning interaction that they get around here. 

For the history, culture, food, and service, Kossar's gets 5 stars in my books!"
52,kossars-new-york,2017-04-22,1.0,"I'm going to keep this one to the point.  

I ordered breakfast from Kossar's.  I ordered their classic sandwich without onion and an iced coffee with skim milk.   It came to $18.

CLASSIC SANDWICH: 
-LOX: Gummy/chewy/no.  
-TOMATOES: Squishy.
-ONIONS: I said no onions.  The receipt stapled to the bag said no onions.  However, for some reason, there were onions.  It's almost like they were intentionally mocking me.  
-CREAM CHEESE: The ""everything"" cream cheese was either very garlicky/oniony OR the taste of the onions that I specifically asked to not exist had permeated the entire sandwich.
-BAGEL ITSELF: Average at best. 

COFFEE: 
-No skim milk, or milk of any sort.
-No straw?  No sugar in the bag?  But you felt the need to include a take out menu? 
-Full of grinds at the bottom of the cup. 
-Dumped largely down my sink.

PRICE:
-This is partially on me for spending almost twenty bucks on a bagel and coffee anywhere outside of Russ & Daughters.  I was better off taking $18 and throwing it into the wind. 

IN SHORT: 
-If you want to overpay to have your instructions ignored, go ahead and do it."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2020-03-20,5.0,"I came across this store while googling ""Chinese tea"" and when at the store, I was very impressed by their selection. And the owner Natalie was friendly and very knowledgeable on teas. I bought eight different teas on the whim and was enjoying them for couple months. Planning now to shop there again - need to have a good stash during the current coronavirus lockdown.

In short: great experience both inside and outside (I mean, drinking their tea) the store!
SIX STARS!!!"
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2020-01-06,3.0,"Came here to pick up some authentic Chinese tea. The shop has a ton of selection from all around the globe. Tea is a little pricey. I felt the cashier was condescending as soon as we walked into the store.

I'm not tea connoisseur and rarely drink tea so as expected, I was asking questions. Every response had a dirty look as if I was stupid for not knowing anything about tea. It was intimidating and uncomfortable. I was actually tempted to just walk out based on her attitude.

I will not be coming back here because of this. I'll grab cheaper tea at a supermarket."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2019-12-31,3.0,"Didn't have the bubble tea to go as I had read about.
Lady working here was rather rude.   Great selection. Lots of 'healing blends'.  Cost per ounce for the dandelion tea (which was good), turned out to be pretty expensive.  I ended up finding another loose tea store with friendlier service."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2020-04-30,5.0,I am very happy with both the tea and the service from Sun's. I highly recommend this establishment.
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2019-06-19,5.0,"I discovered this gem by looking for loose tea leaf a few months ago, in search of Rose Jasmine Green tea. I love it!! Today I went in and purchased more of the above and a new blend which the owner said was mixed by mistake but has been a hit. It's Rose Jasmine and Lavender green tea. The business is under new ownership, I met her today, her name is Natalie and she has excellent customer service. If you want high end organic teas and health herbs, this is the place to go. They are knowledgeable and able to suggest teas in regards to what you ask them for ie: energy, focus, calming etc.  I went in for one type of tea and walked out with 5 more! Need I say more? I'll be going back again and again. :-)"
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2019-09-21,5.0,"Red is incredible. I consider myself rather asute in the world of herbs and 'super' foods -- he introduced me to many new experiences. I've been ingesting the cold-pressed black seed oil for over a month now and feel incredible. I've been taking black seed oil for a year prior to Red's suggestion on this particular brand and why he carries it instore is evident in its felt affectivness. I'm thrilled to have found such an intimate and expansive herb shop within our spralling city. Something about a visit to Sun's Organic Garden just feels right. Shall I dare say, nessecary? :)"
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2019-09-07,5.0,Great place. The guy helped my girlfriend with her upset stomach. He provided tons of knowledge about the different teas. This will definitely be our tea shop for NYC.
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2019-09-19,5.0,The selection here can't be beat. Prices are very decent for New York. The new management has tried to keep everything that made the old place awesome. I think they might have narrowed their offerings a tiny bit but there's still a tea for almost everyone. I get my herbal blends for digestion and anxiety as well as classic Jasmine green teas here. The quality of the teas is excellent and the shopkeepers will be very honest about which ones you can steep twice or use a tinier amount as well as which ones would be best for your concerns. It makes me feel like they really care about their customers and don't want to make a quick buck.
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2019-09-07,5.0,"Such a wonderful experience.  Love the tea. An amazing variety, and host is extremely knowledgeable about all tea and herbs. Must check it out!!!!"
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2017-11-08,4.0,"So based on other past reviews, I can see where everyone is coming from. Lorna does have strict rules and is quite particular about her tea, but I can't deny that I'm excited to go back again. She recommended the jasmine and rose green tea, which I have been drinking for the past five days nonstop. Her tea is beautifully fragrant and so affordable. 

Downside is that, yes, she doesn't let you smell anything and, yes, other tea places definitely let you do as a standard practice (some even let you sample the leaves). But Lorna has a great variety of teas and is conveniently located. I think I found my regular tea shop for now."

Came here for their expertise on selecting white teas as a gift for a serious tea drinker, Natalie and Red made great recommendations and even helped me gift wrap. Excellent service and price. I highly recommend and will be back. Have also told all my friends and family this is the place to go for all things tea."

Now don't go here expecting fancy atmosphere this is a small quaint shop but gives you just what you came for TEA"
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2018-07-17,5.0,"My fiancé and I stopped by this place to inquire about buying some tea in bulk for use in our wedding favors, and the owner (Lorna?) was SO amazingly helpful. She showed us which types of tea were the most popular, which would create the most volume in our containers (so we could buy less but fill up more), and even brainstormed with us on what types of tea we could mix to save even more money. She even gives a small discount when you buy in bulk. Because of her help, we saved almost $100 from what we originally expected to spend!

With that said, this place is more for the casual tea aficionado and less for the herbal remedy seeker. Lorna is not toooooo explanatory when it comes to the different tea functions. There is a huge variety to try here and you'll doubtlessly find a favorite in one of them. My personal favorite so far is the jasmine rose green tea, so fragrant!"

The shop has been in Chinatown for around 8 years now, and both locals and non-locals adore it. They have teas from all around the world ranging from moderate to higher-end prices.

The true gem of the store is the owner, Lorna, who is a sweet, knowledgeable, and patient lady. Lorna takes time guiding you through the teas and other products. 

It can be taxing living in NYC, and the products here certainly help me relax."

53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2019-07-12,5.0,It is legit. They have all the basics and beyond. Her selection of herbal teas and non-caffeinated teas are great. And has her own blend. It's a nice place to expect hidden quality in what they provide. Pretty much all my tea I need can be found here. Quality is promised as the tea shop owners manage and run business. This place is GOLD.

53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2016-03-13,2.0,"We stumbled upon Suns tea garden during a weekend adventure through Chinatown. The organic signage outside spoke to us and we decided to stop in.

We were the only people in the shop and were thoroughly impressed by all the glass jars.  Although some people say that light can damage the integrity of tea so can being exposed to too much air.  I guess it's the greater of two evils and the shop owner things air exposure is a greater danger than light.

When you walk in the walls are lined with glass jars, you'll see everything to your tradition puerh to special blends that were created for medicinal use.  

My boyfriend was looking specifically for puerh and wanted to know what the difference was between all that was offered. 

I'll assume the person behind the counter is the store owner but she was very unpleasant to deal with.  We asked her several questions as we wanted to get the best option as the tea is not cheap here.  One of the questions we asked was what's the difference between the raw and cooked tea.  Instead of describing the difference in their taste her response was one is raw and one is cooked. We repeatedly asked her this as we thought maybe she didn't understand our question and she gave us the same answer. Which provides no add value to what we already knew.

I drink a lot of tea and told my bf that the process of cooking a tea changes the flavor. So there is a taste difference but I couldn't tell him what they were.

We ended up getting some tea to try and my boyfriend says they're pretty good hence the two stars but for the price and customer service I would have probably given this place a 0 star rating.

I'm use to normal Chinatown service but I honestly felt this was atypically rude.

I'll be traveling to China in a few months and will be stocking up on teas then."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2019-02-09,5.0,"This store is the best, you must stop in when in New York, whether for the great tea's or herbs or if you need something to heal a condition.  They have everything here and they are so knowledgeable.  Actually the best kept secret in NYC, you must go.  Call before to check your hours."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2015-03-05,5.0,"To the windowwwwsssss.... To the walllllssss... To the tea fill up my (infuser) ball, down this sencha falls...

As you may have guessed, Sun's Organic Teas is filled with teas and herbs to provide an Eastern alternative approach to pharmaceuticals to cure your ailments. They have teas for relieving stress, sleeping soundly, waking up, going beserk, detoxification, increasing concentration and more. I don't know how much stock I put into all of it, but there is merit to some of it. What they do - they do well. If you want a delicious, healthy tea to wake you up in the morning either subtly or by kicking you in the tastebuds they have it. If you want a tea to relax after a long day at work or before bed, they have it. If you want a fruity tea to enjoy with dessert... You get the idea.

I love perusing the shelves (don't open the jars! the owner is quick to remind you) and have never left with under four 2-3oz bags of looseleaf teas to bring home and fall in love with. 

My favorites are the ""Brain Power"" (I need all I can get) which has cardamom, ginseng, and some other herbs mixed with green tea and the Earl Grey Lavender. They have chais, green teas, oolongs, red teas, fruity teas, white teas and everything inbetween. It's such a peaceful relaxing shop and the owner is a doll. Ciao until next time, Sun!"
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2017-03-22,4.0,"I like this tea shop and I appreciate the owner of the store. Real tea drinkers will as well. No this is not teavana or davids tea - if you're looking for that type of service go there then.... this is someone who grows her own herbs and takes a lot of pride in each and every one of those glass containers. She's very knowledgeable, very honest (what u see is what u get) - no fake persona. So if you're looking for someone to kiss your consumer butt, don't bother."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2017-01-04,4.0,"Forget Teavana and let Lorna guide you through a journey of teas.

Two things brought me to Sun's: my nasal drip that wouldn't go away after weeks and a brand new tea steeper purchase (that I ironically got from Teavana). My first visit took a lot longer than expected and when it was finally my turn (took about 30 minutes), Lorna asked me how I was feeling and made some herbal tea recommendations. 

If you aren't the chatty type and like to be in and out when picking up stuff, Sun's might not be the best place for you. Both times I've been, she's not only asked me about my ailments but also about what I've been up to. She shared a bit about her day and took her time while filling the bags with loose leaf tea. I appreciate the service, although I might leave trips to Sun's on more leisurely days.

Another note: Lorna's sometimes very helpful with suggestions and sometimes not at all. I asked about the differences between the allergy and cold/flu blends and she just mentioned that they treat two totally different ailments (I guess that makes sense). She made a recommendation but noted that if it doesn't work to not blame her because I chose to make the purchase (not that I would, but I just thought that was a strange comment to make)."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2014-01-08,5.0,"An absolute gem for loose leaf tea, especially for the non-sweetener type of people

Nice people in here also. Relaxing atmosphere as well

I think I got a pur-eh in here once and it was quite solid."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2014-10-28,5.0,"Great store!
Lorna has great knowledge of her products and for sure is a tea expert! I was in s couple of tea stores in NYC and could not find Nepalese white tea and here it is! Nice! Expensive but oh do good! A lot of other teas are from China , so many different flavors and smells, huge amounts of herbs and spices also.
Lorna is friendly but there are rules and I love it! No touching of anything in here , just great , I don't want to buy expensive organic stuff that was opened, touched and smelled by tons of people! She explains you what temperature of water to use , how long to steep and what taste to expect.
So I bought the Nepalese organic white tea, white Jasmine infused tea ( with the flower not the oil) and an ounce of Lorna's favorite black tea, can't wait to try it! She threw in a little bag of organic puh er tea she drinks, much appreciated, thank you!
I ll be back!"
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2017-10-23,2.0,"I inquired about the Gaba tea, which I had never heard of, but when I asked if it had caffeine the owner started to get the vibe of DON'T ASK QUESTIONS, JUST BUY THE TEA IF YOU WANT IT. Can't use cell phones in the store, so couldn't look up caffeine content of Gaba tea. Therefore, didn't buy it.

Packaging--you carry out a sandwich ziplock bag of tea with a permanent marker description. 
Storage--exposed to a lot of air and light in glass jars. 
Overpriced in my opinion.

My sister bought some matcha and said it tasted good, though she admittedly isn't an expert judge of good matcha. I bought an ounce of oriental beauty. It tasted ok."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2017-05-17,2.0,"I was there the same time as some other non-Asian customers who were also first time visitors. The owner was very nice to them but ignored me for ten minutes. From looking at her reviews, I'm not surprised to see that the ones from Asian reviewers mostly report her bad attitude, but the ones from non-Asians do not.  

Honestly, the tea here is the same you can find at any other mom and pop style tea shop. Just because it's in Chinatown and all the glass jars are presented in a way that makes this place feel homey, a lot of the non-Asians customers fall under the illusion that the tea here is somehow more authentic. 

The sweet herbal fruit tea section is indeed something you can't find at other tea shops in Chinatown. But if you're looking for traditional and well-blended Chinese tea that is premised on eastern medicine's approach to health and tea appreciation, I would not recommend this place. Their version of blended tea is more focused on organic origins but the actual blending is less nuanced."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2015-06-22,1.0,"Agree with the reviews that talk about the dizzying array of product. I first came here with a friend who had been here before, and was going back for a refill on some supplies. On that visit I thought the owner (guess her name is Lorna?) was somewhat rude to my friend, but that friend can be kind of quirky, so I chalked it up to that. Since I was there for so long, I ended up buying a powder for ""joint pain.""

I tried the powder for 2 weeks and it seemed to possibly help so I returned to this store to get another packet. This time Lorna was there alone with an assistant and immediately barked at me ""what I want"" when I came in and looked at the shelf where I thought the powder came from. Long story short, I found the whole interaction extremely distasteful especially since she 1) argued with me 2) insisted that she knew exactly what I had bought before and when I asked to look at the packet to be sure before I bought it she told me that wasn't possible. When I reached across the counter to turn it to face my way to see the color of the powder she snatched it back out of my hand and then told me I had to buy it now.

Awful. The store is truly interesting and I think her products are probably good but the hostile signs everywhere telling you about 100 things that you CAN'T do (don't touch, no pictures, no refunds, etc) and her rude and stuck up manner will stop me from ever going back. Life is too short to give your business and your life energy to people like Lorna."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2013-07-17,2.0,"I came in here for genmaicha. Came out with an ounce of genmaicha and an ounce of brain power tea for around 8-9 dollars total. 

 I wanted to learn more about tea, since I am an avid tea drinker and constantly buy tea. But, I felt like I was pulling teeth asking her questions. I asked if I could take a picture of her brain power tea in its container and she said no. She replied that she did not list the ingredients on the glass container anyway. I just wanted to take pictures, but ok. 

The genmaicha tea is average, I have tasted better elsewhere. The brain power tea is her own blend of herbs has a nice aftertaste to it."

The ""organic"" on the sign drew my eye. I entered  a small crammed shop with clear large glass jars of large size containing loose teas. All marked with info such as name and purpose of tea and recommended oz size. The minimum for purchase is 2. The proprietor was very friendly and informative. I read previous reviews and experienced nothing but kindness.  She apologized a few times for being on the phone when I came in but it was not an issue because it gave me time to peruse all of the teas and I am pretty sure that I missed some. There a A LOT. AND THEY ARE EVERYWHERE. There are several signs saying no phones and no pictures which is a result of phones being the new hottest appendage I am sure.  Who wants to greet a customer who is snapping pics and taking selfies in your shop. Believe me I understand. I. Other there are also some books for sale. Here was so much that I could have stayed for hours and Sun had a lot of instruction about how to take tea and mix etc. I am looking forward to returning here."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2014-12-17,5.0,"This is tea at its optimal.

A ""mom and pop"" style shop in the middle of Chinatown, this place sells over 1000 kinds of teas.  It's homey and comfortable, and Lorna takes so much pride and passion in her teas.  

The teas here are legitimate, a Whether it is your classic sencha and genmaicha to the exotic white pu'er or Tieguanyin, trust Lorna to guide you to her favorites, and you won't go wrong.  It's some of the best teas I have ever had.

The only downside?  The teas are expensive, and the rating of expensive is based on Manhattan prices, not Chinatown prices.  A lot of my favorite teas here are $8 - $10 an ounce.  And that's breaking the budget a bit.

I guess everyone has their splurges.  Mine is tea."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2016-01-18,1.0,"The shop seems very interesting with vast variety of jars containing tea leaves, powders, and what not.  However, friends and I went in and were ignored as the only person there at the time was on the phone.  It was my fault that I did not see the ""do not eat or drink"" sign as friends and I were eating snacks we bought from another store.   When she was done with her phone, she immediately came by and asked if we were buying anything, which a friend said yes.  She acted very paranoid and OCD, stating that she doesn't allow people to eat in her store, then went on to assist my friend who told her what tea she wanted.  The friend who was eating opened the door and went outside to complete the snacks while some of us continued to look at the shop and jars of tea, at which point she immediately rushed toward us from back of the shop telling us that we are not supposed to touch the jars.  We looked at her and saw that we didn't touch the jars, she asked what was the sound of the glass, which we explained to her was the bell she hung on the door when the friend exited the store.  She then went on and said so many people broke her jars and she doesn't like people touching them.  We replied okay, quickly made our purchase, then left.  The store seems like it has big variety of options, but the owner/staff was definitely OCD with signs everywhere about no touching, no eating, no drinking, no talking, no cell phone usage.  There were signs on each jar saying not to touch, and she definitely made us feel uncomfortable like we were 5-year-old about to trash her shop.  The irony is that there were signs behind her counter about being peaceful, accepting, smile, and relax, which were the complete opposite of what we felt."

Flavored teas contain the real herbs and flowers, not just powders. You can also shop for tea pots and other naturally-derived products (herbal soaps, etc.) up front. 

As other reviews mention, the owner gives one-on-one time to every customer, so expect a bit of a wait if there are people before you. The first time I went, I expected to just pop in and pick up a few bags of tea--and then had to wait 20 minutes because of the two customers ahead of me. But the guidance is worth the wait, otherwise you may be overwhelmed by the 100+ varieties. 

Overall, I definitely plan on stopping by whenever I'm in the area."

53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2013-05-01,5.0,"A true tea haven!

If you like tea, this is a place to visit. I've been coming here for a few months now and tried a few different teas. Talk to the lady (Lorna) and ask for specific types of tea you are looking for and you will get a recommendation. They have just under 1,000 different kinds of tea in the tiny store which even Lorna herself has only tried half of. You can buy teas for specific purpose, like detox, memory improvement, allergy, relaxation, cleanse etc. The price for basic teas is around $2.50-3.50/Oz. and more for more rare and exclusive teas.

Some of my top picks with brewing instructions include:

BLACK:
-Darjeeling (a more tannic and floral black tea)
-Assam (has some strong kick to it)
-Guatemala tea (this tea is for more adventurous drinkers as it has a very distinct flavour).
-Bring water to 212F (boiling) and steep for 3-5 minutes (depending on how strong you like it). If you steep beyond 5 minutes, it will not have more flavour but rather more bitter tannins taste.

GREEN:
-Gunpowder (classic green tea on a cheaper price range)
-Green tea with pear (dried pear adds nice subtle fruity notes but not overwhelming)
-Green tea with jasmine (jasmine adds flowery relaxing touch and makes this blend very gentle)
-Bring water to 170F and steep for 3 minutes. Don't oversteep green tea - it will start getting bitter after 4 minutes.

OOLONG:
-Oolong with ginseng (ginseng ads a nice kick to it)
-Oolong with flower of alps (if you like jasmine tea, you'll love this one. Has fruity notes in it)
-Bring water to 190F and steep for 5 minutes.

ROOIBOS:
-Rooibos with passion fruit/grapefruit (citrus adds some sugar to otherwise strong taste of rooibos).
-Bring water to 212 F (boiling) and steep for a minimum of 5 minutes. You can steep up to 10 minutes as it releases antioxidants in the tea.

Get your teas, and follow these steps and enjoy your tea!

P.S. I bought some allergy relief tea which helped me with allergy this year and it did a better job  than pills."

Even though closing time was 7:30 and I came in 2 minutes before,  the owner of the shop helped me and suggested several teas. I never felt rushed and she even gave me some tea to try. I came into the shop to buy chrysanthemum and ended up walking away with more - silver needle and jasmine tea as well She even suggested a cheaper alternative to the jasmine pearls I normally drink - jasmine leaves that were less expensive but still quite fragrant. 

Overall, a great selection and customer service."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2013-03-25,5.0,"I have been hearing of this shop from friends for quite some time, and the best advice I got was go early before Llai gets busy. Because busy she will get. This is not a shop for someone who is looking for pomegranate green tea (no judgement)and unless you are extremely knowledgeable about Chinese teas and herbs you will need her help. Also, carve out time to listen to what she has to say, one conversation quickly leads to another and another and even though you forget what sparked the conversation you learn much more than you could have hoped. 

I don't think you necessarily have to be die-hard about your herbs either, just be open-minded and hear her out. Also if you stay long enough you will witness her regular customers coming in and out buying up as much as they can of their favorites, which then leads you to a conversations about that tea or herb and you realize 'hey I need that too!' (full disclosure: I may have a bit of a shopping addiction, but at least this one is good for me..)  

I went in looking for what I thought I wanted and left with what she knew I needed. I also had a great morning chatting with her - not only did I walk away with a new brainpower and energy tea but also she deciphered a recurring dream I was having that I thought meant something completely different.  It may or may not be the true meaning but I left with such a better feeling about the day than I would have had I spent it catching up on Beverly Hills Housewives that I don't care. 

So my advice is go early, and go with time, don't be the typical 'in-and-out-I'm-super-important-and-important-things-await-me' consumer because when you have the opportunity to speak with someone passionate about their craft you shouldn't waste it."

Dropped by to wander and ended up buying two different kinds of loose leaf tea packets. One for function, the other for taste. No idea if it works, but I love teas so that's ok. I mean, who knows if vitamins work right? Roll w me here.

The shop owner certainly knows her tea materials but she is hard to engage with. As a first time visitor, I was very overwhelmed w the choices and she was reluctant to both describe the varietals or recommend something based on my preferences. It took a bit of time to get her to choose an oolong. 

In any case, visit this shop if you're looking to support a local shop but you should have an idea of what you want as there are so many choices."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2015-06-12,3.0,"I was excited to come here after reading most of the reviews, but I was only in agreement with a few of them. There are a wide variety of teas here and they are definitely organic and quality teas. But I walked in with a couple questions and had to wait about 10 minutes until Lorna, the owner, got off the phone to assist me. She made me feel really uncomfortable and seemed pretty hesitant about answering my very simple questions. She kind of acts stuck up, like her teas are the best you will find. She didn't really make me want to buy anything. I left empty handed, wouldn't be eager to come back."
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2013-02-01,5.0,"A friend of mine is pretty into green tea so I came here looking to buy some as a gift. I walked out with 546897 things. The woman running the shop is so friendly and helpful. I guess I never really realized how many different tea/herbal concoctions there are for literally.. everything. 

Considering my buddy's studying for his CFA I picked up some special green tea - the lady said it helps to study and focus. Also some herbal brain power tea for your memory, cool. Also got a couple other green tea ones.. and some fruity ones. The teas are really beautiful as corny as that sounds. They smell amazing and have pretty dried flowers in them.

I'm not much of a tea person.. but they did have cafe latte so picked some of that up for myself - yum!"
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2013-08-24,4.0,"Tea! Fresh, amazing tea. The shop smells wonderful too.
The smoked tea I bought is not as strong as I like it...but I would def go back and try some others"
53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2014-12-05,2.0,"Sun's Organic Tea Shop has a very deep selection of oolong and many other traditional teas, I was very excited about finding this shop as I am a daily tea drinker and love the entire spectrum of traditional chinese (and japanese green) teas.  

Unfortunately the owner of the shop made me feel very uncomfortable.

I found her personality very sharp, uninviting, defensive, highly opinionated and just plain rude.  I'm sure she means well, knows quite a bit about her teas and want's to make people feel good about her teas, but she is just too rough around the edges.  She also had been doing this a long time and I doubt she will ever change.  

Perhaps she will warm up to you after she gets to know you, or if I'm in there for a one on one chat with no other interruptions. I'm not sure.

She goes on and on about how her tea is organic, but honestly if you have a very good tea source from the remote areas of southern China, isn't everything ancient and very old.  I have never seen such a distinction regarding organic and inorganic teas when buying high quality teas from other tea sources.  

She also has a strict no smelling policy which I partially understand but at the same time was opposite to an article I read on the place where they said you can smell as much of the tea as you want.  So you just sort of have to buy a tea on faith without getting any kind of sense of it's smell, which for me means a lot.  

I found her very unhelpful when trying to understand more about a tea, she seemed quite impatient and uninterested in engaging in any real conversation of depth.  

She also said the ""Cha Qi"" was completely false (I'm referring too very old raw pu erh teas), and how she knows because she is a healer and practices Qigong.  Well I also practice Qigong and have had very old teas where the Cha Qi is quite real, it's a known experience with some of the old teas that this feeling is real.  So she was quite opinionated on that.  

I also bought an oz. of her finest Phoenix Oolong tea for about 17 bucks as she said there is no better Phoenix.  I tried it and it's good but I also got some at ""Bird Pick"" in Pasadena, Ca just before my trip here and I found that one to be even better (more fruity notes of peach).  So I'm not sure how good her teas really are.

Overall I was very disappointed with the service."

53,suns-organic-garden-new-york-2,2016-01-18,5.0,"Don't know too much about the named teas that sound like disease saviors, but I love this place. It's a small shop so the fresh aroma hits you as soon as you enter. The vast amount of jars never fail to amaze me. I spent around 30 minutes just staring at the jars because it was just amazing. The teas are the real stuff! The lady there was really nice and asked if I needed help, but didn't pressure me despite my long stay. Purchased a few ounces of a few different teas. Will be back for more!!!"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2020-02-22,5.0,"I really really like Joe & The Juice. I've been to multiple ones, two in New York and one in Sydney, Australia and have had great experiences. The interiors are beautiful and modern. If there was one in Portland, I would go all the time when craving  juice.

After a day of exploring in the city, my friend and I came here to take a little break and felt no rush at all with plenty of seating and an outlet for him to recharge his phone. 

My favorite is the Hell of a Nerve with just the right amount of sweetness. Probably the best juice I've had besides the watermelon breeze at Jamba."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2020-02-12,4.0,"Delicious shakes! My go to is the power shake (strawberries, bananas, and vanilla milk). Probably the best tasting shake I've gotten. My only complaint is the price! $7+ for small and $9+ for large. I would come here more often if the shakes weren't so expensive. Otherwise I love the taste and the aesthetic of the place."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-02-14,4.0,"So this place and I have a love hate relationship. It's expensive as hell. But sometimes it's just an easy place to go to for the fix you need. Or to chill for a little bit while waiting for people. That's pretty much the bottom line. 

The place is trendy and spacious though mostly always crowded even in the morning. Outlets are kinda sparse so not always the best place to work. Bonus is free WiFi.

The bathrooms are nice so when you pay $10 for juice it's a given that you can use it."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2020-02-25,5.0,"This coffee was definitely better than I expected. If you are a fan of black coffee, come here. The coffee was extremely smooth with absolutely no bitter notes or aftertaste. It was simple, no chocolate undertones or things like that. It was just a great cup of joe. Heads up! This place is cashless. Don't go walking in money in hand like I did."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2020-03-16,5.0,Love the food and employees are fun!! I love the vegan shake- they have a good vegan selection
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-05-23,4.0,"We chose this place only because it was not crowned by the time we passed by. For the same reason, we didn't give it a hope. However, the smoothies we ordered turned out amazing good and so unique. My friend ordered two drinks, and she think the special flavor might come from the dragon fruit."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2020-04-03,5.0,I've had their teas and a few of their juices. They are fantastic fresh and fast! One of my favorite juice bars in NY! Customer service is also great
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-10-26,5.0,"If I lived in NYC this would def. be my spot! Everything you need to start or keep your day going top notch:

-coffee and pressed juices: if you are like me, then this duo makes for a match made in heaven!! Let's get our coffee fix and include a turmeric shot so we can feel good about ourselves too
-bumping jams: nothing pairs better than a cool song to get things going and it's loud! Which a love!! 
-art: the vibes are bright, which mixes well everything described above. What isn't happy about a ton of color and nice decor!?

I only have one qualm: where's the cinnamon!? It would be very much appreciated from those of us who drink our coffee black and need a little spice that isn't sugar.

Sorry Starbys, but if these guys ever make their way to OC, I'm out!"

I thought it was odd that at 9:00AM they did not have freshly brewed coffee!? I called her out and asked why she would serve me old coffee? She had nothing to say. #Nevergoingback BYE JOE!"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2020-05-05,3.0,Love that you are delivering and love your juice. I don't love that the tops to your cups come off easily as my most recent order two spilled all over the place because they are not well sealed. I spent 25 dollars on juice down the drain. How about scotch taping the cup tops when delivering them?
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-10-05,4.0,Had the Herb Tonic and loved it. Good friendly service but holy EXPENSIVE. $11.50 for a 16oz...
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2020-01-13,1.0,They discriminated against me for wanting to pay cash. Dont come here. Not worth it. They need to hurry up enforce giving companies fines for not accepting cash. Anyone know when that law takes place in NYC?
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-12-19,5.0,"Really cozy space, great for studying and they have great smoothies. The sandwiches are more hit or miss. Really nicely decorated interior I think the vibe of the place is really what makes it."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-06-14,3.0,"My cousin and I came in after our workout and before she went to work nearby. During this visit, I got The Breakfast Club, which is apparently their version of an açai bowl. It comes in a plastic cup, which is handy when you're on the go. There's granola at the top and bottom with the mixture in between. It tasted blander than açai bowls I've had in the past. I'm used to seeing sliced bananas and other fruits lining this dish so it was a bit disappointing to not have that. 

The staff was very friendly and gave recommendations to help us decide what we wanted. This location is also very large. We came in around 11am on a Thursday and easily found a table to sit and hang out. A lot of people were here with laptops so it seems like a good place to get some work done. I may give this place another try because I do want to try other items on the menu."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-02-16,3.0,The juice was delicious but never waited so long for a juice.  I should've timed it cause it felt like an eternity.
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-06-13,5.0,"Loveeeee this place! Come here pretty often to get some lunch. I usually get the Joe's Club or the Joe's Green Mile juice (add a ginger shot, thank me later).  Everything tastes so fresh and natural. 

There's always lots of seating and everyone that works here is so chill and nice. Only thing to watch out for is the super loud music - def not a quiet place to sit and get your work done."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-11-29,3.0,"I'm not sure why people love this place so much. Juice options are not too creative and very expensive. It's very crowded as well.

I don't remember the type of sandwich I got but I wasn't impressed either."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-03-10,2.0,"Fun n youthful atmosphere. 
Every sandwich had it's ingredients listed below. I ordered Serrano Sandwich and it said Serrano, avocado, cheese n tomato or something like that. I goggled for Serrano just to be sure since I'm a vegetarian. Serrano peppers came up and I placed the order assuming it to be vegetarian but I got ham in the sandwich and they confirmed that Serrano is ham. They offered to exchange it so yayy for that. 

Great till now. 

The guy who took back my sandwich said he will get me one soon but he was making juice and he didn't bother telling the gal making the sandwiches to make mine. I could see that I was going to wait for a while but I hoped I was wrong and that he already told her to make my sandwich.
The gal finished her sandwich orders and then looked around and yet she wasn't told about my sandwich until I reminded him and then he told her to make a new one. 

The sandwich was grilled so much that it was burnt (attaching the pic). The gal making the sandwich and the other staff member at the counter saw that it was burnt and looked at each other with an oops expression. I didn't think she would use the same one since she put another bread in the grill. But I got the burnt bread and by the time I opened the sandwich, I had no interest to go back there again to complain or get it exchanged. 
 
2 stars - 1 for accepting to redo my order and for the ambience and the order star for the taste. More stars if u didn't spoil my sandwich especially after u saw that it was burnt."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-12-27,4.0,"Nice but expensive. 3.5 But it has plenty of space to hang out and catch up with friends. So if you spend accordingly, you can really enjoy yourself here."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-11-07,3.0,"The Gluten Free Sandwich is delicious...that is, if you can get it. Been to this location 3 times and they were out of gluten free bread. Super annoying for those of us with celiac. I'd like to be a loyal customer, but Joe & The Juice make it virtually impossible. A+ for sandwich and price, but not dependable if your looking for GF food. Don't go out of your way to visit. Chances are they are out."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-11-03,4.0,"Food and drink? Amazing! Options? Great! Customer service? Pretty good. Professionalism? None. Every food and drink option I've had has been fantastic! A little pricey, but falls in line with similar places. However, this location's staff needs a lesson on being professional. Everyone is usually shouting about personal things, talking about pay, and sometimes how they don't want to be there. I'm not personally offended, but I can see it turns a lot of customers off, and I've even seen and heard people leave because of it. I frequent this location because it's near work and I love the menu, so I thought I'd give the feedback."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-07-31,5.0,"Was directed here for a bathroom, but upon walking in I found it very inviting and well furnished inside. Definitely a perfect place to chill with friends or work on a laptop. I ordered the ""sports juice""  which is pineapple, passion fruit, and apple. It was bomb. A small was like $7 but it's probably one of the best juices I've had!"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-08-11,2.0,"I'm actually really disappointed by this Joe & The Juice. I usually get the GO AWAY DOC, but when I got it, there was not taste of the ginger. Kind of annoying because it really made the drink. Without it was just sugar. 

The bathroom was super dirty, and definitely needed to be cleaned. 

Not sure if i'll come back to this location again. ENJOY!"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-11-09,2.0,Usually like this location. Lots of space and seating. But I hate that the WiFi is super unreliable and constantly cuts in and out. I dont think they care cause they prob don't want people camping out anyways. It's a busy location.
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-01-20,1.0,"So, I had received an email and comment from Stefan in customer service at the time of the original review: He wrote that it was a mistake at the register not to permit me to pay in cash -that while credit was preferred, I should always be offered the opportunity to pay in cash. 

It happened that I tried another Joe coffee shop in midtown just this week. They refused cash again. So naturally I wrote Stefan back and he explained: 
 
""I am afraid that our US management has chosen to abandon cash handling in many of our US stores. Thus, my comment in November is no longer applicable, unfortunately. Sorry to disappoint you""

Ok, so based on the reasons of my earlier review -that customer service begins with accepting cash if I want to pay that way, and my experience that giving out my CC #s has led to some fraud, I am in fact even more disappointed. Stefan in Customer Service didn't even see this coming! 

Please look at my original review (below). And, if you are like me, prefer to pay small sums in cash, then avoid Joe the Juice. It's all about what's best for them, corporatively, not customarily."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-01-19,4.0,"A bit pricey but I keep coming back! Love their juices! I always get the power shake (strawberry, banana and vanilla milk), nothing special but they make it perfect! They make it just the way I like it! And the avocado sandwich, one of my favorites, I always get this along with the power shake. The cashier is always friendly, every location I went to, I basically order the same thing and the cashier is always friendly! It's also a great spot if you want to sit and chat with your friends or get some work done! Absolutely love them!"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2017-12-14,4.0,"The juice here is amazing. Everything is very fresh, as it should be. Worth it??? Still debatable. Overall great service though. The employees were all so kind and the atmosphere there is ""high end"" fun.  Definitely a place to hang out, go on a date or study/ catch up on work. I recommend the Prince of Green. I haven't tried too many things here since it's $$$ and I can finish a juice in less than a minute. 

But it's a cool clean place. Nice to treat yourself to once in a while. 

I would probably stick to the juices and skip the sandwiches and coffee items though."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2017-05-31,4.0,"What were you tryin' to prove, huh?! You's with the Juice!

This place is a chain, I'm on their website and most of their locations are in funked up locations. Where the heck is Hellerup? Sounds like a place that you can get some damn good baked items as well as cold fish for breakfast. 

In SOHO, Joe & The Juice is an excellent place for your morning coffee and some pretty good baked goods. The music at 8am was crankin', the space was large and tastefully decorated. How's the coffee you ask? Pretty awesome. It was a little pricey but hey, that's how Joe survives in NYC. I'm sure the prices are cheaper in Vesterbrogade.

If you're in the area, stop in and have a cuppa Joe. Or Juice which I didn't have.
Cheers!"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-12-11,1.0,Worst customer service ever. The bathroom literally had no soap. I told them 3 times and they still didn't fix it. There was one bathroom out of order so my husband went to that bathroom and took the soap from that bathroom and put it in the working bathroom. Honestly I was too grossed out to eat my sandwich bc of the whole no soap in the bathroom situation.. where were the employees washing their hands after using the bathroom. And let me tell u employees also use that bathroom. Gross!
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-07-27,4.0,"Anytime I'm nearby (this location is much better than the one on Wall St) and willing to spend $10 on a Power Shake, this is my go-to. Especially on a humid and hot as hell summer afternoon or evening, a cold Vegan friendly spot like JJ's cools me down and gives me a second (or third) wind to tackle to day. 
It's dog friendly, which is nice, though the majority of the clientele are uptight and showing off they're overpriced accessories. If you're me, you don't care about any of that crap and come for the juice! Because not everyone drinks coffee like it's water, am I right?
Taking a star because people are very rude about crowding and pushing to get their orders, and the staff do nothing about this.
Oh. And be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes minimum for your order."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-06-02,3.0,"I was looking for a coffee place in the area, and my preferred place was packed. So I went searching and found this place. I have seen this brand around and never went in. It definitely has a unique menu, that I definitely want to come back and try, but this time I only had the flat white. They didn't have any sweeteners, only sugar. The coffee was good, but not the best I have had. 

It seems like their juices or sandwiches may be better, so I will go back to try the other items. 

The place is large and has lots of seats with people in computers, just doing their thing. Seems like a nice place to hang out while having a healthy drink or meal."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-02-23,5.0,Yes yes and yessssss ! Joe& the juice you're giving me life !!!! Not a single day that I'm passing by their soho location which is tenbest location in the city and grabbing my tuna avocado toast and my iron man shake it's a must !!!! Everything there is super fresh and delish ! The staff is always so nice !! Can't wait for my next tuna avocado toast lol ! Highly recommended
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2020-01-31,3.0,"While we wish there were a few more paleo options, this is a solid place for breakfast or lunch. Acai bowl with GF granola was good not great, although could be a bit more creamy and the portion a bit bigger. Excellent tea options. Unfortunately, the sandwiches and salads contained gluten and/or dairy, so they were off limits for us."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-04-28,3.0,"I came here on a friend's suggestion. The interior of this location of Joe & the Juice is very impressive. It's beautifully decorated and the space is huge. There's also a crazy amount of foot traffic at this location. I was able to find a seat at a community table, as I waited for my friend. 

I ordered Joe's Green Mile and the Herb Tonic. The Green Mile and the Herb Tonic were good, but for the price I was expecting a lot more. The flavor was tasty but was underwhelming. 

Also the music was super loud so it was hard to talk to my friend. I would not recommend this as a place to catch up with your friend."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-05-24,2.0,"Acai Bowl... not done right. I asked to sub the raspberries for strawberries. When I received my Acai Bowl, I asked, ""where are the strawberries"" and I was told they aren't actual strawberries, but instead, they blend a strawberry frost cream into it... WHAT?!? The Acai was a dark pinkish/purple instead of purple and worst of all, had an acidic taste because of it. The portion was also small for the price. I usually get my Acai bowl from Juicy Cube. I think Joe and the Juice could improve their Acai bowls and maybe learn a thing or two from Juicy Cube."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-11-30,5.0,"5-star vibes! Love the atmosphere of this place. There's lots of seating, WiFi, tables, cool art, and sweet music. Friendly staff, good coffee. It's a nice place to hang out! Can't speak for the food or juices--prices seem high but not shockingly."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-01-04,5.0,"No longer need to travel to CPH to hit my favorite spot.  Part gallery, part club, part laptop workstation, part cafe, and part juice bar, they tic all the important boxes.  Food is delish, the staff is delightful, and design is out of this world"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-11-09,1.0,"Said they were ""out of black tea, can you just drink green"" when told no, they said well we have more in the back. Waited for over 20 min and then we were told they were definitely out, and if we wanted a refund we had to get back in line...behind 12 people. Also the restrooms are disgusting."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-04-30,5.0,"Wow - I am so disappointed that it took me this long to walk into this place. I came here for the first time for dinner on a Thursday, and it was so good that I found myself back here for lunch that same Friday. 

First of all - this place has great vibes. There are plenty of comfortable places to post up to get some work done and there is even a pretty neat photo booth in the back. I bet it gets really crazy during the day, but on a Thursday night it was pretty quiet. 

I got the avo shake and it was mind blowingly tasty. I have never had a smoothie with avocado in it before but the combination with the banana made it so creamy that it actually tasted like I was drinking a milkshake. I ended up getting the exact same shake the next day and they definitely have me hooked! 

The prices are also pretty reasonable given the quality.

Highly recommend you check this place!"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-01-22,3.0,"Looking for a casual spot to get coffee I chose this Joe & the Juice location for it's proximity to the subway as well as for the size of it's space. Every time I come here I'm surprised with how packed it is! A lot of people seem to prefer it as a communal place in the Soho area to come and work on projects, write papers, and even study! I only say that surprisingly due to the fact that their blaring their music all day, every day. 

I also ordered a $3.27 cup of coffee that (for the price) could have been a bit larger. Not trying to be a stickler, but I definitely felt that they got me on the size of the coffee for sure.

What I will say is that this place is fairly clean every single time I visit. The staff is on top of their game and always provides great service. I'd come here for the space, but order the coffee elsewhere."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-11-02,3.0,"It's a great spacious place and really good vibes all around. Lots of healthy juice and smoothie options. I tried a juice and the ginger in it was far too strong for me. Cost is high, obvi because it's healthy and trendy. I'd come here to hang out with friends, but there were also a lot of people who were working and had their computers. Music was far too loud for me to be able to concentrate so I wouldn't say it's a great study spot. Lots of seating though and it had fun decor. Worth a check out."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2017-01-17,3.0,"I LOVE the energetic and cozy ambience in here. This could easily become my place to do some less-focused/mindless work or catch up with friends. The staff are sociable and energetic, they have fun on the job. The concept of this store is great - there are a ton of cushioned chairs, pillows and round tables for hanging out. The space is paired with both coffee and a large selection of juices.

However, the reason why I rated it three stars is not the concept of the store, but what Joe & The Juice actually sells. For a pricey, cool vibes juice bar that focuses on juice, I'd expect their juices to be amazing and their coffee to be standard. However, their juices are rather disappointing. Having been to a number of juice bars, I noticed Joe's juices are very basic with an average of only 3 ingredients for $7/$8. 

I tried their Hell of a Nerve (strawberry, elder flower, banana), Sweet Beet, Avo Shake, and Yellow Latte. The first time I came here, I was choosing between Hell of a Nerve and Pick Me Up; the staff told me hands down Hell of a Nerve. It tastes reaaally good, but really sweet - literally like candy and chilled melted sugar. The Sweet Beet was just not for me. The Avo Shake is actually really good - it tastes like soft serve vanilla ice cream, but if I were thinking avo shake, I wouldn't expect my drink to taste like ice cream. And lastly, the latte is pretty standard. The way lattes work here is that they are color coded by size and that is simply the difference. They all have one shot of espresso."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2016-11-24,5.0,"This place is great!   Amazing drinks and a very comfortable and eclectic environment.   The one thing you.will notice about this spot is the Edison bulbs.   Very nice touch and it is very stylish and also has a nice color of light.   I came here to use the bathroom at first.  I love the fact that they do not make you purchase something for a bathroom code.   It makes you feel more like a person, I feel.  The style in the head is fantastic , just the same way the main area is.   I decided to try in eif their shakes and was absolutely impressed with the flavor of the energy shake.   Simple ingredients, wonderful flavor. 

They have a great number of spaces to sit and the Wi-Fi is very fast.  They even have a 5 ghz channel too!"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-04-02,5.0,"Whenever I visit New York, the first thing on my list is to visit the boys at Joe & The Juice in SoHo. The staff are amazing, friendly, and always extremely knowledgable about what drinks would suit your mood. 
I absolutely love the atmosphere of the cafe; cozy, great music, and the best spot for people watching while you enjoy your beverage. 
My favorite think to get are the juices, specifically the Sex Me Up. It's refreshing for the hot summers and just the perfect amount of sweetness from the passionfruit and kick from the ginger."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-02-19,5.0,"I am from NY and have somehow never came across this place.  When I stepped foot inside, it felt very chill. People were on their laptops, some were reading, drinking their juices/shakes, eating, and others were having a chat with their friends.  I got the chocolate shake and right away I think I entered a daydream.  It was SO delicious! Every day after that I have been daydreaming of that shake. THAT'S HOW BOMB IT WAS!"

Music is always great here, it helps to pass the time especially in this location where it takes a little bit to long to get your juice."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-10-06,3.0,Came here with my husband and step daughter. I had to leave because of the noise level was obnoxious. They waited for almost 20 mins--i had time for a full on gab sesh with my friend. They each got different juices that while were tasty---not worth the wait.
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-07-26,1.0,"I understand the price if the drink is worth it but... it wasn't. I spent almost $10 for the ""sports juice"" which was suppose to be apple, passion fruit, and pineapple. When I sipped the juice all I tasted was apple, a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. I honestly should of went to the farmers market and picked up the fruits myself. YOU KNOW YALL COULD JUST BUY A NAKED JUICE IN DUANE READ OR WHATEVER AND IT WOULD BE THE SAME
 wish I could get a refund (  )



Thanks for reviewing my comments Stefan! It's appreciated!!"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2017-08-30,3.0,"This particular location is large but overrun by tourists and passersby looking to rest their feet or simply to use the facilities. That being said, I think it is much more crowded than it should be. I'm also not sure what they are going for with the loud club music. Overall, this place just gives off a strange vibe like it doesn't quite know where it belongs. 

We stopped by because I'd been wanting to try this juice bar chain for ages, but I ended up being more in the mood for coffee than juice. The iced latte was fine, and strong enough for what I needed. I found it interesting that they offer four different latte sizes, with the smallest being four ounces. 

This was a nice place to sit and chat, but the noise and the crowding got pretty unbearable after a while."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2016-07-23,5.0,"This place is very spacious and stylish with lots of seatings, including couches. The back is like a lounge. The musics are hip hop and base instrumental, and they are happily loud. Great place to chill and get 'some' works done. 

Ordered a large Joe's Organic Root Juice. Very fresh, gingery and really delicious. Interestingly they put a little bit of ice cubes in the juice but they all dissolves at the last sip. They even have sandwiches for breakfast and lunch.

Free wifi"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-12-01,1.0,"First time in on Saturday 11/30. Meeting a friend for coffee and maybe a health drink. They were out of regular coffee.  A shop that serves coffee being out of regular coffee?  Told I could order an espresso. The young lady serving me continuously scratched her arm as she spoke with me.  A definite turnoff from ordering anything that I would ear or drink from here. When the other person arrived, we immediately left.  Went to another eatery next door and had a fresh salad.  i had planned to meet another friend here, today, Sunday 11/1.  Called and changed our meet to another coffee and food establishment.  One time was enough.  Definitely won'[t be going back or recommending to others."

The volume is always UP to the point where its bumping in my head and I cant even think straight. I've been here when they play chill music and I don't understand why they go days blasting house music. This isn't a clothing store. I've talked to friends and they agree and felt the same when coming to this location, so I'm not the only one that agrees with me on this. Keep it chill/loungy/light hip hop. This is NY not Miami."

Second time visiting with a friend. Well I got a little older since last time but the music is very loud and I do believe its on a loop. Still the cutest guys making your coffee and they are in good spirits. And the low sunlight beaming in is just wonderful..."
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2017-08-17,5.0,"I had a really good time at Joe & The Juice...

Like many of the reviewers said: the music is LOUD.

It's like a party with a side of coffee and a sandwich (and maybe even a juice... I know I got all three).  The fact that the music is so loud had me a bit confused.  Should I be dancing?  They were definitely playing the hits.  That being said, it definitely had some characters busting a move.  Also, there's a photobooth in the back.  What gives?  With the lounge type atmosphere, I almost believe that dancing is encouraged.  My friend seemed to think otherwise.  The downside of the loud music is that it makes having a conversation difficult.  I can see why many people wouldn't like it.  When you come to a place like this, you just have to know what you're in for.  So why not share my review?  

Decor: 100 points.  It's cozy and spacious at the same damn time!  I really loved the contemporary decor.

Food:  They have an offering of 6 sandwiches.  I got the Tunacado.  It was really delicious!  The bread is like some large delicious cracker and the tuna salad is perfect with just the right amount of mayo, pesto, and avocado on the sandwich.  They definitely knocked it out of the park.  I got the apple, carrot, and ginger juice.  Glad I did, it was very refreshing.  Both of those items were pretty filling.  I couldn't finish my sandwich but I did finish my juice.  With a belly full, I grew tired.  So then I got a coffee.  I got the drip coffee and I thought it tasted kind of burnt.  But whatever, it gave me enough energy to write this review.  The pricing definitely matches the quality of food and drink given.

Service: The service is speedy.  One particular man at the register was a slight bit obnoxious (albeit helpful) but it kinda matched the obnoxious music so it was all good.

To the naysayers of the loud music, if you wanted a sleepy time why didn't you just go to Starbucks?"
54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2018-12-30,1.0,"They add OIL to the juices and don't tell you.
I asked to have my juice without oil (they claim it is olive oil-no idea of it's quality but could just as easily be any vegetable oil) and they got clearly annoyed by my request. Your juice will be all separated, you know! said the attendant. To which I said, that is ok with me. And he raised his eyes.
For a $9+ juice and a 20% tip request, the service and transparency should be great. 
*This same issue has happened to me 3 times in a row. My children want to go there and I kept trying to ask ""no oil"" in my juice please and they always get irritated and have even ignored my request."

54,joe-and-the-juice-new-york,2019-05-31,1.0,"Horrible. I paid 8 dollars for a juice. Carrot, apple and pineapple. The size of the cup is already super small. Which is fine if the juice is great quality. Except they ADDED SINK WATER to my juice! I saw the girl behind the counter turn the faucet on, I thought she was cleaning the machine. But then I noticed she was adding water to my order. I would never think this would be allowed. So I grabbed it , took a sip and yup, 50 percent water 50 percent juice. Instead of adding another carrot or another apple to complete the cup size, I got sink water. This place is a rip off!!!!!!! Do not go here!!! I will never step into this juice shop again. And your company should be ashamed to charge so much money for sink water. Ridiculous."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-03-25,5.0,"Cool little hidden tea spot in the city. I thought this place would be somewhat big, but it's actually this tiny spot with about 15 seats, bar style.
My friend and I ended up getting the Vietnamese coffee and a specialty tea. We also got the cool egg dish and the fluffy pancakes.
The service here is so friendly and amazing. The food was pretty great too!  Can't  wait to bring my friends here. 
This place can get busy, so try to get there some what early."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-03-17,5.0,"The decor, atmosphere, and music is great. There is jazz music playing in the background. The space is limited to about 12 bar stools. It is best for a two person outing. It is also a nice blind date spot because if things get awkward you can just stare straight at the counter and not have to face your date lol. I always take my friends here whenever they visit NYC. 

Because of the limited seatings, people normally have to wait to be seated. It's best to go on a weekday so it's less crowded. Food stops being served at 3pm. 

The food is great. I usually split the Demi-glacé omurice with katsudon and Japanese fluffy pancakes with strawberries. The omurice comes with a fluffy and slightly runny egg on top. The pancakes come with whip cream, syrup, and butter with orange rinds on the side. Fancy. 

I also order an iced coffee. It comes in a cute antique cu"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-03-11,4.0,"I've been looking forward to HI-Collar since 2017 when friend and I came at 5pm, not realizing that omurice was only during lunch service. 

This trip, we planned specifically to arrive at 10:45am for its 11am service opening. Three of us were the second group in line and by 11:20 or so, the entire counter was filled.

According to the menu, the katsu sandwich is not available until 12pm but nothing was said about the katsu for the omurice. We ordered three omurice, all with katsu. Server mentioned that unfortunately, it would take 20 mins for the katsu to be ready. No problem. However, I think they underestimated all the timing because we eventually got our food after 12pm...... and we could have added on a katsu sandwich. To say that we were hangry would be an understatement.

There really were only three employees at the restaurant. One for coffees, drinks, phone, and bills. One for pancakes and desserts. One for the omurice, pasta, sandwiches (everything savory). That's kinda why timing sucks and you may wait a really long time for your order.

Omurice was delicious, katsu was delicious, coffee was delicious. Could have served more katsu (for $6) but I truly did enjoy everything. Total was $92 for three dishes and two coffees. Brunch ain't cheap that's for sure. As long as you know what you're getting into, it's a good time."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-12-10,4.0,"Be prepared to wait in line during lunch! This place has a japanese bar set up, so about only 12 people can fit at a time. It's well worth it though because service is fantastic and their omurice was absolutely delicious!

You have options when it comes to the omurice - you can get original (ketchup) or pay a bit more for their demi or full glaze. You can also choose toppings such as pork katsu or a sausage, for an additional price. Because of how the pricing is structured, a plate of omurice can easily run to $16-$20, which I think is a bit overpriced just knowing that its two main ingredients are rice....and eggs...But even so, service was fantastic, the omurice was super soft and the atmosphere was very unique!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-11-07,3.0,"Wow I hope no one has to wait for this spot bc i dun think it would have been worth it. I loved the menu and decor but I did not realize the shop was legit just a bar counter! I love the idea, but absolutely wish it could accommodate table service. 

Food wise - I was a tad disappointed... hi-collar focuses on cafe style and comfort food? And one of the first thing I look for in comfort food is the piping hotness that indicates it was made when ordered. That small detail but important one cannot be missing for me especially when prices r not convenience store price tag. So I had the Omurice which tasted fine, I loved the fluffy eggs on top but the fried rice was borderline cold :/ I could tell that was premade n it was plated as ordered.  The hot cakes also were made before hand, but they receive enough orders throughout the day that the one I had still tasted fresh. 

No way I could say my dining experience was comfortable.  Iucky for me I came on a weekday and there was no wait.  But I don't see myself returning.. hopefully it gets to a bigger place to expand on the concept!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-10-30,4.0,"Japanese coffee shop and lunch venue by day, but a bar by night. Can it get any more interesting?

The venue space is tight, but when you can finally get into Hi-Collar the staff is very efficient with their seating methods and make the most of their small space.  Regardless of the time of day you go, be prepared for long wait times outside of the restaurant just to get in.

The food is delicious - we came for the pancakes and the katsu sando.  Definitely get the pancakes, and while the katsu sando is good it isn't spectacular (we def didn't get the hype, and although they don't state it my friends and I are convinced they serve more than 10 a day).  We did see a lot of people ordering the omurice (which looked delicious!) and definitely want to give that a try one day. We also came for their coffee - they have special roasts, and their brewing method is one that takes time and makes the coffee even more delicious.

Can't wait to try it out at night as well when it's a bar!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-11-10,5.0,"Came here on my most recent trip to NYC. I've had Hi-Collar bookmarked for ages, but never had the time to stop by. I finally carved out some time for a Saturday morning brunch here and it was well worth it!! 

The restaurant itself only seats about 10 or so people, so the wait gets pretty long. We got here 10 minutes before opening and there were probably 15 people in line already, so we waited an hour before we finally were seated. I came with one friend, and we shared the souffle pancake (takes about 15 minutes for them to prepare), the omurice, and a katsu sandwich (only available after 12pm or so). Everything was so delicious and I wish I could come back more often. The omurice was good and I wish I got the katsu add-on. The katsu sandwich itself was also delicious and perfectly crispy. The jiggly pancake was also very yummy. 

Next time I'm in town I'll definitely stop by!! The pasta dish that we did not try looked amazing, so I'm interested in trying that out!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-10-01,4.0,"I would give Hi-Collar 1 more star if the tonkatsu wasnt sooooo small.
Omurice was great! Creamy omelete with fried rice drenched in tasty demiglace is always a win win. The egg was still a little runny on the inside and the rice was flavorful.  One of the best Omurice in NYC in my opinion. Most places just overcook the egg or use rice that is way tooo soggy. Rice game was on point. It's a little bit harder than regular white rice so it has a nice texture. However, to pay like $6+ for 3 bite sizes tonkatsu seems extremely high for what it is. Instead of giving you the whole piece of pork, they just fry a giant piece and cut 3 pieces for you. Visually, not the most appealing.  For $20+ for fried egg, fried rice with a small portion of pork, seems a little high for this cheap eats japanese dish. While good, its not great to be worth $20+.

Oh yea, wait time, come early or mid afternoon."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-10-11,4.0,"Wanted to ensure a spot inside this cozy restaurant by arriving 20 minutes after opening. Despite that, the place was still half full on a Saturday morning.

Settled in at a stool (the only seating option) and was given the menu to look over. Liked the concept of being able to choose coffee beans, though I kept it simple and ordered the ""Mizudashi"" Iced Coffee ($4) to go alongside the Hotcakes w/Banana ($12.75). Coffee comes out first served in a steel cup - an even drink with no overwhelming bitterness; did not need any milk or sugar. Food comes out after 20 minutes - two thick hot powdered cakes stuffed with banana and some butter/syrup to the side. The pancakes themselves are fairly bland, even with the banana inside. However, the flavored butter and the whipped butter options helped tremendously (syrup didn't taste great). 

Service here can take a bit as the lady behind the counter has to make the coffee as well as take most of the orders from an endless supply of people. Can be 3 or 4 stars depending on what you get; come early."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-11-02,3.0,"3.5 stars? Came here for Sunday brunch with my mom. Arrived by 11:05am and the restaurant was already full since it only seats about 14 people. We thought it maybe would be less crowded since it was a rainy day and everyone was waiting outside in the rain for a table, but still seemed as busy as it could be. We ended up waiting until about noon to get seated. (Basically if you're not one of the first 14 people there when they open, you will have to wait at least this long.) 

We ordered the omurice with Demi-glacé sauce and two orders of hot cakes - one plain and one with red bean. The food comes out quickly, which is nice. They have a lot of specialty coffees and teas but we didn't order any since we already got other coffee for when we were waiting in line. I enjoyed the omurice but I've had it before at other restaurants and this one wasn't particularly better. I was a little disappointed in the hot cakes. I've had really fluffy Japanese style pancakes before and I've loved them but these basically just tasted like a thick cake and not really a pancake in anyway. 

Prices are reasonable and service was nice, but since it's so small it was literally two people working to serve everyone - one making the food and the other making the coffee/tea and taking orders. We kept having to ask the waitress to refill our waters because she was preoccupied with others and would never notice our glasses were empty (also their water glasses are surprisingly small). Also when my omurice was served, it had fallen over and was spilling out over the plate, just seemed like very rushed presentation of it since they're so busy. 

I still had a good experience but I don't think I would come back given the wait time and that I can get omurice at other less tiny restaurants."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-01-15,5.0,"When you enter this restaurant it gives you a very chic Japanese feel. Along the walls they have a wonderful collection of match boxes and they also have drip coffee. It's a very small place like 12 seats but the experience is great. One person runs the kitchen and the 2 out front run drinks, checks, sandwiches, and fluffy pancakes. Props to them. The food is good there. The katsu sandwich according to the menu is limited to 10 a day and they start serving it at 12pm. The mentaiko pasta is good and a small portion. The fluffy pancakes you need to order right away because they take a very long time to make. The parfait was good but like a one time thing for me. They also have one restroom in the back and coat hangers along the wall as well as under your seat. At night the cafe turns into a bar so go check them out for drinks!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-03-16,3.0,"This place is tiny so expect a possible wait! This was my 1st omurice, Japanese pancake and mentaiko cream pasta experience. The interior here is tiny and there is only high-chair options by the bar. It fits maybe 12 people. So large groups aren't ideal for this spot. I liked how efficient they were at taking people's orders outside prior to getting seated. If you want the pancakes, you need to give them 20 minutes to make it. We ordered it outside and it came a lot earlier than 20 minutes so that was great. I expected it to be the fluffy souffle-type pancakes but they were more cake-like in texture and were dryer. It came with whipped butter and a citrus sauce. You could add toppings inside. We chose walnuts with chocolate. I thought the citrus glaze was nice but the rest of it was just okay. The omurice came in three options: classic, demi-glaze or cream sauce. I tried the classic. It's a tomato rice with ketchup on the side and a Japanese omelette on top. I added the sausage for $2.50. The prices were pretty high. This place is located on a street with several other Japanese dining options. The mentaiko pasta (roe pasta) was nice and al dente. I liked the simple presentation. The portion was small. This place is also known for their siphon coffee. I liked how the bar area had cute Japanese match boxes on top as decor. The workers here all speak Japanese."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-01-09,2.0,"I've honestly never been so disappointed or let down from a highly rated place before. My friend had been dying to try this place but hadn't been able to the past 2 times she visited NYC, so I went with her this time when we went together. We arrived right when they opened so we avoided the line. There's only like 10 seats so it's very small and cramped. 

Food - They're known for their ""omurice"" so I had to try it. It was my first time trying omurice so I was more disappointed than usual. The omurice egg is supposed to be extremely fluffy that when you cut into it, it spills out. Well, this one did nothing as it was overcooked. I got the omurice demiglace with katsu and for the additional money you have to pay? You should get more than just a few pieces. 

My SO got a japanese fluffy pancake and they tell you to order it early because it takes a long time to make. His pancake ended up being the FIRST to come out. 

Lastly, they tried to hand us the check before they realized not everyone in our party's food was even out yet before they caught themselves. 

Biggest disappointment ever. Giving it one star because the fluffy pancakes were decent."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-10-30,4.0,"Came here for dinner with a friend on a Tuesday night and loved the mysterious vintage vibes. Because it was rainy, there was no wait! The restaurant is narrow with seating at the long bar. The interior designer paid attention to every detail and every detail was appreciated! A few of my favorite things are the stained glass bathroom door, the bathroom door handle, the gold tiled walls in the bathroom, the gold coat hangers along the back wall, and the vintage match boxes lined up on the top of the wall. LOVE.

We ordered the takoyaki (octopus balls) which were a little chewy for my liking, karaage (good) and the gyu-don (good). Portions were a bit small for the price but it saved room for dessert at Cha-an later.

Will be back to try out the daytime coffee menu!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-09-04,4.0,"I recently went here on a rainy labor day Monday and we thought that it would deter the crowds. However, this small cafe still had a line and my friends and I waited for about an hour before we were finally seated (so I guess, come early! but there are some things that you can't order until 12PM - I think the katsu sandwich?). My friends and I were starved by the time we were seated and initially, they only seated 2/3 of us because of availability but they did move us when more seats opened up. My friends and I ordered the katsu sandwich, the original omurice with katsu, milkshake and coffee. 

Overall, the aesthetics of this cafe really reminded me and my friend Nancy of a game called Persona 5 - just slightly smaller - so it definitely appealed to the nerd in us. The food was good, portioned well. Would I come back? Probably - but hopefully right around the time it opens because waiting with a hungry tummy kinda sucked!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-08-20,4.0,"Came here with a friend here on a weekday and they have the best omurice in the city! We didn't have to wait since it just opened and it does get packed easily. 

Regular omurice 4/5 stars: The egg was fluffy and it was delicious! The portion was very big and affordable.

Service: 4/5: The server was friendly and attentive! 

Would come back here to grab a quick lunch whenever I'm in the area. Note: they don't have a bathroom."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-09-23,4.0,"Very cool, eclectic little spot in the East Village! Came in on a Sunday evening pleasantly surprised to find myself a spot. Cloudy sake a must try,  shumai was delicious. They were unfortunately out of the pickles.. Can't wait to come back and try the brunch menu.
Ps. Best iced coffee to date!! I've had this to-go, a few days earlier when the daytime crowd took over the place and I couldn't get a seat."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-12-16,5.0,"I enjoyed the atmosphere of this place, even though it was really small.  I got here around noon on a Thursday, and was able to snag a seat before it got really busy.  I was greeted very warmly and perused the menu, even though I already knew what I wanted.  It looked like they had some monthly specials going on, but I opted to order the regular omurice with the demi-glace sauce.  It came out looking glorious-a heaping portion of soft, yet pillowy egg omelette perched upon a mound of tomato bacon rice, surrounded by a sheening pool of rich, luscious sauce.  I enjoyed every bite.

I didn't realize how many different kinds of drinks they offered on their menu, from shakes to floats, in addition to coffees.  I even noticed coffee beans from a coffee shop (Cirque) in Tulsa, Oklahoma that I used to frequent quite often.  What a small world!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-02-06,1.0,"My egg was  overcooked, no melting at all. I was so disappointed that I didn't have the mood to take the picture to prove it. The Katsu was dry and no flavor 
And not juicy. If you have that, request them to change one for you till you are satisfied with it. Because they will still force you to pay 18% or higher tip. Fruit sandwich was sad too. No thick whipped cream the fruit taste not that fresh with two thin slices of toast. I can make better than this myself. I just saw a same comment in below and although the manager had responded, the situation is not improved at all. You should do better than an apology."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-06-11,2.0,"Wow.........
How does this place manage stellar reviews? Was it just me or the night I dined in? 

To start off service was very strange. Our server who took our order was very offended when I stated I would order one drink at a time. He then disappeared to be on his phone 90% of the night. Huh??! 

Our bill between two people came out to $100+ and so I figured at least the food should be good. No. Run.

Karage- MUSHY, luke warm at best and just ughhhh. This dish was just so inedible we didn't even take more than two bites. It's served with arugula and it just made me want to spit it out. How can karage skin be so mushy and luke warm? 

Grilled octopus: yeah, you get to grill your own but c'mon the experience is not worth they hype for chopped of octopus and some sauce 

Gyudon- Over marinated in what tasted like korean Bulgogi sauce and mushy. I think you see the trend, yeah?

Their drinks are not bad but it's definitely not worth the cost. 

Run. Go elsewhere."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-08-25,4.0,"I came early on a Thursday about 15 minutes after they opened and the restaurant was already half full. It is a very small space with only bar seating, but the decor and ambiance makes for a cool experience. They have a great brunch menu that is full of good Japanese comfort food options. I decided on the omurice with Katsu and a Japanese iced coffee. The Japanese iced coffee was a standard iced drip coffee but came in a Moscow mule type mug. The omurice was delicious! The Katsu was really thin and crispy and the egg on the rice was just fluffy enough. Service wise it was good enough and they moved very efficiently which I could appreciate. 

They had great siphon coffee options and fluffy pancakes, so I will be back to try those next time!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-02-15,3.0,"My girlfriend and I went here at 11:30 am on a Saturday. The line was out the door and we waited 2 hours before we were seated. As other reviews have stated, the restaurant is a 12-seat bar and that results in a pretty long wait.

Environment - The inside was clean and comfortable. Honorable mention goes to the Japanese toilet in their bathroom, with a heated toilet seat (a blessing during winter). However, the long wait is a real thing and should be taken into consideration. Do not come here when it's really cold/hot outside; we stood outdoors for an hour and a half until we got inside, and we were freezing in the 27° weather. 3/5

Service - There were 2 people behind the bar: one woman mainly handling orders/checks and making coffee; another woman handling the hot cakes and handing the food from the kitchen to the customers. Both were really friendly. From what I can tell the kitchen only had one chef in it, resulting in the relatively long cook times for the food. 5/5

Food - The omurice I ordered was decent to mediocre. The omelet part was nice and fluffy, and perfectly cooked. The tomato rice inside was pretty disappointing however, as it was very plain and the texture was a bit clumpy, especially contrasted with the omelet. My girlfriend got katsu as the topping, and the piece I had was pretty overcooked and wasn't juicy like a delicious freshly fried katsu would be, which I would expect for $6 extra. Also the cream sauce spilled in my demi-glace (see attached pictures) did not look good, but I let it slide. 3/5

Overall I enjoyed the dining experience, but I do not think it's worth the wait. If your friends personally recommend this place to you, you're not afraid of the wait and/or you've never had omurice before, go check it out. Otherwise, I think it's a pleasant meal but nothing special. Our total came out to be $46.3 before tips."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-06-01,5.0,"One of my favorite places in NYC. The Omurice is delicious. It's nice and silky and the presentation is beautiful. I tried both the original and the demi-glace sauce. I liked the demi-glace sauce more but both were solid! The original ketchupy sauce does have a nice presentation though! Also, the hot cakes were good, but nothing amazing. 

This place is very small and has a total of maybe 12 bar seats. So I would plan accordingly because there is usually a decent wait. I came maybe 10 minutes before they opened on a weekend and was not able to make it to the first sitting and had to wait about 45 minutes."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-08-15,5.0,"My friend suggested this place to me since she always wanted to go and try this place out. I was amazed right when I walked in. 

Positives 
* authentic, reminds me of a cafe in Japan
* love the friendly staff! 
* drinks, desserts and food are all extremely delicious 
* interior is amazing! 


Negatives 
* not enough room for us to sit. It's just a bar top, lots of people sit all together and there's no room for you to move your arms. 
* pricey items for small portions :/

A little side note: 
* This place gets filled up pretty easily so come early before all the seats get taken.
* Also, it's not really a good place for big groups."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-04-29,5.0,"Beautiful tiny space. So reminiscent of some of the spots we hit up in Japan.

We came here to try the pancake after getting some buzz about these via one of the eating blogs. I think it truly is a pancake and not the soufflé thing I've been craving since I left Japan last year. It is a good pancake but more American than that soufflé.

The coffee is great here. They really care about the process and give you a specially brewed cup. 

We also had some omurice which I'd admit is not as good as I'd imagined. Still most of the peeps in here were here for the omurice.

I'd like to come back for the bar scene. If only there was a smidge more space. Seating for maybe 12 peeps in here."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-11-12,4.0,"Single aisle, cozy / vintage feel to this Japanese restaurant/bar. The setup is somewhat reminiscent to some of the small bars in the alleyways of Golden Gai in Shinjuku, Tokyo but with more of an upscale service twist to it. Not a speakeasy, more of a dive bar in terms of setup but by no means meant to be experienced as a dive bar (not to mention the fact that you might have to wait a while to get a seat).

Nice selection of whiskeys, sakes and shochu cocktails. Falls a little short on the beer menu, but give the shochu highballs a try- they're delicious. 

This is a nice spot to hang out with a buddy or two, or for a date. Seating occupancy is about 12 people at a time (for the entire venue)."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-03-01,4.0,"Brunch perfection! Fluffy hot cakes, savory omurice (with mushrooms), pork katsu sando, aaaaand some of the best coffee the east village has to offer. Worth the wait!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-05-06,5.0,"A very popular Japanese spot so be prepared to wait, but it's well worth the wait. The quaint restaurant is a singular bar room which is intimate and warm. The menu changes somewhat often and some items only have certain quantities (Ex katsu sandwich only had 10 after 12 pm). To drink I got the pour over with a side of homemade whip cream over which was super rich in flavor and delish. Lots of great coffee options so if you are a coffee fan this is the place for you. All food options looked great but I got the tomango sandwich. It is tasty and light, a relatively small portion but very delicious.  

Definitely check this spot out if you love coffee and Japanese cuisine if don't mind waiting for it."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-06-28,4.0,"This place only has about 14 seats inside, so my friends and I came at 10:30 to wait until 11 to get in at the first seating. We were the first ones in line when we came and other people started trickling in around 10:40ish.

There is no question about it, Hi-Collar is a unique dining experience. The bar seating is beautiful and ornate, and they use antique dishes and tea cups for the coffee. The four of us wanted to try a bunch of different things, so we ordered the hot cakes, the katsu sandwich, the omurice with katsu, and the tamago sandwich. We all got our own coffees as well.

The presentation on all of the dishes was beautiful. Super delicate, super nicely plated. The hot cakes were nice and creamy and fluffy, the tamago sandwich was delicious and mysteriously fluffy and light. The katsu sandwich (limited to 10 orders a day) was good, but it was not the best katsu sandwich that I've had in NYC. I've never had the kind of omurice that you cut down the middle and it's still soft and runny on the inside. It was definitely delicious and you can tell that it requires a lot of skill to cook it. 

The coffee's were definitely on the pricey side if you get the fancy siphon coffee, but it's really a unique experience. I'm not a coffee expert, but I opted to get one of the special beans. TBH, if you're not a coffee expert, just stick with the regular house blend and you'll be perfectly happy :)"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-06-02,4.0,"I decided to visit this place because of how highly my cousin spoke of here and I'm glad I did.
This hole in the wall shop is very tiny and cute that reminds me of when I visited Japan. The seating area is right on the counter and some of the meals are prepared right in front of you. The food is a bit pricey, but normal for Manhattan and worth the try. 
The place is small, but you still have your own personal space with hangers right behind you. The wait was around 20 minutes when I went. You do feel like you're in Japan when you're there. The workers speak Japanese to each other, the setup is similar to casual Japanese dining, and there's even a bidet in the bathroom."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-04-21,4.0,"I was really excited to try this place since it offers some special Japanese food (like omurice) that are both difficult to make and rare to find elsewhere. While I enjoyed the food and have fulfilled my goal of eating here, the wait and rush made it difficult to fully appreciate the food.

We came here around 2 PM on a Sunday and waited around 70 minutes before we were seated. There were probably 10 people who got seated before us. For the first 30 minutes, there was no movement in the line at all except for people giving up and leaving. Reading the reviews, there is no way around this except coming maybe 40 minutes before opening at 10:20 AM since some people who showed up at 10:30 AM still missed the first batch to be seated. There are 12 seats in the restaurant so it's pretty hard to get seated. They were letting in all the parties as groups of 2 so I'm not sure logistically how you could seat a party of like 5 or so.

As for the food itself, I was most excited about the omurice and opening it on the rice after seeing the viral videos from Japan's The Yoshokuya Kichikichi restaurant. The omurice definitely unfolds and the egg itself is fluffy and tasty with the demi-glace sauce. The original omurice can be made vegetarian (without bacon) but the demi-glace sauce has beef in it. 

The hot cakes were good, but not amazing. They aren't meant to be as fluffy or light as some people expect since they aren't souffle pancakes and just probably having some rising ingredient (baking soda / powder) to them? I thought they were still flavorful and the presentation was cute. My boyfriend ordered the katsu sandwich which he liked but didn't love. Even though we were there around closing time, they still had this option even though the menu says they only have 10 servings a day. I also got the matcha au lait which I thought was pretty good, but I probably would opt for one of their teas next time. 

I think one of the main downsides was that they servers were always busy. There are two people who are directly across from the 12 bar (and total) seats. They not only handle the cash register, but the drinks, clearing the tables, managing the tables, washing the dishes, and making and plating the hot cakes. It gets kind of hectic which is understandable because the location is so small but it makes the service a bit lacking. For example, the water cups were so small that it was hard for the servers to pay attention and refill them when needed. Or we had to ask for the table to be cleared before the hot cakes since the servers are so busy behind the counter. Or the table next to us asked for their table to be re-wiped since there was a size-able splash of sauce that was missed the first time.

Overall, I think this is worth a visit or to bring a guest from out of town if they really want to try some of the food here. However, based on the service and the long wait times, I couldn't frequent the restaurant as much as other places in the city."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-04-19,3.0,"Standard omurice and katsu/tomago sandwiches.  Nothing really special about the place, though I suppose the ambience is nice and the staff are friendly.  Price is high for what is very standard food, and it takes a strangely long time to prepare the food.  Best food here is the egg on the omurice.  Perfectly done.  Coffee is pretty good too. 

tldr; not worth the wait in line but the food is good and ambience is nice."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-11-23,2.0,"Honestly, I was unimpressed. To be fair, I had high expectations, but for the wait and cost, I didn't think any of the food was worth it.

First off, the wait. It's to be expected, so that wasn't a problem. But be aware, that there will be a wait pretty much any time you go! The place is extremely tiny (about 11 counter seats total), so I would not recommend more than a group of 4 (and less if you can help it). We arrived around 10:45 on a Saturday (15 min before they open), and waited about an hour. 

FOOD: We were excited, so we ordered a lot! Between two people, we shared an omurice, a katsu sandwich, and the pancakes. The omurice was yummy but extremely basic. We all thought that we could have made it ourselves at home (definitely not presented as well, but just as well-tasting!). Plus unless you upgrade with additional ingredients, it's literally just eggs and tomato rice. For $11? Not worth it. The katsu sandwich was EXTREMELY disappointing. It came out a little cold and relatively flavorless. We kept adding sauce to try and bring out some flavor. The pickled vegetables it came with were the best part. The pancakes were actually good - they were fluffy and lightly crispy on the outside, with cream, butter and syrup on the side. They were, honestly, the only redeeming part of the meal.

The space itself is cute and clean, and the service is relatively quick. If you can make it here on a weekday when there's no wait, go for it, but otherwise I'd recommend not."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-04-06,5.0,"I love this place without reservation. Hi-Collar is a brunch experience I won't be forgetting anytime soon. If you're coming in on a weekend, expect a long wait. The place is small with only 12 or so seats and 3 people working at any given time. If you come in on a weekday, you might be a little luckier, key word might. Yeah, this place is popular and for good reason.

The menu is small and that's good. You may as well try everything on the menu. The omurice, the hot cakes, and the katsu sandwich were all experiences that made me appreciate the beauty that is food. Combine that with the intimate and cute ambiance and decor and you got a top notch brunch experience. The omurice with the demi-glace was divine with the fluffiest omelet ever. The hot cakes aren't those fluffy jiggly pancakes that's been all the rage, but the hot cakes here are something otherworldly, you don't even need toppings cause it's so good by itself. The katsu sandwich have limited servings each day so if you manage to get an order, you are in for a treat; it's a little simple, but it was absolutely delicious. 

Oh, was the food not enough for you? Grab a coffee, it's absolutely killer. And do yourself a favor and get the siphon made coffee, I doubt you'd commonly get that kind of coffee elsewhere. 

So is that enough gushing from me? Cause I could go on and on, but I guess it's better if you just go and experience it for yourself."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-11-06,4.0,"Went to Hi-Collar on a Friday for lunch around 12:30 and line was already out the door so that's how you know this place is good. There is only one row of seating at a bar counter in this tiny shop so I definitely would not recommend it for large groups. The wait for 2 ended up being around 20-30 minutes, but I wasn't really in a rush so I was fine with it. 

I loved the vibes of this place, from the gold-colored counter to the tableware on display. We decided to order the omurice with the demiglace sauce, and the tamago sandwich, and were pleasantly surprised by the flavors of both. The tamago sandwich was warm, fresh, and so fluffy and juicy! It came with sides of picked veggies and the sandwich itself also had cucumbers and mayo. So delish and light! The omurice was also very good, and the sweet & savory demiglace sauce made all the difference. The egg was perfectly cooked and paired really well with the tomato (ketchup?) fried rice beneath. The portions are a bit small, so if I ever come again, I will probably add some more toppings onto the omurice or order another dish. All in all, Hi-Collor is a cute little restaurant in the East Village that I would definitely come back to, probably during more off-peak hours though."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-09-23,3.0,"Hi-Collar had been on my list of places to visit in the city for so long, and I finally managed to check it off my list. I arrived at 10:45 on a Saturday morning just to make sure that we'd be able to get in with the first batch of  customers. Luckily, we were the third group in line so there was nothing really to worry about. Since it's a small space, everyone got quite cozy once we were seated.

Everything on the menu looked delicious, and honestly, we had to keep ourselves from ordering just about everything. We ended up deciding on the Original Omurice (no additions), the Mentai Cream Pasta, and the Hot Cakes with Strawberries. Perhaps my expectation of these dishes were much too high, but all of them failed to meet what I was expecting.

1) Omurice -- The eggs were fluffy, but in my mind, I thought it would be a little more runny (think the videos that show the omelette being cut open and the eggs just flowing down the sides). However, they were fine. The rice inside was just okay as well. It was a little hard and didn't really taste like anything special.

2) Hot Cakes -- The girl burned our pancakes a bit, and they didn't really taste like anything that I couldn't get elsewhere. They were on the dry side and not very fluffy or light. You get three strawberries for the additional $2.

3) Mentai Cream Pasta -- I think that, if it weren't for the fact that I can actually make this myself, this would have been my favorite dish. However, since I didn't find the version that I make to be too far off from what they served, it didn't seem like something that I'd go out of my way for.

I'm glad that I was able to try it and make my own decisions about it. However, I'll probably go elsewhere next time."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-09-08,5.0,"Updating to 5 stars because I always have a great experience here. This time I came here for dinner and got the gyudon, berkshire sausages, and calpico shochu cocktail. All were flawless and delicious. I really like the mayo/aioli drizzle on gyudon - it goes well w the sweet marinade of the beef. Cocktail was refreshing and not too sweet. Of course, the bartender was friendly and polite as usual. All in all, it's one of the most reliable and consistent places in the city in terms of food and service quality. I always feel welcome and relaxed in the dim and warm atmosphere."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-04-26,3.0,"Came for lunch on Friday around 12:30 PM - the wait was around 40 minutes. You can't just write your name down and walk around while you wait, you have to physically stand in the line. The restaurant only has one bar with maybe 10 seats total. 

Got the siphon coffee with Hana beans and the demi-glace omurice. For the wait, not sure if it was worth it. Omurice was definitely tasty but not incredible. 

Might come back if I decided to go at an off-time when the line is shorter."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-02-10,4.0,"We came at opening, but were seated after 80 mins of waiting. This place seats only 12 at a bar, so expect to wait a looooong time if you miss first seating. No waitlists, old fashion waiting in line. 

Decor gives a European, Japanese crossover vibe. It's a tight space, but once you're seated it's very relaxing. They have smooth jazz playing in the background 

Service was super slow, but it's really bottlenecked by the kitchen. 

Aside from all this, the food and coffee were on point. 
Omurice - 5/5. Key tip is to cut the top and spread the egg over the rice. I ordered it with the demiglaze which was a sweeter sauce. Rice was firmly packed together, but the rice itself was soft. Egg is still a bit runny and so delicious. 
Hot cakes - 4/5. Novel item. It basically tasted like a dry cake, but mixed with the whipped butter and honey, it was a whole lot better. The orange butter was flavorful but clashes with the optional toppings.
Aeropress medium roast - medium roast means it's not too acidic or bitter, personally my favorite. The milk comes in a cute chick cup and the brown sugar in a jar. 

Overall, it was an extremely long wait that I would definitely avoid by coming a little before opening or after 12pm. Lunch was absolutely worth it and fairly priced."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-08-12,5.0,"Love their omurice and hot cakes! I would skip the katsu addon for the omrice though, and for the hotcakes, next time I think instead of regular flavor I want to try chocolate walnut (?). I heard their coffee is also really on point although I haven't tried it. The portions do run small and the shop itself is also very small, seating maybe 15 or so at a time, plus I think there are only 3 to 4 workers including chef, so on the weekends the wait can get kind of long =( At night it transforms into a bar and they don't sell the omurice and desserts at that time hehe otherwise I'd go more often. The ambience is really cool: it's got kind of a super retro kitschy vibe with vintage match boxes lining the top and Japanese style rice paper window pane, and the waitresses wear cute uniforms and caps. You can watch them make the desserts if you're further inside because it's all counter seating."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-03-09,4.0,"Now... expect to wait ~1 hour if you don't get there before it opens... I'd recommend getting there around 10:30ish... because we got there on a Saturday at 11:00am and we missed the first batch of people to be let in. Due to this and the small space I'm knocking one star off. 

The food... OMG. It was so so good. I loved the Omerice the egg was perfectly cooked to perfection if you split it down the middle it would open up with the goey goodness. We got the glaze and it was fantastic! 

The katsu sandwich was good but isn't something I'd order again, it was cooked to perfection with two Japanese breads in between. 

I loved the pasta, it tastes like the sea but is not off putting at all. Normally I'm not a fan of creamy pastas or fish-y things but this was great! 

HOT CAKES. Please get this, it's a must!! It basically very very good cake like bread. If you're korean it reminds me of the bread from korean bakeries it's called Castella! So good!! Must have! 

For coffee, anything here is good but it's a bit more pricey. I got the cold brew and had no regrets it was so so smooth!!!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-09-16,5.0,"Great service and awesome food. Very reminiscent of small restaurants in Japan. I was having Japan withdrawals after my trip and looked up places to get my fix. I stumbled onto Hi-Collar and decided to give it a try. I saw from the reviews that the wait time is pretty long so I got out early on a Friday to try my luck at their lunch service. I went with a friend and as a party of two we waited about 45 mins to an hour. I imagine the weekend wait to be way worse.

I ordered the omurice with demiglace and katsu and the katsu sandwich. Both were delicious. The omelet was really fluffy. I would definitely go back for their katsu sandwich again if I had two hours to kill. Overall, despite the wait, it was a great experience. With the limited seating at the bar you get a really up close and personal interactions with the cooks/servers as well."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-07-09,5.0,"Ahh man, what can I say about one of my favorite places in NYC? 

I've never ordered anything here that I didn't love. The atmosphere is pleasant, with jazz music always playing and minimal bar seating. Coffee is excellent in any preparation. I've never encountered an employee that wasn't warm and attentive. 

In my opinion, if you want the best experience possible, come on a weekday around 2pm with a friend. Better yet, a rainy weekday.  You'll likely be seated right away. Kissaten food is meant to be simple, so don't expect to have your mind blown. That said, the food is exemplary for what it is. Order the katsu sando and an omurice or the pasta special to share. Follow it up with coffee and a single order of hot cakes. It'll somehow make you nostalgic for something you've probably never experienced. It's just that kind of place."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-01-19,3.0,"We came around 11 and the line was about 40 minutes (assume a much longer line during peak hours). There were only about 15+ seats at the counter (yes the room was small), but definitely loved the ambiance.

We ordered the Japanese ice coffee (Matalapa), original omurice with sausage, demi-glace sauce with cheese, katsu sandwich, and the signature hotcake.  First, the original with ketchup was definitely better than the demi-glace sauce. The demi-glace sauce was not flavourful and quite disappointing, get the original! Loved the hotcakes and they were freshly made but could have given some more syrup. (refer to my pic). Definitely not an expert with coffee, but I liked what I got.

Service was hosted by two Japanese ladies, absolutely brilliant (the culture, the smile, the pace, loved it). The decor and ambiance are ""western-Japanese"", looks authentic, loved it too (and hard to find).

Conclusion: Loved the katsu sandwich and ice coffee, really appreciate how the pancakes were made fresh. However, taking the waiting time and hype into account, Hi-Collar did not live up to it. It's definitely a good try, but does it worth a return with a regular 40 minutes (or longer) wait? I doubt.

food 3/5
ambiance 4/5
value 3.5/5
service 4/5"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-09-06,4.0,"Stopped in here for lunch and it was really delicious. The place is really small and only has about 10-15 bar seats so you might need to wait for a seat but people don't spend too long there so seats usually clear up fast. 

I opted for their Tamago sandwich (egg sandwich) and it was absolutely delicious. The egg was so fluffy and the bread was perfect too (I forgot how yummy white bread can be). They have an extensive drink menu too including a bunch of teas and coffee. Prices are a bit expensive but worth it in my opinion for a treat yourself lunch."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-11-13,5.0,"Waited 45 mins. Worth the wait! 
DELICIOUS!!! 
Definitely coming back here, I forgot to take a pic of the omelet but that was so delicious too, we got the creamy sauce with chicken katsu as an additional topping and it is SO worth to put the chicken (or maybe I just wanted the extra protein). Coffee zenzai looked as pretty as the anime coffee jelly! And everything tasted good, looked good like the animes, so to me. WORTH WORTH WORTH!"

55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-01-29,5.0,Really unique brunch and lunch spot. Small cozy place that serves really beautifully displayed meals. You have to try the hot cakes.
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-02-19,5.0,"This place is very tiny. May be there is around 10 tiny seats in the counter. You cannot sit without accidentally touching you neighbor multiple times. Seating arrangement is really uncomfortable. And most of the time there is a queue. 

Hot cakes were really good. I added some banana and strawberry. That was even better, especially the banana. It takes about twenty minutes to make it. Omurice was good as well. It was a soft omelette on top of rice."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2020-02-16,4.0,"My parents and I frequent Hi-Collar for late-brunch (with pastries in hand, as the wait can be quite long!). Their set-up is having customers sit at a long counter, so be prepared to get cozy with strangers or to shift down to make room for another party, as patrons leave. My parents get the demi-glacé and classic, which they love--the eggs are always, without fail, airy and fluffy; I always opt for the pasta, which is hard to find elsewhere in the city, and is also always done perfectly al dente. One thing that I will say is that, even as a coffee lover, the coffee here is not very worth the price--it's good and is made manually by the kind waitstaff, but not personally worth it to me, at that price point. Overall, great place for cozy lunch/off-standard meal time eats!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-07-31,5.0,I never had a Japanese omelet rice and this place exceeded my expectations. The omelet was soft and the portion of rice to egg was perfect. The only downside to this place is that lunch time is limited and seating is tight and limited.
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-10-22,5.0,"Arrive early before opening (11AM) to make sure you get a seat! We arrived at 11:30 and had to wait over an hour to get in. There are only about 10 seats in the joint and they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived. 

Once we got in, we ordered the drip coffee, and got the classic sauce omurice with sausage, hot cakes, and katsu sandwich. The omurice was delicious though the sausage did not add very much to it. The highlight of the meal was by far the hot cakes. They were decadent with warm syrup and cream on top. The coffees we ordered were great and served in giant bowl/cups with dairy-free additives available. The chicken katsu sandwich was a great appetizer -- the chicken was crunchy and the red candied add-on was delicious as well."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-06-28,3.0,"No line at all when me and my friend went around 2 pm on Friday afternoon though half of the seats were taken inside already. Limited seats and even more limited space. It's hard to get out if there's people getting in. 

Me and my friend each ordered an omurice with the demi-glace sauce. It does take a while since there seems to be only one person working the kitchen (just a guess). By first look, it seems rather small but for someone who was moderately-hungry, it did fill me up at the end. The other good thing was how much sauce was on the sides which I loved scooping the rice and egg with. 

The cons first was the egg on top was more on the firmer side. Don't expecting the melting-wet egg look you might see online and I tried cutting it right in half too. The rice was hard and not warm like it's been prepared for a long while. Maybe it needs to be in order to mold into the shape but it deters from enjoying the taste of the omurice. 

For the price and taste, I wouldn't want to get this any more times than I have already (twice). It's just an okay that I would rather go somewhere else to get it if I want. The service is very nice and friendly. 
But am I going back again? Nah."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-06-29,5.0,"The hot cakes are to die for, this spot is on a street full of great Asian restaurants. The coffee, teas, and omurice are famous and to die for. I love the sleek interior bar setting. A perfect spot in the east village to bring a date, or enjoy a solo bite on your own. Will definitely be back!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-08-26,5.0,"This review is long overdue, but this was an amazing food experience!  Hi-Collar is easily missed due to the low-key signage, but you can tell it is a premium place to get a brunch/lunch with very nicely crafted coffees/teas and breakfast foods.  Short version is this place is tiny but mighty.  And it's true, they only seat 10 people at a time!

My boyfriend and I got there when it was already full at around 3 PM, but space was freeing up as we looked through their menu.  The hostess was extremely upbeat & sweet, because by this time, they were limited on their donkatsu.  Yes, they do run out of menu items..!  So when we ordered the katsu sandwich AND the omurice with katsu, they initally informed us that only one item would be possible.  This was okay, we just wanted to try the donkatsu at least once.  But lo' and behold, the hostess spoke to someone via phone, and someone /hand delievered/ an extra donkatsu WHILE we were waiting on our second half of the order..!  AMAZING (although, mind you, we were the only ones in the shop by this time)!

Overall, 10/10 would recommend!  My only advice is to get there as early as possible, and prepare yourself for amazing service, food & quaint ambiance. 

TL;DR:  The hostess pulled some strings for us to get an extra donkatsu with our food & we're forever grateful!  ｡･ﾟ･(ﾉ`)･ﾟ･｡"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2018-10-21,4.0,"I shall update my review since this time, we went specifically for brunch items and had a better experience here than the last. We arrived at the brunch place around 12pm on a Sunday and waited about 30 minutes in line outside the store. The waiters inside don't really tell you how long you're expected to wait for but they call you in as the tables become available. There's no way for you to put your name down and come back later either. 

We had 2 different kinds of omurice - one with Katsu and one with sausage. Both were excellent. I really enjoyed the katsu- it was so tender and juicy yet crispy on the outside. I actually wasn't a huge fan of the demi-glaze sauce that my omurice had.... it had an interesting taste to it but I just prefer the original one. If you appreciate some red wine taste in your sauce, then you might like the demi glaze one. The egg was SUPER Fluffy and delicious. I was very pleased with that. The fried rice underneath however was mediocre - nothing too amazing. It was also on the more bland side, but I was okay with that because it's nice to have some simple dishes that are made really well at the same time.

The coffee jelly dessert that came with chocolate ice cream in the end was delightful too. The jelly itself wasn't that flavorful, but the red beans, chocolate ice cream and whipped cream gave it sweetness. 

Although the food took quite a while and the whole dining experience was about an hour, it was a much better experience than last time."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-04-29,4.0,"This place only has the bar to dine at, which is pretty cool because you can watch them make coffee and all that jazz, but this means limited seating. We had a group of four and had to split our seats, but ended but being able to sit together as the host kindly asked the guy to move seats a little later on. We were there for a late lunch on a Saturday and waited about ~30 minutes (I arrived late to meet my friends, so my wait was more like 10 minutes). They close at 4 but seems like they were still taking people in or at least people were still waiting in line. 
We ordered the omurice with deli-glaze and katsu sandwich and the hot cakes. The hotcakes takes 20 minutes to prepare so order it as soon as possible (they also note this in the menu). I was really excited for the omurice with the whole egg thing as I have been wanting to learn to make it myself. It doesn't cut open since we got a piece of katsu on top of it, but it was still cool. I was surprisingly delighted by the katsu sandwich. It's a big piece of mean and quite juicy. Though it lacked a bit of flavor. The hot cakes were not as fluffy as I had hoped for but it still pretty good with one of the cream having a lemon taste to it. 
Overall is a good place because of the standard omurice and sandwiches. Not sure if it's worth the wait though. Their food presentation is spot on and the staff is pleasant. I definitely would recommend a try."
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-04-03,5.0,"LOVE this place!!

I attempted to go for lunch a few Saturdays ago around 12:30pm. There were ~10 people ahead of us and I was starting to get hangry so we went elsewhere. This time though, I was determined to get there early. We arrived on another Saturday around 11:50am and had only 1 couple ahead of us. We timed this to minimize the wait as the first round of customers (Hi Collar opens at 11) should be finishing up their meals. We still had to wait about 30 minutes. I quickly found out it was bc the 3 person team that runs Hi Collar is nonstop working - taking orders, washing dishes, making their extensive coffee drinks, and of course the food. Because of this, oftentimes they are not super quick about seating people into empty counter seats (and there are only about 12 to start!).

Our patience was quickly rewarded though when we sat down around 12:10 and were able to place an order for one of their katsu sandos (limited quantities and only available after 12pm). We also ordered:

- Demi-glace omurice: came out first - the egg was unbelievably fluffy and the demi-glace was divine

- Japanese Souffle pancakes w/ strawberries: not the supper fluffy pancakes but this takes ~20 mins to make so place this order first! The pancakes were amazing - the crust on top was so good but the best part of this was the homemade yuzu butter that came with it. I slathered it on like it was my job!! I would skip the addt'l toppings - we essentially paid $2.50 for a big cut up strawberry.

- Iced Green Tea: Standard

- Siphon Iced Coffee w. Hana Bean: had to try the famous siphon made coffee. The first sip was outstanding - super strong but no acidity. Loved the hana bean too (one of the only beans without an upcharge). 

And of course the katsu sando was amazingggg. It came with an egg mayo mustard topping on the side which I happily slathered on but it really did not need it. Perfection but make sure you eat it while it's hot!

Total damage was about $70 which is def a pricey lunch but it was such a cute homey atmosphere (and those Japanese toilets, tho!). We tipped extra as well because the trio that ran the shop (assuming it's a mother/father and daughter combo) literally worked nonstop the entire time we were there. Would love to come back!"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2018-12-14,4.0,"I must say that this place gets very crowded after awhile. Too bad you can't make reservations in advance. I only went during the night time so not sure how it is during the day time. It probably has a different feel both times.

So for the food option we got the sumo ika - charcoal grilled squid. It looked really cool when we saw a few people eating this as you're grilling precooked squid on a grill. The grill kept going out as we were right by the door and the breeze was cold. For sake we ordered the suigei- which is dry and ricey. Tasted great together. 

Not sure if I would be going back, but perhaps??"
55,hi-collar-new-york-2,2019-08-29,4.0,"Perfect date spot in NY.
They make the most dedicated coffee in NY. Remind me coffee is not just a shot. Coffee is enjoyable. Siphon coffee is must try. 
Food are beautiful and tasteful. Go"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-05-29,5.0,"I have been visiting the Doughnut Project for a few years now and can't believe I haven't written a review yet. Of all the artisanal doughnuts I have eaten in my life, The Doughnut Project is the real deal. Not only have they figured out a way to stay open - they have not closed one day off their regular schedule - while we are in quarantine - but they are continuing to pump out weekend specials. 

Their doughnuts have an innovative fusion of flavor, are always fresh and always delicious. I go to this location as well as their other location. ""The Bronx"" seems simple, but is packed with flavor. Their beet ricotta surprises you with its mix of flavors. Their everything, lemon sea salt, maple bar, old fashioned cake, ugh, I can go on about their consistent menu - but the specials are always showstoppers. Just when you think they couldn't top their last one, they do. Even the cinnamon rolls are jazzed up weekly! I can't wait until the fall so I can eat their pumpkin specials. I don't even like pumpkin flavored stuff and I am dreaming about their pumpkin cake doughnut with pumpkin frosting. 

Make it a point to visit this unique business - you won't be disappointed!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-05-22,5.0,"I love the Doughnut Project. My fiancé and I have been going almost every weekend since the first week we started dating and it is such a key part in our life/relationship. We love this small business.

The flavors are inventive and unique. Yes, there will be some you don't like but if you talk to the people behind the counter they will help you decide. If you've never been before I recommend checking their Instagram. The maple crueller is amazing and I have dreams about it! 

Last - their staff is incredible. I've gotten to know them over the past year and I always look forward to seeing them.

Thanks for delivering during Shelter in Place! See you at the shop soon!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-05-04,5.0,"Ordered delivery on Postmates and it came super fast. I got four treats:

+ a cinnamon roll - great
+ a limited edition coffee cake roll - strong coffee flavor, awesome
+ maple cruller - this is now tied with the old-fashioned cake doughnut for my favorite 
+ old fashioned cake doughnut - see above 

Upping my rating to 5 stars because these were all just too good!

Update 5/28: Stopped by on a weekend; there was a line outside but not too long a wait. I got the Blueberry Lavender Mother's Day doughnut, and the Special Strawberry Milkshake 2.0 (latter was the best)."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-06-06,5.0,Hands down the best doughnuts in all of NYC! Love their creativity with weekly doughnuts. The Maple Cruller is one of their best.
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-01-26,4.0,"If you were unaware, NYC is surprisingly blessed with a very respectable doughnut scene, and Doughnut Project is a top-ranked contender.  They have two locations - this one and one in midtown east (7th ave). What first drew me here was their famed Everything Bagel doughnut with cream cheese and it's a perfect hybrid of savory and sweet. I've since had their insanely delicious peanut butter and jelly (Blackberry glaze, filled with Peanut Butter Whip and a kiss of house made Blackberry Jam). Both of which I got at their 7th ave locale.  The only slight I have against the establishment as that many of their 'specials' sell out suuuuuper quick, and coming out from LIC, I'm usually S.o.L. But, again, their staples are still delicious, so you can never really leave too disappointed.

Given my peanut butter fixation, this time I was drawn in for their Peanut Butter Cup (chocolate cake base meets peanut butter glaze) in celebration national peanut butter day. Made the trek over while the skies opened up, but eventually arrived - I called ahead to make sure these were still in stock. And they were indeed plentiful of these delicious morsels available.  I also noticed they had another new PB offering, the Peanut Butter and Honey Old Fashioned, and thinking this trip could have actually landed me in peanut butter doughnut nirvana. Buuuut sold out by 2:30PM. Sigh, par for the course. 

But after tasting that Peanut Butter Cup, I couldn't stay that upset for long. The PB is a bit more subtle than their staple delight PB&J, but with the chocolate base, it really played true to it's namesake - it's a peanut butter cup doughnut. A damn tasty one. 

I'll continue to try my luck at Doughnut Project...because they're that damn good."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-04-07,5.0,"For the past few years, I just can't stop thinking about doughnuts. What better than to be quarantined with doughnuts? Woke up early on Saturday to drive in and pick up some treats from The Doughnut Project. They had two special ones that probably won't be for sale when you read this. See photo for the doughnuts. My favorite is the maple bacon bar. Maple bacon is one of my favorite combos, so most places I visit, it is my favorite. Not to take anything away from Doughnut Project, their doughnuts are terrific."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-04-26,5.0,After 6 weeks of sheltering at home any thing other than what I had at home would have tasted amazing but these donuts are absolutely divine and now I can't imagine spending another day in quarantine without them. My absolute favorite are the maple cruellers. Bonus points: They are a fun shape (big hollow circle) that my son and nephew enjoyed wearing as a bracelet and eating it like that. They're moist and have a nice deep maple flavor that's not overpowering though and just the right amount of sweetness that you can eat a whole one and still try the other dozen donuts you bought.
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-12-29,5.0,"Holy moly! This place is it! 

Firstly, the decor is so fun. A mix of graffiti and beautiful appliances and attractive layout for available donuts. 

I came here on a donut tour.  It was the last stop and the goal was to finish all donuts on the tour. This place made it sooooo hard to do so because the donuts are HUGE!

I had half of the everything bagel, which, yes, you gotta try this. Cream cheese frosting and seeds on a yeast donut.  Wow. No garlic, so don't be worried. If you're a New Yorker, you gotta try this spin on our beloved classic bagel.

Next, I had half of the Bronx. The salty, peppery, olive oil frosting was light but still packed its own unique punch. 

I didn't get to peruse the rest of the menu, because
My tour was curated, but I'd definitely go back here."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-05-11,5.0,"Alright, I ordered from here a second time and tried a few new donuts.  I'm editing this review to specifically say ORDER THE MAPLE CRULLER ORDER THE MAPLE CRULLER!  ORDER!  THE MAPLE!  CRULLER!  It is so freaking good, I couldn't even believe it.  They're all amazing, you can't go wrong, but don't leave without getting that dang maple cruller!!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-02-22,5.0,I work really close to the midtown/Central Park location but always find myself at this one instead! You really can't go wrong with any of their flavors. Finally tried the everything donut which was superb. I would eat that everyday if I could! Note: this location is tiny so you are better off taking a donut(s) to go but there are a couple chairs along the window.
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-11-08,2.0,"The doughnuts here are personally too weird for me and I didn't really enjoy them, but if you like very unusual combinations you might just love it here.

I got the beet one which was filled with ricotta cheese and that was just too weird, especially in donut form, that it wasn't really that enjoyable for me.

I also got the brownie one which I didn't really enjoy that much. It tasted like it had soy sauce or vegemite mixed into it which made the taste kind of unenjoyable after a while.

I like unique foods but this was just too different in a bad way."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-12-03,5.0,"These folks are smart. I know some shops are like, ""We don't change the menu, it works, people love it."" 

BUT, this place adds a special donut that is around for like 3 days or so and this Jersey Boy comes to the yard for them.

If you like plain and simple, they have that...in a eggnog, bourbon glaze kinda way.

So not the most simple, but life is short...treat yourself to a coquito cream-filled bruleed donut."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-06-23,4.0,"Anyone who knows me knows that I am a doughnut fiend, and I've dropped in often to try a variety of The Doughnut Project's tasty, unorthodox creations.

PBJ 2.0 with blackberry glaze, jam, and a peanut butter filling? Check. Miso caramel sesame seed and peanut brittle with black sea salt? Check. Corn creme brulee filled with corn cream and pieces of sweet corn? Triple check. Mango chili lime? Oh so many checks. Peach fritter? Just take my wallet, why don't you.

With all that experimentation, they can't knock each one out of the park. A few of their doughnuts have either been way too sweet or had an unbalanced amount of salt sprinkled on top. I didn't like the everything doughnut, which was sweeter than I expected from a very savory-sounding creation. I didn't get any hints of garlic or sesame. For Those Beetz Are Dope, the beet glaze is very, very sweet and doesn't taste like beets at all. Luckily the smooth, light whipped ricotta filling helps to balance out all that sugar.

Definitely worth a visit or two, or 50, to see what new creations they'll serve up next."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-08-12,4.0,"Very tasty and unique donuts are to be found here. I had the Black Gold donut and was not disappointed. The donut was doughy and bready but not in an offputting way. It was good bread. The chocolate coating on top stuck perfectly to the donut. It was sticky and tasted like chocolate with a different flavor to it. I will definitely​ be back to try the Beet & Ricotta​ Whip and The Bronx. The coffee is good too. And the staff is friendly.

Mera's Tip: Pick a flavor."

WHAT

It's impossible not to love The Doughnut Project with their wonderful spectacular and extremely sweet doughnuts. They're in the same boat as Dough, Doughnut Plant, and Dun Well, the golden trinity of the sensational types of Donuts that NYC sort of invented.

This is now the second location I've been to and I liked it as much as the first. The service at both places is excellent with really nice employees and this one has even nicer and more rustic village-esque decor. 

They also we're not sold out of the big selling doughnuts so I just tried the famous Lemon and honestly it was a little sweet for me but it was also absolutely delicious. I passed it off to my lemon-loving BFF.

Definitely some of the berry best Donuts (I meant to say very, but I'm sure the berry ones are great too) in New York City and we're talking about a glowing endorsement in the best city for donuts in the world so that's a hell of a statement - and I've tried all the best ones, too.

So forget the Dom Ansel Cronuts
And stop trying to fondle your bronuts
I'll tell you right now
If you wanna say wow
Then come to the Project for Doughnuts!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-11-11,5.0,"Such a cute doughnut place I loved it!! From the decor to the doughnut everything was just perfect. They were pit of the chocolate glazed doughnut I wanted so we got the glazed doughnut with a hot chocolate and coffee. 

The glazed doughnut was just perfect never had a glazed doughnut that good. However, I don't recommend the coffee I did not like it at all and I am a BIG coffee person. I definitely recommend the hot chocolate though because Not too sweet not too chocolaty it was just perfect in this NY cold weather. If you have friends visiting and are in the area give this place a shot!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-05-10,5.0,"I'm from Seattle. In Seattle, donut shops have maple bars.  It's not even a question.  When I moved to NYC 9 years ago I was dumbfounded when I learned maple bars are not universal.  Then, sometime in the past 4-5 years (?), this place opened up.  I'm told the owner is from Seattle and guess what, they have an incredible (and very large) maple bar with bacon on it.  That said, I think my favorite doughnut here is the maple cruller.  I also love the PB&J.  They are also constantly coming up with new donuts and seem to have elevated the donut game. So grateful for this place and also that it's open during the quarantine!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-02-17,4.0,"Really good doughnuts! We got a cinnamon roll, pb&j, pb honey old fashioned with brittle crunch. All good but the best was the cinnamon roll. Super nice owner and we really loved the decor."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-05-30,5.0,Such unique flavors! Check on their Instagram daily to see updates and the new flavors! We parked right in front and came pretty late (around 1 pm) and they still had some donuts left but pre order or get there early if you want a special donut. The cinnamon roll doughnut tastes just like Cinnabon but in a donut! Maple Cruller was also delicious. You can't go wrong with any of their flavors.
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-07-11,5.0,"Omg. Best doughnut of my life. Errr...best cronut of my life? Or croughnut...?

I had the beet ricotta donut and it was both beautiful and delicious. The color was gorgeous and the filling was delightful. My favorite donuts have the perfect amount of fried and aren't too sweet, and this definitely fit that description. Also, the size was very appropriate. I didn't feel like I was at risk of a heart attack or sugar coma after finishing it. 

So, I'd give this 10/10."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-01-02,4.0,"The Doughnut Project is a cute doughnut shop in NYC. They definitely bring creativity and quality to their doughnuts! This was my first time here and I would pick this place over Dunkin Doughnuts and Krispy Kreme any day even though they are a bit pricier. 

I had the Rose Doughnut which had silver sparkles, pink frosting and dried purple roses which you can't really taste but they add a cute touch! The doughnut was super fluffy like a cloud (currently thinking about it again LOL). I also got a small hot chocolate that was super creamy. Between the doughnut and hot chocolate, I spent a little over $7.

They have a few table space facing the window if you would like your tasty treats to stay. The walls are decorated with pictures, graffiti and framed portraits. Staff is friendly and helpful when it came to picking a doughnut.

Must come back!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-07-26,5.0,"I was very impressed by The Doughnut Project. Not only do they make some incredibly unique flavors, but they deliver on flavor as well. I got to try the Campfire s'mores, those beetz are dope, PBJ 2.0, The Bronx, strawberry milkshake, and the banana split fronut. All of them were fantastic. I was particularly impressed with the Bronx, those beetz are dope, and the strawberry milkshake. The Bronx was like biscuits and gravy on a doughnut with a slight hint of sweetness. The beet and ricotta combo on the those beetz are dope doughnut was an unexpected marriage of two flavors that worked beautifully. And finally, the strawberry milkshake tastes exactly what it sounds like, a strawberry milkshake on a doughnut. But really, everything I tasted was off the charts. This is a worthy stop for any doughnut fan when in NYC."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-11-17,5.0,"I can't believe I didn't write a review on this sooner. This is the Doughnut Queen (pardon my bias for female leadership) in NYC. They bring the creativity and the quality to the NYC doughnut scene. I've been around the shops in Manhattan and Brooklyn and in my opinion, this place is only rivaled by a few shops far far away in KC and Nola. 

I appreciate that the owners have kept the scale small, because other NYC establishments have sold their soul/quality for greater reach (cough cough Dough, cough cough Doughnut Plant, though I never felt they were THAT good.) I see the same pair working every time I go in, so I assume they may be the owners, which leads me to another assumption that they're really pouring their hearts and souls into every doughnut and every flavor. 

When I take an out of area visitor (which is every-time one is in town), I insist they try the Everything. It seems people fear the garlic and other savory bits that are more prominent in th bagel version, but the cream cheese icing makes this sucker downright everything. You can't go wrong with any flavor, but I suggest you stick with the subtly adventurous kinds. I've had a taste of almost all of them and they are too good."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-04-17,4.0,"I picked out four to try and was surprised I liked the everything one the best. It wasn't as savory as I feared and the amount of seasoning vs icing was perfect. I definitely like yeast donuts more than old-fashioned ones and these taste like Dough's, which are my favorite. I do wish they came in more plain options but the flavors and narrow selection make these all the more unique."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-12-13,4.0,This place was very cute! Lots of special and unique donut flavors. I visited as part of a food tour and everyone was very gracious and friendly as they served us their lemon donuts. Highly recommend!
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-11-27,5.0,"Solid 5! I love donuts, I travel and I always looks for a little touch in the mornings to go with my coffee. Independent donut shops seem to be making a comeback, I'd say the Project has been a success. I tried the basics on my first visit, an Old Fashioned and a glazed. These are exquisite. Light, fluffy, you can taste the flavors independently. The textures are really what set these apart. Overall a top 3 donut, right there with Sublime, Gibson's, Glazed and Dutch Monkey."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-05-05,4.0,"I love donuts... a lot. Everywhere I go, I'm on the hunt for some tasty donuts. I like fancy donuts with fun toppings. I was in the city visiting my sister after running the New Jersey Marathon. We made a stop here on Monday morning to reward ourselves. 
     The three of us each chose a flavor- so difficult because so many of them sounded delicious. We were all intrigued by the everything donut. We also got the black gold donut and the tullamore dewnut whiskey and coffee donut. We threw in an order of donut holes and some coffee. The donuts weren't any more expensive than what I would pay for fancy donuts in Orlando so I thought the price was reasonable.
     There's some seats inside so we sat down to eat. I wasn't sure how I'd like the everything donut but it ended up being a crowd pleaser. It wasn't as savory as I thought, and the cream cheese icing went perfectly. I also really liked the black gold donut. The tullamore dewnut was ok but I didn't really taste the coffee flavor. The donuts themselves were fluffy and fresh. The service was friendly and quick. Overall great donuts and would recommend."

Thank you

We decided to try the Sweet Dough Collaboration, which had currant jam, brown butter glaze, and an oatmeal cookie on top, and it was really excellent.  I felt like the doughnuts were pretty expensive as it cost a little under $5.00 for the one that we ordered.  Unfortunately, the doughnut that was highly recommended to us (the everything doughnut) was sold out for the day by the time we arrived."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-08-30,5.0,"To begin, I don't even really care for donuts. At most, I will have half a donut, and not think about a donut again for months. How good can a donut be? Damn good, I tell ya! The PB & J donut was glorious, naughty,  and the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The peanut butter was heavenly and there was no second half to share or be saved for later!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-10-28,4.0,Amazing Doughnuts!!!! The glaze doughnut is everything you want in a top notch doughnut. Really really good!

If anyone can vouch for The Doughnut Project, it's me! because I literally ordered one of every flavor on the menu!!! Haha! (I really did though)

So.. I won't go into detail about every single one because that'll definitely take way longer than any Yelp review should take... but I will tell you this... 
GET THEM ALL!!!!!! 
Even if they sound like an absolutely odd mixture of ingredients... 
Just. Get. Them. ! 

First of all.. the donuts are pillowy soft and perfect! 
They MELT in your mouth!! 
And the taste? Ugh! Let me just tell you that I literally ate them until I made myself sick. 
Not so healthy.. I know.. but they were JUST THAT GOOD! And they are NOT cheap with the filling. 

Omg the ones with chocolate were so delicious! 
Their chocolate is so creamy that it almost tastes like pudding! 
I can't stress this enough... make it your mission to try all of their donuts. 
I was so skeptical about their olive oil and black pepper donut (can you blame me? That sounds so weird!!) but it was sooo darn DELICIOUS! (honestly.. they all were!) 
So I said it before.. and I'll say it again! 
Don't walk... Run to The Doughnut Project! 
If you haven't tried them yet.. you haven't lived!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-10-21,4.0,"Was in the area on Saturday with my sister and since we had some time to kill and this had been on my yelp bookmarks forever, we decided to stop by. It's a small shop but it's very cute inside, very hipstery. Doughnuts are $4/each but they're quite large and puffy. I got the lemon one and she got a chocolate one and we both enjoyed ours a lot, but I don't know if I'd rush out to return here again. They're supposed to have a lot of unique flavors but the most unique on Saturday seemed to be a Rosé one. There's a couple of stools inside if you want to sit and eat, which is nice (we took ours to go though). Plus side, you're basically right in front of Phoebe's apartment from Friends when you're here."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-04-06,3.0,"Stopped in this morning because I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile and it wasn't bad, I think I was just expecting more? But that might be my fault because I had wanted to try this smorgasbord (peanut butter, banana and  marshmallow) but I didn't. I opted for the pb2.0 (peanut butter whipped filling and blackberry glaze), everything but the whip was good...I think there was something about it that just left wanting more...peanut butter taste. Also got the olive oil and black pepper, hands down, amazing. The pepper kick was mild and nice, the dough soft, glaze perfect. I would give 3.5 stars if I could, I'm open to trying other things too!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-07-30,2.0,"Since we were around the area and it was only a 10-15 minute walk, we decided to trek over here. The reviews and the interesting flavors made our mouth water with excitement. However, we left underwhelmed and disappointed. We ordered the Blueberry Julep with Bourbon and Mint.

Blueberry Julep: firstly, the doughnut was $4!!! We could've left, but we burned so much calories from our journey here that we had to at least order something. Secondly, the doughnuts looked like it's been sitting out all day (we arrived late afternoon). It's a yeast doughnut, so I was expecting a fluffy, airy, and slightly chewy texture, but it was stale. The doughnut had many air pockets and crevices, but it just increased the surface area of staleness. For $4, I thought that the dough would have blueberry and/or mint incorporated into it, but it was just the glaze's flavor. The glaze had a very grainy, sugary texture. A positive aspect of this place was that it's in a nice neighborhood. 

Overall, there are other doughnut shops around the city that are better and cheaper than $4. I really wanted to like this place, but I'll just satisfy my doughnut cravings elsewhere."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-03-03,5.0,"Cute little spot
Staff is very nice
The doughnuts are unique, delicious, and fluffy. I had the chandonut which is the prettiest doughnut I ever did see and it totally tasted like Chandon sparking rosé! I will definitely be back for that one and the other yeast doughnuts!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-03-29,4.0,"Lovely doughnuts! The limited edition ones are also very special usually. I'm a fan of filled donuts, the ones with only a little frosting on top are not my favs- I'd like to see more filled ones. And the dough is excellent. Staff is nice!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-01-13,5.0,"Good lord, this place is dangerous.  Went on New Years Day; what better way to ring in 2019?  They had a very special champagne doughnut, of course, so we tried that, as well as the Tullamore Dewnut (cute, right?).  I could have had one of everything but lucky for me, my date has more self control and I was worried what he might think (not really).  

We got the low down on some future plans that involve Michelin star restaurants adding even more yum yums to their arsenal so very much looking forward to that!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-03-02,4.0,"I have been back to the doughnut project at their central park/7th ave location more than a few times. I feel the need to downgrade the rating from 5 to four stars, but i have my reasons. First, 5 stars in my opinion should be reserved for truly extraordinary venues and it does not quite hit that mark. The doughnuts are always fantastic, but a bit pricey for some reason. They fun flavors never really make it to this location so the very stagnant menu doesn't serve to inspire as the downtown location does. For these reasons I feel four stars is a more than fair review for the secondary location. That being said, I still highly recommend giving it a try."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-09-26,5.0,"The doughnuts made by Troy Neal and Leslie Polizzotto are creative, weird, and of course delicious.

My favorites are the Maple Bacon Bar (which is big), Lemon Sea Salt, and the rotating selection of fritters (Peaches n' Cream in summer, Caramel Apple in fall, occasional specialty ones, and more!). 

I also love the more intriguing flavors such as the Chocolate Bone Marrow and the Ricotta Beet.

Keep up to date with their social media because they often rotate flavors and introduce weekly specials.

I'm not a huge fan of alcohol flavored desserts, but if that's your thing, they collaborate with chefs and bartenders to offer cocktail-inspired doughnuts every weekend.

I recommend you check out the Doughnut Project for some unique flavored doughnuts, and specifically some of the best yeast doughnuts in the city."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-01-16,4.0,"Doughnuts are super soft and delicious! My friend got the glazed doughnut and I give it 4.8/5! It was really soft and chewy.
I got the beet with ricotta filled doughnut and it was good but the filling was a big overwhelming for me.
The store is small so there isn't much room to sit if it gets a little busy. 

Service was good! Everyone was friendly. 

I would go back to try other flavors!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-09-10,5.0,"These doughnuts were so freaking good!! My favorite flavors were lemon, ""everything bagel"", PB&j, and the maple bacon bar! I was most surprised with the everything bagel doughnut! It was the perfect combination of salty and sweet! Get these in your mouth!!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-02-25,5.0,"The Donut Project is a great name because they really do experiment with their flavors. This weekend's special was a bone broth chocolate flavor. They're also know for their olive and pepper and beet donuts.

I kept things simple and ordered the plain vanilla glazed donut. A+ solid donut! Excellent pillowy yeasty bite and the glaze was just sweet enough. You know the kind of bite where you make teeth marks in the dough? Yeah, legit.

It was a bit more expensive than I'm used to, but then again this is NYC. There was no line and the staff was very helpful. They also sell apparel and merchandise here."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-03-31,3.0,"This is just another cute little doughnut shop. NYC is filled with doughnut shops, so it's extremely hard to stand out. This place has some pretty creative doughnuts, but I'm not sure if they can compete with some of the bigger names. 
I got a small pb&j doughnut ($4), and it was really expensive for a doughnut of that size. It was completely filled with peanut butter, and the jelly tasted fresh and homemade. It was a yeast doughnut, and I think the dough could've been better. They have some inventive flavors which is nice, and they have exclusive ones on some holidays. 
Overall, it's not as good as Doughnut Plant or some of the other doughnut shops in NYC, but a doughnut is a doughnut."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-04-20,3.0,"Steady stream of people around 10am on a Tuesday.

Pros:
-Some seating
-Cool interior
-Huge donuts

Cons:
-Expensive! $3.75 for a donut including tax--2nd most expensive donut I encountered in NYC (behind Supermoon Bakehouse).

--
Black Gold, Texas Tea ($3.75)
...is there black tea in this? Yeast donut topped with ""brownie batter"" per the sign at the restaurant. The dark chocolate glaze doesn't taste like brownie batter--just slightly salty chocolate and maybe I was misled by the name but it tasted slightly like tea to me. The dough is chewy and fluffy (fluffier and less dense than Dough) but chewier than I'd like."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-12-21,1.0,Wasn't really that great. Most of these are just outlet holding rather stale donuts. Wasn't really impressed. Rather doughy I'm a very cooked bread way. My normal glazed donut had a hint of lemon.
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-12-09,3.0,"Had their Bacon Maple Bar and the Beet Ricotta. To be frank, I don't like them very much. The maple coating was way much sweet and you can not taste the bacon at all. You only notice the bacon when you feel the crunchy feeling of bacon. And the dough was very doughy.  The beet one, on the other extreme, not sweet at all..... Well, the beet flavor are true cause all I can taste was the beet. The ricotta was not sweet either. 

I hears they say curiosity kills a cat! I will not try any strange flavor next time. Next time I will definitely have the pretty apple fritter and PBJ."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-01-20,5.0,"Ahhh, I love this place! Assumed all this time this was one of those Portland-inspired frou-frou doughnut shops full of odd flavors and zero deliciousness. I was wrong. I got the Everything bagel-inspired doughnut. One bite was so silky, soft and fluffy. They churn their doughnuts out with ingenuity and freshness. 

5 stars!!!!!!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-01-10,5.0,"Best doughnuts in the city. I have now tried every single doughnut on their regular menu and come by quite a few times for special releases which are always worth checking out.

The best doughnuts here are all the ones with a bit of savory to them, imo. The beets is my favorite, but the Bronx and the Everything are terrific as well. If you like something more traditional, all their flavors are solid though. Stop by early on a weekend if you want the full selection plus that week's special, because they do run out of things."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-02-10,4.0,"Came here to try a doughnut.  I'm usually more of a fan of cake doughnuts, but these doughnuts looked good enough for me to want to try a yeast doughnut.

I went with the olive oil black pepper doughnut.  It's apparently the house favorite.  And it was really good...at first.  And then it became too sweet.  The first half of the doughnut, I was so impressed I was saying to myself it was my new favorite unique doughnut flavor.  It had an indescribable flavor.  If I tried really hard, I could make out the black pepper flavor.  But after the first half, the sweetness started getting to me.  As I got to the final quarter of the doughnut, I couldn't taste anything other than ""sweet"".  The nuance of the olive oil and the black pepper were completely lost to the sugar.  It just kept getting sweeter and sweeter.  And I almost couldn't eat the last bite because if it.

The yeast doughnut itself had good texture and did not feel oily at all.  Definitely one of the better doughnuts I've had, but they really need to work on decreasing the sweetness to something tolerable."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2020-03-29,5.0,"There are few foodie destinations in the world where I am consistently satisfied.  The DP is one of them.  The doughnuts are near-perfection.  The inner cake for the more traditional doughnuts balances lightness, moistness with a satisfying chew, savory & sweet.  Combined with the array of inventive flavor combinations, one is transported to doughnut nirvana.  Sure....one may get adventurous and choose a less traditional flavor - say....maple glaze with a bacon strip....but this place does it right!  On top of this, the staff is super-friendly.  The vibe is amazing:  cool artwork and irresistible T-shirts.  This, by far, is the best doughnut bakery in the city."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-07-25,5.0,Such a great place to get unique donuts that taste amazing. Towards the end of the day they have Buy one get one to get rid of the donuts before closing so that's a bonus. The donuts are really big too so you're getting a bang for your buck. Blueberry Yuzu is my personal favorite. I highly recommend if you're ever in the area.
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-01-19,5.0,"My favorite donut spot in the city and I've pretty much been to them all. They have their regular selection of donuts and are constantly coming up with new creations and collaborations with other restaurants.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  Be sure to get there as early as possibly since this place is so popular that they'll run out of a specific kind of donut at times. 

For all my DONUT lovers out there..... this place is a must try!!!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-02-15,4.0,"This was one of the stops on my friend's food tour (soup dumplings, shaved ice -- placed closed , and here) a while ago.  After this last stop, we couldn't fit anything else in our tummies.

We were looking for the bacon (what doesn't taste good with bacon) maple bar. Unfortunately, the store ran out since you have to come early for it.  

I remember standing by the window with a small table to take pictures of the donut (don't recall seats).

Choices, umm: Everything donut, no-brainer; Olive Oil and Black Pepper Donut, strange combo - why not; and Cinnamon Pumpkin Donut.

Everything donut texture was surprising...really reminds me of a bagel top.  Olive Oil and Black Pepper turned out to be my least favorite.  Cinnamon Pumpkin Donut turned out to be my favorite.

Still have to go back for the bacon one!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-10-17,4.0,"1st time here. Doughnuts are huge and look all yummy. Ok, they also have smaller ones and bite size doughnut holes, but come on, if you're here, go all the way! :p
Had the Rosé doughnut, elegantly decorated with fine silver sparkles and dried purple roses (which I actually ate!!!). It was DELICIOUS and really tasted like rosé wine! Seriously, you should taste it, with an espresso or a glass of chocolate milk (for those who like).
The walls are decorated with NYC street art, graffiti and framed portraits. Perfect for any IG photos!
They have a few stools and small counter space, for a quick stop in the West Village if you're strolling this way.
The staff is friendly and talked to all customers as if they had been friends for years, definite plus in crazy NYC!
A MUST stop if you like doughnuts.
Oh, and they have an A from Dept of Sanitation. :)"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-01-21,5.0,"Really love their donuts.
Maple bacon donut, everything donut, and beets ricotta donuts are my top three. Other ones were indisputably delicious. Very fluffy and soft inside."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-05-19,4.0,"they don't have a wide range of menu but with what they have, they sure make the most out of it. the donuts were SO fluffy and tasty. it's pretty big too! i tried the lemon love letter and it's really good. not too sweet and strong kick of refreshing taste of lemon. i'm glad the lemon tastes like real lemon! not some weird artificial stuffs. plus the staff is so friendly and helpful. the place is small but comfortable i'm so happy it wasn't packed when I walk in. definitely a recommended donut in nyc"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2018-09-17,4.0,"Amazing donut! I wish I could've tried a few more or gotten some to-go, but I was out for the entire day so it would've been a hassle to carry them around. Must go back to try other flavors!"
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2017-10-30,5.0,"This is a must-experience!! Monday through Wednesday have the lowest traffic, and Thursday through Saturday are slammed. They will be opening a location near Central Park on 7th between 57th/58th in mid-late December 2017. 

I decided to order the Lemon Love Letter, the apple fritter (just came out warm!), the brown butter carrot, and the dark & stormy. The lemon and the apple fritter are must-orders! The sweetness of the lemon glaze with the sea salt marries well. The apple fritter was doughy but warm with lots of apple chunks. 

Service was excellent and everyone was so friendly. Will definitely be back."
56,the-doughnut-project-new-york,2019-07-07,5.0,I walked in quickly for a doughnut and was so pleased with all the options! I truly could not decide but I got the pbj2 doughnut and it was seriously mouthwatering. It tastes way more elevated than your average pb&j sandwich. The peanut butter has a hint of cinnamon I believe and the jam was the perfect sweet fruity note to compliment! Could eat 10 more of these!!!
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2020-03-02,4.0,"Came here for an afternoon square with my friend, who lived in East Village at the time. He knew all of the little sweet spots to hit during my weekend visit. 

We came here for an afternoon snack. We came here for some pressed chicken sandwiches, beer for him, ginger ale for me, some socializing in a cozy little rustic spot. 

It has a nice comfy and warm interior. Service was good, food was good. It was a pleasant visit."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2020-02-26,3.0,"A very modern way to grab breakfast/brunch on the weekends. It get very packed and you order at the counter before sitting down. People are waiting in a line inside to order & you can barely get a waiter to get you a refill on your coffee. You have to get your own utensils, water, ketchup, salt, etc. So you are paying to eat at a cafeteria (thats what it feels like).
Also when we were done eating we were sitting chatting and a waiter asked if we could leave so another party can sit! I was in shock, we paid for food and we had maybe been sitting for 30 minutes before getting kicked out. Will not
go back."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2020-02-17,4.0,"Restaurant Overview - Neighborhood breakfast and brunch spot that reminiscences of the place you'd bring your parents to on a Sunday morning when they visited you in college. Walk-up counter, cool trinkets on the walls and small wooden tables bring a sense of comfortable laziness when dining. Extra plus if you're a University of Michigan alumnus. 

The Service - Excellent service. The entire staff is very friendly and prompt with walking newcomers through the ordering / seating process. Once seated, the food was brought out fairly quickly given how packed it was on President's Day morning. Even scored a free blueberry scone as a plus!

The Food - The menu offers a decent selection for both health-conscious and taste-conscious eaters. Upstate Omelette was unspectacular yet solid - Hudson Valley eggs with roasted field mushrooms, shaved kale, butternut squash & goat cheese made for a unique combination. Home fries were standard quality and left me feeling full. A tasty yet healthy portion of food was exactly what I was looking for.

TL;DR - An easy-to-find breakfast / brunch place near Union Square which makes for a good spot to get well-portioned food with some friends the morning after a night out."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-12-31,4.0,"Great spot to grab some indulging comfort food. Came for breakfast and the food was great. There are several locations throughout the city and I'm sure they all get busy for good reasons. 

When my group came in every table was occupied. No worries though. The staff assured us we can get a spot and offered to let us put our food and drink orders in. Ordered ,paid for food and got coffee. It worked out well our food came out as we just got a table. The staff was more than helpful in assisting. 

One thing they do here is a little self service. They have a water station at the end of the bar. Napkins, silverware and basic condiments are on the side closer to the entrance. Not really a big deal but it's a little hard to navigate when the place is packed. Getting a refill of coffee when sitting can be a small mission. Again not a big deal but just be aware of it as more fast casual than full service. 

The food comes up via dumbwaiter in the back. It has a bell and they call it Pavlov grey dog. Kinda funny if you get it. Restrooms are also in the back. 

The portions were all good and cooked well and yummy. I would have preferred my bacon a little thicker but it was a good quality bacon, not over cooked or razor thin. Would definitely come back. Just be prepared when they are busy."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-10-10,4.0,"The Grey Dog is a really cute little restaurant where you can go for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just for some snacks. The aesthetic of the place is very nice and so are the people who work there! I love the way that The Grey Dog is decorated. 

For my meal, I ordered the Grey Dog's Breakfast which comes with your choice of protein, 2 eggs cooled any style, 2 pancakes and home fries. If you're really hungry this will definitely fill you up, but if not I would recommend sharing this with a friend because honestly after one pancake I was feeling it. Everything about the meal was decent and I enjoyed it, but my favorite thing was the berry butter that came with the pancakes. I have never heard of berry butter, but I'm about to have it a lot more now! When the butter was paired with the pancakes, it was very delicious! I liked how the butter was salty yet sweet at the same time, I would highly recommend ordering something with their berry butter if possible. 

Overall, The Grey Dog is pretty good I would like to go back and try out their coffee and pastries!"
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-11-15,4.0,"Cozy, colorful, youthful and fun ambiance. Seems to attract a lot of students from NYU and their fam for brunch  (just my observation from my time i came here)

Space is a bit limited in some corners but somehow it's part of the charm. Super friendly staff. 

Ordered the egg, avocado and cheese on a croissant sandwich but they were out of the ""fresh croissant"" they advertise - so I opted for sour dough bread. My sister had a pumpkin muffin that was out of this world delicious. And two lattes - one decaf with almond milk - which they both were served with  cute little dog paws  coffee stencils. 

Perfect casual brunch spot!"
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-09-23,5.0,"Got the Poached Egg Avocado salad. Friend got the Upstate Omelet. 

I looooved my meal from this place. The ambiance is absolutely lovely. The vibes were all around just so awesome and I REALLY loved and enjoyed the salad. The slight dressing with the fresh avocado, amazing salmon and perfect eggs....all so so good. Highly recommend this place."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2020-02-01,4.0,I haven't been back here in a long time and they changed their counter which is more attractive and easy to place an order. I did not like the previous counter set up and I'm glad they changed it. They also have a better menu this time. The noodle soup is delicious and great for this kind of weather. There's no long line when we came which makes it even better.
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2020-01-21,4.0,Very packed place on the weekends so prepare to wait. The line seems to never end as I observed while seated after about a half hour wait. The fish tacos here were amazing and a huge platter! I also tried the avocado bowl with smoked salmon which was okay. Next time I come back I'm getting the fish tacos and sharing it!
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-08-19,4.0,"Great spot for brunch with reasonable prices! Even though the menu offers very typical American breakfast dishes, the food is prepared fresh and tastes delicious. I had the Upstate Omelette, which came on a huge plate. The omelette was cooked perfectly and the ingredients tasted so fresh and delicious. The side potatoes were crisp and yummy as well. I used the bread to soak up the leftover oil and bits from the omelette. 
I also love the decor and style of the restaurant. You pay up front and pick where you want to sit. It feels very homey and comfortable and the staff is very friendly."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-06-26,5.0,"Perfect lunch spot - order at the counter, pay and sit. No matter how crowded it looks they always find you a seat so don't freak out. Salads are amazing (beet Cobb can't be beat), cauliflower stir fry is amazing, sandwiches are great too and I love the sweet potato fries. 

Plus, they have an amazing frosé!

Moral of this review - breakfast, lunch or dinner are great, especially with one of the best frosé in the city."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-06-01,5.0,"Great food, portion, and prices! Amazing spot for brunch. You order and pay up at the counter, then grab a table and they'll call out your name once your order is ready and bring it over to your table for you.
We got the Upstate Omelette (eggs, goat cheese, mushrooms, asparagus, & pesto) and the Grey Dog's Breakfast (eggs any style, French toast or pancakes & bacon, sausage, or avocado).
I loved that all of the ingredients for the Upstate Omelette were from local farms. The flavors were all phenomenal too. I picked home fries for my side and they were so delicious!
They also have cute decor and I might've giggled a bit too much at how their dumbwaiter with a bell was called ""Pavlov's Grey Dog."""
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-12-10,3.0,"Very busy place for a weekend brunch experience. Going to call it average because there are definite pros and cons to eating here.

Pros: Location - it's very easy to get to if meeting others for brunch, minutes away (walking) from Union Square and just a bit further from all of the different 14th street stops, as well as from NYU. This is also a con, but more on that later. 
Decent selection - you will find the breakfast staples  here as well as more lunch-worthy foods (sandwiches and the like), as well as appetizers to choose from.
The food is good. It's nothing to write home about. It's good. It's fine.

Par: The prices - for brunch in manhattan, their prices are fair. It'll be more than you expected to pay for two eggs any style ($13), but it's Manhattan. We get it. Bottomless coffee (again, it's fine) for $2.95 (Dec. 2019) is not bad at all. 

Cons: It's crowded - this again has to do with the location, but also with the very cramped seating and limited space inside in general. You might have to squeeze into a corner and stand while waiting an hour for a table for 2 (on a weekend, even at 10am). In the end, you'll get food that's barely better than the breakfast you could've had at home, so really you're just waiting for the ambiance. 
An added result of the crowding is that the staff can get very anxious about getting you out as soon as you're done eating. They check in every few minutes to see if they can clear plates, even just after the food arrives. And since the bill was paid up front when you ordered at the register, there's no incentive to be respectful of your dining experience. 
With that said, the staff were very kind and accomodating throughout the meal, check-ins to bus our full plates nonewithstanding. It's not their fault the place is desperately lacking in space to accomodate the location's demand.

This can be a fun place to eat brunch, or to stop in for a coffee. Just hope that you get a table right away, as they do not take reservations. Walk-ins only. Credit cards are accepted though, complete with the smart pay ipads  which slyly request a tip before you even get service."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-11-16,5.0,"Grey Dog is home away from home - cozy, yummy, and reliable. This is my go to place to catch up with friends, especially in the winter. The staff is pretty chill and the atmosphere is always really lovely. The food is classic American eats and the menu is pretty accommodating for different dietary needs. Over the years, I've tried a bunch of different dishes - all fantastic. My favorite treat that Grey Dog has - is the hazelnut coffee - it's delicious and nutty, instead of super sweet. In my opinion a rare find. I recently went for brunch with friends and had the fried chicken breakfast sandwich, and it was delicious (my only suggestion is splitting it with someone because it's huge!)"
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2020-01-22,3.0,"I am obsessed with Grey Dog. Yummy food, cool ambiance, and all types of drink options from coffee to sangria. First time for brunch and overall it was yummy. Long line out the door around 1130 on a Sunday. The staff does a great job of keeping everything orderly. You order at the counter and someone will help you find a table. They Grey Dog breakfast has it all eggs/bacon or sausage/pancakes or French toast/and home fries. Yummm. I didn't want eggs so they were kind enough to give me avocado instead. I ordered the gluten free French toast. My friend ordered The Grey Dog breakfast with pancakes. When the server set it down he said here is the one with gf French toast. They accidentally gave my friend french toast too instead of pancakes. She was ok with the french toast. I noticed our french toast look the same. I asked another server before I took a bite. He said, nope that is definitely not the gf French toast. He took it back and it came back 20 minutes later when my friend was already done with her food. I understand mistakes happen and they were super cool about it. Maybe they should put a toothpick in the gf French toast or something so there isn't a mix up in the future. Props to the server that I asked for helping me fix it. The gf French toast overall was yummy and glad they have this as an option. The hot cider drink finished it off perfectly."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-11-24,4.0,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. The line was basically almost out the door; we waited about 20 minutes to get to the front of the line and order our food. 

The concept of this place is interesting, and I guess it works? It was busy when we went, so we stood in line and waited. When we saw the long line, we debated whether to wait or go elsewhere. But very quickly, a staff member came over and greeted us, and asked us if we wanted a table or take out to go. We decided to stay and get a table. So he said that while we waited, he would find us a table. He found us one and indicated by putting a bandanna on the table. It seemed that everyone who wanted seats were able to get one. 

The food was very good. I ordered the poached egg and arugula salad, plus an order of home fries on the side. I also got a latte. My boyfriend ordered the Grey Dog's breakfast, which consisted of eggs, a choice of pancakes or French toast, and home fries. Prices were also decent; not cheap but cheaper than other brunch places nearby. I would come back to try out the other things on the menu, like maybe the burger and sandwiches. Cute place with adorable decor, and reminds me a bit of the local college hangout."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-10-11,4.0,"This was my second or third time at the Union Square location. I came here with a couple friends during the week, so we were able to sit down right away. Although during peak times especially on the weekends the line can go out the door.

I like Grey Dog because it's pretty casual: you order at the counter and then wait staff brings your food to you at the table once they seat you. Also, they serve breakfast all day which is HUGE for me. I've had their avocado toast as well as their french toast. All of it is great. Their teas can be a little hit or miss, but overall beverages are good as well.

The portions are small/average for the price point, but pretty consistent with other similar Manhattan cafes."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2020-01-07,4.0,"Visited The Grey Dog on New Year's morning, which is why my review is gratefully unaffected by the typical ""crowding"" that the place gets.

Ordered Village Pancakes (and spontaneously said yes to adding bananas on top at the register for a surcharge. I do love saying ""yes"" to things, but a third of a chopped banana being worth 1.5 dollars, without regards to LES-pricing, is something I question to this day.) They were.... just alright! Pretty good, but not anything better than what one could make at home. The french toast was incredible, though! The syrup is a bit thin and, in its little metal cup, prone to spilling, so watch out for that. (It's damned good syrup.)

Service! Was pretty great given the day and time. We sat at an unbalanced table and had a spilled-syrup accident, and they helped to fix both issues very speedily. 

Side note: I enjoyed the music they played! Shout out to whoever chooses the music. 

What we're really paying for is ~ambiance~, which The Grey Dog has in spades: lots of painted wood, old-timey signs, chalk writing, well-placed knick-knacks.... The aggregate of it all is that you do get to eat some pretty ""not bad"" food in a cool place. If that's what you're going for, definitely visit The Grey Dog. Four woofs outta five."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-11-12,4.0,"There aren't many places you can order a full breakfast plate for under $15 in the Union Square area. That basic concept of ordering at the counter and finding a cozy table in a coffee shop makes me nostalgic for simpler, easier times. What's better is that the food is actually good - nothing crazy. Just omelets and pancakes and toasts, but that's all I really wanted anyways. I ordered the upstate omelette with kale, squash and mushrooms. Also, don't skip the toast - hard to find a good thick slice these days. Everything really hit the spot. 

The line can get kind of long so come early. A much better experience on  weekdays over weekends."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-12-03,5.0,"Everything is cute about this place-like a dog! Casual and informal, but doesn't feel like a fast food joint, and they have really cool art on the wall, (for sale!)
They have plenty of options for all kinds of taste-I'm trying the zucchini pesto spaghetti next, but for brekkie this am, I got breakfast tacos, (with a ""cute salad,"" as they say on the menu!) and a turmeric latte w coconut milk, as recommended by my cashier. Check out the paw they sprinkled on! 
I'm sure this place gets crowded during peak hours. However, it's such a nice place to treat yourself, and, (though I'm not dating,) if I were, I'd totally bring a date here in the evening-they have wine and beer! What's better than not having to worry about screaming over music in a relaxed joint, with good, inexpensive food, and a libation in good company?
(Cute bonus-the food comes up from the kitchen in a dumbwaiter!)"
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-01-24,4.0,"snug artsy neighborhood cafe / coffee shop planted a hop and skip from Union Square.

Grey Dog has a few other locations in the city. the one on University has a positive-vibed student feel as it is convenient to NYU and services many of those students and other young-ish folks in the neighb. while the space is small, there are seating options tucked everywhere--mostly small tables. the warm wood interior and exposed brick pairs nicely with the eclectic art and chalkboard menu on the walls...supporting a casual space to grab coffee and food and escape the sidewalk bustle of the city.

*Grey Dog gets superbusy throughout the day/evening--have no expectation that you can hang out here for hours, camp out, marathon on your laptop, use a table as a de facto startup company's office (no one wants your app anyway hahaha), etc. tables are in high-demand. seriously be a good human being and self-aware and don't do the above-mentioned*

how it works? order food at the counter, pay, and iyour order will be brought out by the staff. if you're having coffee, you'll take it to your table yourself...the menu stretches from healthy-esque plates to comfort dishes: $12-$15 range.

free refills on the drip coffee ($2.99 w/ tax)...YASSS! the dark roast drip coffee is good--hot caffeine that is not burnt or too acidic. 

the staff is pleasant and constantly hustling. tip them nicely--jar at the counter.

drops mic cuz i'm caffeinated
i out

The mimosa was good. The coffee was pretty good. I'm ""old"" so I didn't appreciate the loud music. The atmosphere however was great. I liked the place very much. 
Bathroom however smelled like urine and I'm confident the walls have never ever ever been cleaned. I almost puked being in the bathroom.

Pretty disappointing.  Fried chicken sandwich was tiny, with not a whole lot of flavor.  The turkey sandwich was at least larger and was decent overall--definitely what I'd order next time.  A lot of fries came with the sandwich, though I noticed that the amount of fries given were not consistent across various plates.

Prices were pretty decent.  Service was friendly and obliging, so kudos to them there.  But the food wasn't anything to write home about."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2018-11-05,5.0,"Love this place! The vibe, the service, the food, and the setting... It's all crafted really well. 

Vibe- funky, colorful, loud but not too loud for a conversation, warm, and casual. 

Service- a little slow when you're on the line to order, but they bring you your stuff rather quickly. 

Food- almond milk cappuccino was really big and delicious, but tasted like it had more milk in it than coffee. Still, enjoyed it. Also got fried brussel sprouts, which I can't imagine anyone not loving. They're huge, and are drizzled with honey. What's not to enjoy? It's a great snack. 

Setting- so artsy! There's paintings on the walls that all spoke to me. The tables are painted, adding some extra color to your time there. Being here transported me to some hippie village in Nepal where all the backpackers hang out and mingle. I really enjoyed it.

Now, if only I could figure out the meaning behind the name..."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-07-16,4.0,"The Grey Dog Breakfast (14.95$)- we chose French toast, avocado, scrambled eggs (came with home fries)

- French toast : too sweet especially with the slight filling inside (and this is BEFORE dipping in syrup). Would go with the pancakes next time  
- Avocado : neatly sliced, perfectly ripe, and refreshing accompaniment with the eggs and home fries
- Scrambled eggs : a little too dry and flavorless (would've preferred it to be too more runny or seasoned)
- Home fries : These were addictingggg - really good and crispy without an extreme amount of oil.

Very cute barn like atmosphere here. Surprisingly, it's a pay-first counter order system which was different from the waiting service at other brunch places but it was a nice change since we could enjoy our food afterwards. Two bathrooms in the back and just overall chic and relaxing space. However, the tables are placed so close to each other that the couples to our right and left could hear our conversation and we would be unintentionally hearing theirs."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2018-11-10,5.0,"Love it here! For a brunch spot that seems to appeal mostly to college students I (a few years out of college) loved the price range, servings and decoration. 

You wait in line for a table then once you get a table you put your stuff down and order at the counter. You order with your party but have the option to pay separately which is ideal. A waitress brings you your food afterwards. Ours was super friendly and accommodating. 

I got a zucchini bread to share, light roast with almond milk (they have oat and coconut too) and the local salad with grilled chicken which was really filling and I had a lot to bring home. My friend got the brunch plate with the challah toast which was so good! The potatoes were plentiful and crisp as well. 


Tip: free refills on coffee!"
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-05-06,4.0,"Good fun location, always seems to be busy.
On my first trip was nervous as you often order without having a table, but somehow one always seems to be free before the food comes out. 
Probably has more of a brunch or lunch feel than an evening place- staff seem friendly and happy, must be a good work environment ( but busy !)"
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2018-11-15,4.0,"Ambiance - Cute, quaint little place! They display art from local artists, which is awesome!

Seating - First come, first served. Seat yourself. Definitely not somewhere I would come with a big group because the tables are relatively small.

Ordering- Order at the counter and they'll bring it to you when it's ready. Also, there's a water cooler in the back. 

Food- Good variety. Everything from Mac and cheese to salads. Always nice to find a place that you can splurge at or stay on your diet if you want to :). I got the cauliflower stir fry with chicken and it was VERY good! Almost forgot it was cauliflower and not actual rice. Came packed with lots of veggies too. I added sriracha for a little more flavor, but you could certainly enjoy it without!"
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-03-27,5.0,"Such a solid, no frills, brunch spot. In a city full of incredible, gourmet, artisan food, sometimes I just want to go back to the basics. Grey Dog is just that. It doesn't get better than a lively environment with delicious, well-priced food that comes in huge portions.

I got the Grey Dog breakfast (eggs, french toast/pancakes, bacon/sausage/avocado). It was so simple, but so delicious. The potatoes were out of this world. You'll love it if you like your potatoes on the crispier side. I also ordered an oat latte, which was good but nothing to rave home about. I got a slice of banana bread to go, which was also really good, but not a must order item.

The seating process is stressful as hell, especially during Sunday brunch. You first place your order at the counter then find seating. On the day I was there, there was an employee helping us get seated based on the order that we ordered food. It kind of helped the chaos. It seemed like the tables were turning pretty quickly, but not fast enough to accommodate the foot traffic. I highly discourage you from coming here with more than 4 people.

All in all, an amazing brunch spot. I'll definitely be back for lunch and for dinner."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-08-21,4.0,"Ok, this is a must go to place.

57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-04-02,3.0,"I honestly don't really get all the hype. It's just a standard breakfast place? It's a good, casual spot to catch up with someone over breakfast or lunch. 

You order at the counter then find a place to sit. The tables are quite cool and have different designs based on different locations. 

The breakfast platter and French toast were tasty, but nothing to go crazy for."
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2018-11-04,5.0,"This is such a solid spot for brunch/lunch! 

Food: 5/5. 
The apple cider was to die for. Mac and cheese was solid, but not my favorite. The star here was the seared tuna tacos, and the scones! Sadly, we just missed brunch (stops serving at 3p), but I think the brunch dishes here are REALLY good from the ones I saw/those who I spoke with. 
Pro tip: go for brunch - you won't regret it. 

Atmosphere/service: 5/5. 
This place accommodated my huge party of 10, with little more than 15 minutes warning. It was amazing! The place is small, but it builds a cozy environment that you won't forget. Loud and kind of rowdy music made me feel like I was at a pre-game, but it somehow made the experience even better, as this place has such a unique vibe.  It's like a hipster cafe meets brunch spot meets club meets pub meets high quality ingredients and food with good service all wrapped into one place with good prices, too! 

Price to experience ratio: 5/5. Very reasonably priced for the large portions! And you pay at the counter, so very easy for big groups without having to worry about splitting the bill at the end. 

I'm definitely going back here! I hope you do, too!"
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2019-04-30,2.0,"Thumbs down on the food, setup, and prices. Cute decor but I don't get why it's so popular/highly rated. Felt kinda ripped off.

Came for lunch with a friend on a weekday. I ordered the goat cheese and avocado sandwich with fries, she ordered the tuna melt with salad. We shared the fried brussel sprouts - this was by far the highlight of the meal. Very tasty (although too large for us to finish!) 

The bread for both of our sandwiches was not fresh at all and pretty stale. It was very hard to eat (my jaw hurt after a while). My friend's tuna melt was weirdly lukewarm. Her ""cute salad"" that came on the side was literally just lettuce, nothing else. Weird. These entrees were certainly not worth $13-15 each. 

Side note - I really dont understand their ordering system. They have handkerchiefs with whistles on them to signal that a table is free. A staff member ""books"" that table for you while you're in line. Then when they come out with the food (which took quite a long time), they call out your name anyway. Why not use a numbering system for the tables? Hand people a number when they order then deliver the food to them. Would make a lot more sense. 

tl;dr: Brussel sprouts (and the fries) were good. Sandwiches were made with stale bread and not worth the price. Decor is cute but service system doesn't make sense. Wouldn't return."

57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2018-10-14,5.0,"We stopped here for breakfast on Columbus Day. They served breakfast till 3:00 pm, so that already gives it great ratings in my book! Second off, they had oat milk lattes. So, I know I am already going to love my lattes and mentally give it more stars while doing a little jig and happy dance inside. 
The avocado toast I'd ordered wasn't as good as the ones at Pour me, and the eggs were a bit too rubbery for my taste, but given the ambience of the place, the bustling joy to be found here, and despite being crowded, the lines seemed to be moving, the people were served and not kept waiting forever, I give this place 5 stars! 
The staff was also very laid back, cool and not pushy but efficient, so, other than the ok taste of the food, a great place, given it was in Chelsea."

I got a beet cob salad which was made with green goddess dressing...loved it (I even had a few flakes of the bacon to help enhance the taste!

Then they serve the food at your table. 

I got an avocado toast with egg with home fries. My friend got an egg sandwich. Both entrees were really good and well cooked. The portions were huge and they gave us a take out box so we could take it home. 

Since they have long queues, the servers suggested that we leave when we were done eating. They didnt want to rush us, but they made it evident that others were waiting for a table when we'd only been there for an hour. Other than this incident, rest was good."

57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2018-06-20,5.0,"A very comforty place that gives you a great vibe when you walk in. It is a seat yourself and order at the counter place but the experience is lovely. Menus on the side of counter with large chalkboard menu above the counter. Hardwood floor and wood theme. Condiment area has anything you need includes silverwares.

I sat by the counter (toward back of cafe), so I got to see how the food was deliver. It is like a dumbwaiter type of thing but with shelves. Looks like a food elevator with chiming of bells to signal food is here. It got to the point I would look forward whenever I hear the bells hahaha.  Kitchen must be below as it keep going down. Very cool. I thought of filming and taking pictures but I wanted to enjoy and not look like a tourist so you gotta imagine it or go there yourself.

I ordered the Grey Dog breakfast; eggs over easy (eggs any style) with French Toast (or pancakes) and add meat for extra $1.50 (ham, sausage, chicken apple sausage). I got the chicken apple sausage. Also got the Martinelli's apple juice for $3 (10 oz glass bottle).

The wait for food was average and the food itself was good and homey. The potatoes were the best in the dish with the green onions adding flavour. French toast was thick and soft, and the sausage reminded us of McDonalds. To this day, we still dont know what the red stuff is in the metal can. For the price tag, it's a little pricey for the dining experience considering you self serve water and utensils and barely have room to feel comfortable.

A friend from home who's familiar with the Union Square area recommended Grey Dog on University Place for breakfast. We went there on the Saturday morning and, since we liked it so much, we came back the following morning.
Speaking only for the weekend days with which we are familiar, get there early for breakfast. It's a small, cozy place that apparently fills up pretty quickly with young families with their baby strollers.
I had the Grey Dog's Breakfast both days, and the wife had that once and Challah French Toast and bacon the other day. Excellent food. So was the bottomless coffee and the Mao Feng Black tea. Around $40 total each day before the tip. Good food, a nice place to eat it, and good prices (for NYC)."

I came here for the first time this week for lunch even though it was always close to my school. This little restaurant seems to always be packed, but for a reason! You order the food at the counter and you choose your own seating. They then bring the food out to you. 

I chose the greydog's breakfast, and for $14 it was totally worth it. My plate came with french toast, sausage, eggs, and potato wedges. It was a big portion, and each item was delicious. 

We didn't have to wait too long for our food either which was nice. I'll have to come back and try more of their food options!"
57,the-grey-dog-union-square-new-york,2018-10-29,4.0,"I walked in on a weekday at 11 am and almost walked out given the crowd inside this location.  While small, turnover is pretty high.  I spoke with the server and he said that if I could not find a spot by the time I ordered, he would provide assistance.  That's a plus in my eyes.

I ordered the Grey Dog's Breakfast, which consisted of eggs, french toast or pancakes, and bacon, sausage or avocado, and a cappuccino.  I opted for eggs over medium, french toast and sausage.  Orders are placed and payed for at the counter.  Once you find a seat, someone will bring your order to you.

A few tables had opened up and I was able to find a spot.  When my food arrived I was told to get my own utensils, napkins, water and condiments.  Some tables were provided with utensils while others were given the same instructions as me.  Odd.  

The coffee was delicious and made just the way I prefer.  The food arrived hot.   The eggs were perfectly cook (I usually find eggs in NYC are overcooked), the sausage patty was well seasoned, french toast was thick-cut and creamy on the inside and the potatoes were deep fried and crisp on the outside, tend on the inside.  I found the meal to be a bit on the salty side but that's likely due to my preference for less salt.  

The decor is funky and fun.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The menu offers many tempting options, both healthy and not so healthy.  It's best to visit in small groups or in groups no larger than 4.  Tables are set very close to one another."

The class flowed well! We were given prepared dough and learned how to shape croissants and danishes. Chocolate and almond filling for decoration. When everything was baking we laminated dough that we were able to take home. So excited to give it a try! Took home about 15 croissants/danishes each. Our friends loved it. HIGHLY recommend."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-11-25,5.0,"The best almond croissant in the city!! The croissant was served fresh out of the oven as It was still warm when I received it. It was a lot softer than a normal croissant - I think maybe due to the overflowing almond filing inside! 
The croissant was decently sized, the outer layer was so flaky and crunchy while the inner was soft. It was not dense as I could still see the layers of dough when I dissect it!!  The filing was the best!! It was so creamy and not overly sweet, and they put a generous amount of almond paste inside the almond!!! 
This almond croissant made my day! This bakery will be my go-to place from now on this it's 10 steps away from school!! LOVE IT!!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-06-23,5.0,"This review is for Mille-Feuille's baking classes.  Today, we learned how to make macarons!!  Woo Hoo!! Not only did we learn how to make macarons, we brought home the two dozen macarons that we each made (3 different flavors-chocolate, vanilla & pistachio)!  How awesome is that?!?!  Ok, I'm all sugared up....let me start from the beginning...

I booked 2 spots for their macaron class.  If you're interested, book early, as the classes fill up FAST; and each class only has 8 spots.  First and foremost, I must mention Vincent, our instructor/French pastry chef, straight from France!  He will be at Mille-Feuille until the beginning of August.  What a great teacher!  He had so much patience, and was so friendly and personable.  Might I add...he had a sexy accent, too! hahaha What a pleasure to have Vincent lead this class!  Even though making macarons is extremely labor intensive, he made everything so easy!  **Don't forget to tip the instructor!

The class:  we were all given written instructions on how to make the macarons, which we could take home with us.  All the ingredients were pre-measured, and waiting for us in their proper mixing bowls/mixers.  This made everything so much easier and moved the class along. (Btw, the class is about 2 hrs long). Vincent walked us through each step, giving us helpful tips, and let us have a hands on experience of making the macarons ourselves.  We each made 8 macarons in 3 flavors (chocolate, vanilla & pistachio)...at the end of the class, we got to take home all 24 macarons which we made ourselves!  In between, we got to sample a variety of macarons which Mille-Feuille offers...outstanding flavors; all perfectly made!  What a treat!

We were all so excited when class was over, and we got to pack our very own macarons in the Mille-Feuille boxes (see my photos/videos).  The macarons can be stored for 1 week only....so you know what that means...I'll be eating macarons all week long!!  hahaha  NOPE, not sharing...they're mine, all mine!!!  hahahaha (evil laugh) 

Thank you so much, Vincent and Mille-Feuille, and my other classmates, for making this class so much fun!  I would definitely take another class in the future....croissants, anyone?!?!  :)

p.s. I do have one regret:  I was so sugared up after class, that I didn't purchase any of their pastries to take home.  They all looked delicious!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-02-21,4.0,"I came here to get some macarons and their macarons were good. The macaron cookies looked good and the fillings were tasty too. 

I got praline, raspberry and rose flavors. The praline was just okay but the raspberry and rose were fairly good. 

I came here just before Valentine's Day and they were having sales! So I paid $1.79 each(original price is $2.75). Yay!! 

I liked their macarons but my favorite here is Raspberry croissant! So good! 

They have another location in upper west where I usually go to."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2018-12-20,5.0,"I ordered 2 short macaron towers from here online for my God Daughter's tea party for pick up in the following days. I got contacted from someone at the bakery thanking me for my order and getting details to confirm pick up time. He also asked me what flavor macarons did I want on the tower. I just asked for assorted so it can be a variety of colors. 

When I went for pick up, I was about a half an hour early but they still had my order ready. The towers were in an airtight plastic case that was wrapped really good in plastic wrap. I greatly appreciated that since the party wouldn't be for another 2 days. When I opened them up for the party, they were the perfect decoration and treats. Plenty guest asked where I got it from. I was glad that it still tasted soooooo fresh. I was honestly a little scared, as I felt like I got them a little too early. But I had nothing to fear because they were soooo delicious. I usually go to Laduree in soho to get macarons but I'm so glad that at Mille Feuille they are just as delicious. I'm definitely coming back to try more treats!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2020-04-20,5.0,Love I here supper quiet perfect place to work and study! I love coming here since it right by campus too. I am addicted to there macaroons!!! They are a freshly made too! The design in the store is simple but great for pictures
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-06-19,5.0,"i took a macaron class here and I must say that I did learn a lot. I'm not an avid baker, I'm more like an occasional experimenter and I do have quite a bit of equipment for a wannabe baker. With that said, I am at basic level skill for this class. I've made macarons a handful of times on my own before this class and I failed every time. 

2 hours at this class I left feeling good about my attempt to do it again on my own. It's actually very easy. You just have to follow the right steps. Online recipes set me up for failure. The pastry chef gave a lot of great tips and was to the point. He was very patient with others in the class that had less experience with baking and he had a pretty good sense of humor. I love that they keep the classes small (about 8 people) this way he's able to give attention to everyone in the class. This class had me thinking I should take more! They definitely know what they are doing. Best macaron class and best baking class in nyc. Level up your kitchen skills!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2018-10-01,4.0,"This review is for the macaron class only~ 

I really enjoyed the macaron class here ! It's a tiny cafe I must say. I was a little skeptical at first about how all of us would fit in the tiny kitchen, but it works. A group of 8 of us fit in the kitchen. You're partnered with another person to make the batter and ganache together. Each of you gets to make and keep 24 macarons. We made 3 flavors- chocolate, pistachio, and vanilla. Our instructor Raphael was very informative and nice. She walked us through the whole process step by step and answered any questions we had. The class ran about 2 hours long. They even gave us some macarons to munch on while we waited for the macarons to bake. (Always a plus haha)

This class was on the pricier side however even with the groupon deal - it was $170 for 2 people and there we're definitely some that offered much less for 2. I came here based on the reviews. Def a nice activity to do for couples and friends."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-05-05,5.0,"Lovely place, prepare that this place is busy with the cooking class and the long lines. 

Use the groupon coupon for the macaroons.
They are still available, just make sure to email them 24hrs prior using the coupon xD

Also, the 6 macaroon shells for a dollar is a steal."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-04-04,3.0,"I came across this place when I was going to brunch around the area. Something about this place stood out to me so I have to check it out. The first time was a great experience I I tried their croissant which was so buttery & flaky! Pure perfection. 

The second time I had a terrible experience with the lady on the phone being rude with me while I was placing my order for macaroons. Then once I got the box of macaroons, they were in a Halloween box wrapped around with plastic wrap. Once I got home, I opened the box & found 4 of the macaroons broken & a few others cracked. That was very upsetting since it was a surprise for my friends birthday. They also tasted old which was another disappoint. Def not getting macaroons from there again. But def their croissants."

58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-01-31,5.0,"This is a small bakery shop that I usually like to stop by for a pastry and a latte. They're super small and in the summer they have a few spots to sit outside right outside of their shop. They aren't anything fancy but their pastries are always on point! If you want to treat yourself to a nice pastry and some good coffee, hop in here! Their chocolate donut is amazing- super buttery, flaky and the chocolate frosting is delicious! Their lattes are always perfect as well as well as their regular coffee."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2020-01-14,3.0,"The cortado, ham-and-cheese croissant and raisin danish were tasty. The young woman who took my order was nice but she and the guy there were openly bickering over customer service behind the counter. And when I tried to pay the guy, who seemed to be intentionally antagonizing they girl, acted as if he was doing me a favor ""letting"" me pay with a Visa-logo gift card. He actually said he would turn down business to customers who wished to pay with a card without a chip. I thought that -- along with not accepting cash -- was illegal. That was my first and last time at this place."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2020-02-17,5.0,We had an excellent experience at the macaron making class at Mille-Feuille Bakery. Nicolas is as an excellent teacher. It was very hands on so we really learned the process. We each made and got to take home 24 delicious macrons in 3 flavors. They were professional quality. I highly recommend this class and bakery.
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2018-03-26,5.0,"My wife placed a large order for macarons for a party, so we came here to pick up the order. Everything looked awesome. The vibe at this bakery is the same as bakeries in France. 

I was drooling at all the croissants, so my wife got me an Almond Croissant. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it was amazing!! I've had very good croissants, but this must have been the best croissants that I've ever had. It was so soft inside!

I then had some of the macarons at the party. Definitely some of the most delicious macarons I've had. I tried a few different flavors and loved them all. 

I'm hardly in Greenwich Village, but I would definitely make a trip to Mille-Feuille all the way from Queens for one of their croissants or macarons."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-07-13,4.0,Grabbed a quick bite for breakfast with friends. They had a great assortment of baked goods and cafe drinks. The ham and cheese quiche was alright. It was pretty greasy and the ham was a little tough. My friends said the chocolate croissant and lemon loaf were good. They had 4 little tables on the sidewalk and a few tables inside.
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-06-25,5.0,"Took the French Macaron class and it was fantastic! It's very much a beginner class, where the instructor takes most of the weight of making sure they turn out well to bring home! You make 3 flavors - pistachio (white choco with pistachio paste ganache), vanilla (white choco ganache with vanilla bean), and chocolate (chocolate ganache). Brought a ton home and it was a complete hit! 

Not sure I'll be able to time it as well on my own and get the correct consistency, but excited to try it at home!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2018-09-06,4.0,"This is a small bakery in the heart of Greenwich Village. I came here for a French macaron baking class and when I entered, my first thought was: Where is the space for the baking class? There was a little kitchen area in the back with a pretty good amount of counter space, a few seats and industrial ovens. 

Before the class started, I got myself a cup of tea which was delightful! It had notes of cocoa and vanilla, was incredibly creamy with the perfect amount of milk and sugar. 

The French pastry chef who led the macaron baking class was wonderful. He was friendly, funny and answered any questions with ease. He was very thorough in explaining the whole process, as well as why something needed to be done. He also did a good job showing us how everything was done, while still allowing us to do it ourselves. 

For the baking class there was 8 of us and we were separated into 3 groups. Each group made the macaron shell of a different flavor: Chocolate, vanilla and pistachio. The group I was in created the pistachio shell. There were 3 people in my group, which was a bit of a struggle for me because I wanted to be involved in every single step but other members did most of the almond dough mixing. I at least got to pour the syrup into the mixer to create the meringue then fold it into the dough. Then it was time to pipe the macaron shells, which took a little bit to get used to. Thankfully there were circles on the baking sheet to help us with how large and how much space to put in between. While the shells were baking, the instructor showed us how to make the fillings, using Valhrona dark chocolate, actual vanilla bean seeds and pistachio paste - separately. After the fililngs were spread out on sheets, they were placed into the refrigerator and we had some time to sample the macarons from the store. 

The macarons were just okay for the most part. My favorite was the caramel, which was sooo full of sweet, sticky toffee flavor. The rose one was quite nice as well - Delicate, light and enjoyable. Others raved about the orange passion fruit macaron, which I did not get to taste. I did not like the green tea one though - I thought the flavor was weird, as was the texture. 

When the macaron shells were finished being baked, we added the cream filling onto the shells and viola, had our own delicious macarons - 24 of them, to be exact - to take home! They turned out beautifully and were so yummy, especially the chocolate. 

Since I only got to try the macarons, I will definitely be back for the other desserts and pastries."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2018-08-30,5.0,Got a Groupon for a macron.  The staffs was friendly and energetic.  The box was wrapped nicely and the content was delicious.   I got an assorted flavors of macrons.   They have an assortment of pastries but I was meeting friends for dinner so I didn't have time to try them.
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2017-11-27,4.0,"This review is for the class only.

I brought my boyfriend here for a macaron making class. The kitchen is pretty tight and it was a little difficult navigating around, but they capped the class size at 8 to keep the chaos to a minimum. We were broken up into teams and everyone got a chance at making a different aspect of the macarons. For the two hours we were there, Pierre did a great job of managing all of us and making sure the macarons turned out just right. The macarons were delicious and we devoured the macarons in just a matter of days!  

The only downside of the class is that it is again, pretty tight, and the kitchen is not separated from the shop, so it is very cramped and you have random people looking over your shoulder. All in all, it was a good experience and I would definitely come back and try to do a different pastry class."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-08-13,5.0,"Such a neighborhood staple and a great place to grab a quick breakfast special... croissant and coffee for $6.  They also have a variety of perfect pastries, sandwiches, and fresh baked baguettes.  This place is quaint, very friendly service and a real treat. I wish the owners years of success because I love having a unique place that serves excellent pastries and service that I can meet up with friends or run into neighbors."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2017-09-02,4.0,"Croissant and chocolate croissant here = literally gorgeous, I'm in love. Ask for them reheated!!

Almond croissant = not so much love

I first came here once on macaron day a few years ago and hadn't been since then up until recently. It seems like their macarons and macaron classes are the most popular, but their macarons didn't look that appealing to me and I haven't tried them since that first visit. However, I really really love their croissants and chocolate croissants!! They're so so airy and light and delicate, and they seem to run out somewhat early in the morning. I don't feel the same affection for the almond ones though, since they're twice baked and I find them too hard and crunchy.

Also the morning deal ($5 for La Colombe coffee and a plain or chocolate croissant) is such a good deal!

Plain croissant ($2.95) - nice buttery taste (not sweet) and the texture was simply amazing. The outside was crispy and flaky and shattered when pressed, and the inside was warm and crossed with gorgeous, impossibly thin, translucent, just slightly elastic and just moist enough beautiful layers. I was scared of destroying them while I was cutting it open; they're so delicate. I don't know how to describe this; I hope the attached photo can do a bit of justice. This is my favorite version in the city.
4.5/5

(But actually though maybe it was just the morning light but it literally looked pearlescent!! .....maybe it's just me)

Chocolate croissant - it's light on the chocolate but for me it's the perfect amount for the delicate interior, and the chocolate itself is really delicious and not too sweet. The chocolate resolves the minor lack of sweetness issue I had with the plain croissant. The best pain au chocolat I've had so far.
4.5/5 or possibly even 5/5

Vanilla mille-feuille ($5.45) - the ratio of puff pastry and the vanilla bean cream is great, and the tastes are amazing together. The puff pastry was more hard and crunchy than crispy/flaky though, and it was somewhat soggy and the layers looked clumped together (probably since they're preassembled and sitting there). It was difficult to eat; we followed the instructions on the wall but it kept falling apart. The cream is great though. In the area I prefer Ladurée's version though it's much pricier. 3/5

Raspberry almond croissant ($4.65) - despite the raspberry jam and freeze dried raspberry powder on top, this was mostly an almond croissant - there was only a bit of raspberry jam at the very ends, deep purple where it nestled into the almond paste. The inside was cold even though it was reheated, and the filling was too sweet and smooth, more like cream but not in a pleasant way. The outside shell was too hard and crunchy and felt overbaked. Also it's really expensive - did not enjoy at all.
2/5"

58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2017-11-21,4.0,"Excellent pastires, cakes and CROISSANTS here! They are a bit on the pricey side but I think it's well worth it for a treat once in a while. 

I also tried the sandwich options they offered and placed my order on Seamless. Within the estimated time frame I arrived at the store and it appeared they didn't see my order so they started to prepare it while I waited which was a bit disappointing since I was in a rush and that's typically why I used seamless in the first place.  Also the sandwich bread was very hard. Not sure if my jaw is weak, but it was definitely a muscle workout chewing the sandwich and was not a fun experience. 

In the future I'd just stick with the macarons, cakes and croissants. However I'm also excited to pair their coffee with my visit in the future."

We took a quick morning excursion to the city and wanted to get a snack to hold us over for lunch and this place was amazing. We were fortunate to get a couple of bar stools to munch on our treats , out of the cold. It looked like there was a class going on in the back.

I looked to come back here again!"

I went to the shop and they suppose have everything ready, but nothing was ready and they said some flavors were out.  Wasted my time going to Manhattan and wasted my money for toll and parking.  Also, the guy working there attitude sucks."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2020-03-03,5.0,This review is for the croissant baking class. Nicolas was a very enthusiastic teacher & you can tell he really loves what he does. We learned a lot about each component & step of making croissants and Nicolas was attentive throughout the process. We left with ~18 perfectly flaky & buttery croissants each as well as dough to make even more at home (which my family was thrilled about). The worst part of the class was waiting for 16 minutes for my croissants to bake! :)
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-08-24,5.0,"Although I have lived just north of Washington Square Park all these years (since 1986) and have passed by this bakery many, many times, today (Aug 23, 2019) was my first visit here.  I only had a cup of hot latte and a piece of lemon flavored pound cake, both of which were very tasty, the more important thing I'd like to report about this bakery is my experience with its staff.  It was just a brief encounter--ordering, paying for and receiving the above mentioned items--but that encounter was a very positive one.  The young lady who took care of me was very polite, efficient, and friendly.  I am sure many would agree with me that it is so discouraging to come across a smileless, thank-you-less, impolite staff person.  And it is not that rare, either!  So, when this young lady on that afternoon was anything but these things, I came away with such good feelings that I decided to write this review.  

I will return for sure!"

58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-07-22,1.0,"Very disappointing class. Extremely over priced and the teacher didn't explain anything. Ingredients were already weighed and combined. The class is supposed to include a free drink which we were never offered.  You are split into 3 groups and for a class of 8, you may be forced to split up if you came as a group of 2 (one couple had to).   The instructor oversaw the final mixing and allowed under mixed batter to be piped resulting in bumpy macarons that did not spread well. 

Do not waste your money on a class here."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2018-04-07,5.0,"A fabulous macaron class for two first-time French pâtissieres!

Dmitri was delightful and extremely knowledge about his craft. He created a welcoming atmosphere that was really inviting. While his instructions were impeccable, he wasn't *too* hands-on, which allowed us to really create our own confidence -- sort of like trial by fire -- and we really learned well that way. He even let us *almost* make mistakes but never corrected us or made us feel bad about not getting it perfect. He simply took every step as a teaching/learning experience, to show us how easily something could go wrong when making such delicate desserts, but also some really great tricks of the trade to make sure we get it just right. 

It was the perfect Saturday afternoon date for my husband and I. There were eight of us total -- some other couples and some girlfriends trying something new together. It was great for complete beginners like us, and it seemed like even a seasoned baker in our group learned a lot as well. 

We made three different flavors -- chocolate, pistachio and vanilla. I have to say, I have never tasted macaroons this delicious in my entire life. It has to be because of the freshness -- and no doubt the recipe is top notch! But who knows how long some macaroons sit around in some bakeries, either in the fridge or freezer. I'm telling you, you haven't lived until you've eaten ones fresh off the baking table! And of course, it's always sweeter when you make them yourself. 

I would totally come and do this again with some friends or other members of my family. It was such a treat! Literally. Everyone went home with 24 macarons. I don't know what we will do with them all!

I think this would be something great to do before a special occasion or a holiday -- to make these and take them while visiting someone at their home or as a gift for any celebration. They're so yummy and fresh and beautiful -- even on our first try! -- and so special because they are handmade. Can't get much better than that!

Merci, Mille Feuille! We will be back for sure. If anything, to try all the cute sandwiches and quiche and other delectables in your pastry case!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2018-07-17,5.0,"I was in NY for work. The French Macaroons is a pretty good size.  I purchased the Groupon online.  40 Macaroons for $54, $1.35 each.  I called in to place my order, told them when I will pick it up. I pick up the French macaroons the night before I left and flew it back to Houston, Texas.  I shared this with my family and co-workers. The flavor I got vanilla, Carmel, Green tea, expresso, and chocolate. My favorite is carmel and my less favorite was green tea.

I am from Philly and I can get a bigger size for cheaper. $2.75 for a small macaron not worth the money. But the macarons were good! I enjoyed eating them. I don't think I'll be coming back here again."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2017-02-26,4.0,"Such a cute cozy little French bakery run by very friendly and helpful French dudes. I got a free macaron because it was my first time coming here! I chose a praline macaron which was delicious of course. 

The purpose of me coming here was to buy a selection of French pastries for my dad to try. I ended up getting an almond chocolate croissant, regular almond croissant, a praline mille feuille, and a box of chocolate cookies. 

The nice person helping me said they have the best croissants in the city. I haven't really tried many croissants in the city so I can't attest to whether or not that is true, but the almond chocolate croissant was incredibly delicious. I normally don't like almond croissants because of the artificial flavoring, but these didn't taste artificial at all! Paired together with the chocolate, it was a really great croissant.

I didn't try the mille feuille, but they seem really popular. There were only 2 praline ones left when I came around 1pm. I bought one, and a lady that came in after me took the other. The chocolate cookies were really not sweet at all and had a crumbly, somewhat sandy texture. The chocolate flavor still shown through well without the sweetness. My mom really liked the chocolate cookies because of that, and they grew on me after me eating one after another.

The bakery is easy to miss. I walked right past it the first time I came. It's right before the copy center and if you see the DŌ, Cookie Dough Confections that means you've walked right past it and will need to turn back. But now that I know where it is, I am definitely coming back to try more of their pastries."

Buy everything and eat everything because the weight gain will be worth it

Although the more recent times I've gone, they didn't have the black currant macaron, and those were by far the best things I've ever had"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2018-05-17,5.0,"Really great authentic French bakery. Service was speedy and the place was clean, convenient location as well. A little pricey, but their bread is always fresh baked and delicious. I had the vegetarian caprese sandwich, and was surprised that they use Gouda instead of the traditional mozzarella! Interesting twist that added sharpness and plenty of smoky flavor."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2016-10-31,4.0,"This review is for the croissant making class. I came here with my mom (an expert baker) and we had a blast even though I am a complete newbie. 

I would recommend getting here a few minutes early so that you can check out the bakery (it's tiny) and to grab a drink and snacks. Everything is so yummy here! The interior is also super cozy and cute. Also, the class said 12:45 - 3:15pm, but expect to stay until about 3:30pm to clean up, pack all of your croissants, etc.

We had 8 people in the class, and the chef was friendly, funny, and helpful. He showed us every step of the process and made tons of jokes that kept us entertained and engaged the entire time. I will never look at a croissant in the same way again. 

The class is not TOO difficult to follow, but make sure to pay close attention when the chef is doing his demo. Also, plan ahead because you will go home with no less than ~12 croissants each, so make sure you have plenty of friends and family expecting delicious croissants! You'll also get extra dough to bake at home, so make sure to carve out extra time and space in your tummy too.

One guy in my class (I should note, the only guy) told us that the macaron class was much easier. I REALLY want to come back for this :) What a lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Highly recommended!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2017-12-09,5.0,"This last trip was my second time at the bakery. We tried out this French patisserie originally for their great macaron Groupons - we regularly now pick up a box of a dozen macarons from them - and have loved both their baked goods and service so much as to keep returning. 

A stone's throw from the picturesque Washington Square park, I typically swing by after work, and no matter how tired I am, this adorable slice of France lifts my spirits. The staff is very friendly and always happy to help me get my macaroons ready to travel, whether just a borough away or upstate to see my relatives. We especially enjoyed their raspberry tarte with lycee and rose creme filling, which was essentially a giant macaron. The outer crust was perfectly crisp and the creme was smooth. A hit at Thanksgiving!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-07-20,5.0,"We had a wonderful day. Vincent and Pauline were lovely, patient and excellent teachers. Would definitely come back for another class!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-01-30,1.0,"Very poor experience with French macaron baking class.

1. Kitchen was very small, without sufficient equipment for the participants - tucked away into the corner of the cafe.
2. The chef in-training has a strong accent and was unclear in directions.
3. All ingredients were pre-measured.
4. The experience was cut shirt for some, as the chef would demonstrate the technique on a participant's macarons, rather than his own demo station.
5. Grossly overpriced - even for the Groupon
6. The complimentary tea / coffee with macarons were never honored.

Based off this experience with a very junior chef, and stingy business, I would not recommend any class."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2018-11-20,5.0,"My fiancé and I are always on the hunt for cooking and baking activities we can do together since our first positive experience taking a cupcake baking class (Butter Lane Bakery). As I do enjoy munching on some Macarons, I know they aren't the easiest to make. My cousin had tried to bake them  on her own before, and then took a baking class after. Needless to say, I can see why Macarons are pricey just for one piece! I booked this class based off the reviews, and when we tried to find the bakery, didn't realize that maybe half the block was also the same building number. Once we found it, we went into a much smaller Cafe than we expected. I was skeptical on how we were all going to be bake 25 Macarons each together.

Our instructor was none other than Executive Chef Olivier Dessyn himself. He must have had this system down pact, because we were able to move around the island counter seamlessly. We made our ganache and cookies together, and learned the proper way to pipe and what our ganache consistency should be like. The flavors were vanilla, chocolate and pistachio. Of course, everything tasted better because we made it.

I purchased a livingsocial voucher, and thought it was a little pricey. However, I realize why it does cost so much to buy Macarons. It's the amount of prep time and materials which need to be consistent when we make Macarons. We were very happy we took this class, and everyone we've shared the Macarons with enjoyed them. I would recommend any first time bakers to try this class."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2016-08-22,5.0,"My friend and I took the macaron baking class here with Chef Olivier Dessyn!

We both had a great time learning the tips and tricks behind baking a macaron. Most of the ingredients come pre-weighed and combined. He is there to help you learn the techniques, but does provide a recipe to take home. There is also a macaron kit that you can purchase after class (~$30). We made chocolate, vanilla, and pistachio. 

Chef Olivier is very clean and meticulous; he did his best to oversee his 8 students. I'm unfortunately one of those people who will touch things in a museum, so he had to make sure I stopped getting ahead of myself (sorry about that). 

Best tips/tricks I've learned in this class: 
- the importance of temperature and timing
- you don't need to bang the metal tray on the counter
- be confident in squeezing! 
- vanilla bean actually adds a green tint 

Thank you Chef Olivier! Great experience learning how to bake macarons! (Look for the Groupon deal - 2 for $132)"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2017-10-14,5.0,"I've been searching for the best almond croissant in the city, and I think I've found it. The outside is slightly crunchy, yielding to buttery layers with the perfect amount of stretch. The texture inside is gooey and delectably chewy, and the almond paste is distinctly nutty without bordering on the overly saccharine.

The caramel cake was delectably moist, so much that it was difficult to eat with fingers, but every bite was pure buttery bliss. This is what all cake loaves should aspire to be.

Finally, I was craving something salty, so I counterbalanced my sugar binge with an olive and cheese breadstick, which was fresh, soft, and flavorful.

I'm really running out of adjectives, so I suggest you just go and try these heavenly creations for yourself. Don't worry about over-ordering, because you probably won't even have enough to share (I thought I'd have leftovers for friends and didn't). Trust me, it's worth every last calorie!

Update: I've now tried the raisin bread and while it was fine, it paled in comparison to Maison Kayser's. The apricot brioche, however, was lightly sweet and perfectly bread-y."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2017-10-02,5.0,"Wow this is good. The mille feuille is absolutely phenomenal. I had the vanilla one, and they also have a praline version. I also had a lemon tart. Just the right amount of tang. No excessive sugar. 

What else is there to write? Maybe I should write the same review in French? Why not!

Wow, c'est bon. Le mille feuille est absolument phénoménal. J'ai eu la vanille, et ils ont aussi une version praliné. J'avais aussi une tarte au citron. Juste la bonne quantité de tang. Pas de sucre excessif."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2016-12-28,3.0,"Dessert:

Fruit tart- the tart wasn't bad and was pretty standard.

Raspberry macaroon with lychee-pretty good mix of flavor.

Service: the waitstaff were a little bit unfriendly.  Seemed like they didn't want to be working there.

Ambiance: there's a few seats inside and at the store front outside but definitely more of a grab and go place.

Overall:  It was ok.  Not sure I'd be back tho."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2017-11-13,5.0,"I had first come across Mille-Feuille when staying at the Hotel Belleclaire in the upper west side, whom they provide pastries for in the lobby. Once moving to NY, I had to go back and have a taste for myself and this place has never disappointed since. Not only is everything they make so decadent and tasty, but you can also see how much time and passion they put into what they offer. 

I excitedly enrolled my girlfriend and I for the macaron baking class which was AMAZING. Pierre, one of the pastry chefs, led the class in a fun, informational and hands on way. We left the class with 24 macarons each, got to taste a bunch along the way, and had an overall great day. I would strongly suggest doing one of their guided classes, because not only are they fun, but you also learn a lot that you can take home with you after it's done."
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-10-28,5.0,"I took a croissant class there recently and have taken the macaron class before, too. Both classes were FANTASTIC! The teacher for this one was a frenchman named Nicholas and he was great. Very friendly, helpful, explained everything well, and he spoke English very well. I will take their mille-feuille class next. I wish they had more classes there. I would take them all!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2016-06-22,4.0,"Not bad for a last minute stop. Millie feuille makes some pretty decent sweets and baked goods like small cakes, tarts, loaves of breads, different types of croissants, and they even had ice cream. 

It's a small shop nestled in between a cluster of store fronts with a good amount of our door seating. It's kind of like a cafe so you can purchase what you want and sit outside but I think it's better to buy what you need and go. 

For the baked goods we got the chocolate hazel nut cake which was not overtly sweet and had some intense chocolate flavor. It was good and it had a really nice crunchy hazelnut bottom. 

The fruit tart had fresh fruit that must've been picked at the right time Bc they were super sweet however the tart itself wasn't too great. It was getting a little too dry and there wasn't really a custard layer to keep it from drying out. Maybe it was late in the day. 

The giant raspberry lychee macaroon was probably the best thing we had that day. The macaroon had the perfect texture and it wasn't too sweet at all. The raspberry and lychee inside was perfect for the macaroon. The fruits were tart/sweet and the perfect foil for the sugar macaroon. 

Lastly of course we got the Millie feuille. Each layer was flaky and delicious. They are able to keep the layers flaky despite the cream between each layer. The cream itself had specks of vanilla bean and you can really taste the quality of the cream and vanilla they use. Not too sweet and it doesn't leave a buttery after taste which I hate. The best way I can describe a Millie feuille ( and I hope it doesn't degrade it) is that it reminds you of a Napoleon cake, flaky dough layers with cream . 

A nice little tip is that all croissants are 50% off after 530 pm! And the owner gave us a free baguette for purchases of more than $15 dollars. Not sure it that's a thing or if it's Bc they were closing soon so don't quote me on that...

Overall good sweets and good service. I would come back"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-05-13,5.0,"It was a wonderful experience for myself and my 11yo son. It was given to me as a birthday gift and we loved it. 
Their food is beautiful. We had lunch afterwards. Highly recommend Mille-Feuille Bakery"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2019-10-07,5.0,"We had a great time at the morning macaron class on Saturday. The space used for the class is pretty compact, but the instructor did a great job in keeping the group organized, ensuring that everyone gets to try all the techniques, and answering questions. You end up taking a lot of macarons home, too!"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2017-04-16,5.0,"*** This review is for macaron-making class only.

So my friend and I had found this Groupon deal in line so decided to give a try. In total 24 macarons, with pistachio, chocolate, and vanilla bean flavors. We started from the beginning - making the dough, mixing the sugar with cream, squeezing it according to the size, baking it, and eventually filling in the middle with chocolate melts.

It took about two hours, and during each step, our instructor Pierre was super helpful and guided us throughout. Learned lots of small tips about baking as well. There was also a small tasting while we were waiting for our macaron to be ready. 

Towards the end, everyone gets her own baked macaron with a cute box. It was definitely a fabulous experience to have and I really had a good time doing everything by myself.

Now the question became, when should I come back for their other baked goodies?"
58,mille-feuille-bakery-new-york-2,2017-05-22,5.0,"I've been here a few times for treats (very yummy) but I recently took a macaron class here and really enjoyed it. I bought a groupon offer, and the class provided all of the ingredients - plus you can take home 24 (or so) macarons that you make. 

I liked that this class was hands-on, but all the tricky parts (like measuring and weighing ingredients, timing the bake, etc) were done by the instructor, I think his name was Dimitri (?). The end result was textbook-perfect macarons even for those who usually never bake. We made beautiful vanilla, pistachio, and chocolate macarons. I thought he did a great job of explaining the process (patiently!), and all in all it was a fun and interesting activity. He also brought out samples of different macaron flavors to try - my favorite was the matcha. 

You can also purchase a macaron kit which includes piping bags, piping tips, spatulas and a candy thermometer, all in a cute Mille-feuille tote. They also sell pistachio paste in case you want to make pistachio macarons at home."

59,charley-st-new-york,2020-06-01,5.0,"We came into Charley St for a quick breakfast and college. The cafe is really nice and quiet inside. There are many comfortable chairs, pillows, and refillable free glass water bottles. The place is a really great place to come and get work done. I got a pastry which was quite good. What impressed me most was the service given at Charley Street. I ordered a coffee, and they were still making coffee so I had to wait. Because of this, they gave me a FREE muffin for my wait. Later I got my coffee after a few minutes. They also seem to also have some awesome bowls with various veggies which looked so good."
59,charley-st-new-york,2020-01-17,3.0,"After a workout, I came here in hopes of having a light breakfast and getting some work done. I got the Happy Morning, which featured avocado and two poached eggs drizzled in olive oil and pesto over a thick slice of sourdough. It was unfortunately quite disappointing. Though the poached eggs were done perfectly, the avocado did not taste fresh and was not seasoned at all. It also left an unpleasant bitter aftertaste. Since the barista also came late (it was 11 o'clock on a weekday?), coffee drinks were unavailable. 

The space itself is quite large with several four-seater tables, making it a good place to work or have a quick coffee meeting. It's self-serve so you just order and pay at the register. They seem severely understaffed with only one person manning the entire place and running in-and-out of the restaurant to grab the food from where I assume to be the kitchen. However, he was very friendly so that was nice.

I'll probably come back in the future to do work on my laptop / finally try their coffee but I'll be skipping their toasts for now."
59,charley-st-new-york,2020-06-05,4.0,"I usually avoid the avocado toast as I find it to be such an easy and inexpensive item to make. However, I was really impressed by the picture of it and took the dive. I'm glad I did as I was pleasantly surprised and my new goal now is to up my avo toast game. Will definitely return the next time I'm in town."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-12-06,5.0,"Not going to lie, before moving to NYC, I had no idea what Australians ate so I had no idea what to expect at an Australian restaurant. This food is good as hell.

I stopped here after morning yoga because I needed to refuel and get something healthy. The food here is really good with a lot of energy and it's legit filled with the important macro and micronutrients you need!

I got the Aussie breakfast and matcha latte. The avocado is seasoned really well and I really like the beet cured salmon. The matcha powder they use also doesn't taste too ""earthy.""

I'm a fan, will come back."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-05-19,5.0,"Came here for lunch after my workout class @ hit house. I got the down to earth bowl to go and a cold brew coffee (FREE if you check in @ yelp, yas). The bowl tastes amazing and is very fulfilling - I particularly love the hummus and grilled eggplant in the bowl. The price tag is $10-$15 bucks for a bowl, which tbh is very affordable for Nolita.

One more thing I want to note is its friendly staff. Everyone I talked to was very nice and smiley.  It really makes the whole ordering and waiting experience better. 

All in all, this place is great. I am definitely coming back to try some other bowls"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-05-01,5.0,"Had a great quick lunch here today. They offer a variety of options, mostly focused around breakfast and lunch options (think avocado toast, poached eggs, bowls and coffee/tea).

I went with the Down to Earth bowl and it was delicious. The mushroom ragú was not what I expected but all the different flavors and textures in the bowl complemented each other well. 

Great staff and fair prices. Such a good and underrated lunch spot in the area!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-12-16,3.0,"Charley St is a cute spot with the famous avocado wall in their bathroom. However, I was quite disappointed in my meal. I arrived at noon with a friend and the waitress told me they were all out of their smoothie bowls. That was a huge bummer and I scanned the menu for my second choice and opted for their Aussie Classic. They were out of the salmon for that and she prompted me to get their Happy Morning ($14) which came with two poached eggs, a small amount of kale chips, and mashed avocados on very thick toasts. It's hard to justify the price for that, and it was unfortunately not too great. It was quite sour and the kale chips were the only redemption to the meal. I also ordered their matcha latte ($4.5), which was too powdery for my liking."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-10-09,5.0,"This is the perfect spot for that after workout meal or if you are not starving but need something healthy in your system. 

The space itself is airy and beautiful. It's a great space to come and grab a coffee and an avocado toast for a quick chat with a friend or for some light reading. 

I had the Avo Smash and also tried one of their juice options. 
I found it filling enough and refreshing. 

The service was great and everything seems to be at a decent price point. 

4.6/5"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-05-28,5.0,"Took a long walk here from work on a nice day and it was very worth it! 

Cute spot with room to do work as well as eat. I honestly don't remember what I got but it was a bowl and it left me wanting to go back for more. Just wish the portions were a littleeeee bit larger."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-11-30,4.0,"A really cute spot to eat a quick meal, study, or just relax! I came here with a friend on a weekday and there was plenty of open seating available. I ordered the avocado toast and it was delicious yet fairly pricey for the portion size. The staff members were very kind while taking our orders and serving us. The space itself is quaint but well decorated with an enjoyable ambiance."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-10-24,5.0,"Great food, plenty of seating indoors and out, free WiFi and outlets--what more can you ask for? Add to it free flat and sparkling water on tap and super friendly service and you have the perfect lunch spot. I made my own bowl with babaganoush, kale, quinoa, squash, broccoli, apple, apoached egg, and spicy cashew sauce--it was all delicious, and the friendly staff even let me taste test some of the sauces to decide which I liked most. This place is light and airy and has all the amenities you could need for an afternoon work spot, plus exceptionally great staff and locally sourced food. Can't recommend highly enough!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-04-24,4.0,"Cute little dine-in brunch spot! The interior was very refreshing, open and calming. I love that they had tables with both chairs and couches--plus they have wifi! 
The food was reasonably priced, most items about $11, and all the ingredients were fresh and very healthy. The reason why I rated 4 stars was that the food tasted a little bland, probably due to the lack of salt or extra flavoring added. But I believe this place offers very healthy and filling options to eat, but it just was a little too healthy for my usual taste, hence the lack of artificial favoring. Overall I had a great experience at Charley St., and I will surely be back for brunch! 

Food: 9/10
Atmosphere: 10/10
Service: 10/10"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-10-14,5.0,"This place has a great, positive energy and very kind staff. The meals are healthy, well portioned and the prices are reasonable. The free coffee with a yelp check in is also great! 

I would recommend you build your own bowl with the smoked salmon and cauliflower. Overall, a great lunch spot in NoLita area!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-04-07,5.0,"Came here to study after a trip to the New Museum and it ended up being the perfect spot to catch up on some reading!

I ordered the ""OG Avo Smash"" on gluten-free bread which they happily informed me was vegan too. Between the walnut miso, pickled tomato and onion, and lemon it was perfectly tangy which I believe is the secret to a good avocado toast. At the cost of sounding so millennial, I have to say I am pro-chunky avocado toast so my only complaint would be how pureed the avocado seemed.

Speaking of avocado, the bathroom is adorable and fully covered in avocado wallpaper. There is a cute neon ""smashed in nyc"" sign on the wall with, you guessed it, another avocado. The tables are clean and white with comfy booths and pillows, all-in-all creating a great backdrop for all your Instagram needs.

I will definitely be back to try the build-your-own-bowls. I'm intrigued by the mushroom ragu and butternut squash spread. I also love any place that lets me order half cauliflower rice/half quinoa as a base."
59,charley-st-new-york,2020-02-06,5.0,Sooooo good! Went back literally the next day. Very fresh ingredients. Had the bowl with coconut curry chicpeas. The bowl was delicious and so satisfying. Cool relaxing vibe. Had breakfast the next day it was a Delicious meal with poached egg dish with veggie choizo. I wanna go back and try everything!!!
59,charley-st-new-york,2018-12-19,5.0,"Such a cozy spot to catch up on some work and have a hearty meal! I'm visiting friends in the city and needed to squeeze in a couple of hours of work. 

Food 5/5: I got a salted caramel oatmeal bowl, and it was absolutely scrummy. It was served cold and topped with strawberries and crunchy thing. The flavors lined up very well, and the portion was absolutely HUGE. I also got a house coffee (10 am in NYC is 7 am, meaning I need an extra energy boost).

Ambiance 4.5/5: This spot is so spacious and filled with light. There are plenty of outlets, but I don't think they have WiFi (at least I couldn't figure it out). 

Service 5/5: everything was fast and delicious, what else can you wish for?

Bonus point: they have a hip restroom with avocado wallpaper (got some nice selfies there)."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-05-27,5.0,"This place was an awesome random find wandering through the streets of SOHO in the early morning. While I'm as big a meat eater as the next person - this primarily veggie based menu didn't make you worry about missing out on that glorious protein. We ordered:

- Naughty Eggs ($14)
- Byron Bowl ($11)
- Cortado ($3.70)
- Cappucino ($3.90)

..and man did it hit the spot. The veggie-based chorizo was very impressive on the Naughty Eggs. It left this Choriz-aholic satisfied. 

Beyond the food and drank, the atmosphere and vibe was laid-back and inviting. It reminded us of our favorite spots back in LA. 

Overall - very impressed with this spot in this crowded market of trendy SOHO. I'd definitely recommend stopping by for your morning caffeine and breaky."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-05-04,5.0,"If you are looking for a healthy grab and go eatery or to stay hangout and chat with your friends, this is an ideal spot in Nolita. Don't miss the avocado wallpaper in the bathroom, the oat milk cortados are one of the best in the city, and the banana bread which by the way is gluten free with no added sugar. 

My go to order: oat milk cortado, lunch the seasonal soup. 

Dog friendly, perfect for woman's best friend. 

P.s. Linus likes a poached egg"

LOVE this place. met a GF for breakfast who was in town for just a day. first off, the staff is amazing and was very informative. but the food was the winner here. I had the avocado smash which had pickled onions, kale crisps and some kind of tasty drizzle on two large pieces of sourdough toast. my gf also had smashed avocado on sourdough but her's had a pesto spread as well as the kale crisps and poached eggs. will DEF be back. yummy!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2018-08-29,3.0,"Cute decor - Like all new places these days, there are a lot of insta-worthy elements. Super nice staff as well. Unfortunately, I feel like their food falls a bit flat and pricing is still not low enough for what you get (self service too). There's a lot of other Australian brunch places popping up in the city (Banter, Two Hands, etc...) so you really have to have great food to stand out...

Their menu can be a little clearer on what's included and what is extra/for how much, especially on the bowls. Even after he explained it, I still didn't quite get it and just ordered something right off the menu with no additions. I'm not sure if you order first or if you pay first, but since there was no one else in line, the guy took our order and asked us to go pay at the cashier. They then brought the food over to our table (not sure if this is the norm since they don't give you numbers, or if this was just because they weren't busy), but utensils/water are all self service.

This is what we got:

Aussie Classic (Avo poached egg with salmon on toast or grains) $11.40
I chose to get this with the grains (website says +$1 but I don't remember if I got charged that or not since it didn't say that in-store). When I saw it, it looked pretty drabby...all the colors and plating looked bleh. When I started to dig into it, there really wasn't a lot of flavor unless you pair everything with the smoked salmon. Also not a lot of texture in this dish either. Pretty disappointed.

Feeling Nutty (Signature butternut coconut spread, roasted cauliflower, tahini) $9.80
My friend got the Feeling Nutty - I actually really liked the presentation of this dish, super fresh/bright colors. I didn't get to try it but she seemed to like it. If you're hungry, I would imagine this wouldn't be enough though :(

They also have a BYOB option for $11.25 - not super clear on how the upcharges work for certain things, but it may be worth it to see if this could be a cheaper option.

BYOB ($11.25)
Choice of grain or toast (quinoa, wild rice, sourdough toast, gluten-free toast)
1 green (arugula, kale)
1 spread (roasted garlic hummus, avocado, coconut beet, butternut coconut)
2 toppings
1 sauce
1 protein (chicken, smoked salmon, poached egg, vegan mushroom ragu)
*on their website, it doesn't list any additional charge for salmon, but in their store menu it says +$2. The vegan mushroom ragu option is also not on their in-store menu.

I know it's sometimes super nice to have all the windows open on a nice summer day, but when it's super humid and hot, they should probably consider closing everything up and turn up the AC. It was pretty steamy inside on the day I went and there were lots of flies everywhere unfortunately :(."
59,charley-st-new-york,2020-03-04,5.0,I eat their PBJ oatmeal and avo toast at least twice a week. Food is fab and the people who run this place are even better.
59,charley-st-new-york,2020-02-24,4.0,So delicious!!!! As a vegan I was overwhelmed by the wonderful options. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because the kale had lots of dirt/sand in it.
59,charley-st-new-york,2020-02-02,5.0,Naughty eggs with a side of avocado is amazing. The quinoa and goat cheese was very tasty and refreshing! LaTte with oat milk was made to perfection. Hot ass aussies working. Ummm yes please
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-08-30,3.0,"The staff was incredibly friendly, the place was beautiful, and the ambiance was inviting. 

However, the food did not meet our expectations. We ordered the Naughty Eggs and the Happy Morning. The Naughty Eggs were too rich. The hummus with the tofu with the bread with the sauce with the egg yolk made for a rather unbalanced and heavy dish. I still finished it as each individual component was tasty, but I definitely was in need of some greens or acidity on my plate.

The Happy Morning tasted a bit better. The toast had a thick crust and a very soft center. The pesto was delicious and the avocado was just what I needed. However, shortly after this meal I got a stomach ache, and had to regurgitate the meal. Twice. It was an unfortunate experience and while I'm sure it is not a regular issue for them, I don't believe I will be returning because of this incident.

Overall, it tasted better on the way in."
59,charley-st-new-york,2020-01-29,5.0,Awesome avo smash and coffee and  easy going staff and ambiance. Really enjoyed a breakfast here while in NYC
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-08-03,5.0,Made my own bowl with chicken and it was delicious. Everything specially the chicken had a lot of flavor but also felt very wholesome and homemade. The location is super cute with some outside tables and the owners very friendly!
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-10-07,5.0,"I had such a positively delightful experience here, that I had to make a review!
I walked in this morning like the starved, lost tourist that I was (brain fog and all), and was taken through a description of the menu including all the favorites by a gentleman who worked there. 
I proceeded to get the recommended ""Naughty Eggs"" (amazing name!) and an oat milk latte (yay oat milk!). It's a nice atmosphere, as you order and pay up front and choose a table to sit at. Oat milk latte was fantastic! Great job barista! I think his name was Aaron?? (I could be making that up).
Then the Naughty Eggs arrived! The portion was larger than I imagined! In shock! But it was amaaaazing!!! I never knew plant-based chorizo could taste so good! And the poached eggs were perfection! The most perfect poached eggs ever! I was somehow able to eat practically the whole thing!
Anyways, long review summarized - amazing food, amazing atmosphere, amazing people! Highly recommend. Next time I'm in NYC, I will definitely be coming back! Open one in Portland, Oregon please???"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-09-25,1.0,"I normally don't write reviews but I ordered the Nolita bowl for delivery and it was honestly awful. The chicken was dry and shredded and looked like dog food. The butternut squash was hard, cold and random. The ""avocado"" was actually just spread out browned guac that smelled very bad. All in all not a good experience and not good food. Will not order from here again."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-11-24,5.0,"Great spot in Nolita for a fast casual brunch. Pretty spacious in comparison to other NYC restaurants, with a light and airy feel. Can't beat the hospitality- even the Owners are there for a chat and offering their recommendations. Aussie Classic is one of my go-tos, the beet colored salmon makes the dish extra fun! Great baristas who take their coffee seriously. Sparkling water on tap is a great perk and can't miss the avocado bathroom wallpaper if you're a first timer!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-12-22,5.0,"The best avocado toast, the best beet-pickled salmon, the best staff, the best bathroom wallpaper. Love this place!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-06-16,5.0,"By far one of the best Australian Avo-toasts joints in the city.  But don't count out their bowls!  The Nolita bowl with chicken is clean, guiltless, and loaded with flavor.  The Naughty Eggs came highly recommended so we'll definitely be back for another round. THANKS DAN!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-03-31,1.0,"I had such a bad experience eating the food from here.  I got the feeling nutty and the bread was burnt.  Not just slightly burnt, but completely black and burnt all the way through.  They actually put the butternut squash on top of a completely black slice of bread.  It was completely inedible.

I also had the Tahini Time and it was also burnt (specifically, the sweet potato hash).  I had to like pick out the burnt chunks and eat the parts that weren't burnt.

I've never eaten at a place where the food was so obviously burnt.  And they still served it like that and the employees didn't care.  All I got from this place was a few bites of ""healthy"" fare and a few bites of carcinogenic burnt food.  It wasn't a filling meal or a pleasant experience."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-03-07,1.0,"Yummy food but I had a horrible experience with a worker there. He was extremely rude, gossiping about me while I ate and I could hear him. I did absolutely nothing wrong and he was just making fun of me with a coworker. I'll never go back here again which sucks because the food was good. But I've never had an experience like that- probably ever in my life :/ 
If you do go here, try the tahini time bowl. It was really good. I just can't stomach the unwelcoming atmosphere there ever again."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-08-13,5.0,One of the best bowls! It is alway so good and the people are friendly! Would definitely love to go back soon!
59,charley-st-new-york,2018-10-20,4.0,"This is a very popular brunch place. I got the build your own bowl with beet salmon. The food tastes very healthy and the presentation is very pretty. However, this place gets very noisy and loud during brunch that it's difficult to actually have a conversation. In addition, the service (e.g. checking out, assembling your bowl) can be very slow and confusing."
59,charley-st-new-york,2018-07-22,5.0,"There are a ton of Australian cafes in New York now, but Charley St is one of the ones serving the best food. This place is run by the owners of Three Seat Espresso in East Village, which my boyfriend and I are also big fans of. 
The cafe is a minimal white space, with green and millennial pink accents, featuring still and sparkling water on tap. The food is health-focused, and very modestly priced. They serve the same range of coffee as at Three Seat. 
We came on a Sunday morning and there were a couple of people inside already. They have all the food at the front, resembling a cafeteria, but the cafe includes table service. 
I had the Tahini Time (around $10), and my boyfriend had the Aussie Classic (prices around the same). His dish was good, though it hard to go wrong with avocado toast and smoked salmon. 
Tahini Time included quinoa, walnuts, sweet potato and coconut spread, sweet potato hash, roasted Brussels sprouts, with a drizzle of tahini. It was both mine and my boyfriend's favorite of the two dishes, cooked well and very tasty. I also felt good eating it. 
Service is genuinely friendly and efficient. Highly recommend for a great brunch!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2018-08-12,5.0,"I enjoyed this cute healthy spot a lot!
A lot of veggie options.

It's new and ready to rock.
You can build your own bowl/plate and they also have gluten free bread.

Located in Soho, i like their interiors and cups, perfect for IG pictures."
59,charley-st-new-york,2018-07-19,5.0,"AMAZING new Aussie fast-casual restaurant in heart of Nolita. Staff is welcoming/friendly, food is DELICIOUS, coffee is spot-on and the prices are killer. HIGHLY recommend 
--
First visit at Charley St I ordered two-toasts for breakfast, worked from laptop for a few hours and stayed for lunch. Safe to say this is my new go-to spot"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-04-06,5.0,"Part of the charm of this restaurant is the friendly staff. There's hope here. Know what I mean? We enjoyed our lattes and the ""Happy Morning"" we split. Good quality. We saw a line for a restaurant a block away and thought, ""suckers!"". Just a block away was this great place!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-04-22,5.0,"Visited today for the first time, I asked the first person I saw, I think her name was Seline, what i should get. She suggested the down to earth...and it was great! The food was beautiful- it looked like art. Staff and place was cool too"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-04-18,5.0,Came here looking for a quality but quick sit down breakfast place and was not disappointed! Got the Aussie Classic Breakfast and was able to get a free coffee from their Yelp promo. Beautifully plated dishes and a friendly staff.
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-04-28,2.0,"I'm super disappointed. I'm moving right across the street from here so I was excited to try out a new go to! Unfortunately I don't really plan on coming back. The food was on the pricier side for what you get. My breakfast hash with a small coffee was $14 but was an extremely small portion. It was also extremely boring. Not enough sauce or salt or something. 

I'd be up to come back and try a different bowl but I don't know if I want to waste my money again when I can get a large, delicious serving at sweetgreen for the same price!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-08-07,3.0,"I got the bowl (I believe called Harvest) with chickpeas, sweet potato, wild rice... The rice was very bland, I had to at least at salt and pepper. The sweet potatoes were spicy. I was actually not able to eat more than 2 and had to get rid of rest:( I also ordered a juice and was confused because the price on the board read $6 but I was charged $8, when I questioned it, they said the board prices had not been updated. Eh, I took it anyway as I was thirsty. NOT worth $8! (watermelon and mint) Finally I checked in and got a coffee. It was free, so okay but very bitter. Customer service was just okay."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-12-21,1.0,Food & owners suck! Bland food and the owner Kieran is an absolute dick. Never coming back here
59,charley-st-new-york,2020-01-30,5.0,Cute place. GREAT FOOD. Friendly staff and owner. Will definitely come back and recommend you check it out.
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-03-05,5.0,This is my FAVORITE Aussie cafe and you're hearing it from an aussie herself. I dont know what secret sauce they're using in their dips but they are so freaking good. It's cheaper than most brekkie cafes out there but the portions are pretty massive. Dan's such a friendly guy who's the chef and co-owner of that place. Definitely check this place out.
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-08-17,5.0,"This place is excellent. Aussie run, Aussie themed menu. Healthy, fresh tasting and the staff is possibly the nicest and friendliest staff I've encountered.. and I eat out a lot."
59,charley-st-new-york,2020-02-06,1.0,"Ordered lunch after being an hour late I called grub hub, they reached out to the restaurant who apologized said they would refund the order and still deliver the food. Never refunded and food never showed. I tried calling the restaurant directly but they were closed at 3pm. Honestly DO NOT waste your time ordering delivery."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-04-06,5.0,"As soon as we opened the door, we were greeted with a warm welcome! The menu is simple and easy, but yet perfect for what we needed on a rainy Sunday morning. A couple of us in the group decided on the Aussie classic, which is made with smoked salmon, avocado, and poached egg on some toast. Chef and owner, Dan, briefed us on how they prepare their salmon days before for a true Aussie taste! The place was well lit & the ambiance overall was cozy and inviting - looking forward to more visits to Charley St this summer!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-08-14,5.0,Just enjoyed the byron bay smoothie bowl with their house-made peanut butter. So good -- great balance of sweet and salty. Incredibly friendly staff and positive vibe makes this an NYC gem.
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-09-15,5.0,"Have been in 4 days in a row. Great selection of coffee, and food! Staff is so sweet and helpful. 10/10 would recommend!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-07-11,3.0,"I ordered the seasonal watermelon bowl, the photo looked amazing and it sounded great. The salad I was served looked nothing like it and was also super messy and soggy. The avocado was partially mashed and brown. Also the apple slices were all brown (so I tossed them off). The watermelon was soggy and there were only 4 cubes. Super bummed! This place maybe needs better quality control."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-08-14,5.0,"Delightful atmosphere, owner and food! Highly recommend for a healthy and creative experience."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-09-07,3.0,Had high expectations for this place but had an unfortunately mediocre experience. The food was tasty but the service was subpar. Waited over 30 mins for my food and when it came out it was missing items I had paid extra for. They tried to make it up to us by giving us a stamp card for a free drink but only 6 of the 9 were punched so would still need to come back 4 more times. Not a great experience.
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-06-22,5.0,"Tons of seating inside, everyone working here is super friendly! Smiles all around make ordering so nice. Great music! Healthy food. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the city"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-09-01,4.0,"This place is very nice and quite. The staff was very friendly and the coffee was amazing! I ordered an iced latte and my friend ordered an Iced coffee and we both were very pleased! Its a beautiful and a very aesthetically pleasing store! I did not get a chance to try the food since my friend and I had eaten previously, but it also looked very good. I am looking forward to returning and trying more things from the menu!"
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-12-27,5.0,"Healthy food, fair prices in a clean casual atmosphere. It was crowded but everyone working there was very friendly and helpful. I will seek it out next time I am in the area."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-08-17,5.0,"Stumbled upon this spot.  The staff catered to our demands, my girlfriend is on Keto and they customized her bowl and she loved it!  I also enjoyed my selection.  Highly recommend."
59,charley-st-new-york,2019-03-24,4.0,"Very very cute place tucked away.  Know about it or miss it!  I had the Aussie classic, which was very good.  A tiny bit expensive and our server wasn't all that attentive, but I would definitely return and try something else from the menu for variety."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-12-18,5.0,My absolute FAVORITE coffee shop in New York; a classic coffee shop in every aspect of true New York style. A testament to doing simplicity so perfectly well. It's such a precious local gem of a place I struggle with keeping the balance of telling everyone I know how much I love it and keeping it a secret so it's not overrun with hipsters.
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-08-01,5.0,This place truly lives up to its name. Classic as in I was transposed back in time. Even the pricing modules seem old school for this area.
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-02-10,3.0,"Very small and somewhat charming coffee shop, which also serves sandwiches and a few other items.

There are a few upsides to this place. The first is that this is a charming place, in that it feels very old school what with the memorabilia. The owner cooks stuff fairly quickly, and the food tastes decent. 

There are downsides too, however. Firstly, the hours aren't too great, since this place closes on weekdays by 4:00 PM, which means it is impossible to stop by for a sandwich or something of the sort after work ends. Secondly, this place doesn't open at all over the weekends, which is the time I would have thought traffic would actually be the highest in this area. Doesn't make sense to me. Finally, though the food is good, it is a little expensive relative to what you get, considering the sandwiches are quite, quite small."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-06-17,5.0,"This one is another staple of the lower east side. No frills, just simple breakfast sandwich and coffee. As a kid I would remember how amazing the bagel with butter or bagel with cream cheese were. The brownie is also absolutely delicious. 

The original owner doesn't seem to make too many appearances there anymore, but his son? has taken over. My friend and I stopped by today and it definitely has the same feeling. Although the food seems to be a bit different from what we remembered as kids, it was still a great nostalgic visit. 

$2 for a bagel with cream cheese! Make sure to get the bagel toasted to let the butter and cream cheese melt alitte!"
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-12-12,5.0,Great coffee shop/simple breakfast diner. We came in for a quick breakfast before going to central park and it was perfect. I got a bfast sandwich with ham egg and cheese on a bagel and coffee was around $5.00. The owner is nice and down to earth. If you are in the area this is a grear place to stop in.
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-12-02,5.0,"What an awesome old-school NY spot!

From the tuna melt on rye, to the walk up window, to turquoise walls, to the polite yet gruff chef, to the egg cream... 
I can't believe it too me so long to go here!
Love it."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-08-24,5.0,"With rising costs of living and renting or owning property not only in the Lower East Side, but in NYC in general, I'm glad that nostalgic places like Classic Coffee Shop still exist. Walking into here is exactly like walking into a time portal going back 30, 40, 50 years. There are old school signages, bar stools, radios and photographs all around the store. This coffee shop is supposedly second generation owned and the man who spearheads the store nowadays went to school directly across the street at P.S.42.  

There is nothing fancy about the menu and what is offered here. Nothing overly complicated and hipster. Just what kids would typically want to eat as a quick snack before or after school at extremely inexpensive prices. I'm a big fan of the ham and egg on a bialy here. Aside from that, cold cuts, snacks, cheese sandwiches and old school beverages such as the Lower East Side classic egg cream are also offered here. I tried my very first egg cream at this spot now that I think about it. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend giving this place a shot if you're ever in the neighborhood and looking for a quick snack. Everything in this venue has a very homey atmosphere. Everything from the 2 tables and chairs to the pan used to fry up your egg that is not much bigger than the size of your palm. The man running the shop is a extremely cool guy and won't hesitate to strike up a friendly conversation with you. I truly hope this Lower East Side staple stays open for another 50 years!"
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-01-27,5.0,"This place deserves six stars because it's finally a no frills just good old coffee and food place. Many coffee I have encountered recently serve this organic coffee that literally tastes like cigarettes and I'm sick of it!!!

I begin to ask myself ""what happened to the mom and pop shop that serves coffee out of the pot and none of those fancy machines??"" Classic Coffee shop answered this question for me. The space is small but it's made for a quick bite and coffee. Prices are extremely inexpensive, I got two coffees and a brownie for 4 bucks. 

Everyone try the brownie! No nuts, no fudge just a yummy and gooey brownie for $1. This delicious dessert melts in your mouth and pairs perfectly with their delicious coffee. No joke I think this is one of the best cups of coffee I have had in NYC. 

The staff is so nice too. The man who was working there engaged in conversation with my boyfriend and I. He really seemed to enjoy talking to people and didn't rush us out which I loved!!! Now that I know this place is here I will DEFINITELY be back!! 

I highly recommend for great no frills coffee and desserts at an insanely fair price!"
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-08-05,5.0,"Super friendly service from Michael today. He can make a pretty mean tuna fish on rye. Also a good conversationalist, like his pops.
Btw, just discovered there is a bathroom in the back. You wouldn't think it because of the size of the place, but it's there and also decorated with lots of pictures, so it's worth a visit even just to wash your hands."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2019-09-08,5.0,Great spot. Inexpensive and delicious. Classic is the perfect word for it! Love that it's untouched when so much around it has changed.
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-07-17,5.0,"The name speaks for itself: Classic!!

1.The prices are good, & my aunt Judy, used to come here since the early 80`s. 

2. I like the decor this is a real, retro, coffee shop, that`s been here for 42 years.   

3. I call this Classic Coffee Shop, a Time Machine, you'll feel like you time traveled to the 1950's.

4. Coffee, & food is tasty, the owner Carmine is a nice person to talk to, & his son Mike is into the same music as me. 

I highly recommend this place!! :) 
Note: There's not too many places like this, left in NYC."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-07-29,5.0,"Walked passed this place a number of times while wandering around Chinatown and finally decided to stop in and try it out. What lured me in was the sign exclaiming they made good, old-fashioned egg creams, and admittedly I'm a sucker for a good egg cream.

The place itself is small, with 2 or 3 tables for seating, some counter stools, and that's about it. The decor is nothing fancy and the place lives up to it's name: classic. 

To put it simply, this is a no-frills place that's won my heart over. The vanilla egg cream I got was perfect, a good size for what I paid for, done right. I also snagged a brownie for $1 just to give that a try as well. 

Both items were tasty and I'll definitely be back on a more regular basis. Stop by this place while you still can, I'm honestly afraid it's going to be gone before I can even finish typing the word hyper-gentrification..."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-03-14,5.0,"Old school mom and pop coffee shops like this are amazing. Food and coffee here is very fairly priced and as other reviewers mentioned, no frills.

The decor of the shop is incredible and makes me feel like I've time traveled every time I come here. Great place to grab coffee and catch up with friends."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-12-18,4.0,"It is exactly what the name of this place describes it to be: classic coffee shop. You have your typical coffee and breakfast sandwiches. There are bagels, bialys, rolls, toast, and desserts. This is your no-frills, old diner style cafe, with amazing service. The owner is really friendly and has a lot of love for what he does, I can tell. I overheard him talking to a tourist about how it has been a family business for over 40 years! What impressed me the most were the wall decorations, which consists of old pictures of the shop and its owners. The prices are really good for a place on the LES, portions are huge."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-09-06,5.0,"Old fashioned, walking in here is taking a trip into American history--it's just a great vibe and the owner is an open book--they have been open for 42 years, cheers to that, price was right food was yummy especially the EGG CREAM!"
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-03-23,5.0,"This coffee shop has been in the neighborhood for as long as I can remember. I used to order bagels here as a kid going to elementary school across the street. It has been a few years since I stopped by but this week I decided to bring my friend who was visiting out of town to show her a little piece of my history.

Now as an adult I love to put cream cheese, jelly, and butter on my plain bagel (you might think this is a crazy combo but try it. It's a heart attack in a bagel but your mouth will thank me.)  I grew up ordered a toasted butter bagel so I had to order just that. The bagel was exactly how I remembered it.

I felt like I was transformed back to a time I had long forgotten. The shop owner who is no longer the giant I remembered him to be, completed the moment for me. I wish this was on my way to work every morning.

The decor has not changed much and he's preserved everything. Make sure to stop by if you are in the neighborhood."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-04-19,5.0,Nice cafe so small place but so good coffee too. They make good sandwiches too. The space is so little. But in general is good cafe. The owner is so nice and friendly.
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-06-13,5.0,"Me and sis was walking around the area where we used to go to elementary school. Saw the classic coffee shop and decided to get a light bite. We looked at the menu and decided on a egg with cheese bagel and the popular egg cream. The classic coffee shop is know for their egg cream which is like almost 100 years old. It's made from milk and seltzer. The owner is very friendly and took his time making the bagel and egg cream. The cafe was opened by the owners dad. The dad went to the elementary across the street ps 42. So cool that a student from that elementary school opened this cafe. This cafe is very old school and with old school radios, posters, fridge, counters and chairs. The bagel was made to perfection. Me and sis shared half of the bagel. After leaving the cafe me and sis wanted to order another bagel because it was so delicious. It's made so good that makes us want to go back for more. Best to go on weekends when it's quite and not crowded. When school is in session it can be quite crowded. Since I went on the weekend and me and sis were the only customer. The owner really took his time making the bagel to perfection. Definitely going back for more of the delicious bagels. You don't get to see much of these old school cafes in the city."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-07-09,5.0,"Coming here finally gave me a true LES experience, and the name perfectly depicts what it's like to have a classic cup of coffee and homemade delicious brownie made by the owner himself! I really enjoy looking at antiques so the knick knacks of memorabilia he has around the shop are such a nice touch! You feel completely welcomed & everything is made as if you had it at home if you know what I mean. Most authentic (probably only) coffee shop in the neighborhood!"
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-06-24,5.0,"I'm in NYC for the month and this spot is my go to breakfast place every day. Family owned, no frills, and in business for 41 years, truly a neighborhood gem."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-11-27,5.0,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Nothing short of a total classic coffee shop!!! Everything - the fabulous food, ambience, service, decor, music, location... everything. One of my favorite coffee shops, ever anywhere."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-01-30,4.0,"Come in for the old school NYC no bullshit atmosphere, the Folgers coffee, the simple quick egg breakfast"
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-07-09,5.0,Best breakfast sandwiches in New York City!!! I love this place. Beloved neighborhood spot
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2017-07-17,5.0,"Great cheap egg creams! 2.00$ for a big one! And it was GOOD! Michael, the son of the owner made it perfectly, and he was so nice and friendly.  They actually make the food right in front of you, taking the eggs out of the fridge when you ask for a turkey and egg sandwich! Cash only, so make sure you have that with you because it's worth it:)"
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2014-11-18,5.0,"One of the greatest parts of my new york experience has been this coffee shop. 

Great begals, bialys and egg creams.

A lot of the regulars know each and everyones opinion is welcome when conversation breaks out. Which it regularly does!

I moved pretty far away but still make it a point to dropin whenever I'm in the area. 

Stop by and say hi to Carmine!"
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-08-30,5.0,"Wow, talk about a find!!!!!  The name really does say it all.  There are not many places left like this in New York my friends.  So rare that I was completely dumbfounded.  The owner is a really, really great guy and he makes a great grilled cheese.  My other had an egg salad sandwich which was great and fresh, something that is hard to find in NYC.  Most places have egg salad that comes out of a 5 gallon bucket.  Yuck.  Most importantly though - great coffee and I had my first egg cream here!  Places like this have so much more to offer than the giganto-corporate places.  I wish I lived closer, I would certainly be a regular.  You could eat lunch here for 7.00$  Try and find that in NYC.  Cash only as it should be."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-04-22,5.0,"I spent the recent week roaming the Lower East of NYC with my camera and watching Tribeca Films in between. 
Early in the week I fortunately discovered the  Classic Coffee Shop at 56 Hester Street just a couple blocks from my hotel. It has typical Lower East Side ambiance and charm while serving great tasting coffee and sandwiches at very reasonable prices. Inside the place is cozy and clean with lots of interesting pictures on the walls. The owner has been there for over 40 years and is interesting to chat with. The shop has an outside serving window facing north and when the morning sun shines down Hester Street the light and shadows are beautiful. The owner said it's his ""window to the world"" and he has all kinds of stories about what he has observed over the years. I highly recommend giving it a ""try"". It is now my favorite coffee shop in the area."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-08-17,5.0,"I stumbled across this place by accident. And I'm glad. 

It's a simple menu, with tasty sandwiches. The music playing great classics and the guy who I'm guessing is the owner has a great personality. 

The only down side that it is cash only. 

If I'm near here again I'll be back."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-02-25,5.0,I came here after 20 years and nothing has changed. I used to come here as a kid where the elementary school across the street would let us out to play during lunch and I would always get a butter bagel . This is a gem. The food and options are very simple but good.
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-04-17,5.0,Throwback to anther era. One of the last bastions of the old LES. Delicious egg sandwiches.  Perfect for a quick casual breakfast.
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2018-03-14,5.0,One of the best cups of coffee I've ever had. The place is charming and cozy. Really a comfortable spot to just sit and wind down. Service was great too. I will definitely pay another visit the next time I'm in the area.
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2013-11-27,5.0,"Classic Coffee Shop, the name says it all. I can't believe I've never reviewed this place.

Like most people, I frequented this place when I went to school at PS 42. This was back in the late 90s and early 2000s (wow that makes me feel old), but the place hasn't changed much. The menu is still small, and the quality of the food is still the same. I've always contended that this place has the best toasted buttered bagel I've ever had. The owner runs this place by himself, and does it quickly and efficiently even during the rush of kids.

The atmosphere is great, really makes you feel like you're not in a bustling modern city, but rather the bygone days of yesteryear."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-05-01,5.0,"Stumbled across this gem after a longass bus ride from Chicago a few months ago. Great coffee and bagels but what really makes this place special is the ambience. Nothing fancy, if that's what you have in mind but suffused with a sense of history. The owner has been running this place for decades and I had a great chat with him about the city. Also, quite possibly the best music selection I've heard playing in any establishment in New York."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2014-12-04,5.0,"After a 90 minute cab ride from JFK to my nearby hotel I needed a place to hang out while waiting for my room. I turned to Yelp and found this little gem. Carmine was behind the bar when I walked in and 3 regulars were eating lunch. I had a delicious hot cup of coffee and ordered an egg and cheese bagel, it really hit the spot. What a great little local hang out. The place literally only seats 8, 4 barstools and 2 small tables. Carmine, the owner, said he has been there almost 39 years now and grew up in the neighborhood. Most of the people who came and went while I was there he knew by name. I'm happy I had a chance to enjoy this rare little find. Great atmosphere and even better company. Definitely check it out!"
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-12-14,5.0,I was looking for a breakfast sandwich. I found a time machine to the 1970s. And the ham egg and cheese roll was good too.
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2014-01-27,5.0,"The owner Carmine is a friendly man who has kept this place open for over 21 years. This place is like a time capsule. Carmine has pictures of his family on the wall, Rocky Marciano and a picture of himself on the cover of Rolling Stones. He also has pictures of PS 42 when he was a child and old pictures of the neighborhood. There is one small table and stools. He cooks everything himself. Menu is rather small but everything he makes taste good and I seriously mean it. He makes the best buttered bagel and egg sandwich. He also makes cream soda. Very retro and a delightful place in this neighborhood that has clearly gentrified. I hope he continues to keep this place open and/or his children take on his legacy (This place is legendary in this neighborhood)."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2012-04-04,5.0,"I love this charming coffee shop on Hester Street. It's been in the neighborhood for three decades and stopping in here is like going back in time. The walls are covered with old pictures and the coffee is cheap - $1.00 for a small cup and $1.50 for a large. It's not the most mind-blowing cup of coffee I've ever had, but hey, coffee is coffee.

If you just want an old-fashioned cup of joe in the Lower East Side, look no further. At least on weekdays - sadly, it's closed on weekends."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2013-12-16,5.0,Carmine has been making these delicious and inexpensive sandwiches for decades. Come here and order anything and ask him about the comic books he used to buy here as a kid.
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2016-06-20,5.0,"My new go-to. Super affordable no-nonsense breakfast food  that tastes good, and the owner is so nice! They don't have a tip jar, but every time I go I feel like tipping because the dude deserves it for how cool he is."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2010-01-05,5.0,"I absolutely love this place. It's tiny but very homey.
The guy has had it for 34 (!) years, which is truly amazing. He can tell you stories about the neighbourhood if you wish. 
He only got some simple sandwiches and soda, except coffee of course, but everything he makes is delicious and cheap. 

The coffee is 1 dollar, and so is all soda cans. But the best part thoug: The Egg Cream. Dang that's good..

I love bringing a book and just sit in this tiny place for hours. Have a snack, watch all the people pass by, and just enjoy Lower East Side-living!

Go for it, I know you want to! :)"
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2015-01-24,5.0,"the previous reviewers are correct when they say this place has the best bagel with butter! I want to come back all the time! I miss it when it's closed on the weekends. the man who runs the shop is incredibly kind and personable. He has the ability to connect with people of all ages, even the little kids who come in after school. and it's a really special vibe in that place.. it's comforting to be in an ever changing city with at least some places of stability like this Classic Coffee Shop."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2013-07-16,5.0,"This place is a classic. I've been coming here since I was in elementary school and the owner still makes the the same things on the small menu. The place is very small, a few chairs but it's very homey. Everything is delicious, my favorite is the turkey and egg on toast and the homemade brownies. I think I ate the same thing for 6 years while I was gong to school, right across the street from this place. Stop by, if you're in the neighborhood."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2011-02-23,5.0,"This place is everything it claims to be. Which makes it truly great. 
In addition to what the other reviewers said, Carmine (the owner) plays the best music of any establishment in New York, in my opinion. 

Yes, everything is simple, cheap, and NO NONSENSE in the truest sense. But everything is done with care and class, which makes the difference between this and a bodega or diner. He makes a wonderful little tuna sandwich. The egg sandwiches are perfect. The coffee does the job."
60,classic-coffee-shop-new-york,2009-05-20,3.0,"My friends & I were looking for some spaces to rent for a business idea we got in mind, when we chanced upon this cute looking coffee shop. Inside you'd see memorabilia pieces including old pictures, mugs, collectibles of various kinds of bygone eras. it even has a picture showing how ""Hester"" street looked like during late 19th century in this part of the lower east side, that depicted buildings looking like the slums. it seems to me that it's  a one-man operation. i ordered for iced coffee which was OK.  i noticed the diversity of customers this shop had: latinos, asians, european-looking fellows...pretty interesting, hmmmm...."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2020-05-27,5.0,"Order their most popular flavors, honeycomb and earl grey. Honeycomb was perfection as it's a flavor you don't see everyday. Earl grey tasted fragrant if that's even possible, so while I didn't love it, I appreciated the new taste. I had friends messaging me about how much they love the earl grey though!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2020-06-01,4.0,Times are weird right now due to COVID-19 but Van Leeuwen makes it so easy during these times. The line outside wasn't too bad (probably 3 people when I got there) everyone was wearing a mask and there's one person inside taking one person at a time. This was easy and the ice cream is so creamy. My fav is the honeycomb flavor.
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2020-04-26,5.0,"Ordered two pints on Postmates and they came super quick. The mint chip was as good as ever, but even better was the new Vegan Passionfruit & ube coconut cookie, which might just be my favorite Van Leeuwen flavor ever. Definitely will be getting another pint soon, as we nearly finished it right away. So tart and the chewy cookies were incredible."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-11-21,4.0,"I really loved it. 

Shop - the shop really stands out amost the block. It's veeery very brightly painted in ""happy"" colors. Very cute interior. Very small inside. 

Service - the staff were great. Very helpful and friendly. They let us get samples before testing it out. 

I really loved that there were dairy free options. The caramel cookie was really delightful. Definitely something to write home out. The cookie bits were made of oats. I was very pleased. The only downfall with many dairy free flavors and shops is that almost everything had chocolate in it. So if you're allergic, like myself, there were only 2 options and one was sold out. Luckily, the one option was really good."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-07-31,5.0,"No question Van Leeuwen's is the hipster equivalent of Ben and Jerry's!
Van Leeuwen specializes in dozens of unique flavors both dairy and non-dairy. Prices can run a bit steep here, but scoops are massive. I would suggest ordering a small cup and grab your bestie and share-zies. Lots of eye candy in the area too. What's better than eye candy and ice cream??"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-07-25,5.0,"Wow wow wow! Came in every night while I was in New York and there was a quick moving line at all hours... Which means this place is amazing!!!

The icecream was so creamy dreamy and the flavors were marvelous. The mouth feel was divine and the scoops grand! My favorite flavors were: chocolate fudge brownie, mint chip, cookies n cream, salted caramel, honeycomb. 

They have vegan and gluten free options so all can indulge. If a flavor is sold out chances are there is a pint in the freezer that you can take home with you! 

Fun out of the box flavors were: Earl grey and blueberry pie

If you're in the area (or not in the area but want icecream) hop in a cab or stroll over for some mouthwatering deliciousness! 

And if there's a line (which there likely will be) wait! It's quick and worth it!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-11-11,5.0,"I absolutely loved the strawberry ice cream I had here. I can't wait to try their other locations. The ice cream was so creamy, so perfect. It had real bits of strawberries in it. They have vegan ice cream also that is made of cashews, coconut milk, organic extra virgin coconut oil, organic cane sugar, pure cocoa butter, so you can feel like you're being healthy. The service was perfect! Very friendly and welcoming!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2020-02-27,4.0,"I've gone to other locations in the past, and I'm a giant fan of their Earl Grey flavor, but alas, my body has (increasingly) become lactose intolerant and I'm fast learning that dairy and I are not friends. So I'm always grateful for vegan ice-cream options that are tasty. It was a toss up between the churros and fudge and the mocha latte - eventually I picked mocha, but wished it was less soupy (I think the freezer was malfunctioning). However, the flavor was spot-on and service great."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-03-28,3.0,"Interesting flavors but man this store is small! They offer vegan and gluten free options too. 
Came here with some friends for the first time,

They offer scoops in cones, bowls and even shakes. 

I got the earl grey shake, it was okay. Tasted like cereal. I don't think I'll be coming back, it felt a little pricey. Worth a try but not the best I've had. 

Recommendation: you're better off eating your ice cream outside. Even on a cold day, this place is packed. The line was out the door and this was 9:30pm on a 10'degree night."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-03-21,5.0,"It's very nearly impossible to have a bad experience at Van Leeuwen, so yup, another 5 stars for the go-to ice cream place!

I'm slowly making my way through every location and this one is definitely the tiniest so far. It was a THURSDAY NIGHT and COLD AND RAINY, yet the place was packed with about 18 people in the teeny shop. The fanbase is strong.

I tried the peanut butter marshmallow and it was deliciously peanut buttery, in a really pleasant way. Sometimes things can be too peanut buttery, but this one was just right. I didn't seem to get many marshmallows in my one scoop though. Darn.

My two Van Leeuwen virgin friends also loved the salted caramel. Wins all around, just a tiny location so take it to Washington Square Park."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-03-31,3.0,"We came here after having pizza nearby.  Truth be told, I've heard many great things about this ice-cream store.  Having had some really great ice-creams (one that starts with a J and one that starts with an S in particular), I was intrigued in trying this infamous New York city highlight.  As I don't have much of a sweet tooth, it takes a bit to get me to like ice-cream, especially if it's the non-Asian kind.  What I did manage to try was their seasonal Chai Tea (and Toffee?) ice-cream: pardon my forgetfulness, the name was so long I couldn't remember all of it.

PROS:
- large quantity, even for a small.  I definitely couldn't finish.  (But an ice-cream lover would kill it)
- good flavor, not overwhelming with any one flavor
- very creamy, no icy bits

CONS:
- no distinct chai flavor.  I was hoping for a little bit more chai or at least cardamom
- a bit too sweet

I have to admit, their ice-cream collaboration with 886 and the Taiwanese pineapple cake was pretty good and would have made this review hit 4 stars for sure.  I'll probably come back and try a few of their other flavors though.  Credit definitely goes to them for vegan ice-cream!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2020-03-13,5.0,The best VEGAN ice cream in the city! And the cherry on top? They have vegan whipped cream. Would love to see the business expand to new cities!!
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-10-06,5.0,"Whenever I come to a Van Leeuwen I always end up trying every vegan flavor (of which there are usually 7-8) and then I end up with vegan chocolate anyway. 

I love that they have such a diverse array of flavors (from basics to cookie infused situations that are somehow blue). So if you enjoy ice cream even in the least, you'll find something here."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-10-06,3.0,I particularly enjoyed the chocolate brownie ice cream flavor here. That being said it was a bit pricey for what you got and I didn't feel the quality was that much better compared to a Ben and Jerry tub. I also didn't really enjoy any of the other flavors outside of the chocolate brownie one.
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-06-24,5.0,"The perfect way to kickstart your day or a great dessert after a meal? Van Leeuwan Artisan Ice Cream! Once a buttery yellow ice cream truck roaming the streets of New York, Van Leeuwan has quickly established themselves as a mainstay in New York Ice Cream culture with their ever evolving seasonal flavors along with their classic staples. Each flavor is derived from the best of the best the world has to offer in regards to artisan producers and farmers. Their ice cream is made from scratch in Greenpoint, Brooklyn and distributed to their 20+ locations. Pictured is their ""Tiki Paradise"" (Mango , Pineapple  and Guava Coconut  Ice Cream) atop a scope of their ""Oat Milk and Cookies"" (Vegan Caramel Swirl with Gluten-Free Oatmeal Cookie Crumbles )."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-02-08,4.0,"I'm positive there has never been a more vegan-sounding flavor than ""Planet Earth."" I'm not vegan but wanted to give it a try. I think I'll stick with non-vegan ice cream but was impressed by the ice creamy texture of the ice cream and the unique flavor offerings.

What is it exactly? Van Leeuwen's vegan ice cream base + Spirulina (blue color) + Matcha green tea cake. The ice cream literally looks like the earth, all blue with patches of green from the matcha cake.

It tasted interesting... like Danimals yogurt. The vegan ice cream base had a very nutty cashew taste. There was an initial strange aftertaste but that went away after eating more ice cream. The matcha green tea cake was oddly earthy tasting. The matcha cake chunks were also too big and  should've been cut up into smaller, more manageable pieces.

I've heard fantastic things about Van Leeuwen's other flavors though so I'm banking on really loving the next non-vegan flavor I try!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2020-01-17,5.0,"Van LEEUWENS  i love it, i love their vegan options. Since my boyfriend and I are both ice cream lovers FINALLY 1 STOP to satisfy our ice cream needs"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2020-01-11,4.0,Had a scoop of the earl Grey and it was awesome -- really fragrant tea flavor. Our cones all had holes at the bottom and the ice cream dripped down as it melted but sticky fingers = still worth it for such delicious ice cream.
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-02-08,5.0,"My favorite ice cream joint. This place serves vegan ice cream and I won't have vegan ice cream anywhere else. They have specials every month or so, and they really know how to get creative with mixing flavors and chunks of cake/bites/cookies into the mix.
I love planet earth (the flavor).
I tried most the vegan flavors and I would vouch for every one.

Side note, skip the hot chocolate. It's not worth the price."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-12-17,5.0,"I love Van Leeuwen. They consistently have high quality ice cream and a wide variety of their ""classics"" as well as rotating seasonal flavors. Of their ""classics,"" I LOVE their Earl Grey and Honeycomb. For the fall they had an amazing lemon/shortbread/basil/honey flavor and for this winter they have a comforting hazelnut fudge flavor. Van Leeuwen has been my ""go to"" and preferred ice cream shop in the past few years. For an idea of my taste, my close second would be Morgenstern."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-12-17,4.0,"We had a hankering for something sweet after walking the High Line so we went a few blocks over to check out this ice cream joint.  Must have came at an off peak time because we didn't have to wait long to place our order.  Was about to order something standard and asked the server for a recommendation.  She said her favorite is a scoop of pistachio and a scoop of honeycomb, so that's what I ended up getting.  Was expecting the pistachio to come across like its pudding counterpart but it was very different and had more depth of flavor, and it paired very well with the honeycomb.  This place may become our go-to spot in New York for when that sweet tooth needs to be satisfied."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-06-21,5.0,This place is delicious and reminds me very much of an East Coast Molly Moon's (any of my Seattle/Portland friends out there?!). I've been twice now and very much enjoyed the PB marshmallow crunch. One time the line was out the door (no surprise there) and the other time we actually got a table. They have tons of vegan flavors along with rotating seasonal flavors which of course we love.
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-11-14,5.0,"Cute little ice cream shop! Van Leeuwen is a chain, but it felt like a neighborhood gem.

After dinner, I shared the hot chocolate float with vegan chocolate cookie dough ice cream and vegan coconut whipped cream on top. It's so yummy! The hot chocolate is really hot though, so your ice cream is basically soup in like 10 seconds, but it's still fun to sip!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-06-19,4.0,"Small shop which was still jammed packed late on a Monday night. Cant imagine the wait time on a weekend. The ice cream is quite tasty though - I can't lie. 

I went with the non-vegan ice cream, because I am not an idiot. The seasonal blueberry pie was quite good, a nice reminder of home in New England, but the standout was the salted caramel. This packed a punch of salty flavor, with a developed caramel back-note."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-12-11,5.0,"Ate here on a recent trip to New York and really enjoyed it! We came on a Saturday night and it was somewhat busy but not crowded by any means. It's a very small venue, so I can't imagine how it would handle a large summer crowd :) I was boring and got the strawberry ice cream, but it was actually some of the best strawberry ice cream I've had in a long time! Definitely exceeded my expectations. I can't imagine I'll be back in this area any time soon, but I 100% would recommend it to others for getting an ice cream fix!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-04-01,4.0,"How can you even resist when the store smells so goooooood!!! Line goes out the door along the opposite wall, but it moves pretty fast. They allow you to get samples of their ice creams, but a note to the staff - please make sure you verify that the one you give is what the customer requested just in case they have an allergy! We asked for the earl grey tea, but somehow got the salted caramel in a sample. I went with a friend who has a really severe peanut/tree nut allergy, so it would have been extremely bad if they had given her something with peanut butter or cashew in it! Anyway, the earl grey tea ice cream is to die for, definitely give it a shot if you swing by!!!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-04-07,4.0,"This was my favorite ice cream I tried in NYC--by a huge landslide! Things to love about Van Leeuwen (apart from its location in such a charming neighborhood) that differentiate it from other popular ice cream spots in Manhattan:

- Good flavors. In particular, I loved the honeycomb flavor, which is at once subtle (not too sweet) but also distinct and delicious. This was a unique flavor for me and left me wanting more! Still, I wish they'd let you split the small scoop--this would have been delightful with the earl grey I sampled.
- Solid texture. This ice cream could be creamier IMO, but compared to several other NYC ice cream spots, Van Leeuwen's has much of the creaminess you crave in a great, dairy-filled ice cream. :)
- No limit on samples! It's not to say that you should take advantage and try every flavor, but having the flexibility to try multiple flavors made it easier to decide what I wanted.

I'd definitely come back next time in NYC if I'm looking for dessert!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-04-27,4.0,"Got the pistachio and salted caramel and it was very creamy and delicious. When we arrived there was about a 20 minute line/wait. The place was small and understaffed (understandable since its a hot spot) for a Friday night, but the ice cream was great. I sampled the vegan flavors as well and they were delicious. The one I tried wasted with coconut milk (chocolate peanut butter swirl something) and it was very tasty."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-08-25,4.0,"Tight spot, but folks waiting in line know how to snake in and not ask for a million tastes. The line moves pretty fast.

VL always has such creative flavors, and that includes for both regular and vegan flavors. It's always so hard to choose. I tasted the Planet Earth, which was so original (see my pic), but I didn't love the texture. So I went with strawberry shortcake, which had a lot of chunks and jamminess. Really dug it.

Vegan scoops are 25¢ more per scoop.

Guy behind the counter seemed mildly exasperated, but he and his colleague kept the line going efficiently.

Cash free payment only - though, as my friend noted - they're happy to takes tips in cash."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-05-10,5.0,We found this gem close to the Friends apartment building.  Delicious options including vegan!
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-07-05,5.0,"As upon arrival, you can notice the beautiful design that goes in to this place. It really does taste as good as it looks.

   The menu is an ok size but it has many gluten free and vegan options. They also have sundaes and various topping. All their ice cream comes in pints, so if you want to take it home you surely can. I got the cookies and cream single scoop in a waffle cone. It was delicious. The ice cream had chucks of chocolate that really brought out the flavor in it. And the waffle cone was fresh of the press when I got it. And the cone had a hint of cinnamon which was the perfect touch of flavor.

  In all, this is a very nice, delicious ice cream shop in West Village. If you are in the area and craving some rich, flavorful ice cream, this is the place for you."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-12-23,5.0,The ice cream flavor that I ordered here was delicious! They have several choices and even Vegan options! I had a sample of one of the vegan flavors and it was pretty tasty. The service was also good and very quick! They have a few places to sit down but not a whole lot. So for the winter it could probably get crowded. It was a little crowded when we came but the workers allow you to sit on the window sill.
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-04-14,5.0,"Was craving some ice cream while I was walking around the the mall and decided to give this place a go. I got the honeycomb flavor, the ice cream itself taste amazing but just a bit to sweet for me. I like they offer samples of their ice cream and the staffs are really nice, especially when it's pretty busy. I waited in line for no longer than 10 minutes to order my ice cream. I sampled early grey tea and honey comb. I will definitely come back here again to try other flavors."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-07-11,4.0,"This ice cream was great. Yes, I waited in line for like 20 minutes at like midnight to get inside and get my ice cream, but I am glad I did. The flavors of ice cream here are unlike what you will find anywhere else.

I got the black sesame chocolate cake ice cream. Wow this flavor was so so so complex. It was some of the most unique and delicious ice cream I have had. It was so rich in flavor, I would not have been able to finish much more than my one scoop of ice cream. My friend got their royal wedding ice cream and loved it. It was very flavorful and was sweet.

I look forward to coming back here and trying some of their other unique flavors. The prices can be a little much, but it is worth the money to try some flavors you haven't before!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-06-27,5.0,"The best of the best when it comes to artisan ice cream. Van Leeuwen makes some of the best vegan   flavors I have ever tasted, using a rich, creamy cashew/coconut milk base. They currently offer 9 permanent vegan flavors, as well as several other seasonal options. In addition to best loved classics like chocolate chip cookie dough and vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, they offer inventive flavor combinations that you will not find elsewhere. This location in the West Village is small, with seating for only about 6 people.

I got one scoop each of Planet Earth and Dark Matter, both two relatively new vegan additions to Van Leeuwen's permanent menu. The Planet Earth was truly unique. The vibrant blue color of the base is created using spirulina, a sea vegetable that adds just a touch of earthiness to the otherwise sweet vanilla ice cream, with is studded with chunks of delicate green tea cake. The Dark Matter tasted identical to their vegan Honeycomb flavor, but is pitch black, colored with activated charcoal. If you love vanilla and caramel, this fun flavor is for you. I enjoy Van Leeuwen's products as often as possible, and highly recommend them to anyone."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2020-02-26,3.0,Had the London fog. It was made with too much whip cream that had no flavor but the earl grey ice cream tasted great.
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-07-29,3.0,"Finally off my bucket list! I've always thought of coming here to try their ice cream and finally fulfilled that today!

When I got here, shop looked pretty decent but kinda small and tight with many people inside. Not a lot of seats inside or outside.

I decided to sample the Earl Grey Tea flavor and it tasted amazing! Therefore, I decided to get that in a cup. The price totaled to be $5.99. The ice cream did kinda melted quickly since I was busy taking lots of pics lol. But while eating the ice cream, it got much sweeter for every spoonful."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-01-16,5.0,"I tried the earl grey ice cream on a sugar cone and loved it. Although, it was slightly too sweet for me, the early grey flavor was fragrant and delicious. The ice cream wasn't heavy and had a nice creamy consistency. It is a bit on the pricier side for ice cream but I would highly recommend trying at least once (one scoop was around $6). They have vegan options and unique flavors. 
For this location, the store is pretty small so there isn't much seating available."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2020-01-09,4.0,Delicious ice cream! A little expensive but worth it as ingredients are so tasty luxurious ice cream! They don't take cash only card!
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-06-14,3.0,"The store is pretty cute and small, but it's just your average ice cream.

There's nothing much out of the ordinary about the flavors, as you get your typical vanilla, coffee, and mint flavors. The only unique part was that they offered vegan flavors. 

They allow you to sample the ice cream, and it was through this that I noticed how ridiculously sweet every one of their flavors were. 

I eventually opted for the Planet Earth because it looked pretty with the blue and green colors. Plus it was vegan! 

A scoop in a regular sugar cone was around $6 which is slightly overpriced, but forgiven given the scoop and cone size.

The ice cream was for sure, creamy and smooth! However, I barely remember what the blue ice cream tasted like as the green cake part completely threw me off. The cake bits and ice cream did not go well together, due to the cake's weird crumbly texture and overly sweet taste. I sadly had to remove those huge chunks.

I may have picked the wrong ice cream flavor.
But, even still, unless I'm in the area, I would not go back as the ice cream was too sweet and just average for the price."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-06-17,5.0,How can I express my love for this ice cream than by giving it 5 stars. My go to flavor is the strawberry cookie jam (it's vegan and delicious). Honestly most of the flavours are delicious but I've somehow gotten stuck with that one. The ice cream is fresh and creamy... honestly I prefer vegan ice cream over regular.. it's much lighter on the stomach. Hubby loves it and he's not vegan.
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-05-09,5.0,"Oh my goodness! The smell of fresh baked waffle cones and cookies for their ice cream sammies that hits you the second you walk in the door is worth a visit here alone!! WOW!! 

This place is heavenly! The flavors are super creative and unique, and there were EIGHT vegan flavors the day of our visit! EIGHT! Not to mention dairy free and gluten free cookies too! Amazing!!

Choosing three flavors for our towering cone was difficult. We took the recommendation of the kind gals working the joint, and went with fan-favorite cookie crumble strawberry jam, chocolate chip cookie dough, and peanut butter cup chocolate chip in a waffle cone. Great choices! They were all super creamy and rich. They didn't have an overpowering coconut flavor like some vegan ice creams tend to have either. Absolutely delicious and decadent! YUM!

The girls behind the counter were super sweet with our order AND with replacing my cone after I had a photo fail, which they say is actually pretty common nowadays with everyone trying to grab those perfect Instagram-worthy shots. 

The place is now cash free, so bring those cards! I did love seeing all of the different beautiful currencies that line the walls from when they accepted cash! Incredible to see how many visitors they have had from all over the world! 

We came mid-day, mid-week and had the place to ourselves. We enjoyed our cone inside at their little bench overlooking the intersection. 

If for some reason you happen to be driving, parking was actually simple right on 10th. 

Cannot wait to return and see what flavors they offer next time! Adding this to our list of regular snack spots (Papaya Dog & Pomme Frites)  in the West Village!

I can imagine a cone from here after a visit to Washington Square Park nearby on a warm day is just perfection!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-07-07,5.0,"I'm always starry-eyed for Van Leeuwen. This is probably the only scoop shop where I'd ever feel justified spending nearly $7 on a cone of ice cream, given that it is mindblowingly amazing vegan ice cream (dairy is slightly cheaper). Plus, they pack the scoops in, so you know you get your money's worth.

Most recently I tried the Planet Earth vegan flavor, which is really pretty and tastes great. It's made with blue spirulina and matcha cake. I've been wanting to try the Vegan Dark Matter for a while but the times I go, it's always sold out. Gotta really plan for it next time! But I love knowing that regardless, the many non-dairy options are creative and delicious. 

Their West Village location is a small, cute storefront, where you can grab a seat if you're lucky (and if the line doesn't take over, which it usually does). Go to the East Village location for a bit extra space. Regardless, excellent selection of flavors is guaranteed."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-02-10,3.0,"Tasted:
Earl grey 
Black sesame

The ice cream was smooth and creamy. The flavors were tasty. Prices are on the higher end so I would rather go elsewhere to get similar quality but at a better price. I think this place is great if you are looking for vegan ice cream since they offer that. If you don't need vegan ice cream, I don't think its worth coming here."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-10-11,1.0,"If your not gay or white they don't give a shit about you. 
Literally second time seeing the cashier let his ""friends"" skip the line and order ahead while there's others waiting to get there orders. No respect. The nerve."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-01-27,5.0,"Got some delivery ice cream from here. Got a pint of honeycomb and the peanut butter marshmallow crunch.

The honeycomb was amazing. One of my favorite ice cream I've ever had. It was so creamy and smooth....reminded me salted caramel almost, but less savory. The other one, was just ok. Nothing too special there, but the other one was just soooo good."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-04-20,4.0,"In NYC walking my way to all the ice cream places I can get to this weekend! Good luck to me and my stomach!

So my first stop is Van Leeuwen where they offer vegan flavours and mostly gluten free ice cream. They pride themselves in ""local grass fed milk and cream, pure cane sugar and organic egg yokes while their vegan options are made with house-made raw cashew milk, organic coconut cream, raw organic coconut oil, pure cocoa butter and organic cane sugar"".

Today, they offer 15 flavours of classic flavours and 10 vegan flavours. After trying 5 flavours, I decided on lemon verbena, rhubarb jam, crumble (soooooooo good! It has a beautifully orchestrated mix of flavour and while you can taste each notes, together it's a winner) and black sesame ash chocolate cake (the chocolate works as a stabilizer to the nuttiness of the black sesame which could've overpowered the flavour, instead the taste is round and decadent).

TIP: they only take credit or debit, so it's a bit annoying, especially for someone who's traveling from another country"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-06-17,4.0,"Great ice cream, special flavors! Love the black sesame and earl grey flavor.
This location has a window ac dripping water at the entrance though...a bit nasty..."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-11-15,4.0,"Pretty decent scoop and for its price! Went with the girl after dinner on a Tuesday night since I promised to get her a sundae. Went at around 9pm and the store was nearly filled up - They don't have that many seats. They have about 3 small tables and the window porch can sit about ~9 people max I reckon. We opted for the sundae option where we get to choose two scoops of ice cream and three toppings. We got pumpkin cheesecake and honeycomb for our scoops, as for toppings we got the chocolate fudge, candied walnuts, and the chocolate nibs. Highlights were the scoops themselves - I liked the pumpkin cheesecake more so than the honeycomb for its taste, and the ice cream was made very smooth. Honeycomb was rather syrupy for me, but then again its personal tastes. Topping wise the chocolate fudge was a good addition as it broke up the dryness and the crunchiness of the candied walnuts and cacao nibs. Also complemented our ice cream scoops very well. I didn't really tasted out any of the cacao nibs in the scoop.

Overall a decent experience at Van Leeuwen. Lines could get quite long during the weekend as I've seen people line up outside of this spot. Our server was incredibly friendly and instead of charging us the full price of a sundae (~$10), he charged us the price of two single scoops at $8. THank you very much!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-08-31,5.0,"i love their ice cream!
i got strawberry and honeycomb flavor
i loves their honeycomb! it was sweet and salty at the same time. 
strawberry was good too but nothing special. 
when i went they were sold out of earl grey flavor ( it was only 1pm) so i was disappointed. 
i would def go back to try their other flavors"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-07-10,5.0,"Rich, creamy, flavorful, refreshing - everything amazing Ice cream should be. We stopped in the west village on our way home from Chelsea market and found the perfect spot to satisfy our sweet tooth. We initially wanted the blueberry flavor sadly it was sold out so we opted for the strawberry instead and it was still an excellent choice. There was a line out the door on a weekday night and for good reason ; definitely worth the wait - will surely be back for more!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-08-09,4.0,"Extremely delicious! I tried the honey comb, peanut butter chocolate chip and cookies & cream. My favorite was honey comb! Very creamy and not overly sweet. I wish it was a little less expensive!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-12-27,5.0,"Ice cream: so good!! There are regular options and vegan options. I tried the earl grey tea and honeycomb. The earl grey has a strong tea flavor and the honeycomb is sweet and caramel-y. 

Price: we got two single scoops for a total of $12. A little pricey but totally worth it. 

Service: friendly and helpful! 

Overall, I really enjoy their ice cream. They have many different flavors both traditional and unique. I would recommend it and come again"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2020-03-07,5.0,The ice cream was great. The manager was very friendly and formative. I recommend the Brooklyn Brown Sugar and the cookies and cream. Definitely come here.
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-02-04,5.0,"I dropped in for a late night ice cream snack and was pleasantly surprised. I shared a three scoop ice cream and it was very sizeable. 

I had pistacio, black sesame, and early gray, which all had very intense flavors. Each spoonful was as good as the last. Absolutely loved it and will love to be back for more."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-06-19,4.0,"My friend and I came to this location Friday after dinner and to our surprise there was only a short line! The space is super small so any line makes for a cramped space and only one person can be helped at a time. The staff were super friendly and let us try a bunch of flavors before we settled on two vegan flavors: Cookie Crumble and Strawberry Jam and Planet Earth (the coconut milk base with a spriulina swirl).  Our thoughts:

1. Cookie Crumble and Strawberry Jam: The strawberry is the key part of the ice cream here and the cookie doesn't really come through. It adds some texture, but the jam dominates the taste, but in a subtle way. 

2. Planet Earth: this was a fun looking flavor and nice and mild. Not too ""earthy"" at all. I would pick this one again as I generally don't like things that are too sweet.

The vegan ice cream base have the mouth feel of normal ice cream, but not quite as creamy. It breaks off in chunks a bit, but when you eat it you wouldn't even notice. Van Leeuwen always manages to impress me with their ice cream, but I never feel compelled to go unless I'm in the area."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-01-01,5.0,"Cookies and cream and a scoop of the chocolate. Yum yum yum...

Small batch ice cream amazingness..."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2018-11-14,5.0,"Came here on a Tuesday night with the boy after dinner as he promised to get me some dessert after our meal. We came here at around 8:30pm so the place was a bit empty then. 

We opted for the Make Your Own Sundae, which consists of two scoops of ice cream and three toppings. For those two scoops, we chose the Pumpkin Cheesecake and Honeycomb, as recommended by our awesome server. For the three toppings, we chose Hot Fudge, Candied Walnuts, and Cacao Nibs. I had quite high expectations for this as I've heard great things about Van Leeuwen, but damn this was wonderful! The Pumpkin Cheesecake literally tasted of Pumpkin Cheesecake and I loved how they put in bits of cheesecake in it, which gave the ice cream itself so much more variety in texture/mouthfeel as well as flavor. The Honeycomb was also awesome as they added a honeycomb syrup to the ice cream mix so the taste of honeycomb really came through! In addition, the stickiness of the syrup combined with the silkiness of the ice cream was sublime and just delicious. 

Toppings wise, I was also a fan of the ones I've gotten. I'd say my favorite was the Candied Walnuts as the sweetness of the sugar coating combined with the crunch of the walnuts was a great combination for me. Definitely enjoyed chowing down on those nuts haha.

I would definitely recommend Van Leeuwen and those two flavors if you're ever in the area and want some wonderful ice cream! You definitely won't regret it."
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2019-07-01,5.0,"Love this place! Small, simple but clean! And yeah, their ice cream was thick and very creamy!!! Love it!"
61,van-leeuwen-ice-cream-new-york-6,2017-12-04,5.0,"I come here for my ice cream fix.  The ice cream is nothing short of amazing.  I could go on and on, but the flavors are all very good and the portions are generous in my opinion.

I often go all out and get a sundae - hot fudge, whipped cream, the whole shmeer.  The ice cream here never disappoints.  
The service is great, too.  They are friendly and they are patient in letting you try flavors, even when it is packed, with a line out the door (most of the time in warmer months).    

The only only downsides are the aforementioned crowds and the relative lack of indoor seating."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2020-01-06,5.0,One of my favs. A little small but has great coffee and friendly customer service. Also dog friendly benches outside
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2020-02-19,2.0,"Well. Here we go. My first Yelp review.

I should preface this by saying I work in a restaurant and I am sympathetic to the grind (pun somewhat intended). It is hard out here! There are days I would rather stab myself in the eye with a Bic pen than talk to anybody. And maybe the concept of ""hospitality"" in the service industry is entirely fraught to begin with, and a disingenuous expectation to walk around with, especially from hourlies who aren't exactly printing money. 

But good lord. The disdain. It must get exhausting. The coffee is very good, but it is very good a lot of places, and I see no reason to keep subjecting myself to this."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2020-01-04,3.0,"My boyfriend lives above of this cafe and we used to come here pretty often. The coffee is delicious and strong, however, I get a bit anxious before I go there.  The staff is incredibly rude, I must have stopped by at least 15 times, and every time I leave there is this bad taste in my mouth. They barely look at you when you order, and once you do they act annoyed as if they're doing me a favor. They don't have basic manners, such as saying ""you're welcome"" after I say ""thank you."" One time I even asked what teas they have and the barista just said ""here."" and pointed at the options while rolling his eyes as if I asked him for a free ride to the airport.

To be honest, solely due to the staff, I go to Irving farm a block over now. Coffee isn't worth the unpleasant experience, especially in the morning."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2020-01-18,2.0,"Wow, so that was disappointing. An almond milk latte the size of my fist for $6 served by an incredibly unfriendly cashier and a barista who literally threw my cup at me, in an extremely cramped place, and coffee that was not anything above average at all. It was smooth, but nothing better than the standard level. Not planning to return."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-12-14,4.0,"Cute little coffee shop with a wickedly delicious mocha with oat milk. The perfect balance, not too acidic or basic. Has a hint of chocolate and not sweet at all.

This isn't really a place where you work from since the tables are so tiny and there aren't any outlets. It's perfect for catching up with a friend or just grabbing a quick to-go coffee!"
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2019-10-29,5.0,"Fantastic coffee! I thought I had a pretty good cappuccino earlier this morning, and then I broke my rule and had a second one at Third Rail. Originally, I rated my initial cappuccino an 8. Then, I had cappuccino at Third Rail, a 10+, and my initial cappuccino went to a 5. This is seriously delicious coffee, right by Washington Square. I have never before reviewed a coffee place, but this one required notice."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2019-10-25,4.0,Why sooooo expensive...$7 for a oat milk latte **sad face** anyways this place really serves great coffee!! Just a tad bit disappointed in the price but what can ya do..the latte was delicious!!
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2019-05-28,1.0,"Third Rail went off the rails for me. On a cold day, in a space so small that there are eight seats, maybe ten, and you're next to NYU, with students needing a hang, takeout is your biz. 

There were people standing out in the cold to get this brew, so I'm sure that it must be wonderful. 

Unfortunately, weary business traveler I,  I needed to find a place of shelter, to sip my morning clarity, and commune with the web gods for a spell. No room at the Inn, I had to go to Irving Farm around the corner, which was busy, but had a place to sit. 

I understand the cost of New York commercial space. I ran into a coffee place or two in London of this size. Either get a space where people can stay, or put down no tables, and be take out, with a line that can stay indoors in inclement weather. 

Or call yourself a coffee club, because it definitely rolls that way when there is not even room for a line to form without standing in the cold."

62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-04-07,5.0,"Let me premise this by saying I'm not a big coffee drinker. However I do appreciate a good cup of iced coffee. A friend of mine who appreciates fine coffee invited me here and I'm glad he did.

Third Rail is small, and the offerings are limited. Yet this works perfectly for Third Rail as they make exceptionally good iced brew coffee and some mighty delicious looking pastries. I enjoyed the bold, deep, rich flavors Third Rails Iced brew delivered. Genuine flavors of a fine roasted coffee, not simply a bean that has been burnt beyond recognition and called ""coffee"". 

The inside is small but we got a small table to enjoy our beverages. The ambiance is pleasant, a balance of people working/studying and those of us small groups of friends that just were enjoying a damn good cup of coffee. I traveled about and hour in both directions just to taste this coffee and it was well worth it. I highly recommend a visit. Or two, or more....... Enjoy!"

Not a lot of work space, but great to meet someone and chat briefly. I've been on an oat milk kick lately, so I recommend the cold brew with oat milk. I love coffee and you can bet that this is my new spot. I've also heard the blueberry (could potentially be acai?) lemonade/tea is great too. Thanks Third Rail!"
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-07-14,3.0,"I wanted to like this cafe as the location was perfect, the people were nice and everything, but the coffee, the beans, the cortado, was a meh! Definitely not the best espresso I have had. In fact, one of the really bad tasting ones.

Got a cappuccino that was very well made. However, I was disappointed that they didn't use Counter Culture beans for the espresso, even though they were on display front and center when I walked in. Apparently they use a different roaster for the espresso shots, and while it was ok, it definitely wasn't the best tasting flavour profile. 

Next time I will ask for the specific beans I want for my shot. 

Otherwise a well made cappuccino with great consistency and good non-dairy options."

Third Rail Coffee delivered an awesome red eye (a brew with an espresso added to it). Definitely a contender for one of the smoothest red eyes I've had to drink and I had no problem drinking it black. The place itself is small and a regular coffee will run you at least $3, but their smooth brewing methods and friendly service make it worth it!"
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2019-12-08,1.0,The customer service was awful. The two people working were rude. Barely acknowledge you when you walk in. The place has no WiFi either so don't plan on coming here if you want to get some work done on your laptop.

The espresso is also too strong. I'm a regular coffee drinker--an aficionado, some might say--but this was just excessive. I was jittery for three hours. Third Rail Coffee is very good coffee but you'd get just about the same quality for two bucks less a block away.

I had an iced latte and it was made to perfection. I also tried one of their almond croissants and it wasn't bad- I am not a huge almond croissant person and wanted to try something new and was pleased. They definitely have their regulars and you could see how the baristas knew individuals by name and k ew their orders as they came in.

It's not the best size for groups, but with such a close walk to Washington Square Park, I would recommend coming here and then taking your drinks to go for a walk in the park.

I also want to give a shout out to the barista working, when I visited - I think his name was Andrew. I was only sitting in the location for maybe 30 minutes, but I was constantly impressed at how welcoming and friendly he was, and also, inclusive. When a customer from Barbados came in, he started asking a bunch of questions and engaging in a dialogue with the man. And then when another customer came in, they started speaking Arabic to each other. It was a very unique multicultural kind of experience that I really valued."

He took extreme care in hand-brewing my individual naturally-roasted Burundi over a generous single-serve Chemex. I was quite frankly surprised by the amount of time and attention he took in brewing the cup, almost like a lab scientist. The resulting pour was so worth it. Very clean, perfectly extracted, not a hint of sour overextraction. The notes are still singing in my mouth now. World class."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2017-07-15,5.0,"One of NYC's smallest coffee shops with exceedingly beautifully lattes. Cozy yet modern atmosphere, very anti twee. Limited seating, maybe at most for 10 people, so depending on the time you come in you may or not get a table. I did not see any outlets, nor would I recommend trying to bring work here. Good to visit in the off times with a book, groups less than 3, or anything one to one. 

The baristas are knowledgeable and friendly. The prices are about average. They offer two different espresso blends, single origin coffee (some brewed within a chemex) and a range of espresso based drinks. I highly recommend their lattes- flawless appearance and taste, a particular, almost nutty flavor from the coffee itself. The cortado is also well done."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-09-11,4.0,"I considered myself a coffee snob, so I'm pretty snooty about my coffee. Got a cortado from Third Rail Coffee today, and I love it. Probably my cup was made by a light to medium roasted coffee beans because the note was aromatic. It tasted like honey and some berries blend. 


The temperature of the coffee, the coffee beans, the smoothness of the milk, together combined brought out a nice taste of my cortado. It indeed brightened my day.

The only flaw that I want to point out about this place is their staffs.They are not that friendly. I was a regular to this place a year ago, never really got a friendly vibe from their staffs. Now I'm back to the hood this year, a stoney face from their staffs again. I reckon it might be a hipster thing? Probably it looks more cool to not smiling too much?"
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2019-03-31,1.0,"Rip Off

They offer an 8oz Latte (no idea why) and a 12oz Latte; both have 2 shots so they just add extra milk and charge you extra for the 12. The 12 then tastes like pure frothed milk, so if you add another shot (1 shot per 4oz), they charge you even more, then if you want Almond milk, you guessed it, they charge you more (even though they give it for free on side for people who might get a Coldbrew). So for a normal tasting Latte, you will pay $8.50, plus they then throw the screen in your face were the only tip options are $1,2,3. So you are paying $9.50 -$11.50 FOR A LATTE. Absolutely criminal."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-05-23,5.0,"Easily among the best coffee I've tried anywhere - these guys really care about what they are doing. Consistently excellent espresso and cold brew. 

I haven't tried baked goods, etc. The location is very convenient, small but cozy."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-07-11,3.0,"Pretty disappointing coffee shop for me. Coffee was pricey and very average. I didn't get much fragrant coffee bean taste, which I usually expect for a $5 drink. Overall I'd recommend passing as there are much better options in the city."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-11-08,5.0,The BEST chai latte I've ever had.  It was sweet but not too sweet.  It tasted like Christmas in a cup and reminded me of arroz con leche.  It was so good that I would go to the village just for that.  The shop is cute but tiny but we were lucky to get seats by the window.  I will definitely be back soon and will recommend this place to people.
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2019-08-21,4.0,"This is my first stop in my coffee shop hop in NYC. It's a really lovely teeny tiny shop adorned with b&w photographs shot by a traveler. The coffee is good, the gingerbread cookies are scrumptious, and the times are on point for reading, studying, or chillin. A little bit pricey but it feels worth it.  Really great alternative milk selection."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2016-11-13,5.0,"I don't know what defines flawless, yet Third Rail is definitely close to whatever that definition is. As tiny as a hole in the wall, Third Rail serves counter culture espresso, one of those better local roasted beans in the city. Their cappuccino was creamy, foamy, less intense, yet carried a light nutty fragrance - I simply could not think of a better way to start my morning!

Great beans, chill vibes! I have been to their East Village location about a year ago, and this Greenwich village location is consistently good! Wish they could bring more locations into the city, as I'm clearly fall in love with it."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-02-21,4.0,"Small coffee shop with about 6 tables. Excellent espresso, had a delicious latte. Fyi - no decaf espresso"
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2017-02-07,4.0,"Small and dainty little shop in West Village. This is the kind of cafe you'd expect to stumble upon in Europe, seats 8 people tops. The baristas were speaking some coffee lingo I could not understand, so chatting with them was limited due to language barriers. The iced latte was delicious. Dinging one star because a $4 latte was not filled to the rim. Or maybe I'm too accustomed to Dunkin Donuts and there overabundant pours. Pretty good spot nonetheless."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-10-31,4.0,"I've only had their regular hot coffee, and I do like it which is why I've gone back a few times. The place is really cute and their pastries look great. However, my last experience there was not a great one and here's why: 
I was buying a hot cup of coffee and right as I'm paying I somehow tip over the cup and it spills all over me. Thankfully it did not touch my hand and only spilled on my leg, so while it was very hot, I did not get burned. 
The reaction of the baristas was not that of concern. I have worked in food related companies for around 4 years now, and if someone ever spilled coffee on themselves right in front of me, I would genuinely be more concerned for them than these baristas were about me. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they're not the most friendly people, but I was a little annoyed that I needed to ask for a napkin as I was drenched in coffee. I had a feeling they were annoyed with me and probably thought I was drunk/high, but I was actually just tired running on four hours of sleep :( 
They did the bare minimum to make sure I was okay and even gave me a tide pen to use for the coffee stains, and while that is all fine, I know most would agree that the feeling you get from a person and/or their service transcends the actual actions they do for you. 
In short, if a customer spills piping hot coffee on them, you should be genuinely concerned. 
Another thing, their lids do not fit the cups properly, so if you plan on walking around with your coffee, be prepared to have more coffee dripping on your hands onto the sidewalk. 
I give this four stars because I know one crappy experience should not speak for the place as a whole, however I wanted to share it nonetheless."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2017-03-31,4.0,"It is your average ""above average"" coffee shop in New York that has limited seating. Nothing to really write home about other than it having better coffee than the coffee bean close by. 

Strongly do not recommend you try to do any sort of work here."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2019-07-16,5.0,"The coffee is awesome, loved the food, I recommend the granola bar. Loved the ambiance of the place, and if you want different types of milk/creamer, they have it. I would recommend people to come here all the time."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2017-12-28,5.0,"Great mocha. The perfect amount of espresso and chocolate. If the spirit moves you, try a glazed donut which was delicious, though all the baked goods looked scrumptious. 

The customer area is quite small, so not a place to hangout with your laptop and your homework."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2017-12-13,5.0,"Best coffee shop for me in nyc. About 1-2 dozen times here, I have never had a bad cup no matter espresso or latte. It's small but right by Washington square so space is not a problem."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2017-01-25,4.0,"Its location by NYU is small, cozy, and hip. Of course, its coffee is excellent. The location in the East Village (159 Second Avenue (10th & Stuyvestant) New York, NY 10003) is more spacious and good but I had a better latte at the NYU location.

If you are visiting New York and looking for recommendations for coffee, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my personal lists of great coffee shops in the city, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-02-11,5.0,"This place has a great coffee, great pastries, great customer service and overall a perfect atmosphere. 
Worth mentioning that the place is pretty tight and focuses mainly on coffee."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-04-23,4.0,"Love this chill spot for its relaxing wooden interior with big sunny windows. They make great espresso and cold brew, and have delicious pastries. The baristas are always pretty nice, and I like that they have loyalty cards so I get a free drink every 10th. 

Only downside is that this place can get pretty crowded with people lacking in spacial awareness, and it has weird flow for waiting for your drink and using the coffee fixins table. I've had my drink bumped more than a few times. Despite this, I recommend coming on down to the electric Third Rail."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2019-05-28,5.0,"My favorite coffee shop near Washington square park for a quick espresso. Not a lot of seating, but the park is right nearby. I love the baked goods, especially the almond croissant. The staff are pretty friendly too!"
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-06-27,5.0,Good coffee and atmosphere. A good location for walking around as well. They have milk alternatives for vegans and lactose intolerant people.

Four Stars

This small coffee shop has two sets of benches, 6 mini tables, and some good coffee.  I ordered my usual Cappuccino ($3.75) to stay.  They use Stumptown Coffee. It had a strong nutty aroma.  The slightly bitter crema sticks to your lips. The ratio fell on the milk heavy side.  The vibe was pretty cool - playing the Iconic Space Jam Hit I believe I can fly by R. Kelly followed by songs from Missy Elliot and Beyoncé. You can also see into the bar across the street and watch some Sunday night football. The service was nice and seemed to know their product."
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2017-11-28,4.0,The workers were super nice and the almond milk latte was delicious. My new favorite drink. It is small in the cafe with limited seating and no bathroom which is a downside. Not too many pastries either.
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2016-02-08,3.0,"The cafe is kind of cramped and stuffy like most of the non-Starbucks coffee shops in the area, but they brew a strong cup of coffee! I didn't want to splurge on a latte since I'd already had my cup in the morning, so I went with just the drip. It did its job to keep me awake and functioning for another 3 hours!

Btw, they are no longer cash only - they got themselves Square, YAY!"
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-08-18,4.0,Stopped in for coffee and cookies after hanging out in the park and it was such a great end to the night. Definitely recommend.
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2019-03-25,5.0,Great coffee - small place but the coffee is great and the cappuccino is strong enough to be good
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2018-09-24,5.0,"Great! Hole-in-the-Wall!! Coffee!!!
Always love to stop here for one of the best coffees not only in New York City, but on the US East Coast!!"
62,third-rail-coffee-new-york,2017-10-16,4.0,"Good espresso!!
Close to Washington Square. 
They could offer different syrups other than simple syrup, but they have the beans."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2020-03-04,5.0,Small place with great taste. Oatmeal has great flavor. Save some room for a cookie. The oatmeal raisin is amazing!
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2020-03-01,4.0,"It's oatmeal. Served like they do with Poke, or Frozen Yogurt, or Ice Cream, or Pizza, or Ramen...  that is ...pick an oatmeal base, then choose toppings. 
The toppings are great and so is the oatmeal. 
But seriously, can this place survive? 
Check me in a year, maybe I'll have oatmeal on my face. If so, good for them and good for us."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-12-28,4.0,"In NYC for a quick getaway and the ""youngster"" suggested we try this place (he saw it on Shark Tank)!  Why not. I love a good oatmeal to fill up before tackling the walking needed in the City this time of year. 

Very cute little place just off Washington Square near  NYU Law. Staff greeted us quickly- asked if it was our first time visiting. Had helpful suggestions to start with a favorite bowl and showed us crowd favorites. I went savory while the other 2 stuck to more breakfast friendly suggestions. 

I like that you have 3 size choices depending on hunger level. Loved my cheese plate and honey choice, Crunchy hazelnuts included. Only suggestion is because the place is so small you end up eating almost over your lap and with how many toppings are included it gets a little messy when trying to mix it all in. (Might suggest a slightly larger container to hold it in - or offer up a plate or tray  if dining in.). 
Liked that there is water available if needed. Coffee was also great. Would definitely stop in again."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2020-01-25,4.0,"A friend of mine recommended this to me several weeks ago and I am so happy that I tried this! its a small place, not much seating, mostly a grab and go. I didn't know when I was gonna get a chance to come back so I decided to try both a sweet and savory kind. So I tried the Truffle rissOATo parm with bacon and a poached egg...YUMMY! I also tried a sweet one which was Indian spiced with ginger, cardamom and some other spices I can't remember. That one was just OK to me. In my opinion though, the oatmeal itself could have been more flavored because only the toppings made the oatmeal taste the way it did. It needed some butter and brown sugar, and the savory could have used some salt.
But I would def recommend this place to anyone wanting to be adventurous. Very easy to get to! I was pleased that this location was a decent proximity to my job. I will be back to try others!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2020-05-18,1.0,"Gross. So disappointed. Ordered 3 different baby bowls to share and only one was kinda edible. The salted caramel apple was ok and not too sweet. 
The Canadian was greasy and nasty. I'm most disappointed in the peaches & cream bc I was most excited about it. It was so watery and bland with canned peaches on top. So bummed since I loved peaches n cream oatmeal as a kid. Don't waste your money."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-09-15,3.0,"This small joint serves one thing only: OATMEAL !
Come if you're a fan of oatmeal. They have endless toppings to create your own concoction OR choose one of their many many preset options. 
They divide their menu into sweet and savory and have a few different size bowls. 

I purely came here to try something new, so I opted for the smallest option.
I like oatmeal, especially steel cut. But I've definitely had/made better. Not to say it wasn't good!
I got the Elvis, which comes with PB, banana, honey, bacon, sea salt. One of my favorite combos! 
I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's exactly as it sounds. It's always a great combo and you can't go wrong. 
Can I make it this at home? definitely. But if I'm craving it and in the area, sure why not?"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-05-17,4.0,"My buddies took me here for breakfast and I thought they were joking when they asked if I like oatmeal.  I do, but I didn't think there was a place just for oatmeal. Well, clearly I was wrong. Introduced to me was ""OatMeals.""

It's a cute little place offering, you guessed it, Oatmeal. They got sweet and savory kinds which all look pretty good.  I had the ""Carbonara."" It had oatmeal, bacon, shaved Parmesan cheese, a hard boiled egg on top, sea salt and olive oil.  Those ingredients sounded good to me so I went with that. 

The staff were super friendly. Not much more to say about that. 

As for the oatmeal it was actually really good.  I didn't know what to expect but I would get it again for sure.  One thing I would not do is the oil.  There was a lot of it so one, it made it kind of messy and two, it overpowered the other ingredients. It wasn't the end of the world but ehhhh maybe put a little  less on next time. If you love oil, you'll be happy. 

Overall the price wasn't too bad, I think I paid around $10 for it plus OJ.  I would recommend you all try this place if you are looking at it right now.  Send me a note and let me know what you thought!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-10-11,5.0,"LOVE this little place. I'm a huge fan of oatmeal, so that's a contributing factor. But everything is so fresh and delicious. I built my own bowl with dates, blueberries and almond butter. Next time I would love to try the Elvis bowl! Great find"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-06-16,4.0,"what a cute and fun concept! the world's first all-oatmeal cafe, tucked away in a cozy storefront close to NYU. I saw this first on the TV show Shark Tank, and considering oatmeal as one of my favorite foods, I made sure to stop here when in the city.

The cafe itself is tiny, but is adorably decorated with oatmeal-related decor and displays, and is a refreshing small individually-owned food option compared to all the overwhelming large restaurant giants around. The menu is actually quite extensive, showing all the different savory and sweet creations you can enjoy with oatmeal! You can get sizes ranging from Baby Bear (small) to Mama Bear (medium) and Papa Bear (large). I went for the Antioxidant Awakening which was topped with Greek yogurt, raspberries, dark chocolate, chia seeds, and honey. The combinations of all the flavors were so tasty and filling, and the chocolate melted just slightly on the hot oatmeal, making it even creamier. My friend got the pumpkin pie one, topped with graham crackers, brown sugar, and pecans. Like Thanksgiving for breakfast!

The prices weren't bad and they make your bowls right in front of you. You'll leave filling fulfilled and nourished. I want to come back and try one of their savory bowls!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-09-27,5.0,Love this place! The people were super nice in suggesting a perfect bowl. I got the harvest and my boyfriend got the hot date. Perfect simple meal on a fall day - and close to Washington Square park to have brunch in.
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-12-07,4.0,"For all the Oatmeal lovers and non oatmeal lovers this place is a must try. They have vegetarian and vegan options and it will fulfill your savory and sweet cravings. I got their Truffle Honey Cheese plate and it was so yummy.

63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-08-05,1.0,"Wtf was this service? 
I ordered a physique 57 bowl or whatever it's called and waited for 20 minutes. A lady came in after me and ordered and got her oatmeal right away. I didn't think much of it until a group of people came in and they all got their orders right on the spot. I was annoyed. Initially I thought that they were just working on to go orders, but when I went up to the counter and told them that I had been waiting for my order, they said ""what order?"" 

Uh, excuse me?? 

I then told her that I'd been waiting for 20 minutes and they looked confused... I told the worker who took my order that I was waiting for my bowl and she looked confused too. 

Basically, THEY FORGOT MY ORDER. 
How is that even possible??

Anyways, the bowl wasn't even that good. Literally, you can just make it at home. 
The only good thing about this place is the decor, and the free chocolate chip cookie I got, which was better than the oatmeal itself. Would not recommend coming here."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-08-17,5.0,"Came here for breakfast. Had a hot oatmeal with strawberry, cherries, pecans, raspberries and currents. It was delicious. 

I had the baby bear size and thought it was the perfect amount of food.

They have a wide variety of oatmeals that they recommend, but you can also customize your own with the crazy amount of toppings that they offer. The oatmeals come in 8,12,&16 oz sizes. I got ""The Hot Date"" oatmeal and it was delicious. 

I went with my girlfriend on a Wednesday morning and tons of people were coming in. Luckily the service was incredibly fast (it only took about 30 seconds for them to make my oatmeal), so it never got too crowded. 

In addition to oatmeal, the cafe offers Greek yogurt, pastry, and lots of drink options. It costed around 9.50$ for my oatmeal and water bottle

7.75/10"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-05-13,5.0,"A great place for breakfast and lunch! I've never seen oatmeal like this before. This place offers the best creations and combos like the Elvis (peanut butter, honey, and bacon) and the Quatre Fruits Rouges (strawberry, currants, cranberries, and raisins). The space is small, so it's not great for hanging out, but it's very easy to do take out and snack on it as you're walking. Other perk is that you can get your oatmeal made with either milk or water."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-05-16,5.0,"Oatmeals is great spot for a quick and healthy breakfast/lunch! I had the oatmeal carbonara which is a good savory option, and the Nutella oatmeal is good for people with more of a sweet tooth.

I got the oatmeal carbonara and I actually thought it was very good. It satisfied my pasta craving but it still felt light with the oatmeal. I say even if you're not that adventurous, this place is worth trying. Definitely try the savory oatmeal b/c you won't find it anywhere else."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-02-18,4.0,"I've had OatMeals bookmarked for over a year and I'm glad I finally made my way here! The menu has countless options to choose from and as I read through the specials each one sounded more delicious than the last. I decided to go with the banana cream special (with Nilla wafers) and my boyfriend went with Cinnamon Bun. They were both very good and filling (as oatmeal usually is). The girl at the counter was very sweet and attentive, we were lucky enough to snag a small table on a very cold day and enjoy our warm snack. The bill was very reasonable and totally worth every cent, I would gladly come here again and recommend it to anyone craving something sweet and filling."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2018-06-17,4.0,"What a fun concept! We had two of their signature bowls, and while it was hit and miss, there's no doubt I'd come here ever so often for brekkie if I lived nearby.

Physique 57: more of a classic hearty topping mix with nuts and honey. Tastes amazing

Oatmeal cinnamon scone: a good, if not great, scone with interesting cinnamon chips embedded. 

Thank you for having drinking water available!

Croque Monsieur with a poached egg sounded like a potentially winning concoction, but it was a little odd to me. I guess it had to do with the nutmeg, but the savoury oatmeal didn't work quite as well as physique 57."

I tried one of their oatmeals & I liked the consistency but I wasn't wowed by the flavor. It was good but nothing revolutionary. The drinks were fine, I had an ice coffee with almond milk. I also tried one of their cookies which were great, they tasted homemade! Overall, I wouldn't say you HAVE go out of your way to try it but if you're an oatmeal lover I think you would enjoy this place."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-07-02,4.0,"One of a kind restaurant. I think this is probably the only food spot in NYC that solely makes oatmeal. 

- A ton of toppings to choice from (various nuts, fruits, etc.) 
- Portion will definitely fill you (baby bear, mama bear & papa bear) I usually get the mama bear & still have some left over 
- Not too expensive ($5 - $7)

I usually come here on weekends mornings if I'm the mood for oatmeal before/after a run. Never had an issue with waiting on line. 

Overall I'd say check it out m. They have milk based & water based oatmeal for those who have a preference."

The food:

I usually like my oatmeal sweet with fruits and all the natural sugars available, However I went for savory this Saturday morning. Truffle RisOATto- truffle oil, simple seasonings, and I added bacon. Oh and PARMESAN, Grated. Mmmm. Let's just say I'm glad I didn't go hike after stopping at the Chinese bakery nearby. The truufle oil pooped out, the bacon was Quality and the oats?

Go to whole foods its good and affordable!"

5 stars!!!!!!!!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2018-11-13,5.0,"Okay, I must admit I was preeetty skeptical about the idea of an oatmeal restaurant. I mean, oats cost pennies to make at home and take like 2 minutes to cook, right? After trying OatMeals, though, I have to say they've won me over.

While it's true that oats would be cheaper to make at home, Oatmeals is still an affordable breakfast and they have an impressive array of toppings that few home chefs have to offer. They also have such a wide selection of creative oatmeal bowls! I had a hard time deciding between sweet or savory, but ultimately went with The Canadian--cheddar cheese, cinnamon apples, bacon bits, and maple syrup. I had never tried savory oatmeal before, but I'm glad I gave it a try. The cinnamon apples were truly decadent and the bacon added a nice salty twist. I ordered the Mama Bear size, and it was plenty; I didn't even finish the whole thing.

My friend chose the quatre fruits rouges and loved that as well, and my other friend went with the Elvis. All were delicious and no one was disappointed! The atmosphere in the restaurant is also nice and cozy and was the perfect setting for breakfast on a gloomy day. I also got a coffee and it was cheap and good. 

I hope to come back soon!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-04-24,5.0,"What an amazing concept! I love nothing more than healthy and quick options. I've had OatMeals once before via UberEats, but this was my first time at the location and I'll definitely be back. I had the ""physique"" baby bear and added strawberries. The oats are the perfect consistency and the toppings worked very well with each other. The staff was friendly and the space was cozy, I love the vintage oatmeal cans!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2020-03-30,5.0,This is the first time I've eaten oatmeal ever. It was so good and now I'm obsessed with oatmeal because of this place! It was so good! I got fruits in mine. My bf got breakfast oatmeal. I thought his was good too!
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2018-10-31,5.0,"I stumbled upon this place on my way to a lecture at NYU. I didn't eat bfast, but I also knew that this would be healthier than the likely bagels and coffee. 

I decided to splurge on an OatMeal. I had the one with the cherries; Quatre Fruits Rouges. It was pretty good. They have options for vegans too, which is great since I'm recently dairy-free! 

Their coffee is delicious as well. They need more seating! It would be awesome if they could rise up, literally... and add a 2nd floor or a loft space for additional seats for those who like to have some morning/post-noon eats! 

Place is clean, friendly, accommodating, cozy, and quaint. Definitely will be back next time I'm in the area and looking for something light and healthy.

Happy (tr)eats!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-06-10,4.0,"For exactly what it is, it's fantastic. Oatmeal is not my favorite breakfast food, but even so this place manages to create numerous combinations that are perfect for anyone."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2020-03-11,5.0,"Sam runs a great place. Oatmeal is creamy and hot, toppings are fresh and tasty, and she makes a mean oat milk latté. Even the music is great. I mean who doesn't love oatmeal and usher? Love this spot!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2018-10-12,4.0,"I stumbled upon this spot while waiting for a friend in the neighborhood. It's one of those small, cozy places that feel acceptable chat with a friend or nibble some oats by yourself. 

I guess I never imagined a menu made up entirely of oatmeal before, so I was just floored to see the variety of oatmeal bowls. I tried the Elvis (I think that's the name) with bananas, PB, etc. and it was taaaaasty. The coffee/tea selection was also solid. 

I'll be back."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-11-16,4.0,"Saying I love oats is an understatement, so oatmeals is a dream come true. I love all the options they have. Four stars, however, because I wish more/better seating was available. And the couple times I had an egg in my order the yolk was cooked completely through."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2018-07-30,4.0,"I expected OatMeals to be underwhelming. I pictured bland oats with a topping selection my grandma would be into.

But nah. OatMeals is legit. I think oats are a canvas for some really delicious concoctions. Even as a dessert of some sort. OatMeals has capitalized on this opportunity, and has done so pretty well!

I recommend going for one of the more adventurous options as opposed to your usual flavors. Otherwise you're wasting your time coming here for an ordinary bowl of porridge. Go for stuff like the S'mores, Cinnamon Bun, Salted Caramel Apple, etc. Feel free to try my delicious customization: the Cinnamon Bun with brown sugar substituted with mini marshmallows. It's like cinnamon S'mores. Thank me later.

Only downside is that the oatmeal base is plain. You could get a lot more creative by having a base with mix-ins from the start, and then adding toppings to that. Even flavored bases like vanilla or chocolate would make it more exciting.

With 80ish toppings and a bit of silly brainstorming, the possibilities are endless. They even offer some interesting savory oat creations, but I wasn't in the mood for that. Maybe next time. 

OatMeals is sort of like a froyo bar, except with an oatmeal base. But I find this hits the spot way more than froyo."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2017-07-28,4.0,"Tiny oatmeal bar in Greenwich, stopped there for a quick breakfast and because I am an oat aficionado! Lots of really interesting options and add-ons, but I had my heart set on the Elvis (my favorite flavor combo of all time). 

The sizes come in baby, mama, and papa, and I decided on the medium/mama. It was very filling, especially since they use steel cut oats which contains more dietary fiber than your regular thick cut rolled oats. They make the Elvis with a water base, and I had asked if they could add speculoos cookie butter but apparently they don't serve that anymore (time to update that menu guys). 

The peanut butter and crumbled bacon was mouthwatering - the sliced banana on top  made it the perfect bite. I would absolutely come back to try another variety of oatmeal, and I highly recommend you do too. Place is a bit cramped and offers free water while the servers there take your order, they were friendly enough. Limited seating so probably best to take it to go. 

If you love oatmeal, make this a must. If you're one of those people who think it's bland and devoid of life, make this place change your mind."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-10-02,5.0,"I got the cinnamon bun oatmeal. Oh man, SO good! I was very wary of a place that just serves oatmeal but this was truly awesome and kind of inspiring to make my own. Definitely will come back and try more! (Also, the servings are called mama or papa sized - so cute)"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2018-12-27,4.0,"My aunt lives down the street from OatMeals and we were excited to try it. It's definitely a different kind of place to say the least. Unfortunately it's a tad small but we were luckily able to snag some seats. Staff was friendly and explained the menu to us, like what was popular being that there were so many choices. 
There are still so many choices I want to try but I settled on Banana Cream Pie because I'm boring but the Nilla Crackers pulled me in. The bananas were nice and sweet, while my aunt had the Antioxidant with Greek Yogurt. I'm not a fan of Greek yogurt but she was very fond of it. 
I understand why people might be skeptical of going to an oatmeal restaurant because you can make oatmeal at home right? But this is completely different. There are so many kinds of OatMeals I want to try. I'm kind of glad that I just chose one, because had I kept looking at the menu, I wouldn't have been able to decide."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-08-16,5.0,"I was blown away with my first OatMeals experience. To be honest I was never a huge fan of oatmeal, but their ""The Hot Date"" signature bowl was absolutely incredible. It's so rare to find a place that is both delicious and healthy. This place is that PLUS it's extremely affordable. I will absolutely be going back on a regular basis. 10 out of 10 I would recommend."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2017-09-05,4.0,"It was empty around noon on a weekday. The place is small, intimate and had few seats. The lady at the counter was very nice in explaining their menu options. I ordered a small salted caramel apple as I prefer my oatmeal sweet. 

Verdict? It was good but nothing you can't easily make at home. The oatmeal was already made and they simply added the toppings. My cup had large slices of cinnamon apple (big plus!) I loved the mixture of sweet and salty. I wished they gave me more whipped cream. 

It's a very cute concept and it's great if you're on the go and need to grab quick breakfast. Otherwise save your money and make it yourself."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2018-05-16,4.0,"Once upon a time, there was a young lady named Anna and her two other friends who joined her on her weekly eating excursion. They went for a walk in Soho on a warm afternoon and found themselves craving something sweet. Pretty soon, they came upon an adorable cafe with ""OatMeals"" painted on a swinging sign. Anna knocked and, to the dismay of the other customers wondering why she was knocking and for the purpose of this nursery rhyme, she walked right in.

At the table in the front desk, there were three size bowls of porridge offered: Baby Bear, Mama Bear, Papa Bear. Anna was hungry, but not Papa Bear hungry. She ended up grabbing the Mama Bear bowl and kept it quite simple: steel cut oats with baked apple, banana, cinnamon, dates, and maple syrup on the side. One of her friends grabbed the Baby Bear and other the Papa Bear. 

Anna tasted her friend's oatmeal from the first bowl.

""This oatmeal is too sweet!"" she exclaimed.

So, she tasted the oatmeal from her other friend's bowl.

""This porridge is not sweet enough,"" she claimed, exasperated.

So, she tasted the last bowl of oatmeal - her own.

""Ahhh, this oatmeal is just right,"" she said happily and she ate it all up.

All in all, great place to grab a quick breakfast, but nothing marvelous that you can't make at home yourself or pick up from Le Pain Quotidien for about the same price (albeit with less toppings)."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2018-04-21,5.0,"I literally come here everyday these days. I hope they have a coupon or something for the people who come here a lot!! I especially love their Hot date and peanut butter granola bar. 
Healthy& yummy :) 
Highly recommended!!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-05-30,4.0,"an oatmeal bar in New York? definitely a place I would love to try so off I went on one Saturday morning. the place was small and there wasn't too many seatings but it wasn't packed when i walked in as it was still quite early so I manage to get a seat near the window (it got pretty packed by the time I was about to leave). i ordered the bacon pumpkin oats in papa bear size with additional cinnamon roasted apple. the pumpkin had really strong spices but after I stir the whole thing, it tasted better. i really love the fact that they use steel-cut oats (i usually just have rolled oats) because apparently the texture make a huge difference. it's more satisfying and filling. plus i always thought it's so hard for me to feel full from oats but apparently papa bear size really did a good job on filling me up. would love to come back and try another varieties. for the price: it's decent and service was good. they are very welcome and helpful :)"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2017-04-20,4.0,"Excited to finally have tried this place out! I'm an NYU student and this is a common off-campus breakfast / study location. I came in on a weekday morning around 10. The place was buzzing but not crowded, and the employees were friendly and warm. 

I ordered the smallest size of the Quatre Fruits Rouges (water-based) and it was ready within a few minutes. The oatmeal itself was well done - I love steel cut oats - but it wasn't as warm as to my liking. The fruits were fresh and the sweetener really helped balance the whole bowl, though I do question how healthy this place really is after all the add-ons. At a little over $5 for the smallest size, it's reasonable but not necessarily worth it, especially since it's something that is so easily replicated at home. I do hope to come back in the future to try out some of the more unique flavors (peanut butter and bacon, I hear)."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2017-12-03,4.0,"Who knew fancy oatmeal could be so good?!

As a fellow NYU student, I have countlessly passed Oatmeals but never went in.  I just never thought a shop that sold mostly oatmeal would be that good... I'm so glad I decided to give it a try!

I decided to order the Quatre Fruits Rouges, which the lady recommended.  Originally she suggested the truffle one, but I was a little wary of trying a savory during my first time there.  I played it safe and went with fruity.  The quatre fruits rouges came with lots of fresh fruit, and I loved the honey/vanilla drizzle on top!  So refreshing, and lots of great berry flavors.  I definitely have to come back for the truffle one or to try a customized one (many regular customers were doing this, I noticed).

The inside is really cute, and although tiny, they have a sunny window for you to sit down.  I ended up grabbing my oatmeal and sat at the window counter to both read and people-watch.  This place is slightly more on the pricier side, in my opinion, but they have some really unique options and flavors!  Definitely coming back sometime to try them."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2018-03-16,5.0,"LOVE this place. I love oatmeal so I just searched yelp for an oatmeal place and came based on the reviews. It's a cute little oatmeal cafe that lets you customize or you can choose from the signature selections. They also have a lot of savory options too. The two ladies working there were so nice and helpful. I got the banana cream pie bowl (mama bear) with some half and half. I also got an iced apricot tea. So yummy! My roommate got a bowl with strawberries, raspberries, and Greek yogurt. The names for bowl sizes are really cute too: baby bear, mama bear, and papa bear. 
There's a cute but small seating area and even has a few bar stools by the window. This place is great and my roommate and I are planning on coming here weekly.

I also couldn't leave without trying one of their baked goods. I got the iced oatmeal cookie. Sooo good. Crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. Not too sweet."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-06-06,3.0,"The staff is super friendly! They took the time to explain everything to me and give recommendations. There's limited seating at this place, but I noticed most people take their oatmeal to go. Got the Canadian, but didn't like it. Maybe it was just a weird combination for oatmeal? I think I'll just stick to the simple stuff with fruit. They give you a variety of options and you can order from their signature bowls or make your own."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2017-08-27,3.0,"I came to OatMeals to get breakfast with my vegan sister who was visiting the city. You can order the oatmeal either cooked with water or with milk, which I think is a really smart move to help accommodate people with different food allergies/preferences. 

We went around 11:00 on a Sunday and it was a little crowded, though we were quickly able to grab a seat. I ordered the Peaches n Cream, and was disappointed to get my oatmeal and see just 3 greenish slices of canned peaches on top. It wasn't bad, it just didn't meet my expectations (I was imagining a pile of delicious fresh peaches on top of my oats!). 

My sister had the Hot Date and really enjoyed hers. I think if you like dried fruit/granola/nuts/nut butters/etc. you will really like the toppings selections. Wouldn't recommend if you are hoping for fresh ingredients!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-04-19,5.0,Great little spot for oatmeal. This restaurant is very small with a few tables inside. I got a simple oatmeal with fresh berries on top and it was delicious. I would love to go back and try some more of the extravagant toppings next time.
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2017-11-04,4.0,"This place is good, a super fun way to dress up your oatmeal and be creative. They have all the options.  Savory or sweet there is something for everyone.  We did notice our oatmeal was a little watery. It definitely tastes better with more toppings added, so load up.  I definitely had higher expectations for the oatmeal and consistency, but good none the less and a cute little place to try.

I got the s'mores which was pretty good."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-11-07,5.0,"Delicious!   Great selections of oatmeal dishes. We tried the Nutella oatmeal with bananas, blueberries, almonds and whipped cream. It was beautiful and delicious. Very friendly staff as well."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2017-09-28,4.0,"It's sort of a salad bar for oatmeal, which seems like rather a small niche market, but what the hey.

It took all but a minute to whip up my oatmeal which had goat cheese, honey, olive oil, and nuts. It sounds like a weird combo but I'm frankly shocked I haven't thought to put goat cheese in my oatmeal before.

Props from ingenuity 

Tucked away by NYU, it has a small seating area if you want to sit down and eat in peace and quiet. But there's only room for a few people, this venue is very small."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-01-09,5.0,"I liked the place, liked the concept, was surprised by how many options there were and it really opened up my own path for oatmeal in my home. The portions seemed small but I was more than satisfied by the time I finished a bowl. The place only seems chain-like in their actual doling out of the ingredients and set-up behind the counter but there are lots of touches in there to make it feel cozy, welcoming, and real."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2017-08-02,4.0,"Love this place since oatmeal is my go-to breakfast. Plenty of healthy options to choose for as toppings. Beware: each topping cost money though! 
For vegans: they do have oatmeal made with water instead of dairy milk. 
Seating is very limited- as in all ny establishments."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-03-10,4.0,Very good. Enjoy the hot oatmeal on a cold date. Great variety in toppings. Only real downside is small dining room.
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-04-20,5.0,Great little spot! Perfect for a quick meal on the go! Who would have thought bacon banana and peanut butter would go so well with oatmeal!   Next time I'm in NYC I will be making my way to this spot.
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2019-10-15,4.0,"The oatmeal was good. It was cooked well and I enjoyed it. However, the bowls were not big enough to evenly mix your toppings throughout your oatmeal. I had to use the lid of another bowl, which was demeaning to my oatmeal. When I asked the lady for a larger bowl she said no. Its okay though, because the lid was big enough that my oatmeal didn't fall out. Prices were reasonable, toppings were fantastic. Atmosphere was a 10/10. Also they are fast at making your oatmeal! Stop by sometime:)"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2017-06-08,5.0,"I wanted to try every flavor! But my husband pulled me back to reality that there was no way I could eat that much. So now what? Well, I wish I had tried the pesto, sun dried tomato, Parmesan but I ordered too fast and chose the Shaved Parmesan and added bacon, how can that not be good?! Delicious. Then on to my second pick, Pumpkin Pie. It's a cloudy, slightly rainy day in New York and it has me in the mood for Fall so Pumpkin Pie seemed appropriate. Two for two! Delicious.

I know everyone might say this but truly I had this idea. Good for her for running with her dream and opening a place like this. Yes, I love oatmeal and yes, I loved Oatmeals!"
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2018-07-21,4.0,"I love oatmeal in any form - plain oatmeal, oatmeal energy bites, oatmeal cookies, oatmeal bars, you name it. I usually eat a super quick breakfast before leaving for work, but one morning I decided to get ready really fast and walk over to OatMeals before beginning my commute. The space is decorated very thoughtfully and gives off a homey vibe. The service here was fast and friendly. I got the baby bear size of the antioxidant awakening combo off their menu. Some other customers chose their own toppings too instead of picking a signature bowl from the menu. I really enjoyed having the greek yogurt with the oatmeal because it added some extra protein to help keep me full until lunch. My oatmeal was a great balanced breakfast, but I don't see myself coming here that often because my wallet can't handle the expensive breakfast costs in addition to my eating out habit for all other meals. Anyway, the oatmeal combo was a delightful morning treat and I'm intrigued by the savory oatmeal bowls they offer..."
63,oatmeals-new-york-3,2017-05-24,4.0,"I got the peanut butter and banana oatmeal - a combo I never thought of but have replicated on my own a number of times since. 

It was good. It isn't anything to scream about but if you need breakfast (or lunch or dinner or snack) and want to try some oatmeal with fun toppings I'd recommend you stop in."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2020-01-17,5.0,"Great coffee - had an oatmilk latte and it was creamy and delicious with beautiful latte art to top it all off. For all my fellow oatly fans, they use oatly barista ed, the good stuff.

I absolutely love the cafe space. There's PLENTY of seating (15-20 seats; combo of 5-6 two seater tables and one big table for like 10 people) which I've found to be quite rare for Tribeca cafes, so it's a great place to meetup with friends or just to get some work done. 

Speaking of getting work done, THEIR WIFI IS SO FAST. I was so productive in the 1.5 hours that I was there that it more than justified the $6 coffee I paid for. The big table doesn't have outlets which sucks so come with a fully charge laptop.

I probably won't be stopping by for a daily coffee here because there are other shops where I can get the same quality latte for about $5 (ok I know it's only $1 but IT ADDS UP!!) but you can find me working here very, very often."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-12-18,4.0,"Gosh, I used to come here ages ago and glad to see this place is still around and hasn't succumbed to the crazy Manhattan turnover rate.

The drinks are pretty good, lattes, hot chocolate, teas. They offer food options, which is nice. And it's spacious, plenty of room to meet up with someone, hang for a bit and get some work done remotely.

It's not the best coffee I've had, but I like the space and am glad it has endured."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-12-05,2.0,"My large latte tasted like a cup of hot milk. $6 I will
Never see again. Pretty sure they left out the coffee. 
Didn't give a one star as I enjoy the Kaffe 1668 further up. Shame about this experience"
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2020-05-28,5.0,Great coffee and they have plastic straws!!! Also the sheep are SO cute. Will definitely be coming back!!!
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-04-30,2.0,"I came to Kaffe because of its decent reviews and to get a picture of their cool cups! 

When I arrived, it was super dim and it seem like a bunch of people who liked working or chatting in the dark. I asked the barista for recommendation on something strong, but different. I got back a pretty rude ""You can choose what you want."" 

I went with the Ethiopian Coffee which was recommended by a nicer barista. The coffee was super strong, but for the price and service, I rather go to the 100s of better coffee shops than Kaffe."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-07-12,4.0,"I used to go to the Kaffe 1668 in midtown once in a while and always loved how big it was. The FiDi location is smaller but still has plenty of seating at a communal table, and a few smaller tables. The thing is, downtown coffee shops don't have the come-and-stay-while-sipping-coffee vibe...since everyone is heading to work and busy. This is one of the few non-Starbucks locations in the area where you can actually sit if it isn't slammed.

Friendly service, nice decor, and bougie coffee drinks. It's what you'd expect."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-10-25,4.0,"Definitely one of my favorite coffee spots in the city. Their decaf doesn't taste like watered down mud, which as a coffee lover with a caffeine intolerance, I very much appreciate! They also have a variety of meals and pastries to snack on, and they cater to a lot of different diets. 

I really like how there are two sections: one for people trying to get work done, and one for people who are just there to hang. There's nothing worse than having two friends gossip right in your ear while trying to read some critical theory, but thankfully I'm able to concentrate pretty well here.

The one thing I don't like about this place is the lighting. It's pretty dim. Sometimes I walk out with an eye strain headache. 

For my friends with tinnitus/hyperacusis/audio processing disorders: this place is on the louder side, normally around 75 dB. I think there's just a lot of room sounds and machine whirring going on. They never play music super loud though; but, if you go on the weekends, you may encounter some screaming children. 

The coffee shop itself is pretty accessible as their are no stairs to enter it and they often leave their door open. However, you do have to use stairs to use the bathroom. 

But yeah. I come here on a weekly basis so I love it. I would definitely check it out."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-04-28,4.0,"The latte I got was smooth and delicious.  Awesome area of town.  Nice layout, with a large communal table at the entrance and a section in the back with smaller tables, separated by a short wall w/benches on either side of the wall.  Warm, dim lighting and a comfy ambiance for chilling out.  

The gentleman who took my order was pleasant, but I could barely hear him talk.  Same volume with the other customers.  Wondering if they speak with a soft voice on purpose, or if he's just a quiet guy."

64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2018-03-22,5.0,"Sheep on! 

Kaffe 1668 South is the family love creation by Swedish twins Mikael and Tomas Tjarnberg. They've been in NYC over five years when they opened their first Kaffe 1688 on Greenwich Street. Now with three NYC locations, they are serving up some terrific coffee. 

What's great here is the variety of single-origin pour overs. There are many different coffee choices ranging from Ethiopia to Honduras. The espresso offering is a bold roast, Kaffe 1668 South is a true coffee lovers destination.

All of these Swedish places have some insane baked goods! If I had more time, I would have loved to have one of their many egg breakfasts or panini lunches. I grabbed a big chocolate chip cookie with sea salt with my latte. The coffee after the first sip is bold, perfecto! 

If you're in the area, have a seat and enjoy the coffee along with a few fuzzy sheep."

The server was kind enough to substitute to-stay cup for a to-go cup when I requested one. My brewed coffee with oat milk was tasty, just the right amount of strong without being too acidic. Kaffe 1668 is little pricey, but it is worth it for the chill, homey atmosphere and tasty food and coffee."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2018-12-15,3.0,"I came here because it is nearby WTC and seems like a really cute cafe. I got the chicken guacamole mango wrap, which was so bland. My taste buds were bored. The wrap was overpriced, but at least the atmosphere was chill and there was wifi."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-11-23,1.0,"This cafe has decent coffee, pricey, but decent. I have stopped going because they charge $1.25 extra for alternative milk in a cup of joe. This is an unseemly way to rip-off customers.

One cafe nearby either does not charge extra, Laughing Man, and their coffee is quite good. In addition they are really a source of financing for charities."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-04-21,5.0,Cozy Cozy Cozy!! This place feels welcoming as soon as you walk in. The aesthetic is beautiful and the coffee tastes great as well! I came in with my textbooks and did some work and mostly everyone else did the same. Its​ prices are average and they have big tables for room to study! They have a bathroom also!

In addition to coffees and teas, Kaffe 1668 has a good selection of baked goods and toasts (beyond just avocado toast), sandwiches, and salads, including some items to grab and go for those in a rush.

I've tried a number of things, such as the breakfast burrito, avocado toast, and beet tahini hummus with avocado toast; everything's been good.  I wish the toasts were a little bit thicker for thick cut toast, but overall quite good."

64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2017-11-27,4.0,"The Kaffe brand offers some delicious coffee, lunches, snacks and treats. This location is no exception. I like a lot of things about this cafe. Obviously their drinks are snacks are good, that's what keeps me coming back. They sometimes sell day old cookies at a discount. But a TriBeCa discount so they're still like $2 each. The seating is nice and he atmosphere is pleasant.

You can come here with a friend or alone without feeling lonely. The restroom is downstairs, so be aware of that if you have limited mobility. Perfect location near Whole Foods and Target if you're running errands and need a break."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2018-07-28,3.0,"When I went, literally everyone where was working on their laptops aside from one guy who was reading. The lighting is really dim. There's a long communal table near the door and a couple small tables in the back. There is only a bathroom in the basement, so I'm not sure what the other reviews were talking about when they say two floors.

The iced green tea was flavorless, and the iced chocolate drink was basically chocolate milk. It was a good place to take a break, and the interior design is pretty nice. The service was also fast and friendly, so one star for each of those. Prices were what I expected for New York.

If I needed to do some work and happened to be in the area, I'd consider coming back, but overall this place was very underwhelming."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-10-04,2.0,$5 for an iced coffee?  I'd rather support local businesses but at these prices I'm better off at Starbucks.  Why do you then need to make your own coffee?  For the price I would think you would be given a nice balanced drink. Instead put in your own sugar and milk and try not to spill all over yourself while mixing.  Thumbs down.
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2017-07-31,2.0,"The staff was friendly but very awkward. 

I ordered a small chili soup to go and had asked for sour cream on the side. Simple enough right? The teaspoon of sour cream came in the soup ugh. No spoon came with it either. They obviously had bad communication or the chef just doesn't care. I paid about $7 for 12oz and it came barely full. It was also luke warm but when I had the sample, it was piping hot. That's confusing. On top of that I waited 30 mins for it. I guess I shouldn't be ordering soup from a coffee shop. I won't be returning."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2017-06-17,3.0,"I don't usually hang out in Tribeca, so I'm not familiar with the local coffee scene. I was looking for a place on Greenwich Street with only one requirement: wifi, and this was one of the establishments that I had bookmarked a while back that fit the criteria. Unlike it's sister location a bit further up on Greenwich Street, this particular location has free wifi (open network). Also, if it's important to you (those of you who are looking for a place to hunker down and do some work), there is a large clean bathroom available for customers downstairs as well!

Although I liked the decor and the rustic feel of the cafe, I found it a little too dim of a place to start my morning - honestly, all I wanted to do was cuddle with one of the stuffed sheep, toss a sheep throw over me, and take a nap in the corner, instead of waking up like I should with my morning coffee. I started out at the back of the cafe at a small table, but found it way to dark to do work, so I moved up front to the bench next to the window sans table. However, I do appreciate that there are a variety of seating options - both at the communal table up front and smaller tables in the back. 

I ordered a latte, and it was photogenic, but even with whole milk, it tasted watered down to me. I was hoping that a couple shots of espresso would wake me up more than it did!

I like this place, and would definitely meet up with friends or do work here if I was in the area, but I would not go out of my way to visit!"
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-01-28,5.0,"Great coffee shop. Came here with group of 3 on a Sunday looking for a place to hang and get some work done. One of the few places that has lots of room and there's no pressure to leave if you want to do work. Coffee is also great, got cold brew and cappuccino which were both solid, prices on par with neighborhood. Would come back"

Easily one of the better coffee shops in Tribeca, this smaller version is more of an express operation. Smaller menu, a smaller selection of of pastries, not as much seating, but the same great coffee and customer service. I'm not in this area much, but if I were, it'd likely be a regular haunt. 

Unlike the original location, I wouldn't call this the friendliest place to pop open a laptop and get some work done. Far more cramped, so if you're looking for wifi, you may want to stick to the tried and true."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-07-02,4.0,"Really love this coffee- the espresso is delicious and super strong. I like the dim lighting. Some might say it's dark but the natural light helps me focus when I come to read or study. I would've given 5 stars if they didn't charge for oat/almond milk. Paying extra when I just want a splash for my espresso feels silly and honestly, dated. Otherwise, I'm a huge fan."

64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2018-01-21,4.0,Nice space with a large table to share. Comfortable to chat or work. Ordered a tea and their Greek yogurt ($10). They also have a bunch of vegan options in their fridge and some other bakery sweets.
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2017-08-25,3.0,"Cute tiny cafe located in lower manhattan! But i'll explain the 3 stars

Atmosphere: suuuuper adorable! It is sheep themed (odd but cute) so there are fluffy wooden sheep around the whole cafe. They have a large picnic table style table and then a couple of small two seater ones for more private seating. I loved the decor! Seems like it would be a cozy place to sip on some hot cocoa in, in the winter time. 
ALSO-- bonus points for free wifi!! But MINUS points because not outlets anyyyyywhere :( 

Service: Just your average coffee shop, great and fast! My coffee was ready in under 5 minutes but my avocado toast took a lot longer. I was dining in so it didnt matter but I can see it being an issue if you're on the go and want something quick. I did appreciate that it was brought to my table though! 

Food/Drink: The latte was decent, not too sweet and not too strong. I like that they offer different kinds of milk - almond milk is what I got. The toast wasnt anything special but it was filing and freshly made (also pretty to look at). 

Price: This is the major reason for the 3/5 stars. WAYY too overpriced. The latte was okay and so was the toast, but not really worth the $16 I paid. I guess they're making you pay for location! 

Will I be back? super cute place and love the reliable WIFI but not really a place to study or get work done with no outlets around."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-05-16,4.0,Cute space with plenty of seating options. The menu had a large selection of 'healthy' dishes. Cappuccino was delicious!!! Cashiers/baristas not so friendly-could benefit from a customer service pep talk.
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2016-09-07,4.0,"I liked this place. The interior was a bit bohemian like and enjoyed the atmosphere - especially early in the morning when there was crisp air flowing inside. 

I got the columbian coffee that they offered. Although it took a bit of time to receive my order, it was delicious. The temperature wasnt scolding hot, nor was it room temperature. I would have preferred it to be a bit warmer, but it was still delicious. 

The location is quiet and a bit of a walk from landmarks, but it is a good place to visit. It does have limited seating so be prepared when going during peak times."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2018-07-12,2.0,"Service is a bit slow and staff are not very friendly. I would expect more from a place with fairly expensive menu items. 

Just this morning, I went to get an avocado toast. It was so loud, neither the barista or I could hear each other, and she barely smiled. The guy who delivered my avocado toast looked like he wanted to strangle someone, and this is at 9am. Seems a bit early to be so intense."

I have been going here for almost four years but it has never been my go-to coffee spot since there is a Joe's in Westfield and The Laughing Man coffee a few blocks up in Tribeca. 

The customer service has gotten much worse than before, particularly this one tall Caucasian girl who always looks annoyed at the customers. I will try to get her name on the next trip and update this review."

The environment is busy a tad noisy with the full store on a hot day (almost 90 degrees f outside) wifi was a simple question to a dude behind the counter.

Nice coffee shop."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2018-07-30,5.0,Kaffe 1668 is one of the few cafes around here that is spacious and has amazing coffee. I'd definitely recommend it for a coffee break if your office is nearby or a relaxing spot to get stuff done on your laptop.

Great food and coffee, although on the more expensive side. There was lots to choose from for food: not only pastries but also eggs, açaí bowls, breakfast sandwiches, etc. The wait was a bit on the longer side but still shorter than a regular restaurant."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-02-10,2.0,Love the place and love the vibe. Food is a little pricey but what I want to kvetch about is the coffee - the taste. Something odd. Sort of over roasted or oak barrel like. Couldn't finish my drop. Just not to my liking and am afraid will move on to someplace else where the coffee brew is not as overly distinctive.
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2019-03-23,5.0,"Really amazing cafe. Good atmosphere, great food, nice service. The latte is very good and creamy. Plenty of seating for a small cafe. They are polite and listen to you carefully when your order. 8$ breakfast + 1$ for tip is not bad for an upscale cafe"
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2015-12-06,5.0,"I love Kaffe 1668! There are sheep EVERYWHERE. The espresso drinks are great, and they sell coffee beans as well. Try the latte - soy and almond milk are both available. Wish it was a bit less expensive, but prices are in line with any coffee shop in NY.

It's comfy and airy, and there's a lot of seating upstairs and downstairs, with a super clean bathroom, as well as free wifi and outlets. They close LATE, past 8pm most nights.

The aesthetic is everything you look for in a coffee shop, and it may be far if you're not in TriBeCa, but DO NOT underestimate the 1/2/3 train because you'll jump right down to Chambers St from 14th/6av."

They have so many great beans to suit whatever your mood and their cappuccinos are so good...perfect for a long sit with a good book...or index cards.
If you don't know much about coffee just ask someone behind the counter for a recommendation-I wouldn't say staff here is friendly but they know their stuff and are always willing to talk coffee or tea!
I used to come here all the time in the summer, pick up an iced tea (they always have a great selection in the warmer months) and walk over to battery park to enjoy the water.
Also, sandwiches and baked goods here are also really good-I've never been disappointed."
64,kaffe-1668-south-new-york,2018-04-05,1.0,"Not a good experience.  Ordered a large coffee and an egg and cheese sandwich.  I paid $10.58 for this breakfast.  The egg and cheese took 15 MINUTES to make.  Ridiculous!!  The sandwich itself was soggy, bread was tough, skimpy egg (barely filled half the sandwich), and  lacking in flavor.  Won't be coming here again for breakfast when there are so many better more affordable options in the area."

The setup and layout of this coffeehouse does is not ergonomically work which the queuing is at the entrance where the line spews out the door blocking customers from exiting/entering the method of egress.  The line definitely spews out the door during peak times for coffeeholics which does not work during the brutal winter cold months is an issue.  The menu is affixed on clipboards which can be only be viewed when you are next in line at the counter without sufficient time to decide your order thereby holding the line and create a backlog of impatient customers waiting.  There is no food or pastry menu as you stand at the register scanning at their pastry selection hastily making a decision.  I hastily decision on one chocolate croissant $2.99.  The refrigerator containing yogurt, cold sandwiches, cold drinks is by the door which draws more traffic at a non-ergonomically workspace.  Price appears reasonable.

Upon reviewing the Yelp business listing menu Kaffe 1668's selection of teas attracted me for a visit which I desired one cup of hot Jasmine tea.  However, disappointedly it was not an option.  I inquired what selection of green teas were available the server paused hesitated to respond no Jasmine tea, no China green tea, no Matcha green tea, and no Gyokuro green tea.  I opt for regular green tea $3.22 which was served excessively piping hot as it was the water was freshly removed from the boiling tea pot.  My sales receipt stated ""black: Anastasia $3.22"" when I actually order one green tea.  My tea was mediocre that I was unable to intake.  There is only one cup size unlike most competitors who offer:  small, medium or large.  How about the Starbucks ""tall"" size?  Kaffe 1668 have a loyalty punch card to obtain ten stamps."

I've read reviews here that the service was really friendly, but that's not what I experienced. I couldn't decide what I wanted and was taking my time looking over the menu and also checking back to make sure no one was behind me. The cashier was rolling her eyes and sighed cause I was taking too long so I quickly ordered a latte. 
Picked up my order and was able to find a seat by the window. Just wanted to enjoy my latte for a little bit and finish up my wedding planning, but it got a bit too loud so I left. 

At least the coffee was decent."

Now to the food. I got an iced latte and matcha biscotti. The iced latte was good but not the best I have had. However, from the taste I can tell the quality of ingredient is good. The biscotti sounded tasty but was just okay.  Overall I'll like to come back again and try their brews (that's how you can tell the coffee is good) and maybe some other baked goods. 

Not a cheap place - my medium drink and biscotti was exactly $8 in total. But people working around the are probably won't give another thought spending the money."

I thought to myself, ""uhhhh, anything that are not my hands to eat my breakfast."" The eggs and bacon were very plain with no flavor. I would pass on this place."

As for the food, I got the beet hummus avocado on toast with iced matcha which ran me about $16- kind of expensive but when you take the surrounding area into consideration it makes sense. In my opinion, the food itself is worth it. The colors of the sandwich were incredibly vibrant and tasted almost as good as it looked. Also, I've never been a matcha guy, having bought it because it seemed familiar but I actually enjoyed it. My acquaintance and I were able to talk for around an hour and I left feeling satisfied. As for the other reviews mentioning rude staff, I completely disagree. They were very welcoming and helpful. I'd definitely recommend checking this place out!"

Update



I arrived in from the blistering cold and cutting wind. I was going to order my usual cappuccino but there espresso machine broke before my eyes. Several guests ahead of me didn't get their order. So I had a coffee. Apparently they have different origins. I had no idea what to order so I got an individually brewed Guatemalan. The preparation was interesting and similar to french press.  They press the coffee in a cylinder of hot water. (Not my expertise so you should just order and watch for yourself). I tried a mixed Berry Muffin. The top was sugary and lovely. The berries were okay. Overall it was pretty delicious. We sat at the ground level communal table and I had a great 2 hour catch up session with my UCSD college friend Elise. The Kaffe played Goodwill Hunting and Hook on their projector screen. 

Sheep!"

Ordered an Iced Matcha Latte, the cashier looked at me funny and told me they didn't have it. (I've ordered it here before. They do.) Asked her if they didn't have green tea anymore and she goes, ""OH, we have green tea.""

Figured she would still give me my Iced Green Tea Latte but instead she makes an Iced Green Tea.

Line was too long for me to complain and I was already late for work so that Iced Green Tea went in the garbage along with the $4 I spent trying to get some caffeine in me."

I haven't have a really good one in a while since my favorite places have been shut down to make way for bigger buildings going up in the area.
Although Kung Fu is a small place sometimes the lines can get ridiculously long on a given day and the wait can be annoying. Because there is one person at the cashier and one person who makes the drinks so on a busy day you must pack lots of patience.  
But for a tea as good as this I must day it is worth the wait as long as the weather permits it. Because I do not like standing in the cold on a long line waiting to order a bubble tea. This is no fun. 
But if you're ever in the neighborhood do go ahead and try them out you will not regret this. Whenever I'm in the area I head over there to get one for me and my friend because she loves bubble teas just as much as I do."

I like the lychee and passionfruit flavors and taro is always a classic. I would like to try their matcha sometime as well. I usually dont get boba because they're so filling.

They did however mess up my friends order - gave her lychee punch instead of lychee black tea. For being the only people in there it seems hard to mess up an order."

  Kiwi apple Kale Slush!!! - 10 of 10!!! So refreshing for this weather ! And ofc with bubbles!!! 

  Caribbean Brezee - 3 of 5! Taste good, not amazing ! If you like citrus this one is for you !

   Strawberry lemonade is always a good choice!

    No bathrooms!!!

You Nepal, me KATHMANDU

You 80s radio, me CUTTING CREW
You a doctor's office, me the FLU
You the Synagogue, me the JEW
You the toilet, me the POO

Wait, what
Anyway

Those boys will have to join the QUEUE
And wait until I'm done with YOU
You'll bounce like a KANGAROO
Cause we're lovers, not fighters like FOO

And when we're done (in a day or TWO)
After I've made your kitty MEW
And after I've finally WITHDREW
Then it's time to go to Kung FU!

WHAT

If you come in here drunk, they might re-Fu to serve you. That would be your loss.

This is a really nice Kung Fu Tea in Chinatown which I like a lot. The employees are really nice and it was incredibly busy. Part of the reason why it was so busy is that it was the Festival of San Gennaro - but then again there's always something going on in Manhattan so this might just be a really busy location.

There really isn't anywhere to sit and sometimes the wait times are long and the staff can get flustered - but they are really nice and so are the customers. The product tastes excellent, especially my beloved lemon black tea.

I hope they are still making it even though corporate has cut it from the menu of all KFT locations because corporate has pleasing-Fox-E issues.

At this location, they also sell a bunch of cool little trinkets as you can see in the pictures.

All in all this is an excellent location and I will be back again. Five stars all the way."

Initially I was unsure what I wanted but I decided upon the hot taro milk green tea. When the cashier asked me what topping I wanted I was unsure as well, but my friend suggested the jelly. I gave it some thought, but decided to get bubbles instead.

When we received our drinks I opened my cup to see if they had put my desired topping because I felt that my friend's suggestion may have threw off the employee. Turns out it did and the employee put jelly instead of bubbles...

I told the cashier that he gave me the wrong topping and I wanted bubbles, not jelly. He was rude about it and told me to pay 50 cents to add bubbles to my drink. I told him that I didn't want jelly at all, and he asserted that I said I ordered it as the topping. 

When I finally clarified with him that my drink was suppose to have bubbles, he replaced my drink for me.

I understand that I should've clarified with the employee after placing my order but he was unnecessarily rude.

So how'd it taste?

The drink was meh.
It was not warm enough.
The drink tasted too milky and was too sweet for my liking.

Overall I feel like this was a crappy visit and the taste of my drink did not help. I get that after a long day of work, you don't want to put up with complaints, but there's no need to be rude. Sorry that I'm complaining, but I just want to vent a little and share my experience

Takeaways:

-10 dollar card minimum

-be prepared before ordering 

-write reviews to share you experiences
(Helps you remember to be polite)

p.s. For some reason a large chunk of my review didn't save and I lost it all. Feels bad. But basically I'm not trying to be mean, just wanted to share my experience and vent a little."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-08-30,1.0,"Ordered a Taro milk tea and it straight up tasted like sour milk. Something didn't taste right. We walked back in and asked if we can order something else to replace it. 

They said no and that we had to purchase something else. 

So Kung Fu tea lost a bunch of loyal customers forever. And I'll turn friends away from giving Kung Fu tea any kind of business again.  

All because they wouldn't exchange our drink that tasted like spoiled milk."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-08-08,2.0,"It was really humid and hot and I was really thirsty. The line at Boba Guys was really long. Starbucks was out of most drinks. So I ended up here to get a iced tea to quench my thirst before jumping on the train. I got a winter melon tea and skipped any toppings because I wasn't in the mood for anything too sweet. However, the winter melon tea was SOOO sweet & cloying...it was like drinking straight sugar syrup. No drink should be this sweet even at full sugar level. I couldn't drink it and ended up waiting til I got home to dilute it with water.

My drink isn't the only reason I wasn't a fan of this location. It's really small. The music was too loud where the soft spoken guy taking my order couldn't hear me and I couldn't hear him. I ordered a large and he entered a medium. Their Level Up payment scanner didn't work so I couldn't pay with the app. 

Just a culmination of things that did not make a great experience."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-01-13,3.0,"This is your typical bubble tea place in Chinatown. Nothing too spectacular. Kung fu tea is a chain store and their other location is on Chrystie st. I don't frequent this location often because there are just too many of these bubble tea shops around. Pretty convenient because NQR train station right across the st if your a subway taker.

Came here today after church and got us some bubble tea. Wife got the strawberry lemon green tea with grass jelly. I'm pretty basic so I got their milk tea. Not trying to get fat so we asked for less sugar. Also make sure to ask for less ice because you get more tea. They use these machines that actually shake your tea without shaking it with their hands or fill up your cup with tea and ice like other places do. Pretty cool in my opinion.

Brought it home to drink and my milk tea tasted pretty basic. I guess that's what I get for getting a basic drink. Wife said her strawberry lemon green tea was a lil sour and sweet. She prob won't order that again. Not sure when the next time we be back here."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-06-04,2.0,"I usually go here twice a month for the past 12 months of the year and this was the worst experience yet..

I ordered LARGE TARO milk tea with bubbles and oreo cookie topping.

The crew is fair in terms of courtesy but the TEA I GOT was severely lacking in this occasion,
a huge amount was missing, enough to make this review ...

I frequent the 32nd street location ""EVERYDAY"" and I ordered the tea.. and I can show a pic by pic comparison .. of the lack of difference.. 
6 $ for tea, can I have the 6 dollars worth ?"
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-06-15,5.0,"We love this place. It is very small so most likely there will be a line.  We are never disappointed when we order something here.  Our favorites so far are, lychee punch with naja jelly and the passionfruit slush with naja jelly.

The lychee punch is very refreshing, great on a hot day. The passionfruit slush is cold, sweet and full of flavor. We've been to a few locations and feel that this one makes the best slushies."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-05-07,1.0,"Giving 1 star for the RUDE customer service I received here and for the lack of flexibility they have here for their customers. I had a reward on my Kung fu tea app that I asked for guidance in using and they snapped at me, making me feel like an idiot not knowing how to redeem my reward. On top of that, my friend is lactose intolerant and among their extensive menu, they couldn't offer lactose free option unless you order the strawberry drink. I found that ridiculous. They shouldn't advertise their ""WOW lactose free milk"" in 10 different products and then say ""sorry, you could only get that in our strawberry drink"". Who wants a strawberry drink???

Boycott. 

Heck, I'll give 0 stars if I could."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2020-03-19,4.0,Been wanting to have bubble tea so ordered a red bean milk tea which wasn't sweet and had good amount of red bean. Service was quick.
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2018-09-07,3.0,"As a substitute for a real lunch, my boyfriend and I decided to come here for some boba to fill up our stomach! We noticed this particular Kung Fu Tea only really has room for walking in/out of the store. There aren't any tables there, and it could comfortably fit 7 customers all standing in single file. I ended up ordering the Oreo Wow Milk Tea, which interestingly enough has Lactaid in it! Service was pretty quick - I ended up getting my drink in about 5-10 mins. 

I started drinking it and it was pretty good! It definitely tasted a lot like a less thick Oreo milkshake. However once I was about a third of the way done with the drink, it became too diluted, despite my quick slurping of the milk tea and boba. My experience at KFT has always been getting drinks that are too icy, and once again, KFT has fulfilled this expectation. The boba was pretty chewy and sweet, so I will commend KFT for that. 

Overall, it was a pretty icy and average drink. However, most KFT drinks for me have been subpar, but this one was pretty good compared to other KFT drinks! I ended up drinking about 80% of it before calling it quits. I'm not one to recommend KFT, but if so, then at least have KFT in New York or even the one on Canal Street."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-10-30,1.0,"I order 2 drinks mango slush with mango jelly & grapefruit yogurt with mango jelly! So I asked if I can get 2 bags at first so my son can carry his own she said something to her coworker in mandarin. Like girl it's a damn plastic bag few cent! 

So I looked over the other girl made the mango slush with black bubbles and she was trying the open the lid and pour the mango slush into another cup like girl make a new one it's only ice and syrupy. I told her to make me a new one or I want a refund. And she kept saying it's not mine. I wasn't born yesterday Honey!"
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2018-10-08,4.0,"Even summer is over but someday in fall is still hot, walking around the town makes it hotter so it is nice to have a cold drink!

I had passion fruit green tea and it was so refreshing:) i have more energy to walk all day."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2018-11-18,5.0,"We spent our day in China town and o our wya in saw this Kung Fu Tea. It was early so bubble tea sounded like a great option. I ordered the tia iced tea with bubbles and it was spot on. Sweet with gooey delicious tapioca balls! We also got a winter melon milk tea that was out of this world, the tapioca was pooping and the flavors really stood out, a tad sugary so if you are not into overly sweet things that one might now be for you. This place is a chain but has the ability to be one for a reason because of the quality of the product. Also to mention the guys working the counter were helpful and super nice, very thankful that we were there and answered all questions we had about each drink. Would definitely hit the place up again or visit another location under the same brand."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-04-29,3.0,So I love Kung fu tea honestly. But this locations Kung fu tea disappoint me a lot. Literally the best I'll say that actually taste good is the oolong milk tea which can't go wrong. I order a peach green tea with lychee jelly and literally feels like they just dump half the cup with sugar. It was so sweet that I have to pour my own water to balance it out. Even with their taro milk tea too! It was hella sweet. I wouldn't recommend to order from here unless you want the regular drinks which I tried wjntermelon tea was good too. But they didn't have any milk tea caps ‍. There was also some new drinks through Instagram on Kung fu tea has shown and they didn't know either
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2017-07-18,4.0,"I'm so glad I got to get my boba fix in NY. We stumbled upon this place while we were in Chinatown and I was extremely happy we did. It was hot & humid and Kung Fu Tea quenched our thirst! 

The set-up of the place is pretty small with a narrow hallway. It wasn't that crowded when we got there so the logistics of the place wasn't too much of an issue. There are a host of options to choose from and I was delighted to see a bunch of tea options available (opposed to your typical milk teas). I got an order of the wintermelon tea and it was really refreshing! I enjoyed every single sip after venturing back out to the NY humidity!"
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-03-24,4.0,"This was my first experience with bubble tea (boba tea). I had the Kung Fu Tea with bubbles, no ice so it didn't get watered down, and extra sugar. Even without ice, it was cold enough for me. This is a tiny location right on the edge of Chinatown. Very good."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-04-04,3.0,"The cashier said they don't sell milk caps even when it is clearly on their menu. They should have put a sign that says it's out or not available. The cashier was drinking her own milk tea in front of me before taking my order. 


Aside from that, taro milk tea's good. Very tasty and sweet."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2018-04-18,5.0,"King fu Tea is one of my favorite places to get my bubble tea fix in NYC! 

I go to Chinatown for 1 thing usually, Food. Yup, to eat and at times to take home to then eat. It's a lively, fun, crowded adventure every single time that I can not get enough of! It's literally the only place I can find my kids their summer favorite fruit-Rambutan. However, before my adventure starts Kung Fu Tea is ALWAYS my first stop. I promise, this is my ritual.  

I'm a huge fan of their Taro milk tea and occassionally their Taro slushies. They have a wonderful passion fruit slushy that is so damned good, that it never makes it a quarter of the way home. A great honey green tea as well.  My kids favor the Oreo milk tea. Not a surprise there.  

My favorite mix in is definitely the nata jelly. Honestly,  I have no idea what it is but it's really good to me. The bubbles are a fan favorite but they can be quite tough at times. I love that you can decide on how much sugar to add in. My suggestion is to always say less ice because no one wants a $5 cup of ice with a 1/4 cup of flavor. 

They have quite a few flavor options. Surely you'll be able to find something you like. Milk tea, Green tea, Non lactose milk, Slushies etc. This is an easy win when in search of a cool refreshing drink on any given day. I love Kung Fu Tea their quality and taste can not be beat!"
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-09-15,4.0,I remember being in NY Chinatown with extremely hot weather. My cousins and I saw this place and decided to try it. Kung Fu Tea seems to be a good option if you're feeling thirsty or just craving a drink in Chinatown. Pretty good and seems like a reliable place for anybody that is new in the area. The place was really small and so I wouldn't recommend bringing a whole family in there when ordering.
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-08-11,1.0,I like Kung fu tea but I hate this location. Bad service. There's a minimum of $10 to use your card and the level machine that allows you to pay with the app NEVER works. They want cash. Loud music. Talkative and distracted workers. Not flexible or willing to satisfy customer. Asked for mango black tea and they said they only have mango green tea...obviously it's because they already have that type of drink prepared in the dispenser and will just fill that up in you cup with ice but if you have the mango syrup and black tea you can make it... so what's the problem???! Had to buy 2 large drinks to meet the minimum to use my card. Stupid.
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-03-08,4.0,"I go on 3/7 canal street kunfu tea with my friends. We are probably at 6 PM. At that time a lot of people. But the staff was very friendly to us. When lining up to us. But I haven't decided what to drink yet. I asked the staff. She is very friendly and very patient to ask what kind of taste i like and recommend what kind of milk tea. (I asked  the name of the staff, her name is vicki, she is very pretty and patient, She recommended oolong milk tea to me. The price was very affordable and delicious .She was also polite when she gave me milk tea. She always smiled at us.

The only drawback is that the milk tea is too sweet. I'll order less sugar next time I go."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2017-03-05,5.0,"If you've got problems with Kung Fu Tea, it's probably you and not the bubble tea. Seriously, who had problems with bubble tea?

Anyway, I came on a weekend and got a mango slush. It cost me $4.36 and I have to say that it hit the spot. No issues whatsoever. Highly recommend the drink -- I usually get mango, passionfruit or taro slushes. Always a good decision."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-08-18,1.0,"I've been to this location for many years and always liked the workers here but recently I've experienced terrible customer service. When I asked questions about the flavorings, they rolled their eyes. Very rude. When asked for a bag for my drinks they were confused to what I was asking for."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-08-13,1.0,"I ordered a mango snow drink which is suppose to come with mango jelly. When I asked them, they told me its not available now like it was a promotional thing. So I didnt get my mango jelly. They have bad customer service and everyone in there seemed like newbies. Also the QR scanner have been broken for months now. Every time they told me they ordered it and theyre waiting for it to come. Very disappointed."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-06-29,1.0,Shitty service. Bad product. Ordered 30% sweet taro milk tea but still tasted like syrup. I asked for them to remake it but they were too cheap to do it properly.
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-04-02,1.0,Worst location ever. Waited in line and people after me were getting their drinks first. I only ordered one drink but while waiting observed the workers talking and joking around while not being clean-they were touching their faces and surfaces and money before touching ingredients.
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-01-24,2.0,"I got the taro milk tea with bubbles and it really wasn't good. The taro was not strong enough in the tea and even though I got regular ice, it wasn't cold enough. I'd suggest not to get the taro milk tea. 
However, the taro slush with Oreo is pretty good. Definitely better than the taro milk tea."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-06-26,2.0,"Terrible, the level machine has not been working for a few years. I think they purposely stopped using it so people pay cash. They also ran out of napkins when i went."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2018-09-14,2.0,I love Kung Fu Tea but not this location. Minimum purchase of $10 for credit/debit cards. Absurd! I ordered a mango slush and tap. I got tapioca and aloe jelly. I didn't ask for aloe jelly. Slightly enjoyed it anyway.
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-07-05,4.0,"To me personally, Kung Fu Tea is the standard for boba places. It's pretty good and always a reliable place for anybody if they are in a new area. This one was pretty good and the service was quick. Kung Fu Tea is always a good option if you don't know where to go"
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2017-09-15,1.0,"Minimum $10 purchase if you want to use your credit card.

Drinks are WAY TOO sweet to the point where I most likely developed diabeetus after finishing.

The store is also very small and cramped, there is definitely more space behind the register than in front."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-03-03,1.0,"I never write reviews but I had to share what a horrible experience I had. I come here all the time and the guy workers are usually nice. 

I visited today in the evening around 5-6ish on Sunday 03/03/19. The ASIAN GIRL working at the register (short hair near shoulder length, circle metal glasses, and about 5 feet tall) had the most disgusting attitude for no reason. I come here all the time and people are always friendly. I've never seen her before either so she must be new...

I walked in the store and she literally just stared at me with the most disgusting face. I wasn't sure if she was even ready to take my order because she was literally grilling at me and not saying a word. I walked up to her slowly and she still said nothing ...
Literally idk what was wrong with her but I'm not exaggerating about the face she gave me the entire time I was in the store. 

Finally, I gave her my order and she responded in such a rude tone. When I gave her my $10 she gave me back the change with the face again as if she was disgusted. Even when she gave me my change, she didn't even reach her arm out.. and it looked as if she was even going to drop my change on the table. 

I literally do not know how someone like this even gets hired. She did not greet me, she did not say thank you, nor did she even smile once. 
When she gave me my drink she said ""here"", rolled her eyes, and walked away. I hope that you could rewind your store camera and see this for yourself because I am not joking. And this is so frustrating because I come here all the time and have never received such terrible service like that. I'm also not a complainer but it bothered me so much that I had to write this so that you could see. 
I didn't say anything in person either because I don't like to be ""that"" type of customer. I hope you could somehow teach her manners because that was honestly ridiculous. 
I didn't find her name on the receipt either."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2016-04-17,5.0,"This place was packed when we arrived. Line was out the door and you can only fit 10 people in there max. We were able to get our mango, black tea, winter melon milk tea in less than 10 minutes. The teas did not taste very sweet. You could tell the difference in each drink with the distinct flavor. The tapioca balls are at another level. Very chewy and for some reason it tastes better than the competitors. I'll be back to try their matcha and slush drinks.

Cash only location. Line can be long."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2016-02-19,5.0,"Ohhhhhhhh man! So I had never heard of ""Kung Fu Tea"" but this past Monday I was walking around Chinatown with two of my favorite ladies after having a fantastic dim sum brunch and some Chinatown Fair Arcade hangs. One friend really needed to use the restroom and another friend reeeeeeeally had a craving for Oreo Milk Bubble Tea (that friend was meeeeeee!) and I was hoping that we could find a place to satisfy both needs.

After two false alarms for my milk tea we ended up deciding to just hop on a train to midtown so my friend could use our other friend's bathroom - but then I spotted Kung Fu Tea and yelled something along the lines of, ""OMGLOOKTEEEEAPLACEHOPETHEYHAVEOREOMILKTEAACKOMGGIMMIE"" - seriously, I feel like I probably said this all in one breath. 

Upon entering and glancing over their menu, I immediately saw it...OREO MILK TEA!!! Not everyone has the Oreo variety and I'm not often in Chinatown so it's rare when I can get my hands on one of these suckers and so I was elated. I ordered it in a Large because GO HARD OR GO OREO - I mean - HOME.

I don't like tapioca balls - their gelatinous texture is weird to me (although I like Jello, a lot...meh) so they poured in ice, tea, milk, oreos and whatever else goes into making this delicious thing, popped a Kung Fu Tea branded seal on it and off it went to the Bubble Tea shaking machine. That thing looks like so much fun. Kind of wish I had one of these at home, lol.

My Oreo Milk Tea was freakin' DELICIOUS and everything I needed. All the feels. Writing this review is making me crave one RIGHT NOW THIS MINUTE!

Alas, they didn't have a restroom for my friend who needed to go - but the guy who took and made my order was really friendly + this place is clean and super cute. I also found out that they are a chain and there is apparently one not too far from my job (but too far for me to bounce to during lunch) but still - this excites me. 

5 stars. 5 whole Oreo-shaped stars. I cannot WAIT to be back :)."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2017-03-03,3.0,"I come here once in a while when I'm craving for kft, but not so often at this location because their service varies. Today, the service that was provided was super vague. 
The cashier was really nice, but this is only because she was serving me at the moment. After she was done serving me, she went back to talk to her coworker. They were talking pretty loud, acting as if my coworkers and I were not there. They were so busy cleaning that it literally took them like 5 minutes to make my drink. I'm not complaining about the time it took to make my drink, but they were too busy talking to each other. 
The floor was filled with receipts, tissues and straw wrappers and the workers seem to only clean when they're close to closing. It honestly doesn't seem pleasant walking into a dirty store."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2017-06-11,4.0,"great place with a ton of options.
i dont like the bubbles, so i always get a slush with lychee jelly- sooo delicious.
its a tiny little place and gets incredibly packed. the wait can be quite a while
me and the girlfriend noticed that there is always a TON of garbage from a combination of the order receipts and wrappers from the straw.
would be very helpful to the environment if they provided straws WITHOUT the wrappers.
it would make the place a lot more clean looking as well.
the staff are very nice
please note there is a 10 dollar minimum to use your credit card."

65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2016-01-29,4.0,"Excellent drinks and fast service. Cheap price and variety of drinks to choose. Worth coming to hang out and chit-chat.

Rude stuff
Inpatient service 
I asked for a medium taro milk tea and the girl actually confirmed the size with me whether it should be medium or large. Then I asked for a hot tea and they said hot tea they only have large cup . As I pointed out the medium cups on the table they said it was only for coffee, wtf?
They don't seem to want to be here 
Will not comeback for this attitude again"
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-02-19,4.0,Love the bubble milk tea here I recommended it to everyone !! The taro milk tea is also delicious!
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2019-08-13,5.0,"seriously the best bubble tea i've ever had. the taro slush i got tasted unique, not super basic like most places, and their boba was fresh -- made in-house every 2 hours."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2016-12-02,1.0,"They got my order wrong and refused to admit they put honey in my drink. It tastes disgusting.

The service and lack of attention to detail is truly annoying. If you make a drink wrong, own up to it and re-make it. There are people with allergies out there."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2015-07-23,2.0,"Finally, something I didn't fully finish. It was THAT bad. I was extremely thirsty, and I was looking for a place to quench my thirst so that I wouldn't be thirsty anymore and I stumbled upon this place. 

I settled for the Matcha Milk and it tastes horrible. Everything about the drink was bad. The drink tasted tremendously sweet even without any added sugar. The matcha was weirdly sweet and bitter at the same time. The matcha was also pre-made and not freshly blended. And don't get me started on the bubbles. The bubbles tasted extremely sweet. It's like they didn't even bother to mix the syrup/sugar throughly. And worse of all, the bubbles weren't chewy. There was an elastic aftertaste to it. It was like chewing on a rubber band. Disgusting. I should've stuck with the traditional bubble milk tea instead. This is what I get for trying new things. 

Would I come back? Probably not. I shall take my business to Cha-Time across the street instead."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2017-04-14,5.0,This is definitely one of the best boba places you're going to find in NYC. They have a wide variety of yummy options and serve either medium or large (or not). I got the Oreo bubble tea (crazy I know!) and is was interesting but good. Nice balance between sweet and milky and the cookies added an extra flavor. My friends got the taro and mango and both enjoyed it. Will definitely return next time I am that far downtown!

65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2017-11-28,5.0,"Kung Fu Tea is still one of my top favorite places to get Boba Tea and Taro Root Slush! I am so addicted to the Taro Root flavor!!! 

Place can get crowded really fast but the team there is very efficient and so are the machines they work with. 

Unique and tasty place! Plus I love all the stickers they posted around the place."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2018-05-21,5.0,"I like the honey green tea! Customer service can be improve, but I understand the line is long. Honey green tea with bubbles 70% sugar will be perfect for a good sunny day!"
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2015-08-24,3.0,"I had really high expectations for this place because many of my friends always posted pictures of their drinks from Kung Fu Tea.

I ordered the yogurt green tea with boba and I was SO EXCITED. However, it wasn't that great. I couldn't taste the green tea, at all. I noticed for the yogurt, it was the small Korean yogurt drinks and they put so much of that in it, all I could taste was that. I was expecting it to have more of an equal ratio of green tea to yogurt..... 

Staff was great though! There were so many options and I was overwhelmed by the choices, but the staff was very helpful. 

My other friends enjoyed their drinks. I will probably give this place another try the next time I'm in NY. Maybe I'll have better luck next time."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2017-08-18,3.0,"I loved coming to Kung Fu Tea in the San Diego, California location as it holds so many precious memories for me. We came here hoping to be able to bring up some of those memories but alas, this was not the right Kung Fu Tea to go to. There was no seating area unfortunately. The room was too small to really support the line that was forming inside. I opted to stand outside until our order was ready to be called. When I drank my milk tea (or bubble tea as they call it here in New York), I felt that it was just average tasting - nothing amazing or special."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2018-07-23,4.0,"Tried their Taro Milk tea. It was way too sweet for me. The boba tea was average. I felt like they put in too much boba, but other people may like that. All in all it was a nice place to try if you're into boba teas but there wasn't anything that wowed me about this place. The service was a bit long and there was no actual line so ordering took a minute for us to figure out. Tried it once and now I'm done."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2017-10-12,5.0,"This place is great! Stopped here because we saw their posters outside of the store! The stuff at the cashier was very helpful to answer my questions. So Boba at this place is just a topping. Even though the store is a little bit small but their drinks are so good. I ordered the oolong milk tea with boba and milk cap. It was awesome. Pretty sure I will be back.

They have a 10-dollar minimum for cards."
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2017-09-17,5.0,SO good!!!! Tried the yogurt green tea and it hit the spot perfectly :) 10/10 would recommend. Bubbles are also cooked well and chewy without being overly chewy. Wish bubble tea wasn't so pricey but it's always $4-5 anywhere you go.
65,kung-fu-tea-new-york-2,2016-07-14,4.0,"The service at this Kung Fu Tea is appalling! To be fair, I liked that the people who worked there were honest, and I ended up with a really delicious bubble tea, but...if 4 out of the 5 items I chose garnered such intense looks of digust and statements such as, ""Are you sure?"" Are you sure? Are you SURE? Whatever, it's your life."" then perhaps as the owner of this establishment you should take a look at your offerings and see if they are worth it to put on the menu.

I finally got some excitment when I ordered the Oolong Milk Tea with Boba! I'm glad I ordered it because it was really good, but the experience here really has me thinking about whether or not I want to come back.

Who am I kidding? The tea was so good, of course I will. I already know this."
66,ground-support-new-york,2020-01-04,5.0,"//5 star because I received my order correctly and in a timely fashion. 

Macchiato:
Amazing, strong, fresh, and just enough to get your day started. 

Ham and Cheese (grilled):
The bread was delicious. Everything was heated up without any coldness in the middle. The cheese was great. The ham was a little more cured than I desired but I pass on that. 

They have plenty of seating if you want to dine in. It's a lot better alternative to other popular coffee shops like Starbucks and such. 

It's a nice chill place so check it out."
66,ground-support-new-york,2020-05-09,4.0,What attracts me about this cafe is it spacious setting and that is perfectly located in SoHo.  I'm usually that boring coffee drinker who orders an   all-black coffee and will opt for a healthier option to put into my coffee if in the mood.  I've been here a few times and it can definitely get busy.  Plenty of seating inside and during the nicer times of the year outside.  Perfect for a coffee date or a friendly gathering. Maybe next time I'll treat my taste buds and even order some food.
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-11-08,5.0,"I've always adored Ground Support. It's in a perfect location in the heart of SoHo, has a wonderful and spacious set-up, great views of West Broadway for people-watching, and attracts lovely customers. Besides the coffee also being great, the cookies and sandwiches are delicious too! I recently had the Cuban sandwich and fell in love. 

Ground Support will always be my go-to cafe downtown!"
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-01-11,3.0,"A few friends and I dropped by here on our way to the library and half debated staying to do some work. However at noon, this place was bustling and full of people, and we did not find any seats available, so we got everything to go.

I got a small drip coffee which was $2.75 for about 8 oz. While the coffee tasted good, I find it very hard to justify the price for what it was. 

I also picked up a package of the earl grey shortbread cookies, which has two cookies for $6. They were crunchy and crumbs flew EVERYWHERE when I was trying to eat it. The earl grey flavor is strong, which I liked. However it was also very salty, which didn't jive as well with the tea flavor. 

All in all, a solid coffeeshop but feels a little too overpriced for what it offered."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-10-23,4.0,"Cute little shops with a lot to offer. In the heart of soho, this place can offer you a lot in terms of variety and service! 

I love coming here every time I'm in soho."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-07-12,5.0,"I wish there were more locations of Ground Support, because the matcha latte here is one my favorites. Not sure how they do it, but both the hot and iced matchas are always so so smooth. They also have plenty of seating indoors and outdoors. This place seems to be very popular for coffee dates and meetings, as the seating is consistently pretty packed, but there's usually always somewhere you can squeeze in."
66,ground-support-new-york,2020-02-23,2.0,"Good coffee, horrible staff. Seemed like the entire staff was collectively having a bad day and just didn't want to be there. Not a good experience at all. Absolutely terrible customer service."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-04-24,4.0,"Excellent cafe for small bites, coffee/tea, and some communal space to work/read. I got mint tea, iced, and it was fantastic - I strongly recommend it.

The space is great. There are a few long wooden tables, a few smaller tables for two, and a number of window/bar countertop spaces. There's plenty of light, and doors in the back area open to a small alley, giving a lot of fresh air and flow to the entire cafe.

WiFi is free, but got really slow at times, perhaps because I was there at a popular hour. Still, it was frustrating having to load and reload on occasion, not really what I expect from cafe WiFi.

Overall a good option for the area, I'll probably stick to my book next time I go!"
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-11-24,4.0,First time here but would definitely come in more often. Cappuccino is good and strong. I asKed for it to be put in a ceramic cup as I don't like drinking out of paper. Friendly service too!
66,ground-support-new-york,2020-03-11,3.0,"I come into this shop every once and a while when I'm in the neighborhood. Great drip coffee and cold brew (I do miss the old espresso). This is a quintessential spot to stop into while in SoHo. The staff members are extremely friendly and seem to always be having a wonderful time together, especially the girls I often see at the front of the cafe when I come in, they're always kind and complimentary. 

However, I have had a few rude interactions with one staff member particularly. He always seems to be in an awful mood whenever I ask him simple questions about the coffee they now serve, I notice him on his cell phone huffing and puffing around. The other members of the staff are nice enough to offer me a helping hand, but he seems to be in a bad mood and I have yet to enjoy my time at Ground Support while he's there."
66,ground-support-new-york,2020-01-25,2.0,"Today I ran in out of the rain with my infant and my family from out of town and the guy wearing the red  bandana behind the counter told us the place was full and couldn't serve us. He made us feel like we should leave after we just got there. I understand it's a busy spot but some basic customer service would have been nice. We ended up staying for the coffee, which was good, but we don't  plan on returning because of the staff."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-08-25,3.0,"My husband and I were going to a venue close by and since we were early, we decided to pop in here for some food. When you walk in, you automatically smell the aroma of coffee and pastries. It was so nice and inviting. The organization of the place though is a hot mess. The cash register is so close to the door that if there's more than 3 people waiting to order, the line is already out the door. If you move over to the right, you'll be in the way of people and the seating area. There's also no clear sign that says where you can pick up your beverage/food, so if you're not dining in, it's awkward not knowing where to stand (and there aren't many places to stand!). They do have two picnic tables to the right of the entrance, but they don't fit too many people. There's limited seating towards the back of the cafe and the walkway is very narrow. 

Anyway, once we finally figured out the place, I ordered an almond croissant, an iced chai and my husband ordered the cuban sandwich. Altogether we paid $21, which is pretty steep in my opinion. My almond croissant was a bit on the heavier side. The croissant was very dense and wasn't as flaky as I would like it. The iced chai was pretty good though. My husband enjoyed his cuban sandwich, but it's quite small for $10. He pretty much left the place slightly less hungry than before.

Overall, it's a cute coffee shop, but I don't think the prices justify coming here often. If I'm in the area, I'll pop in. If not, there are other coffee shops to visit."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-07-24,3.0,"I had the opportunity to visit Ground Support for the first time while grabbing coffee with a friend on a Saturday in Soho. We had planned to check out an art exhibit nearby and thought this would be an ideal spot to enjoy some cold brew beforehand.

The space itself is really interesting! When you walk in you instantly notice the long wooden picnic tables set up for customers to sit at. They also have pretty standard beverage choices, along with a variety of food options to choose from. So if you're just looking to grab a cup of coffee or enjoy a full meal this place seems good for both.

My friend and I ordered our ice coffees ($4) and actually opted to sit at a bar they have that's located towards the back of the space. There's natural lighting that makes it's way into the cafe which was also really great too. Even though we were more towards the back we didn't feel like we were ""in the back"" so to say.

The only issue I have with this place is their restroom. There's only one, and it's located all the way in the back in between the staff's private section and the trash disposal closet. Also, it was pretty dirty when I used it so that was in itself a really off putting experience.

Overall a decent coffee shop where you could either do work, catch up with a friend, or enjoy what looks like a decent meal! I might just try and use the restroom elsewhere if you really have to."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-01-17,4.0,"Good for: studying; grabbing a coffee w/ someone to catch up

One of my favorite coffee shops to get some work done or meet up with someone in SoHo. They have good wifi, bathrooms and a lot of tables and seating. Even when it's crowded, you can usually snag a seat on a bench until a table opens up."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-09-20,5.0,"I absolutely love this place. They take their coffee seriously without being pretentious. 

Theres plenty of indoor and out door seating, which is hard to find in this neighborhood. If you're the kind of person who brings your laptop to do work, they have wifi and tables that can accommodate you.

They have affordable food options for breakfast and lunch or just a snack (salads, sandwiches, pastries, etc). 

Do yourself a favor and become a regular here. The staff is friendly and make excellent coffee. 

Also in the summer months you can get a cold brew slushie. I highly recommend trying one of these."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-07-13,4.0,"The matcha was great.  And the place is cool and a good place to get some work done.  However, it doesn't seem like they have a/c and that's a bummer.  Other people don't seem to mind it."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-11-26,4.0,Very affordable and great coffee and service! Taking off one star because the wifi was very slow and essentially usess.
66,ground-support-new-york,2020-01-03,3.0,Disappointed that a place as natural seeming as this would not have stevia. Splenda is chemical garbage and Stevia/Monkfruit are plant derived. At over $5 for a coffee please get it right.
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-02-08,4.0,"Coffee shops in SoHo are pretty much my favorite thing ever because each one is so unique -- and Ground Support definitely reaffirmed that idea. 

I came in on a weekday around 4PM and grabbed the coveted bench facing out the window. It was great pulling out my laptop, typing away, and looking up every once in awhile to people watch New Yorkers walking by all bundled up in their fashionable winter wear. 

Once my laptop started dying though, I struggled a bit to find an outlet as they're quite scarce and the cafe was crowded with people. Once people started clearing out, I was able to scout one out behind one of the benches by the walls. The seating there wasn't as comfortable but hey, it's an outlet. 

I got the chai latte and it was a nice treat for a frosty winter day. The latte itself wasn't anything special but it did the trick. Ultimately, a great place for working but come with your laptop charged just in case!"
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-11-06,5.0,"Consistently good coffee. My staple elsewhere is always a latte with two pumps of a selective few flavored syrups. Receiving a latte with no option of flavored syrups here and still feeling it is the best cup I have had in awhile, speaks to the quality of coffee they use here and the barista's added touch. I highly recommend this place. While I haven't tried the food, based on people in line often ordering various food options, I imagine it is just as good. Enjoy!"
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-05-14,4.0,"Lovely coffee shop, bright and cosy with good hot drinks and sweet bites."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-08-28,4.0,"Came here looking for coffee and a place to sit down at the end of a long afternoon in SoHo. My friend works in the area so he'd been here a lot and said I should try it out, so we did. I got the cold drip coffee, and he got a chai latte - I liked the cold drip coffee ($3), taste was pretty strong and did the job. Friend liked his chai latte (I'm not a fan of chai, so don't really know if it was good or not). There is a decent amount of seating for SoHo, but still not enough for all the people trying to sit/chat and grab coffee or sit and stay a while to study or work. Friend and I wanted to sit and stay, but it was a little too busy for us to focus on our conversation so we decided to grab and go instead. Solid place, fast service, good coffee, bustling place good for grab and go coffees."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-04-01,5.0,"This is one of my favorite cafes in NYC! Not only do they have amazing coffee but also delicious paninis! My go-to panini is the Cuban. I actually haven't gotten around to try any of the other ones because I keep coming back to order this one again! Everything is fresh and made to order. 

If you're ever in soho and need an afternoon coffee pick me up or a quick lunch, definitely check out this place!"
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-03-27,5.0,"There are a myriad of coffee places right in this area and this one is my go-to if I'm craving a drink. Their food is also delicious. It's small, so seating can be a bit limited, but the drinks and food are too good to pass up.

I can't speak on the morning crowd. I mostly come here on my lunch break to get an iced mocha as an afternoon treat. I've never had a better mocha before. Their bagels, oatmeal, and PB+J are all delicious. 

Overall, good vibes. Really nice staff."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-11-02,5.0,"A great place to get some work done, people watch, or catch up with friends. They have free wifi, bathrooms, and different types of seating (benches, tables, bar) and plenty of natural light coming in. I appreciate the housemade nut milks they serve, and they didn't charge me for oat milk (always a huge plus). Like other reviews said, they offer a wide selection of drinks and they take their coffee seriously but aren't pretentious about it at all. I also appreciate that I never feel rushed when ordering or pressured to order more stuff if I'm staying for a while."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-06-23,5.0,"Best decaf soy latte I have had in a while. Definitely recommend this place.
The atmosphere is good, but it can get busy so seating is limited."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-05-07,5.0,"My Favorite coffee place. 

Great staff, amazing location, good Pastries. Great Coffee.

One the most reasonably priced lunches in SoHo.
Salads and sandwiches.

My favorite to get for breakfast is the Legacy Bagel, which is Choice of Bagel (toasted or not) cream cheese, arugula and pickled onion or something. It's good."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-06-08,3.0,"This place has a great location and a cute interior. However there is limited seating, and I'm not a huge fan of the communal tables. The iced dirty chai was fantastic, but the regular coffee was so so. I ordered a breakfast sandwich which tasted good but was overly oily and greasy (probably due to the sausage), but it ended up giving me a stomachache.... I'm going to chalk it up to the oil?"
66,ground-support-new-york,2017-06-17,3.0,"Not my favorite coffee shop. My friend recommended it because she had been there before and said that she'd enjoyed the ambiance and the coffee. Maybe they were having an off day when I visited, but I found the baristas slow and the internet shoddy. It was so shoddy as to not be available at all! When my friend went up to the counter to ask about the internet, we were told to move to the back of the cafe for better service (where there were no seats).

The macchiato that I ordered was nice and strong, but it took about 15 minutes to prepare - I was watching the clock because I was due for an appointment but had ordered a macchiato to stay because I thought I would have at least 30-40 minutes to enjoy it as I studied. Unfortunately, I had to down my drink almost as soon as I got it because it took so long. 

I might give them another try if I'm in the area, but given the plenty of other options, this will be a hard sell."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-01-11,4.0,"This is a fairly busy coffee shop. I got a basic drop coffee which tasted pretty strong and had a nice roast to it. One thing I was surprised by is the size of the cup. A small coffee here is smaller than the standard small at other shops for approximately the same price, so beware. The ambient noise is loud and there is limited seating space, so it may not be ideal for studying."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-07-12,4.0,"SoHo's cafes are usually quite cramped, but Ground Support is a comfy coffee shop with adequate seating, great coffee, wifi, and a restroom.

It's a great place to work. You might have to share a table with other people but there's plenty of room. I love that there's plenty of natural light throughout the place. It's really pleasant.

My cappuccino was pretty good too.

I didn't try the food, but the menu consists of several sandwiches and (a single) salad. There are also a few pastries available."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-08-31,5.0,This is a what they call worlds best coffee. Every time I'm in NYC it's a must stop in for a cup of Coffee. Amazing Cappuccino's and Latte is made to perfection. The sandwiches are also great.
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-09-22,3.0,"Decent coffee, ridiculous prices. I ordered a small latte with almond milk which ended up being almost $7. That was before I added cream. 

WiFi is available but very very slow. There is also a bit of seating available, but it was so crowded that not much was open."
66,ground-support-new-york,2020-01-15,1.0,"I've been coming to your shop since it opened. coffe is great but , Your matcha latte is too white. Please, don't be greedy, put more green stuff."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-08-01,5.0,"This is my favorite lunch destination when in NY. The turkey picnic is a favorite, which I enjoyed today, as in the past. It is a turkey sandwich on a baguette with barbecue sauce and chips *in the sandwich* as well as tomatoes and lettuce. I love it. What I also loved today was their fresh squeezed orange juice--served perfectly with no ice--it was potent and flavorful ($4 for a large cup)."
66,ground-support-new-york,2017-06-27,3.0,"While the vibe of Ground Support exceeds my expectations for a coffee shop, the pricey and only okay quality drinks made for a disappointment. 

The coffeeshop meets industrial decor with benches (seating available both times I've come here!) and music playing offer so much to fawn over. It's not a large cafe, but there's a substantial amount of seating and some outdoors seating on nice days. There was a healthy mix of people chatting and people working and those just getting coffee to go so I was excited to try my drink.

Unfortunately that's where this review gets sad. The first time I came here I ordered a cold brew, which took 10 minutes and reminding the barista I had ordered it to finally get, and a very ice heavy cold brew and not that strong tasting cold brew at that. The second time I ordered a iced matcha latte with almond milk, which came to a hefty $6 total. CRAZY. For that price the matcha latte was not worthwhile. It was slightly above average with a distinct matcha taste, but the drink had too much ice and seemed a touch watered down. I enjoyed it, but would not be willing to pay for it again. On the plus side I had a pleasant time reading a book here during the visit I got the matcha latte. 

The menu also has pastries and sandwiches (~$10 ea) that generally dominate the chalkboard. I stared at the board for a good five minutes to find the coffee section (it's in the top left corner btw). Of the limited options, don't get what I got."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-04-18,4.0,"Nice hipster cafe with everyone on their laptops doing work. This place looks like it's the bees knees with the crowd who comes in.

I was just there to kill time while my students were out and about shopping til they drop in SoHo. Pretty good chai latte, a little too foamy than what I'm used too but hey, still good. Also loving the custom stamp on the simple white cup to brand the store. 

Only minus 1 star cause the cashier looked bothered from us. Maybe caught him on an off day and bc it was super cold out?!"
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-04-12,5.0,"I only nipped into Ground Support quickly but I fell in love. First, it is surprisingly hard to find a good chill coffee shop in Soho, probably because the rent is Chanel & Louis-worthy and therefore precludes the humble cafe. 

Second, the inside is adorably airy and relaxed, with a lot of natural light and shabby chic vibes. It is a very popular nomad workstation so to take into account if you want a seat or are one yourself! 

Third, the barista gave me a latte with two kissing swans!! And said he wanted it to match my outfit, which is the sweetest thing I've heard lately. 

And fourth, when I posted the latte to my Insta, the coffee shop reached out to thank me and we had a great chat. 

Fifth, I then found out they refuse to post foodporn and only post photos of visiting dogs to their company IG. I'm totally charmed. If I could marry a coffee shop, I would. Swipe right on Ground Support if you're in Soho!"
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-09-10,4.0,"Great cup of artisanal joe here. Probably the best specialty coffee shop in SoHo and they've been around awhile. There's plenty of comfortable seating, free WiFi, and a friendly staff. Certainly a notch above Starbucks and a refuge from the shopping hordes a few blocks east."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-01-28,3.0,"The coffee is good, I had almond matcha latte for about $6.
Atmosphere is okay.  
All servers never looked happy when serving.  
WiFi is fine.
Temperature is cold during winter, most customers kept wearing their jackets."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-10-02,2.0,"It was just a decent experience, less than average. Service: 2/5; food: 3/5; drinks: 3/5

Me and my boyfriend trief ordering like 3 sandwiches but apparently they were sold out. While ordering the lady on the counter was just upright rude. She didn't even let me email or text my receipt. Her coworker also made my drink wrong. When I got my iced chai latte I was presented with a hot chai latte so they had to remake it. The chai was really not that impressive but it was different in that it was milkier. There wasn't much chai taste in it. It was a really short experience but yet I felt so many things. I don't even know what to say except for disappointed. Incredibly disappointed. The place did look pretty though, that's all I can say."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-07-01,3.0,I went for salad as per pix.   No salad available.   None.  Staff pretty nice with my 50-year-old-white puzzlement.  I ordered an ice coffee I did not want just to tip.  Crowd = boring as sh!te.
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-06-22,5.0,"Great iced coffee and lots of ""milk"" options, including oat milk - yum.  Cute seating options too."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-07-01,1.0,"5* coffee, but the sandwich wasn't nice, the pastry dry and whoever the guy with the long hair, beard and cap is has an attitude problem (management...hire someone else)."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-01-20,1.0,"Customer service was absolutely horrid. From the first second I got there I was greeted with condescending tones and glares from the cashier. Because the store is way too small, I was sat on a bench in a corner and accidentally spilled my coffee. After that all of the workers were extremely rude and behaved as if mopping up a spill was the worst thing to ever happen to them. They were also incredibly disrespectful when I asked politely for another coffee. Overall, place would be fine if it weren't for the a-hole cashiers."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-07-28,5.0,"First time in SoHo, and this coffee place had very unique drinks for the summer. One of them was similar to Starbucks frappucino, but much less sweet and more coffee flavor, almost closer to melted coffee ice cream (minus the creamy taste), and the other one was matcha and lemonade blended. I am not sure if these types of drinks are common throughout NY, but was great experience for me, and was a great coffee break in the middle of humid and hot summer day :)"
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-11-11,4.0,"TLDR; Great coffee, great croissants, great service, can be crowded.

Details:
This location has a very friendly environment and friendly staff although it can be crowded. Has a large variety of coffee and other beverages as well as pastries and food. First at this establishment and I only had a coffee and croissant. The coffee was incredible, but the croissant was probably the best I've ever had."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-01-28,5.0,Excellent coffee and service! My hair salon is just around the corner; I make a point of coming early just to grab coffee from Ground Support. They sell their beans for those looking to brew at home. I cannot recommend them enough!
66,ground-support-new-york,2017-11-05,3.0,"Pretty typical coffee shop. I got the hot chocolate so I can't really speak as to how good their coffee is. The hot chocolate was so expensive ($4.50 for a small cup) and it didn't taste good. It was kinda powdery at the bottom. 

It's got a decent amount of seating and a long table with benches. It's also nicely aerated. It was chilly that day and I went in expecting it to be stuffy inside due to the heat, but it wasn't :)"
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-04-06,3.0,"I want to love this place. I really do. And enough people seem to so maybe it doesn't matter what I think!! ! What would make me love it- if the coffee 'portions' weren't so small and if they had to-go lids that didn't leak coffee onto the front of your shirt with every sip. That one is a major deal breaker. Kinda ruins your outfit and your day. 

Lovely layout tho and pleasant staff and vibes."
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-02-18,4.0,"Great atmosphere and prices for sandwiches, just really crowded and a little tight so you'll probably get knocked into as you're putting the lid on your coffee."
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-04-16,5.0,"As good as overpriced coffee can get. They have numerous milk choices and a full food menu. Plenty of seats, which is super hard to find in any NY coffee shop. There are a few long tables in the front of the store and two in the back. Also there is bar seating. Yes--there is wifi! I still don't understand coffee shops that don't have wifi, obviously they're not down to have customers spending hours in their small square-footed store. There are many windows, allowing light to peak through, even on rainy days. Definitely a good work/study place. The music isn't overpowering either, which is another hard shark"
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-04-29,5.0,"Every time I'm in Soho I make it my mission to stop in and get a cup a coffee along with their grilled cheese sandwich. Its the best I've ever had !!!!! 

I love this coffee shop so much!  Reminds me of my days of going to MUD and stopping in before hitting the subway to head home. 

Love. Love. Love. Xo"
66,ground-support-new-york,2018-03-19,2.0,"An oldie, but not a goodie.  I've been to ground support on and off for the past five years and unfortunately, it no longer stacks up to other options.

Seating: this is a pretty small cafe with limited seating. All of the tables are a bit creaky and old, and it's pretty difficult to get a good seat.

Internet: if you're coming yo get work done, turn away!  The internet is known to be very bad -- and it disappoints every time I have visited.

Ambience: It's quaint and feels like a small cafe. But it's too loud and crowded that it's not a great place to stay for awhile.

I can't comment on the food (coffee is okay, sometimes burnt) but I'd say it's not worth a visit."
66,ground-support-new-york,2017-01-23,3.0,"Not a bad place to hang out and get some work done. Low key background music, relatively soft spoken crowds, and reliable wifi (at least so far!) there are picnic tables and a few benches throughout so it isn't cozy, but there is plenty of seating squeezed into a small space. 
I was hoping for a fun latte but their only latte flavors are mocha and honey. I ordered the honey latte from the disgruntled man at the front. The baristas are all friendly and working away. They made the latte quickly and always seemed busy in the back. 
The latte was made well, with light frothy milk and a pretty heart design.  I was underwhelmed by the honey flavor or lack there of. I couldn't really taste anything which was disappointing considering it was $ 5.75 for a medium."
66,ground-support-new-york,2015-05-19,4.0,"Order your cup of espresso, and find a nice bench to sit and enjoy!  Love that you can bring your pooch with ya...since they do have outdoor bench seatings. They even have a cute little cute outdoor courtyard where your dogs can socialize amongst each other, even lift a leg or two! Arf, arf!!

Their bagels here seems to be a big hit, but their espresso is amazing. Smooth!! Coffee here was also quite delightful!! So if you find yourself in SOHO, and want to immerse in local SOHO style, I suggest start your morning cup here! You'll be pleasantly surprised! 

Until then, Cheers! ~ :p"

I got myself a bagel with the works it as delicious! When people say the bagels are better in New York they aren't kidding! 

I would like to come back and try a latte next time ( they do amazing latte art) - who doesn't like a cute picture on top of their latte?"
66,ground-support-new-york,2019-06-23,1.0,"I found the customer service to be extremely terrible (I was mocked by the barista). The overpriced turmeric latte was pretty tasteless, and tasted like milk with a sprinkle of turmeric from a shaker, which stayed crystallized in the drink"
66,ground-support-new-york,2017-12-07,5.0,"Stopped by for an almond milk latte on a busy Friday afternoon. The barista was friendly, my latte was perfect, and the coffee shop has a very cozy vibe. It's great for taking a break in between shopping. I will definitely becoming back for more lattes!"

For locals, its simply a place of comfort. The environment is so serene and spacious with couches and other very comfortable sitting throughout. It has a great atmosphere and its a great place to hang out and study, read a book, or have a lil date. 

There's also a great view from this place, what more can you ask for on a date?!"
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-12-31,3.0,"One bathroom for this huge place? Bummer...you can imagine the line. 

Coffee was good and nice vibe in an old brick building. They also sell a bunch of merch."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-11-26,4.0,"I enjoy coffee and tea, well, more tea than coffee...anyways, while we were hanging out in Brooklyn, we were looking for a spot for a good cup of coffee or tea, and this spot came up on my search.  

This location has two separated ordering counters, and the one in the back has unique matcha drinks with limited coffee offerings. The front side had loads of merchandise goods, and offer espresso drinks and all sorts of coffee, and limited amount of tea menu. 

I ordered a matcha drink from the back counter, Strawberry Fields made with strawberry, ginger, milk, and matcha. It was certainly an interesting drink, nothing like I've ever had. The matcha was strong, didn't get much strawberry, as the ginger was more overpowering. Very refreshing drink on a hot day. 

The place was pretty crowded with locals, just relaxing alone or with friends. Seemed like a great spot to hang out. I heard their coffee is really great, so I would like to try their coffee the next time we visit."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2020-02-12,4.0,"Hipster coffee in Dumbo, which translates to a constant influx of visitors going in and out! The place is huge, but it could be hard to find seats for groups of more than 3 people. It's also loud and the wifi is excruciatingly slow so definitely not a good place to concentrate on work/study. Instead, I think it'd be a cute place to catch up with friends. The drinks are okay, a bit expensive but I like the fact that they have a separate matcha counter!"
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-08-27,5.0,"Brooklyn Roasting Company is so great that I came here twice during my recent trip to NYC. I love chai, so the first time I came, I ordered an iced chai latte. It was perfect and the chai was strong. The second time I came, I ordered the Golden Latte. I've actually never heard of Golden Latte before and I was feeling spontaneous so I ordered it. It tasted kind of ginger-y and cinnamon-y and sweet. It was the best tea latte I've ever had....!! Why didn't I order this the first time? I literally get chai latte all the time everywhere lol. But regardless, I'm sure you can't go wrong with any of their coffee/tea. My friends ordered other kinds of coffee and they were def on point. 

Another reason why I love this place is because not only does it give off such lofty hipster vibes, it's also incredibly spacious. There are many tables and chairs, comfy sofas, modern decor that makes this old industrial warehouse building a great place to hangout and/or do work in. There were a ton of people sitting around just doing their own thing (i.e. reading a book, doing work on their computer, journaling, catching up with friends). 

Another plus - great views and super close to Brooklyn Bridge Park & Brooklyn Bridge. Omg, my type of coffee shop for sure - what a GEM."

     Went walking down by the waterfront park in Brooklyn that goes from Atlantic Ave to the power station at the Navy Yard.
      Came across this place and my mom and I decided to grab a cortado.  First off, very friendly and cool staff. Gave us a rundown on the history of their place.  Coffee roasting and providing that third space that is popular right now.  
      This place is BK unique, it's open, industrial and sets that ""lets get sht done vibe"".  Think of it as the place that a starting out entrepreneur can get the feel of a support staff that will drive them to gain more success in the future.
     I'm not saying they are here specially to work for you, but they provide a space for success and growth in a unique and only way you can get from Brooklyn.  
     Visit, try their unique roast and get sht done with your team at a place that is like the Naruto Uzumaki of the coffee shop third space."

This place was a nice pitstop on a cold NY day (even though I ordered iced coffee LOL). They have wifi and plenty of tables to sit and enjoy company/work. I'll be back the next time I'm in NY.
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-03-30,4.0,"I came to Brooklyn Roasting Company right after taking a few pics of the DUMBO. It's a great spot to go to especially on a chilly day. The interior was nothing special as they laid out a few merchandise to purchase throughout the shop. There are plenty of seating in front of the cashier and also in the back. 

Immediately looking at the menu, I was very curious of what the Maple Shay Latte($5) was. I decided to just order it and boy, was it a good choice. The maple shay was so flavorful. The sweet maple complements so well with the bitterness of the espresso. I would come back to Brooklyn just for this drink."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-11-09,4.0,"For my father-in-law, a diehard espresso drinker, this was the 2nd best espresso he found in a 3-month stay in NYC (the best one was Elsewhere Espresso in the East Village). 

I loved the large, industrial space and the chance to see their actual roastery. My partner also enjoyed his cappucino! (Sorry I'm not a coffee drinker so hard to be more descriptive, but these two coffee lovers definitely give Brooklyn Roasting a huge thumbs up.)"
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-01-09,4.0,"Ain't nothing wrong with a cup of coffee at Brooklyn Roasting Co.! The large space is accommodating to all and houses different concepts like a matcha bar, retail shop and plenty of seating for those wanting a workspace. 

What I love about cups of coffee in nyc is that they are affordable. Every one seems to be less than $3 for a small cup and this place is no different. I take my coffee black so I can get a good idea of the bean quality and Brooklyn does a nice job with the roast on their drip to go. Not overly done and lightly roasted. 

Moral of the story, grab cup of joe if you're on the go!"
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2018-12-14,3.0,"The coolest of coffeeshops on the edge of the water in DUMBO. It's a giant space with brick walls, tons of tables and couches, and a wide selection of drinks/pastries/tins of in-house roasted coffee beans for purchase. I work close by and have been often. 

Pros: fast, lots of space, discount if you bring your own cup/mug. Love that they have Oat Milk. Great for a mocha. 

Cons: inconsistent coffee and service. Dare I say these days Brooklyn Roasting Co sometimes feels rather ""corporate""? On an up day an awesome barista asks me if I want light roast or dark roast for my drip coffee and hands me a loyalty card. On a down day there's no eye contact and coffee grounds in my cup. The taste of their drip and espresso drinks just isn't for me, either. It's a bit too bold and acidic.

I used to come for the vibe but given all the great coffee near by, I don't find myself coming here as much anymore."

The décor is simple and industrial which further elevates the cool coffee shop vibes. Their iced chai is indeed the best one I have every had! Coffee and teas are great, so what more do you need? Take my word, run here!"
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-09-05,4.0,"I would say this is a nice little spot, but it's actually a tasteful & spacious warehouse.

Brooklyn Roasting already has somewhat of a famous presence in the NY coffee scene, but visiting is always a pleasant reminder of why they're as well-known as they are. Their coffee is good, they've got a good aesthetic going on, and they provide a neat space for people that are trying to go about their business, whether it be work, study, or play.

This location also has a specialty coffee & tea bar in the corner, which I didn't get to try at my last visit, but definitely want to the next time I'm in the area. It's also a nice perk that they're right next to the water in case you feel like going out and taking a scenic walk."

My friends and I stepped in after a long walk over the bridge on a very rainy day. This coffee was exactly what I needed. Warmed me right up, and such a great taste. My only regret is that it's not available in LA. I bought a bag of beans to take home though, so..."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-04-09,5.0,"I stopped in on my last day of my trip in New York and I must say this place was a delight to come across. It's a huge store front near the board walk in DUMBO with large windows, comfy seating (couches, lounge chairs) and some beautiful reflective glass high top tables with stools. I was there on a Monday morning, people were on their laptops as well as just relaxing. The shop has two counters, I couldn't tell if they were different (one seemed more focused on Matcha and tea so I went to the other one). There were some tables with items to buy like coffee beans, logo mugs, socks, and other items. 

The counter I went to was facing the water/front of the shop. There was a plethora baked goods to choose from. A variety of coffee/espresso style options and with milk alternatives available (almond milk + oat milk). I chose a butter croissant and an Iced almond milk latte. The croissant was large (always a plus!!!), buttery, and soft and the latte was smooth and delicious. Huge plus: they had the Strawless plastic lids for the to go cups (YASSSS!!!!!!!!).

The staff were cracking me up and they were so kind (and genuinely kind!!). They made my whole day. We chatted shortly, but you could tell that they are truly  invested in ensuring your time spent at the Brooklyn Roasting Company is wonderful. 

I can't wait to be back on my next trip."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-11-21,4.0,Great mocha but would have loved it to be slightly bigger at $5.25. Had some subtle caramel notes. It's located right before the famous DUMBO shot so lots of people at that intersection getting their photos taken.

67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2018-11-12,4.0,"(4.5 stars) Loved my cappuccino here but more than that, really enjoyed the space. High ceilings and an abundance of natural light with plenty of seating, making it perfect for getting work done for a few hours. 

The layout isn't necessarily the best, as there's lots going on and it can be hard to maneuver around. Most of the tables I went to sit at were dirty so not sure how often they get wiped down throughout the day. But then again, with the views they have, it's pretty inconsequential."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2020-03-06,5.0,Nice coffee spot!  Near the Brooklyn Bridge and spacious but cozy.  The coffee is great and the service is friendly.  The barista I had was super fast and friendly.  The windows are huge and the space is very sunny and comfortable.  Recommended for when you take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge!
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-03-20,2.0,Staff was friendly but coffee wasn't good at all. I ordered a caffè latte with almond milk. It tasted burnt and the texture was thick (of the espresso). I expected more for such a big place. The side tables with sheet metal ripped a piece of my jacket. Had the chia seed pudding and that was delicious. We also shared the chocolate avocado pudding and that was delicious too. The two stars are because of the fact that I came here for coffee and this is a coffee roasting place and that the coffee wasn't good. I also tasted their regular blend that they had (black no sugar) and it tasted bland.
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-04-01,5.0,"What a great coffeeshop in Dumbo! I hesitated as I typed coffeeshop, because it definitely felt like more of a destination than what the word coffeeshop conveys. In addition to coffee, they also have a matcha bar and lots of different beans for sale (which they locally roast!).

It can be a little confusing at first to know where to go, so don't be ashamed to walk the whole store first! I did, and after getting the lay of the land started with the beans, as I wanted to buy some as a gift for my friend. The people working there are awesome and friendly, and someone came over to help me choose a blend based on what I knew of my friend's coffee habits.

In addition to the blend I got, I also ordered an oat milk latte which was nice (not the best ever, but a decent cup). Then, I sat down at a table (of which there are numerous), pulled out my laptop (free and fairly fast wifi), and got to work.

During my time there, a worker also came around with some coffee to sample. It was a nice touch-- instead of trying to kick out customers, BRC seems to be trying to make an atmosphere to welcome them. Nice ambiance, good coffee, and fantastic service made for a lovely NYC morning."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-06-05,4.0,"brb - moving to DUMBO so I can hit up this coffeeshop on the reg. 

I recently spent a long weekend nearby and grabbed a drink from here every single day. Their coffee and matcha lattes are on point, but even more than that, I love the atmosphere! 

For starters, it's a really large space. There's one entrance off of Jay St. that will land you at the matcha tea bar, but you can also get espresso based drinks at this counter. There's also the main entrance closer to the water which is where both the food and larger drink menu resides. 

Besides that, there's lots of open seating. If I lived nearby, I would totally pop in to do work all of the time. They roast beans onsite and have a large retail space where they sell their coffee and other fun goodies. 

Until then, I'll definitely drop by next time I'm in the area and would encourage you to do the same!"

67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2020-01-11,3.0,"The place looks promising when you walk up, great vibe inside, chatty baristas, good seating options, and people watching plus. It has half the equation but the Iced Chai Latte I ordered was 14 oz milk with a two once shot of chai that wasn't strong at all. It serious tasted like I was having a glass of milk with a dash of cinnamon. So I go back to the barista and ask for some more chai after I drink down 1/4 cup of milk. He puts another two once shot in it and guess what, still tastes and looks like milk. I had high hopes but was thoroughly disappointed."

About $5.75 for my cold brew with complimentary milks including soy which is nice.   No flavoring available but they do have simple sugar if you need that. Really only complaint is the no flavor and short supply of seats
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2018-12-06,3.0,"I came here on a Saturday morning.  I needed to kill some time so I ordered a chai latte and a ham and cheese croissant.  I don't know how you can ruin a chai latte but they did.  It tasted weird and I would definitely not eat here again.

Redeeming factors - pretty decent seating area with free wifi and outlets in every seating area."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2018-05-27,5.0,"Definitely great coffee and excellent oat milk lattes. My only sorrow is when I sought to buy a can of coffee, the barista who made my latte said she had used the Iris blend. Apparently, it's a blend of two beans, one of which is fair trade and the other isn't! Such a pity, since we do not buy non-fair trade coffee especially when they come from Africa. 
But it's a truly great coffee shop and for those who are looking for a wonderful cafe, there are ample vegan choices for cookies and such as well! 
The bathrooms are gender neutral, which is really great, but just be prepared to wait for a long while!"

I got their house office and I have to admit I didn't like it.. it was super bitter even with all the sugar and cream I had to add to it.. it didnt' really help. The decor and vibe of the place is a place I could see myself hanging out though.

We had called ahead to ask about gluten free items and were told they had three things. When we got there it appeared they didn't and asked the barista, and he said ""no they don't have that today"". We told him that we had just called and were told they did. He then said ""oh, ok, then these muffins are GF"". I asked if he knew that it was just saying it, and then we went off to ask someone else. This obviously gave me no confidence I could trust anything he said. I ordered just a drip coffee and got something more like tea, and also with some sort of herbal infusion. In an area so densely packed with coffee houses, I'd look for some place else."

67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2018-09-09,3.0,"TL;DR - Good coffee, quirky venue, great location but a little pricy.

This place is perfectly located for a stop if you're in DUMBO for the Brooklyn Flea... it's only a couple of minutes' walk away but means you can escape the crowds. It's also at one end of the park, so great for starting or ending a walk.

The venue is pretty huge - a vast converted space with lots of nice touches in their decor. Despite the size though, there's not a huge amount of seating so I could image you'd struggle to get a seat at busy times.

They sell their own coffee beans here, but we just came in to recharge with a couple of lattes. The drinks were very nice - not the best coffee I've ever had, but certainly not far off - but they were also some of the more expensive coffees we had whilst in NY. 

There's a bit of a hipster vibe here but it's not insufferable - they were very welcome to a pair of old guys like us. We'd definitely come back here on a future visit to Brooklyn."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-04-29,1.0,"I thought I'd try this place this morning because I've heard good things about their coffee. 

I ordered an ice coffee with oat milk. When taking a sip is tasted sour as if it turned... I didn't think much of it because they could've have given me bad coffee or milk but an hour later I got sick... 

obviously not coming back here."

When I went there was only one lonely slice of vegan lemon cake :(  Maybe it's a sign for me to come back and check it out again"
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2018-12-26,1.0,"Well it's a coffee roaster/shop. Their roasts are generally good. 

However the coffee shop portion leaves a lot to be desired. Service is most often surly for some reason I can't figure out. They only offer one size of coffee and ""forget"" to put out the sugar syrup and stuff for guests. 

As for the space it's big and airy, but the music is really really loud. Too loud to work, certainly, plus the concrete and rusty metal aesthetic lends itself to annoying echoey tones that are grating. 

If they weren't right by my house with relatively few other options there is no way I'd (occasionally) drop in."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-05-02,4.0,"What attracted me to this coffee shop was the large space with natural light.

I had some Brooklyn Roasting coffee prior to coming here and it was good. Then I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I popped in. Not having pour over service was a big let down for me, as this coffee shop has about 20 types of beans. These people are overachievers for sure. Phew! So I ordered a cortado and sat down on one of the many comfy couches. This place is big!

And then, while I was dreaming and looking outside the big windows (I love this space!), I see a power plant right next door. What? The barista didn't ask if I wanted radiation with my coffee. Minus another star, for performing an MRI without my permission. How is this possible?

Whatever. I am not coming back here. I am giving them a star back because the place is super cool, but man, they should give people lead suits while they order. Peace out."

Lots of space to read, work or meet with a friend or coworker. 
Oh and they carry what are probably one of the better croissants I've had in Brooklyn (it's an art that rarely makes it across the water).
Staff here is lovely : ) definitely worth checking out if you're in the area and need a pick me up."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2017-04-24,3.0,"Brooklyn Bridge entrance area has an old industrial/new commercial feel.  The place is crawling with tourists and newly built clean condos.   Warehouse mystery has been replaced by antiseptic capitalism.

This coffee shop, sitting near the water, has no water views, due to a yard of electrical conduits positioned like alien 
Thai stupa, and it surprisingly has no patio or outside seating.

Brooklyn roasters is a good sized newly outfitted space with communal work tables, a few comfy antique couches, big leather chairs, and an upstairs loft with more
Quieter option. 

The roast options on my visit came in 4 options.  I chose Dark and Stormy - dark and bright with a clap of thunder, as it was the darkest roast.  It was clean, caffeine big, sultry and if woodsy.   A cup was a reasonable $3.

The crowd was that upwardly mobile together sort of Brooklyn type, self assured, cutely dressed, insular. 

I just just wish they had a patio. 

Atmosphere - cute warehouse thing.  
    Crowded with busy Apple lap toppers.
Coffee - really good 
Not sure if they have food."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2018-05-30,4.0,"I stopped by while visiting Dumbo for a quick pick-me-up. I decided to go with the nitro cold brew which was fantastic. The price was pretty on par for a nitro cold brew, and the quality was great so there is nothing to complain about there. 

The atmosphere inside was nice and cool and very spacious. It had a hip, laid-back vibe which I really enjoyed. It was a nice relaxing stop after walking around in the hot sun all day.

The barista that took my order wasn't the friendliest--she sort of rolled her eyes at me when I asked for light ice in my cold brew the second after pouring. I normally ask before, but as soon as I asked for a cold brew she started pouring so I didn't have any time. A causal eye roll isn't a huge deal, of course. But it's just a little off-putting. However, there was another barista behind the counter who I was asking a few questions about the coffee beans for sale and he was very nice and helpful. 

Overall I was a fan of this place and would swing by again the next time I come to Brooklyn."

67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2018-04-26,5.0,I love this place. The coffee is delicious. The staff is super friendly. The owners are amazing and so humble. Good place to come sit enjoy a cup of coffee. Pretty big coffee spot place and the design is different from any other coffee house I have been to. It's close to my job and right next to Brooklyn bridge park. Enjoy coffee with an amazing view.
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-09-08,5.0,"I come here near daily - 45 minutes commute because I love the airy space, consistently superb coffee, friendly service, music mix, ample functioning outlets, working bathrooms (yeah, they are out of order often in an unnamed chain). The surrounding area is scenic. It is not a defacto hangout for ""disturbed"" people. So I can actually get my work done, relax as needed. A popular spot for socializing, business chats, tourists.  

Now they've added more sandwiches which is nice when you don't want to walk outside for that. An interesting bookstore next door. Fliers that give me a headsup to local events."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2017-01-24,4.0,"Doesn't get more Brooklyn and drinking coffee in DUMBO.

It's a little bit off the beaten path, but it's worth it if you want a specialty drink, to buy beans, or just to hang out at their many tables. The decor itself is worth the trip.

Pro-tip: West Elm on Main has a Brooklyn Roasting inside of it if that's more convenient for you."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-01-04,4.0,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. It's quite a large coffee shop, so the seats are easy to come by. The location is off on a side street, so it may be hard to navigate too if you're first timer in the Dumbo area. The coffee (latte) we ordered was pretty good. Definitely would come back to try another roast."
67,brooklyn-roasting-company-brooklyn-2,2019-04-29,1.0,"I live upstairs in the same building in Dumbo and I found them very unkind and disappointing. I got locked myself out this morning without phone, I went in to ask if they have landline I could use to contact my husband. This girl at the counter just said ""you can ask strangers on the street"" then she laughed. I mean.. is this necessary? I understand that they don't have landline but I don't think she has to take a piss out of my situation. Instead I went to dry cleaning shop on Front Street and they kindly let me use their phone. I wouldn't have coffee downstairs anymore, stupid attitude."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-12-13,5.0,"I love the idea of The Uncommons where you can come to play board games with your friends. It's interesting to try new games that you might not have purchased otherwise. 

It gets busy during the weekends and sometimes on weekdays, large groups reserve tables so there's less seating. There's free wifi and the last time I went I saw a sign that said students get a small discount. They also have snacks and drinks, but water is free of charge. Some board games have clearly been loved and used, so they might be missing a few pieces or look tattered, but the uncommons typically has more than one box for people to use."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2020-01-13,4.0,"Key tip: Call ahead and make a reservation before you go!

Fun game spot in the West Village! I came here with two friends on a Saturday afternoon and the wait was about 2 hours so be prepared to have another activity planned if you didn't make a reservation. We grabbed food around the corner while we waited. 

$5/ person for 1 hour and $10/ person for 3 hours. It would have been nice if they had a 2 hour option. 

Floor to ceiling games! They had a ton of options and you could also buy unused games if you want to. We played Life and What do you meme. You could definitely tell these games had been played many times. A few missing pieces here and there but not enough to make a difference in play.

We didn't order any food or drinks but they have beer and other snacks and beverages available."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2020-01-26,5.0,"Love this cute and nerdy spot! On my latest visit, I dropped in before Sunday brunch and tried out three different games with my partner. One hour of play ($5/hr per person) plus two coffee drinks was just under $20; I felt that was fair given it saved me the cost of purchasing at least one game I wasn't wild about. Atmosphere was chill, quiet."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-07-05,5.0,"The best board game cafe in the city with the largest collection and open late with wifi. It's pretty overwhelming to come here and decide on a game when you've never even seen 95% of them, but the staff here are super knowledgeable and can give you recommendations. Likewise, the customers that tend to come here are also nice and wouldn't mind giving you a few of their favorite suggestions. When we were trying to locate a specific game, the staff were able to point us to the right direction. 

Prices are very affordable. You can stay for just an hour or choose to buy a ""day pass"" which was only $10 (I am not sure if this price is only for weekdays because it seems too good to be true!). For students, it is $5. There is no pressure to buy drinks or food, you just have to pay for the table. 

It can get very crowded here and making a reservation is recommended, especially if you are coming here at night during the weekends. It is not an ideal place for studying as it can get rowdy."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-12-22,5.0,As my first Coffee & Table Top board games spot I must say I highly recommend this place. With a library of board games and card games it was an intresting thing to do in the middle of chilly Sunday. It a great spot to try out new games but also somewhere you can kill time and maybe lose track of time wIth all the fun your having. I went with a group of three and was charged $5 a person for an hr. We learned a new game and had a blast.
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-08-19,5.0,"Oh my god, I loved this place! It's a great place to grab a small bite to eat, grab a nice coffee or beer, and meet up friends to play games. It's this cute, cozy shop that's perfect for a little ""family game night"" type event. 

I played this cooperative survival game called Ravine. It's a game where you're stranded on an island and need to work together to stay alive until being rescued. I wouldn't have discovered it without the help of one of the employees. They were very kind and I'd recommend this place to anybody. It's such a wholesome place!"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-12-12,5.0,"This place is amazing! It makes my top 5 places to visit in NY, coming from a complete nerd, that is :P

Just like foodies want to go to the most reputable restaurants in a new area, if you're a nerd on vacation, you probably want to see the unique fandom destinations that New York is famous for.

I can't say whether or not The Uncommons has a huge reputation outside of NY but I know that it should. If you're a tabletop gamer, a card gamer, if rpgs, board games, trivia and the like are your thing, this is the place to be.

They have it all. They have an extensive inventory of board and card games to play from Settlers of Catan to Superfight, from Disney to DC, from exploding cats to sushi cats, and everything in-between.

And to top it off it's also a cafe? You know real gamers run on coffee! They don't allow outside food (I found out when I got stopped trying to eat a cheesecake lol) but they do have a few things to munch on their own menu beyond their coffee selection.

There's no fee to sit and have a drink and get your munchies on, but if you would like to get some gameplay in and have a go at any of the inventory they have available for use, it's just $5 an hour, at least on the day that I went. You can of course bring your own games and decks in to play as well and use their space, also the same fee.

As for concerns of being kicked out if you don't play a game--I didn't hear that from the two men manning the shop that night. I think it's reasonable if you didn't buy anything at all as their tables are essential to the sale of gametime--but asking you to vacate if you've purchased food or drink seems incredibly bad form. Just know that I didn't experience that on my visit.

If you have kids and you're wondering if it's worth it to bring them, think about it--it's cheaper than any other attraction's cover charge and kids pay $10 just to get into a bouncy house at the mall. It's $20 for a round of mini golf here in Hawaii and that's only so entertaining and no freedom to explore different things to do. At a tabletop gaming parlor, you can spend quality time with your kid that actually exercises their brain, teaching them strategy, and having fun all the while.

Yes, you might be saying--well I can do that at home with my own board games! Yes, you can. But do you have the freedom to always choose new and different games to play with a library of hundreds of games? And  when you're out buying a game--how do you know you'll even like it? How many board games have you bought for your family that you don't even touch or have only played once? If that's the case, why spend $30 on a single gameplay and then shelf it forever when you can spend $5 on a single gameplay with the perk of figuring out whether you love it or not and if you don't, put it back and grab another one.

See? Worth it.

Lastly, if you really love a board game, did I mention they also sell them? They have a separate inventory of sealed and new games to purchase if you really like the one you're playing or you're searching for a game no one else carries. I bought a Rick and Morty trivia game that had only *just* been released and I couldn't find at Walmart for example.

In any case, way to go guys. This was a great venture to start and you made the experience enjoyable and worth the 2-hour wait for our Blue Note show down the street. I will definitely always visit every time I come back to NY!"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-12-20,4.0,"I came here for the first time to play Cards Against Humanity with a big group. They have two rooms, a main room when you enter, and a second room off to the side with 3 large communal tables perfect for groups. This is the room we sat in, and despite being right up against a window in the winter I was nice and warm- love places with good heat!

They offer beer but no liquor. They also have coffee, tea, kombucha, lots of beverages that aren't booze, as well as a small menu with things like eggs, croissants, mozzarella sticks. You can't buy a beer for someone else, and when that side room has every seat full maneuvering your way out of a packed picknic table backed up against a wall is a real pain, so we tended to go in groups, which overcrowded the one bathroom they had, whose toilet wasn't flushing so great- but other then that it's a great spot. 

I will say their chai lattes are expensive, $5 for a small, $7 for a large. It was also luke warm and not particularly good, so I'd say choose something else.

They have small pocket size games up front for sale, the kind of stuff that makes cute gifts.

Overall I had a blast, and they have what looks like hundreds of games to choose from!"

However, I paid $10 and my friend who's a CUNY student paid $5, we went in just a little passed 5pm but they asked us to leave by 7pm which was only 2 hours so I'm not too sure how I feel about going back tbh. There's quite a few selections of board games but none that I've heard off except like 4 of them. Wish they had Rummy-O but that wasn't there, it'd be cool. They sell some too. A few seats and tables and try to make reservation if you have more than 2 people because it does get pretty busy. Didn't get anything to eat or drink there because it's a bit pricey. Clean and organized place tho, the restroom was decently clean too. Staff was alright, and walking distance to the 6 train."

We weren't sure what the place was all about at first, but it had a super friendly atmosphere and friendly people in it. Sat down, got some board games, and played for hours while talking to people around me also there. Have made it a point to come back every single time I could that I've been in the city and will continue to do so!"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-07-09,5.0,This place has walls and stacks of games both opened and unopened. I liked that there was plenty to choose from and try out without having to create your own home collection. There are also games for purchase if people liked. Pieces are all in the games we played and seating area was conducive for both small and larger groups to play games. There was good selection of drinks and food to keep us staying for as long as we liked.
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-10-24,4.0,"Friends said the drinks were okay, but after walking in, the real attraction is from the multitude of games! They're stacked so high and have every type of game imaginable - available for rent or purchase.

Whatcha gonna play?"

Came here with 4 friends and we spent 3 hours on a busy Sunday afternoon. The place did not have air conditioner which made us a tad bit sleepy. The charges were very reasonable and the selection of games was good. A tad disappointed some of the games were not in the best condition and with missing instructions."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-03-24,5.0,"I came on a weekend, it was $10 for 3 hours of play, per person OR $5 for one hour of play, per person--that isn't bad at all since you get to pick from a huge load of games. It's great if you wanna test out a game before actually buying it. They also sell brand new games in case you wanted to buy any.

They do have some food and drink options, but nothing too big--i mean, you are there to play a game after all. So the food options are more like snacks or small appetizers. Week days are cheaper, $5 per person. Not sure for how many hours yet, but I plan on finding out.

We were seated quite fast, too. You can reserve a table, but im also not so sure how to do that yet. They also have some type of event calendar at the front register. Great place to just hang out with friends or family and play a board game.

A plus about this place is that they smell good-- like food and coffee. Not like other places where it smells like sweaty men that havent showered for a week."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-05-26,4.0,"Really cool place to try out some board games for a few hours!

They have as many games as you could possibly imagine and the table rates as reasonable (5$ per person per hour or $10 for 3 hours). 

Haven't tried any of the food, but the coffee from Brooklyn roasters and beer selection are pretty good and the prices are about average. 

The space is pretty cramped and it can be tough to be comfortable, but it's understandable given the area. Due to the cramped space it can also be kind of tough to hear everyone talk if you're trying to explain a new game. But if you're a board game fan in manhattan this is the best place you're going to find to try some new ones!"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-05-13,4.0,So had to do a stop in the city and needed a pick me up in the cold rain. So as I walk I see this place.

Definitely try this place especially if you like board games as you can see
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-11-15,5.0,"I wish I had found this place earlier!  This place has a great selection of board games.  There is something for everyone.  They not only have the original version of a game but multiple extension packs and versions.  Among other games, they have Ticket to Ride, Munchkin, Codenames, and more.  You can book either 1 hour or 3 hours of play on weekends.  They also have a good variety of beer to quench your thirst while you play."

We tried playing a collaborative deck building game that was suggested, but after an hour of set up and figuring it out - we wasted 1/3 of our three hour window. Do not order food here under any circumstance. The food was a joke. Paid $10 for pigs in a blanket and tater tots. The serving size was absurd, and this place should be ashamed to even call it snack size. The tables are too small for gaming in my opinion and overall it was a lackluster experience."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-09-08,4.0,"Fun, casual hang out place with some snacks and tons of games. It's located in an easy-going, fun area with eating options for before or after meeting.

Edibles we had:
pigs in a blanket
Pierogi (slightly dry on outside)

Great to hang out with friends or for a date. One can spend 45 minutes here, or two hours, depending on company."

When we arrived, they had only fired one draft and then promptly kicked us out of the store, saying that there would not be any more drafts for the day. It left a bad after taste in my mouth.

68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-06-10,5.0,"Flash back to 7th grade nerdville. 
This place has about a million games.  Things I've never heard of.   They also have the classics like monopoly, clue, battleship, and into the more role playing games.

Monday through Thursday game play is $5 a person for unlimited play.   Weekends the cost is $10 a person per hour.   

This place is delightfully funky.  We saw a poster of fictional beer labels from Laverne and Shirley's Schotts to Drew Carey's Buzz Brew.

Importantly, this place is a great place for a cup of coffee.  The morning I came in was surprisingly chill.  The music also seemed to evoke a 70s weird pop culture sensibility.

According to the barista, there is a waiting list on the weekends.  She said cold days the place can fill up early.  

Drink situation - fantastic coffee bar 
Food situation - bagels, pizza 

Atmosphere - geek den 
Coffee - wonderful"

Simple, compact setting with several board games up for use as well as many others available for sale. 
Enjoyed Jaipur, an engaging two player game, for an hour for a cover charge of $5 per person. 
They also have a small F&B menu and the mango smoothie is worth a try."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-12-22,5.0,Stopped by on a Monday night around 8 and the place was surprisingly packed. Must have been the NYU kids taking a break from studying for finals haha the workers were are very friend and explain to you how the place works when they see you walk in. It's 5$ for an hour of play or you can pay 10$ for 3 hours up front. A bunch of games to choose from and overall a great place to chill with some friends.
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-07-21,5.0,"This is a great place to play some board games with friends. It gets busy on the weekends but they take down names and will call when a table opens up. You can pay $5 for an hour per person or $10 for three hours on weekends. 

They have a great slection of games and the people who work at the store are super friendly. They're always great at recommending games and finding new ones depending on what you like to play. It's also a great place to try out new games before you buy them. The store is cozy and inviting. The clientele is a mix of game aficionados and people who like some light hearted fun. Great activity when you're tired of walking around the city!"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2020-01-30,1.0,"They screwed up and made me and my friends wait 3 hours. We spent our time at the bar next door and went home afterwards. Don't bother coming here, they don't care for your patronage"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-03-07,4.0,"My friends and I were looking for a place to hang out on a Saturday night, but we didn't want to go to your average bar nor did we want to wait in long lines to get into places that have pool tables and shuffleboards.  A Yelp search brought us to a BOARD GAME CAFE.  Whaaaaat?

Even though they serve beer, this place is NOT a bar by any definition.  They could do a better job of creating a more nightlifey atmosphere with the lighting and music, especially for the late-night crowd, but that might not be the audience they're targeting.  They serve coffee drinks, smoothies, beers, and cafe snacks like muffins and pastries.

Seating is mostly communal, though there are a few smaller 2-person tables.  The walls are stacked floor to ceiling with just about every board game you can think of.  They even have certain games for sale (new ones, of course).

When we came on a Saturday night around 9:45pm, the price was $5 per person per hour ($20 per hour for my 3 friends and me), or $40 to play until closing time at midnight.  The price is definitely reasonable, but I felt there should be a discount for larger groups because individual play time is shortened if there are more players."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-07-06,5.0,"My new go-to spot for some daytime (or nighttime) fun in this part of town! I've already visited twice this week to meet up different friends that I haven't seen in a while.

$10/pp gets you 3 hours at a table. Wide variety of games to choose from--some that you know, others that you haven't heard of but are definitely fun to try out!

It's cramped inside and it's a real possibility you may share a table with another small group. It seems like this place is always crowded so be prepared to wait or maybe even not be able to play that day. 

They have food and drinks (alcoholic + non) for sale and some small bites. Staff is really well trained at moving people in and out and maximizing their space--definitely not an easy feat in a place that does the volume they do. 

I'll definitely keep returning for some underrated fun!"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-01-31,5.0,"Great board game cafe with a huge selection of games to choose from. Games are stacked up on the walls all the way up to the ceilings, and even more by the counter! Good for all ages, and they also have drinks and some food as well if you get hungry or thirsty while playing. Gets crowded really easily, especially on weekends, so arrive early or make a reservation if you are coming with a sizable group. Otherwise, you will be stuck having to wait for hours on the waitlist. Some of the games are pretty tattered and may be missing some pieces here and there, but still manageable. The tables are really close together, so it may feel cramped, but with the amount of customers they get, it's understandable why they really needed to optimize the space and squeeze in as many tables as they could. 

Price: $10 per person for 3 hours, or $5 per hour."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-07-06,1.0,"My friends and I have been coming here regularly for prerelease for the past 5 years. I was here 7/5 for the 8pm prerelease, and unfortunately the experience was a real let down. It appeared the judges/workers were playing in the event, rather then really managing it. The runtime for the first 3 rounds went into overtime without any calling of time and enforcement. With the 4th round ending extremely fast by 1:30am.

On your site, it is 1.5 pack per win, and 1 pack for no wins. I went 2-2-0 and was given only 1 pack. The prize payout seemed real off. 

Unfortunately we'll probably have to find another game shop for prerelease, and bring our party of 8 friends(from their 30 attendance that night)."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-01-08,5.0,Came in to visit the local shop my brother always goes to. He loves it here. I think it's pretty cool. Very warm and cozy. Gives it a nice homey feel. Really busy. There was a hour wait for a table when we came in. Would love to visit again.
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-07-16,4.0,"I came here a long time back with a few friends and we loved the place!  We actually came by on a random rainy weekday afternoon and didn't expect it to be as busy as it was but when we saw the crowd in here we were pleasantly surprised!  The venue was somewhat small but there was still enough seating at that time and the crowd was only a testament to how popular the place is.

We all ended up getting coffee and small snacks (all wonderful) and then started our search for a game.  Obviously, all the popular options were taken by the time we were there but we found some familiar choices and the collection was huge.  By far the best part of the day was when we asked one of the staff members about a game suggestion and they took the time to walk us through/teach us one -- that I have now since forgotten!  Everyone was friendly and patient -- even the other game-players -- which was a nice change of culture from a majority of the other popular NYC hangouts.  

Overall, would highly recommend spending an afternoon here with some friends -- especially if you're looking to learn some new games!"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-09-17,3.0,"The Uncommons is a board game cafe located just south of Washington Square Park. Came on my birthday with a group of 6 friends on a Saturday. The cafe was quite packed but we managed to get a table to sit down.

PROS:
Huge selection of board games that you can borrow and play! there were at least 75+ board games you can pick and choose. We naturally gravitated towards playing Settlers of Catan. 

CONS:
I am not a huge fan of their pricing policy - as a cafe you don't usually expect to pay in order to stay in their cafe - going rate is $10 for 3 hours and $5 for 1 hour during weekends. Had I known earlier I would've brought my own board games and played it in Washington Square park. Drinks were also pretty pricey - we got a few small mango smoothies and those cost $5.50. Pretty big ripoff since there wasn't anything too special.

Board games were also very battered and tattered - understandable considering probably hundreds and thousands of people have borrowed them. Air conditioning in the annex room where we were at was either turned off or broke down, so it did get quite musty inside. 

OVERALL:
Not a huge fan of their pay-to-stay policy, but they do have a huge selection of board games to play."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-03-26,4.0,"Great idea for a place!

Useful small-but-meticulous cafe has everything you may want to snack on or drink while playing the gazillion games on the wall. No qualms about the prices (after what everyone was going on about, I expected them to be exorbitant!)- they seem 'regular' to me, as this isn't a restaurant! Think college/convenience snack cafe. With a surprisingly hugely complicated beer list, another huge selection of refrigerator drinks or barista drinks, and chips/snacks galore.

Really impressed w the thorough organization & explanation of everything, especially the host/reservation manager!

Really tight quarters (we are not huge people)- if you know your expected table, I'd observe whether the guy next to you is yelling the entire time or not. The really really close quarters PLUS know-it-all yeller next to you makes it difficult to try to process reading the complicated game rules. I had my ear plugs in the entire time, and could barely focus on anything but the obnoxious yeller next to me. Seriously, he was shouting at the top of his lungs the entire time we were there. (Just him, the rest of the place was pretty politely not crazily loud.)

So, I'd try this place again, off-peak. Maybe then it'll be better!

On the weekend, it's $5/hr or something else for 3 hrs. Once your hr is ending, they give you the option to extend. They'll call when your place is ready (they even give you a specific time estimate, which I LOVE), so if you answer the call, they'll reserve it for 15m, otherwise will go down the wait list."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-07-30,4.0,"New prices:
$10 weekdays unlimited, $5 for 1 hr on weekends, $10 for 3 hrs on weekends.
3.5/5 mainly because I don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth anymore.

The good:
Board game cafe still a unique concept. Some dessert shops have board games and other games now, but Uncommons' brand image IS board games and it's built quite a following. I remember the good old days when I discovered new games and bonded with friends over games I've never heard of before. 

The bad:
Partially our fault - one time we spent 4 hours playing just Poker and another time my group of friends and I spent 3 hours just playing Risk. Really should've bought the games ourselves and camped out somewhere else. Plus...this place is super cramped. I suggest Uncommons try to expand their space or add another location.

A long time ago, it was $5 on weekdays and $10 on weekends, unlimited play regardless. Now, the rules have changed (see top). Good thing is, it'll be easier for you to get a table if you come past 2 pm. Bad thing is, a long time ago, I could play for 5 hours for $10 on weekends, but this time, only 3.

Another con is that what once used to be head-to-toe, wall-to-wall board games to play is now half (or a third?) board games for SALE, limiting the number of board games available for customers to play.

Uncommons sometimes has events and tables reserved, so they should honestly put them flat out on a calendar on their website, so potential customers can plan accordingly. 

Can't speak to how the coffee or food tastes because I've ever only had the water.

P.S. Friendships will be destroyed. No joke. You have been warned."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-04-14,4.0,"I came here with a group of friends with no expectations because I had no idea what I was walking into. Card/board games aren't a hobby of mine, so I'm glad I tried this place. I had a blast! 

It's very packed in here and they have a seemingly great assortment of card games, board games, etc. 

It's $5/hr or $10/3 hours."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-11-21,5.0,"This place is a must for board game lovers - I swear I could spend the whole night here. The entrance is inexpensive, there are tons of games, and they have nice refreshments (amazing ice cream sandwiches during the summer) - love the relaxed vibe here."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-01-05,2.0,"Good luck trying to get a table at the Uncommons. 

From the outside it looked so promising, like one of the nicer game stores: well-lit, spacious, and tons of game options. So even though the wait was 45 minutes to an hour and a half, we were content to put our names down...and wait...and wait...and wait...and wait.

An 1 hour and 25 minutes passes without a single phone call or missed call or text message, so we circle back to see where we are on the wait list. It turns out they crossed our name off the list and gave away multiple seats to people who came after us on their wait list, including moments before we arrived. 

The two male staff managing the ""waitlist"" asked if I was sure I gave them the right phone number. Uh, I definitely did cause when I asked you to read it back to me you acted like I was inconveniencing you by making this request. 

After realizing they gave away our table, you would expect that they'd at least apologize. As Cher from Clueless would say, as if. They said it would be another 45 minutes for a table and left us waiting without even an apology."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2017-09-10,5.0,"I honestly wish there were more places like this. Instead of bars that have free board games (that usually have missing pieces), this spot specializes in the games themselves. Saturday evening, there was a 35 minute wait for a table - so they take down your number and give a call once the table is ready.

Got the call 30 minutes after putting my name down. Once there, they give you an explanation of the rules (what to grab and asking for assistance). For $10 per person (weekends), you get unlimited use of the games for as long as you want (closes 1am). They also have plenty of food and drink for a place this small. Ordered a beer while playing ($7), which wasn't too egregious. The playable games aren't in the best condition, but all the pieces are there. Also, lots of different options depending on how many people you have.

Service is fantastic - the people working here and quick and helpful. Place itself is cramped, but not too bad since you're sitting down for most of it. Great place for friends, dates or the like."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-02-18,5.0,"The uncommons is THE hot spot for board games on the south end of Manhattan. I work for Gigamic, and we have visited here several times because our products are popular with the cafe crowds. I ordered up a latte and it was crafted with the same expertise as their sister store Hex and Co uptown. The almond croissant was flaky and flavorful, and the crowd is very lively. Great staff. Recommended!"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-08-06,4.0,"It is exactly what it is: a place to rent a table and play from their wide selection of board games. Maybe do some research beforehand to figure out what you want to play cause choosing one can take a while. And then learning it can take a while. Get a jumpstart. 

They have a decent beer selection, and they have food. But the food looks like it's fresh from the microwave so I opted out."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2017-08-18,5.0,"Lots of cool games here! Great date night! :) it's also super affordable! $5 unlimited time.

FYI, the smoothies are pretty sweet."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-07-16,5.0,it is an iconic board game cafe next to Washington Square Park and I have stopped by multiple times in my life. It has a great selection of boardgames to sell and to play onsite. The site is bit small and one needs to reserve to play here
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-04-21,4.0,"Amazing for board game and card game lovers!

This is a great place for games and they have a whole collection of all the latest games and many that you could try! Groups can easily spend 3 hours here which is why often at uncommons there is a waiting if you go on a Saturday or a Sunday but there's a lot to do on mcdougal street so it's not all that bad.

Don't waste your money on food because it's strictly average, from the multiple experiences I have had. Another slight con is the restrictive feel of the place but unfortunately in Manhattan that's the best someone can do with the room they have.

Overall great experience and amazing place."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-05-17,5.0,"Think of this place as the semi-hipster, kinda nerdy, board-game version of Barcade. (Note: if you're not familiar with Barcade, that's another bar with a variety of old school arcade and machine games) 

Located in the heart of The Village on the Lower East Side, right by Washington Square Park and NYU, this spot gets packed at night and definitely on the weekends. For day drinkers like me, the place is conveniently rather empty and easy to find seats.

Once you enter, aside from the massive arrays of board game boxes reaching from floor to ceiling, you'll also see the counter right in front of you. That's where you order from their small bar menu and pay. Aside from whatever you'd expect from a small cafe, this joint offers an impressive collection of craft beers that I definitely appreciated. 

I went on a Wednesday afternoon around 3:30 and went with an IPA and then a Delirium Tremens. 
I also ordered Pigs In a Blanket and Mozzarella Arepas which were more than amazing . 

$5 fee per person to play games from Mon-Thurs to stay as long as you want. 
$10 fee per person  Fri-Sun for a limited number of hours.

Definitely worth it! They also have a whole side of unopened, sealed games that you can purchase. 
I'll be back ;D"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-05-28,4.0,"I've never been of the mindset that I wanted to rent table space to play board games. But at the same time, I understand the need to pay the rent and purchase items to sell, i.e., food, drink, and other games. With that in mind, The Uncommons does what it does pretty well. If you're going, try to allot larger periods of time to get the most bang for the buck, and try to get table space in the main room, where you'll get air conditioning instead of ceiling fans. The games list is quite impressive, and you'll find everything from straightforward board games to fun social games to top of the line epic strategy games. There's a decent variety of drinks for purchase as well as food. I didn't order any food while I was there, but several of my gaming companions ordered the chicken tenders, and boy did they smell good.  

So I guess if you're like me with that mindset thing, keep in mind you're paying for the conveniences of a wide variety of games from which to choose as well as food and drink for which you don't have to do the foraging or cooking, and from that aspect, it's a pretty good deal."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-06-24,5.0,"This place turns me into a kid in a candy shop. When its busy its super busy but if you can get yourself a table with some friends, I promise you, you will be having a good ol time. Add a little bit a wine to the mix and BAM! there is no other place like this. You have to pay by the hour and its not so bad in my opinion. 

No honestly I wish there was one closer to home but alas there isn't. I love coming to this place to just relax and chill and kick some @$$ on some board games. Everyone should come here once and give it a shot. Its well worth it. Enjoy! You won't regret it."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-02-10,5.0,"What a great place to go when near NYU when you're looking for a place to hang out with friends or on a date that is NOT just going to a bar or cafe. (But don't worry, they do serve beer/wine and Brooklyn Roast coffee! So you can do both!) They have a HUGE selection of games, anything you're thinking of or not thinking of is there. The staff is also happy to offer suggestions depending on what you're in the mood for and the number of players. The one downside is there is limited seating and when there's a polar vortex outside and seems like everyone is looking for a place to hibernate, this place fills up quick and there's a 90-120 min wait... given that people can stay for forever. Overall, I thought this was really fun and cool! And it's not as nerdy as you think. I'm quite normal. :P"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-04-11,5.0,"I wish you guys an eternity of business.

This is a gem. A wonderful idea, brilliantly executed, and so desperately needed. I can spend endless hours upon hours in this cafe. The Uncommons serves a delicious variety of treats, coffee, tea, craft beers, and wine. All of which can be consumed while you are endlessly entertained by their unlimited supply of board games (both obscure and mainstream. All I can say is thank you!"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-04-04,5.0,"Do you wanna play a game?? 

What be ""uncommon"" would be for you to walk in here without finding a decent game you want to buy or play, especially when they are literally from the floor to the ceiling - no really - there are boxes of games TOUCHING the ceiling!  

The Uncommons has been hosting the Game of Thrones card tournaments for a few years now.  Since my husband is an avid player, he frequents here quite often.  The space has wooden tables and chairs that his group can occupy, and there's a little bar to get some caffeine in ya with something sweet like a muffin or cookies.  The vibe is like a friend's apartment on game night and no one plans on going home any time soon.  Whether you prefer cards or board games, or you're a strategist or great at bluffing, there's something fun here for everyone and children of all ages!

What's really UnCommon is that there aren't more places like this around the NYC metro."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-06-12,5.0,"For what it is, it's the best.  I'd already been to a similar place in another city and was pleasantly surprised when I came across this one in NYC.

Decently large board room cafe that lets you in the front door and play to your heart's content with just $5.  They serve basic drinks (alcoholic and non), plus both cold and warmed-up snacks for people who're in for the long haul or just want to enjoy some munchies with their games.  Pretty decent selection considering.

More importantly, they have a HUGE amount of games available, of all different types and categories (strategy, memory, team-based, individual, etc. etc. etc.).  The staff there are super helpful and will suggest games based on your tastes, group size and interests.

The one and only downside is that since it's not exactly massive, on weekends it tends to fill up pretty quick.  There's an actual waiting list which can stretch pretty far; first time I tried to go was on a Saturday, and half the place was booked for a huge DnD tournament.  Was told I'd have to wait a full hour just to get two seats.  Simplest solution is to just avoid the weekend.

Definitely intend to go back as soon as possible, during the week, with the right group of buddies."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-03-04,5.0,"Fun and large variety of games. Some of the games are quite heavily used, but not unusable. Good vibes and wholesome fun. Prices of drinks/food weren't overpriced which I found surprising considering it's theoretically including price of playing the games."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-03-13,4.0,"This place was fine. Just fine. They have countless games which was awesome!! The cafe menu was small and the food was ehh. We ordered the pizza and the arepas. The pizza seemed microwaved - really created the ""board games in your friend's basement"" vibe. the arepa was actually very tasty, but small for the price. The drink menu was adequate considering they advertise as a cafe and not a bar. 
Be sure to make a reservation as the place was very crowded (on a monday!!).
The game we selected was missing instructions and some game pieces, which is to be expected out of communal games...but still worth noting. 

Despite the hiccups I'm rating this place a 4 because it is a novelty. You don't see many of these and it was a great alternative to a typical bar night. It was good wholesome fun where everyone felt included and welcome."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-06-11,2.0,"No cash??? Loved coming here for my weekly shopping spree but upon checking out shortly before 1130pm last night, the blue haired gentleman said that they were no longer accepting cash. Ughh. Guess I'll have to take it elsewhere."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-08-28,2.0,"Cool to have a game store with a library to choose from, but the staff here is not always the most welcoming. They are particularly weird about selling beer.

Once, they wouldn't accept my wife's NYCID (a city issued ID) as proof of age. She was 28 at the time btw.

Another time, my friend tried to grab a beer from the fridge to take to the counter to pay for it. They told him to step out from behind the counter in a stern tone. This fridge looks like a self-serve fridge and is not behind a counter.

Just a bummer"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-07-27,4.0,"Pretty cool board game shop. It's probably one of the premier stores in the city to get a board game. The walls are literally stacked to the ceiling with games. The staff are friendly enough but it's a bit of a tight squeeze in the store, especially when there are lots of patrons. The pricing on the games are the suggested retail price usually so that means you can probably buy them online for a bit cheaper than what they are selling it for. But if you need a quick fix for a game, this place will probably have it. I like to go in there and look around sometimes. If you're in the area I'd check it out."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-03-07,5.0,"I had such a great time at Uncommons! Good coffee $4-6, amazing unlimited play of board games for $5, and interesting beers, like the Java Beer of OB, Espresso and Chocolate (NB: Only allowed 2 beers per person...prevent drunken Monopoly fights!?). 

Food and drinks are all counter service. 
Super comfy & sweet to chill out in. 

Was thoroughly wowed by the vast selection of games available from old school to brand new - My date and I played our childhood faves; Headbandz, Guess Who, Scattegories, and some newer trivia ones and a very new looking one called What Do You Meme! Other people playing more complicated card and magic games. 

I will definitely be back to the the Unicorn Glitterfk Ghiradelli White Hot Chocolate whilst playing the Unicorn Board game. Yes I am cheesey. I love it!!! 

I love also they have hooks everywhere to hang up your coats, scarves and bags. Some tables WERE reserved for NYC board game club at 7pm, but there was a second room to hide out in. Perfect snow day spot. Thank you!!!"
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2018-03-20,5.0,"Guys. This is amazing. Grab a friend or two and come play a game. All you have to do is pay a cover of $5 and then you order whatever drink you want and have a great time! 

They have an unmatched selection of games to choose from. Some to purchase and some to play. The space is very spacious to play games but I'm sure during the weekends it fills up quickly.

Regardless, this is a place to visit. Very fun, something different, and a great business to support."
68,the-uncommons-new-york,2019-08-12,5.0,"This was such a cool place! They were friendly and accomodating with my large group, even when the place was jammed...The atmosphere was cool, had a ton of great games to play and buy...Even grabbed a beer and some snacks. Great time."
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2020-05-04,5.0,Staff is always friendly. The drinks are usually always on point and the pastries are great. Def a spot to go to anytime of the day!
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2019-10-01,4.0,"Stopped in from a friends review, and got an iced mocha. Absolutely loved the balance of sweet and espresso, no syrupy taste which was much appreciated. Great ambiance, friendly staff, and is near the subway. Not much seating but it keeps it less crowded that way I feel so no complaints from me. This was a great little find, and will always recommend for people to stop in for their caffeine fixes!"
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2019-10-20,5.0,"Nicest guy around with really strong, tasty iced coffee.  They have multiple options for milk so I was able to enjoy my beverage without distress.  They also have confections, I had the salted dark chocolate cookies (dense and delicious). Nice place to ppl watch as well. I'll be back."
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2019-12-05,4.0,"I stopped in Gasoline Alley on a whim, but was very pleasantly surprised by their iced oat latte (second only to my love La Colombe). Creamy, strong, and not watery. The whole package. I also really like their rotating selection of pastries. Had a great whole wheat croissant once, and a solid chocolate chip cookie. My go to spot now when I'm in the neighborhood - just wish there was a location closer to where I live!"
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2019-09-30,4.0,"I was trying to head to The Alley but I've given up when I realized how hard it is to get there with the N/W local trains suspended and the bus that's never coming, and when I saw Gasoline Alley Coffee right next to me. Once I spotted that salted caramel doughnut from Supermoon Bakery, the boba idea went out my brain. The iced coffee can be better but I was quite happy with my doughnut in one hand and the coffee in the other on this hot day. Even though the place doesn't have a lot of interior seating, it was nice to sit right outside the coffee shop on either side of two streets (the coffee shop has two exits facing two streets)."
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2019-02-27,3.0,"Ran in here for a coffee after a run the other morning and service was quick and friendly. A latte ran $4.50 with a $1.50!!!! up charge for oat milk. I have to be honest, I found that to be steep, even for the area, considering that the latte came in a pretty small size. The coffee itself was just fine. I'm generally a black like my soul coffee drinker but an occasional latte is how I treat myself and this really didn't feel like much of a treat. Maybe it would have tasted better if they upcharged me a reasonable $.75 for my admittedly hipster non-dairy milk choice, not totally sure.... 

I might give them another go to get a plain coffee/espresso but only once I'm a little less butt hurt about my $6 latte."
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2020-01-02,5.0,This place has excellent coffee. Very small not really the place to sit and stay but perfect to grab a quick cup.  Very busy in the morning as expected but the line moved quickly.
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2018-11-09,5.0,5 stars for the PERFECT temperature hot chocolate. Hot enough to keep my hands warm but not too hot where I have to wait to drink or scald my tongue. Also had great flavor and a cute design! The staff was very trendy and worked quickly. I definitely will stop by again!
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2019-10-10,2.0,"Bring back the good cookies. WTF. If it's not broken, don't fix it. If it's perfect, definitely leave it alone. Sadness."
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2020-02-18,5.0,"One of my absolute favorite morning stops. The staff are lovely, and remember your name every time. My chai latte takes about 45 seconds to appear in front of me. The location is very easily accessible, and has seating next to both entrances since there is limited seating inside.

69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2018-07-09,4.0,"This is a good place to stop by if you have some time to kill near NoHo to enjoy a coffee on a nice day.

That's exactly what I did on a hot summer day. I enjoyed a great iced coffee while sitting on the cafe's iconic red bench and reading some things on my phone. 

The inside window seats and the outdoor bench are fantastic spots for people watching, btw. I wouldn't come here if you need a seat guaranteed; there's not a ton of space.

The coolest part about this small coffee shop is that it connects Lafayette and Mulberry St. There are entrances and window seats on both sides."
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2018-12-01,4.0,A great find in a busy area. Gasoline alley is small. Don't plan on hanging here or posting up to get some work done. It's quite literally perfect for a pitstop to fuel up. Simple menu. They serve Intelligentsia coffee. If you're in the area and in looking for a solid coffee shop definitely bookmark Gasoline alley.
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2019-01-19,5.0,Gasoline Alley Coffee is the perfect stop for fantastic coffee. I love the size of the space and the large open windows and doors on either side. The architecture is industrial/modern and just the overall has a coolness about it. The guys working here were playing some old Grimes and signing along to it with the high notes and all. Ace.
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2019-06-22,5.0,"I got probably the most expensive latte I've ever bought (came out to $6 with milk substitute) - but it was also hands down the most comforting, delicious latte I've ever had. And I've had a _lot_ of lattes!!

It's a small spot between two streets with limited seating, so it seems like more of a grab-and-go establishment. Has nice big windows and seating for people-watching. Service is also pretty fast."
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2018-07-05,5.0,Stopped for a visit after reading the review about the Chai latte! Had the cappuccino and an iced Chai. Both were outstanding! Chai was spicy and did not taste artificial like many do. Staff very friendly and efficient!  Looking forward to coming back!
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2016-12-30,4.0,"Two entrances...one to the right, one to the left. Four metal chairs...two to the right, two to the left. Two long tables...one to the right, one to the left. Two simple wall menus...one to the right, one to the left. Symmetrical it is. This space is simple and it has a mix of modern and alley vibe with a slight hint of old fashion. Food wise, I ordered the Truffle Cookie and the Almond Matcha Latte. The Truffle Cookie was sweet and decent in size. The Almond Matcha Latte was smooth and had more of an almond flavor rather than the matcha flavor. Total price? About $8ish for a 12oz latte and a cookie...a bit expensive for something low key.

This place is conveniently located by the 6 train near my morning commute so I might come back again to try their caffeinated drinks another time. 

Credit cards are accepted."
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2018-04-24,4.0,"Great coffee inside a very small space! The coffee shop has two entrances on each side of this odd sliver shaped building. I really liked the branding and logo, but the coffee really kicked my ass! Strong as hell and tasted great. So happy to have found so many great coffee alternatives to Starbucks. Only downside was that there weren't as many drink options as I would have liked. I'm also not sure if they roast their own beans or not. I asked and I didn't exactly get a straight answer. The coffee was good either way."
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2017-08-04,4.0,"My tank needs a daily intake of caffeine, so fill 'er up! There aren't many better places to fuel up than at Gasoline Alley Coffee. Put high quality octane into your system and not that brown sludge you get at national chains. This location has a rustic feel, almost as if it were a petrol station in its previous life."
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2017-05-16,5.0,"Cutest little hipster coffee shop! My friend ordered a latte (mainly for the latte art lol). But it turned out to be delicious and creamy. I myself ordered an americano, where I just added a touch of half and half. The first coffee I had in a long time that wasn't so acidic and burnt tasting (I'm lookin at you Starbucks). Very bold yet smooth flavor! I could sip on the coffee all day if the caffeine didn't drive me nuts.

The inside is super clean and inviting, open space concept. Next time I'm in NYC I would definitely hit this place up again! Totally recommend if you're on the lookout for some deliciously smooth coffee"
69,gasoline-alley-coffee-new-york,2016-02-06,5.0,"Absolutely delicious almond milk latte!!! One of the best I've had!! Awesome espresso and super smooth latte. I will definitely come back despite it being very pricey. $4 for a small 8oz latte and extra $1 for almond milk. A treat!! Cute latte art too

Small store and no seating. Just a counter so grab your drink / pastry to go"
